<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>, on the balance of arguments presented plus a quick sanity check which finds that (a) the article is unreferenced; (b) there are only 26 unique Google hits for "Copperfield Death Saw"; (c) Copperfield's own site does not figure in that list, so that doesn't appear to be what he calls it.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am surprised at (but respect) the number of keep opinions. Just to clarify, I'm not arguing that the articles should be deleted for all time, only that (1) there is literally nothing in the articles right now that is sourced; (2) there is <i>almost nothing</i> in the articles that is useful for the encyclopedia. Explaining <i>how</i> to calculate a Four Pillars astrology analysis is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">not what Wikipedia is about</a>, IMHO.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The condition of being unsourced, much less unsourced with inline citations, is not a ground for deletion. Were this so, nine tenths of the text we now have would be deleted. Nor is the fact that the existing text is incomplete, confusing, or wrong grounds for deletion. My typical test asks two questions: is the topic itself a worthy one? and if so, will the text now there be helpful to writing an adequate article on the topic? I think these articles easily pass the first test, and the text currently at the pages, while not very good so far, is not so useless that we should conceal it from non-admin editors or readers, or require that an improved article start entirely from scratch. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:09, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article, which is unreferenced at present and reads like an ad, was originally speedied under A7/G11. The magazine was launched "this fall", so I question it's notability.

<li>Reads like an ad? It reads like a summation of what the magazine is: a 100,000 circulation magazine by a notable publishing company covered in Reuters and the New York Times. Notability, in this case, is purely subjective and I respect your questioning but it cannot be definitive. What, by the way, is your definition of reads like an ad? I am not attempting to coax someone to read this magazine. I am just providing circulation and subject matter information for this particular magazine to anyone who is of interest in the magazine. It is true there is no sourcing concerning the press coverage and the notability of the magazine, but if that is the problem the article should not have been deleted, just asked to be sourced more thoroughly.

<li><b>Delete</b> Article comes across like corporate spam/PR copy. Article creator's apparent relationship with publication creates a conflict of interest. Encyclopedic notability hasn't been established. All we have are marketing claims made by the launch of a trade magazine.

<li>A difficult one. Doesn't appear to be widely known to the public at large, and I couldn't find a review of his book in a widely-read publication. Further, I don't think his composing/film work hits notability on its own. However, when googled his name pops up all over the Randian world, so he's clearly important in that niche, and his book appears to be reviewed and regarded as consequential there. So I'm inclined to say <b>Keep</b>. I can't imagine most people will ever want to read this article, but the same is true for other biographies of niche experts. We're aiming to be encyclopedic, and we're not paper. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I could see the argument for inclusion, but a minor figure in a niche arena does not really seem to me to be encyclopedic.

<dd>Sorry, should have made myself clearer. I'm not an expert in <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism.html" title="Objectivism">Objectivism</a>, though of course I've heard of it, but it seems to me as an outsider that within that realm Jeff Britting is well-known as an archivist and biographer. Certainly, when you google him and look at the way other objectivists discuss his work it seems that he is taken seriously, and his contributions are valued. That is, though he works in a niche area, within that area he appears to be more than a minor figure, and for that reason I believe we should keep this article. What we really need, of course, is input from a couple of objectivists, but failing that I'll stick with my original assessment. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 13:20, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with people who say that his role as associate producer of a movie is not notable, by the way. It seems to me that his notability arises from his work in the field of Rand-studies, not his dalliance with Hollywood. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 13:20, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, the book is interesting, being a book of photos... i could not find sales numbers on it, and it does not seem to be cited anywhere, but I ouldn't expect that. I'm not sure that the book lends notability as much as popularity for those people that want pictures of Rand. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 13:39, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I apologize if I was not clear, but I did not intend to imply that the site should be kept solely on the basis of being a non-English site.

Therefore, in my opinion, subjects like these should be held to a slightly lower standard considering the fact that any references that may exist are inaccessible to most of us.

It's a shame we're allowing every stupid character and talisman from the <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse.html" title="Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a> on here, but when we come upon a website with tens of thousands of users that carries information from al-Qaeda representatives, it's considered non-notable for the encyclopedia.

<ul>
<li>That <i>Asia Times</i> contains 1 sentence's worth of information (the meaning of the web site's name), too. You haven't made a case that this web site actually <i>is</i> "notable newsworthy", because you haven't cited a single news article that is <i>about the web site</i> (rather than one that merely mentions it in passing in 1 sentence and is actually about <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Quaeda_2f90.html" title="Al-Quaeda">Al-Quaeda</a> or some other group).
<p>As for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>: That has been in use for a long time now. "It's only a guideline." cuts no mustard at all. You are making a bad argument that has been made many times before, and that has been rebutted many times over long since. For one thing, not having an entire article on something is not the same as not including information about it. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Dealing_with_non-notable_topics" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability#Dealing_with_non-notable_topics</a>. As I said, the aforementioned one sentence of verifiable information (now one-and-a-half, with the addition of <i>Asia Times</i>) can be easily included in <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Quaeda_2f90.html" title="Al-Quaeda">Al-Quaeda</a>, a very natural home for it.

<li><b>Delete</b> I would like to see this web site reviewed exclusively by a mainstream media outlet.

<li><b>Comment</b> Has anyone considered what the word Montada actually means? If it does in fact mean <i>forum</i>, try putting the word forum into english google and see how many hits you get!

<li>True, but searching <i>Montada</i> will not give you results similar to what you might get from <i>forum</i>. It <i>would</i> give you similar results if you search using the Arabic word for <i>forum</i>, منتدى. Try searching فورام, which is a transliteration of forum in Arabic. As for a media review, I'm afraid it is almost impossible to ever find one, since Arabic websites aren't really well featured. I'm sure it has been featured on Arabic media, but not much of Arabic media is published online. ← <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnas_Salloum_27fd.html" title="User:Anas Salloum"><font color="DimGray"><i><b>A</b></i><small>NAS</small></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/a/User_talk%7EAnas_Salloum_76de.html" title="User talk:Anas Salloum"><font size="-3"><font color="DodgerBlue">Talk?</font></font></a></sup> <small>12:39, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I tried montada.com (not just montada) on English and still got 3,000,000 hits; it got 300,000 on Arabic (as many appear to be from another language). Still, that's an obscene amount of hits for an average forum, and probably the most prominent Arabic forum that exists. I find it frustrating that forum surely has outside media mention, but we can't access it because it's in Arabic. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 14:29, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To call this systemic bias is insulting to the people who participated. Anas has gone through great lengths to improve the article. Many of the votes were previous to this rework. I feel that if the same people were to view the improved article, that many votes would change. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaydjenkins_d8a3.html" title="User:Jaydjenkins">jaydj</a> 05:26, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Whilst the article is certainly informative, it seems to me that notability has not been established. Simply being a popular forum is not, it seems to me, enough to establish notability: there are plenty of forums. It seems to me that notability, for a forum, would arise if the forum were doing something different from other forums. This is why I don't think it is enough to note that Al Qaeda has posted messages on this forum: Al Qaeda need to post messages somewhere, so this could be just a random choice. We need to know what this forum is _doing_ that makes it different and special: notability arises from actions taken, not things that "might have happened anyway". So, I'm suggesting we <b>Delete</b> this article. I should stress that this is not, so far as I can introspect, bias: I've applied the same criterion in plenty of other AfD discussions, including for other forums ( though I haven't been quite so explicit in my reasoning ), and imagine that I will do so again in future forum AfD discussions. Obviously, if my concern is met, I'll change my opinion. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:25, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Very reasonable. I am not a frequent visitor of the forum, but I do drop by every once in a while. This forum is different; apart from the popularity and Al-Qaeda massages, this forum has had interviews with celebrities, particularly Saudi football players (2 actually, one of them was <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasser_Al-Qahtani_c782.html" title="Yasser Al-Qahtani">Yasser Al-Qahtani</a>. I'm not sure though, as I can't recall well) and with a few game designers. Also, this forum has some famous and notable members, mainly journalists and writers. Of course, I can't find any sources to back my claim.&#160;:) ← <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnas_Salloum_27fd.html" title="User:Anas Salloum"><font color="DimGray"><i><b>A</b></i><small>NAS</small></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/a/User_talk%7EAnas_Salloum_76de.html" title="User talk:Anas Salloum"><font size="-3"><font color="DodgerBlue">Talk?</font></font></a></sup> <small>19:34, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li>Whoa. <b>Keep</b>, possibly rename.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Rename</b> - I wouldn't merge to Gay Stereotyping as that article notes it is about "common misperceptions about homosexuals".

A redirect or merge to <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_stereotyping.html" title="Gay stereotyping">Gay stereotyping</a> should be discouraged: as I understand it, stereotyping is about misperception and generalisation: this article, and the supporting research, do not seem to imply that this speech pattern is present in all gay men, or only in gay men, only that its presence is to some extent correlated with sexuality.

<p>non notable Pakistani corporation; about $350 million in sales, they make fertilizer and sell or resell various agriculture-related products.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The only part of WP:CORP that the company might meet would be the 2nd provision, "The company or corporation is listed on ranking indices of important companies produced by well-known and independent publications." The company <i>is</i> listed by Forbes Asia as one of "200 Promising Firms Under $1 Billion" or something like that, but I would argue that that isn't a list of <i>important</i> firms, but instead of promising ones. And I suspect they have a new list of firms every year; making it one year isn't that notable. Other than that, I can't see much notability. $350 million in sales isn't that big, even for Asia. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 03:14, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Well, the article doesn't include two press accounts, and I haven't seen any cited here, with the possible exception of the "The News" link below (although that is brief and may well be based on a press release.) I assumed that it didn't meet #3, since nothing of the sort was cited in the article, but to my chagrin it appears that it is in fact part of the Karachi Stock Exchange 100, and in fact in the top 25% or so by capitalization; given that, I think I will have to <b>withdraw this nomination</b>. I wish that had been in the article to begin with, as it took a bit of digging to find out. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 04:52, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This was listed on DRV, where the lister was self-admittely confused about the process regarding renomination of kept articles. The debate, which was withdrawn by the applicant, can be viewed here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_December_13&amp;oldid=94222037#Darcy_Burner" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_December_13&amp;oldid=94222037#Darcy_Burner" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> The original AfD can be viewed <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Darcy_Burner_6e8f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Darcy Burner">here (closed as no concensus)</a>, that took place about five months ago.</p>
The reason for listing was:
<blockquote>
<p><i>Delete or Merge with article on Election -- WP:BIO. Proponents for keeping the article during the July discussion centered on her viability as a candidate in the November 2006 election. As the election is over and she has lost, her notability seems to have declined. AndrewSaint 06:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
</blockquote>
The concensus from DRV was to relist at AfD, so here it is.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Burner got substantial media coverage both nationally and internationally, and on that basis clearly meets the inclusion criteria under WP:BIO.

<li>The key words are "blatant" and "may". Taking an existing article about a figure, replacing the name with something else, and then posting it as a new name under that new name is a blatant hoax.

But something that is not self-evidently a hoax, but that requires some amount of actual checking to determine that it is a hoax, is not a <i>blatant</i> hoax.

<p>This is problematic on two counts. First: it is assumed that there is a definition for the word "dictator", which in today's usage signifies an autocratic, tyrannical ruler - an inherently subjective definition. (Yes, one could re-name the ever-popular <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dictators_ef57.html" title="List of Dictators">List of Dictators</a> to List of people called Dictators or something, but time would be better spent at calling those rulers by their nominal title and instead discussing the political system in depth.)</p>
<p>Second: the fact that an autocrat might choose to pass on the anoint a family membe his successor is extremely trivial. Running a hgovernment racket is profitable and of course one chooses to keep the profits in the family.</p>

<dd>Since you asked: what is violated is the prohibition on original research because it isn't at all clear what a "dictator" is or who qualifies as a one. Someone below mentioned that calling <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Kuan_Yew_c963.html" title="Lee Kuan Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a> a dictator might raise eyebrows, and if <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> qualifies depends strongly on who you ask. Thanks for listening. Oh, another thing: you said you are not sure what the issue is, yet vote on it anyway.

<dd>What I meant when I mentioned Lee was that he was the kind of person whose inclusion or non-inclusion would prove controversial without an accepted definition of what a "dictator" actually is. That said, there <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">is such a thing</a> (and I'm pretty sure the Wiktionary entry is good, too), so that needn't be an issue. As with a great many other articles on controversial topics, however, this one would have to be watched carefully to make certain that someone with an axe to grind didn't argue that someone who <i>wasn't</i> accepted as a dictator should be included on the list. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:54, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, the article I quote does two things. Firstly, it sets out something approaching a definition of the term. Secondly, it explains that in popular usage, the term is thrown around a bit more liberally. The fact that a given term is misunderstood by the man in the street doesn't mean that it doesn't have a valid definition - there's no end of political and scientific terms which would have no definitions if this were the case. Our task, assuming this article is kept, is to make the definition abundantly clear (political scientists love definitions, so it shouldn't be hard) and then to make certain that the only people who turn up on the list are covered by the definition. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:02, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Are we talking about the same article at all? Could you point out where either <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">dictator</a> or <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictatorship.html" title="Dictatorship">dictatorship</a> gives a definition that goes beyond "epithet for Heads of State with autocratic tendencies that we happen to despise"? <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 16:02, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"In modern usage, the term "dictator" is generally used to describe a leader who holds an extraordinary amount of personal power, especially the power to make laws without effective restraint by a legislative assembly." It's not a great definition, no, but it is a different one from the definition in the next paragraph which begins "in popular usage". As I said above, what we have is something vaguely approaching a definition of the term. Our task is to take what's there and (with the usual reference to reliable sources) establish a solid working definition. Once we have one, it's a simple case of comparing those on the list with the definition. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:16, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Likewise, the article on "dictatorship" makes the following attempt: "dictatorship refers to an autocratic form of absolute rule by leadership unrestricted by law, constitutions, or other social and political factors within the state." Again, not an award-winning piece of prose, but a start. Both definitions are significantly less subjective than the words you've put into their mouths. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:19, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>: There are no references to anything scholarly. This is a partisan political term at this point, and it even has invalid coinages in it ("personalistic?"). A Republic has no dictatorships, and dicatatorships do not abide by a republican model. This is the equivalent of saying "Anarchist beaurocracy." There is no scholarly standing. There <i>is</i>, however, partisan political standing. The first usage goes to references to the Kennedy's, and the right wing tossed it about in the US, then the left with the Bushes, and now the right with the Clintons.

<li>If there was no political phenomenon, mainstream media wouldn't be making widespread, un-coerced use of the term, but they are. And they are referring, in the most part, to the same political figures listed in the article. The second part of your comment looks like an attack on somebody, so I'll ignore it. — <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharlotteWebb_8dbe.html" title="User talk:CharlotteWebb">CharlotteWebb</a> 13:55, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It was no attack on anyone. You said that the references weren't to the U.S. fringe partisans, and I said that was proof of how irrelevant they are to the real press. Don't go looking for insults where none are intended. The fact that all of your references are to the Duvaliers is a demonstration of the echo effect of newspapers. When an organization like the AP uses a colorful term, that term will be picked up by other accounts. The same is true of the New York Times. It is not surprising that an account of Baby Doc is going to have the same usage of a common adjective with a common noun. It does not point to a phenomenon. The phenomenon here is that Baby Doc took over. There was no "republic" there. It was just plain old dictatorship. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:05, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep:</b> I believe the following articles Seven Network (Logos), Nine Network (Logos) and Network TEN (Logos), are usefull, as they remove the numerous logo galleries that previously cluttered their main articles of <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Network_cc4b.html" title="Seven Network">Seven Network</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Network_03d3.html" title="Nine Network">Nine Network</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_TEN_d0e0.html" title="Network TEN">Network TEN</a>. These articles are to reduce the clutter caused by logos from Pre-Network years on the networks page. If wanted, I could change the article title to, for example, History of Seven Network Logos, to encourage other wikipedians to add a description of the history of these logos.

<li><b>Keep</b> per What's New, although if Stickeylabel has merged the article back into the Seven Network page, then there's no need to keep this one as well (except that it takes up quite a large amount of room and will make the article too big.) <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 03:21, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> To reduce the large amount of room that the Pre-Network logos took up, I have moved those logos into their station pages. For example old Seven Melbourne logos are at the <a href="../../../h/s/v/HSV-7_390c.html" title="HSV-7">HSV-7</a> article. This removes the non-network logos from the network page, and adds them to their rightful location. Also, to ensure quick access to the pre-network logos, I have added links to their articles below the normal network logos. I hope this resolves the issue.

<li><b>keep</b> this is not indiscriminate information it is all perfectly relevant to the show. Aside from that, countless other wikipedia pages have trivia sections that are accepted. This trivia section does not match any of the examples given on the indiscriminate collection of information section of the WP:NOT page. It is not an FAQ, it is not a travel guide, it is not a memorial, it is not an instruction manual, it is not an internet guide, it is not a textbook or annotated text, and it is not a plot summary. Unless Someguy0830 can get an 8th section added to that rule stating that it is not a source of relevant trivia, it's a moot point to even reference. The definition of indiscriminate is "failing to make or recognize distinctions" or "not marked by fine distinctions," anybody reading this trivia can plainly see that the vast majority of this trivia either deals with references to real life heavy metal bands or recurring issues in the show. It is blatantly incisive. The only reason I would opt for deletion of this page is if it were integrated back into the main metalocalypse article. Countless other tv shows have trivia sections in their articles, such as, <a href="../../../m/i/a/CSI%7E_Miami_c5c2.html" title="CSI: Miami">CSI: Miami</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sopranos_69e1.html" title="The Sopranos">The Sopranos</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a>, <a href="../../../n/y/p/NYPD_Blue_50c4.html" title="NYPD Blue">NYPD Blue</a>, the list goes on and on.

<li>What the hell is the above supposed to mean?

<li><b>Merge</b> into the Episodes list.

Theres another magazine article around but its older and I think it focuses more on the game engine technology than the game itself (UK game dev zine maybe, can't remember...). The Google results do include other notable sources but for each its little more than a paragraph, guess that doesn't help. I'll keep looking.

<li>Funny. Not if I edit the article and repost it on the grounds it was wrongfully deleted in the first place. The article is a mess, I'll give you that, but with the Atomic article as a primary source and a couple dozen notable minor sources (Google results, some German) the WP:N/WP:V concerns should be satisfied. "Game in development" is not a valid cause for AFD nomination, thats why the future game tag exists. The WP:NOT "a crystal ball" claim isn't valid, it doesn't need independent sources to be satisfied, any evidence the claims are valid will suffice - like the videos, screen shots, and the combat prototype (a fully functional game by itself). The only logical result can be keep for cleanup. I'm changing my stance to speedy keep and starting on the article cleanup. You're welcome to continue whining or move on with your AFD crusade, I'm just starting to enjoy myself. --<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaBurn_a592.html" title="User:MegaBurn">MegaBurn</a> 18:36, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Atomic magazine could certainly be usable in the future but to me doesn't warrant an article about something so early in development, particularly when sources will appear when the game is actually completed.

<dd>Granted, but that can easily be solved by a redirect. There are tons of these "tourist-fooling" animals, including the close relative to this, the "<a href="../../../f/u/r/Fur-bearing_trout.html" title="Fur-bearing trout">fur-bearing trout</a>". However, given that I can't turn up pages on Google even about the HOAX, it seems destined for deletion as unverifyable rather then redirectable. 68.39.174.238 07:25, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The list is good. At finnish wikipedia even the leading moderator has contributed to it. The list can be limited to non-living persons if it feels offensive.

<li><b>Comment</b>, maybe our problem here is the use of the word BASTARD, which in our language use is an insult, in older times it just meant people born out of wedlock -- but I fail to see how that makes a person notable. In the case of August the Strong of Saxony we would have to include about 180, and their claim to fame would be depleting Saxony's treasure to the point of bankruptcy by alimony claims <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 15:13, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Requires subjective judgement on 'famous', many entries are bound to be contested or hard to prove, and an article with that title may as well just put up a neon sign reading "Hey vandals!

The category isn't "meaningless" the description is tight and accurate if changed to "out of wedlock births". The word "famous" is being used here to mean they already have an Wikipedia entry and are "notable" by Wikipedia standards. If an article is unsourced, it just means someone has to add sources, and in this case its just a matter of taking the source from the individual articles. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 18:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Illegitimacy was an important legal status in many countries (including Russia); the illegitimate couldn't marry, own property, or even work in some professions. Having such a list, especially for people born before ca. 1918, would make it easier for a student looking at the changing status of the illegitimate. I think that at least with respect to historical individuals it's quite encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 21:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I can see how this article is similar to other similar classifications, but I don't believe it is particularly useful. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 21:50, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very Weak Keep</b>. I think the list could be useful and interesting. It's got to be absolutely perfectly sourced, though...calling someone illegitimate could be considered slander, expecially if it's not true. Probably more trouble than anyone would want to put into it. Plus, as said by many others, the name really needs to be changed. <a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 22:28, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think this is liftcruft, or random, non enyclopedic information. I also think this is un-manageable over time, like <b>famous people with black hair</b>, since it will include too many over time - driven by whether the information is referenced, not true. But if we do keep, <b>bastard</b> seems like the right word.

<ul>
<li>But article titles also should be as unambiguous as possible, and fact of the matter is that <i>bastard</i> is an ambiguous term. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Aecis_0e71.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis">Dancing</a> to electro-pop <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">like a robot</a> from 1984.</sup> 00:09, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but probably move.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This is per UsaSatsui's argument above. Hiwever, Agent 86 also makes a good case for deletion too. The title of the article made me think it was about a list of famous <i>obnoxious</i> people (not 'bastard' in the sense <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimate.html" title="Illegitimate">illegitimate</a>) but it is misleading. --<a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunStar_Net_0f71.html" title="User:SunStar Net">SunStar Net</a><sup><a href="../../../s/u/n/User_talk%7ESunStar_Net_e180.html" title="User talk:SunStar Net">talk</a></sup> 23:59, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I can see no encyclopaedic merit in this article.

<li><b>keep</b> and <b>change name</b> This is a list containing people famous otherwise and generally know for being born out of wedlock. It;s not intended as insult. And because of that the name must be changed, because the literal meaning of the term is intended here, and such is decidedly not the meaning that most people would think of first. It wasnt mine until I read the comments here &amp; looked at the content of the page.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 02:16, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This page serves no obvious people, and with the changes in western morality in recent decades is likely to become pointless. Such a list is begging to be troll-bait. A category is a possible way foward.

<li><b>Keep, but fix the article.</b> This is not a resume; were it a resume, it would include vital information such as where to contact the individual, statistics regarding the individual (body type, voice, etc.). In addition, Andrew Jesse Brown is a notable actor in the NYC area, having recently performed in several off-off-off Broadway productions. I strongly disagree with Gladlyplaid's movement to remove the Andrew Jesse Brown article. HammerTime32905 13:50, 14 December 2006 (UTC)Stop.

<li>This may be because there are no sources available for this particular subject. All sources are pamphlets and/or flyers, and therefore unverifiable.

<p>the general style of religious converts lists has always been "List of converts to X", because their conversion to X is what has been notable. a "List of people who left Islam" or "List of ex-A" is unnecessary and irrelevant because <b>a)</b> it falsely assumes ex-Y became so because of Y, and not because of their conviction in something else (i.e. religion X); <b>b)</b> it consists of unnecessary duplication, by "leaving Y" they have automatically become a "convert to X"'; <s><b>c)</b> there is no precedence for this as we do not have a "List of people who left Christianity", "List of people who left Hinduism", "List of people who left Athiesm", nor do we need it.</s> <b>d)</b> the focus is inappropriately on negation, the title and entire purpose of such a list is implicitly loaded with a negative connotation against religion Y, and under the false premise discussed in point a) serves as a vehicle for propaganda/advocacy.</p>

<dd>I find your arguments a little too strident and out of proportion to what you're responding to. The user was concerned for people's safety, but concerns with privacy or safety occur on many kinds of AfD debates not just this one. In addition I fear your statements indicate this list has a political purpose and if that's the case I will switch from weak to strong delete. Wikipedia lists are not the proper place to make "stands against terrorism" or push political agendas, even when they are agendas I agree with more or less. Perhaps these lists do provide valuable names when one is studying a valid cultural issue, but reasons like "the conversion lists stayed, so we need religion bashing lists for balance" or "we can't give in to terrorists/religious-zealots" strike me as invalid and prejudicial.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>Dont use my statements to change your nomination. Make your own judgement. The primary purpose of these lists is to classify information in another way. The lists are not redundant. I could claim that these lists should be kept because they help save the lives of African elephants, but if you disliked elephants and said these lists should be deleted - well that would be a wrong reason for you to choose to delete the lists. The primary purpose as I said is: these lists are not redundant and there are no lists on the internet like these. If you say Apostasy lists have a negative agenda, then Conversion lists have a positive agenda, do they not? The point is to look at these lists objevtively. Are they useful information? Yes. Are they redundant in any way? No.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 20:47, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Lists are just ways of categorizing people. If they converted from one religion to another, they left the first and converted to the second. IMO, it's non-neutral to prefer only the "positive," lists of what they joined, rather than the "negative," lists of what they left, as one assumes someone left a religion for a negative reason, rather than joined another for a positive reason. Only a weak keep because it's rather a boring category, still, it is just a list. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 16:44, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Its not redundant. People from different faiths join a certain faith. People from one faith can join many faiths. This is not being redundant. If you have one list, you should have the other one as well. When you have Lists of people who CONVERTED to Islam, WHAT is wrong with having List of people who LEFT Islam? Can you tell me? If you're saying they're redudant, tell me why the first should not be deleted and the second kept. How are these lists are redundant? Do you see Ibn Warraq in "List of people who converted to Islam"? Where should he be included? List of Athiests? My point is: <b>If CONVERSION is a serious enough issue that a list must be made for it, why is not APOSTASY?</b> Can you or anyone suggesting a <i>Delete</i> tell me that?

<dd><b>But there is a problem in the definition the article may be using</b>. People who convert to another religion have obviously left their former one. People who become irreligious are less obvious. I think for such individual it would be necessary to have a source where they specifically say: I am no longer an X. (&amp; I believe there are some religions which consider you in their membership none the less) . In particular, there is the problem with people originally of religion X, where someone considered an authority says: So and so is no longer a X. Unless so and so aggrees and says so, how can we judge the validity of this? We could have another category for persons ejected from whatever--not just a religion--but that would be a particularly poor idea for something spiritual. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 02:27, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thats where references come in to prove how they left the religion. Also its probably obvious that if they're strongly critical of the religion, they have left it. For those who dont say it clearly, they are included in the Secular category for example Wafa Sultan (she's given conflicting statements about her being a Muslim, although is strongly critical and explicitly secular in her own words). People who are ejected would be a small quantity in number, these are generally few. Also people who are ejected also usually have left the religion already on their own will so they can still be included here. There could be a separate mention in this article for people who were also 'ejected'.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 14:27, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> While I recognise the possible repetition of information in these articles and agree with earlier comments that the title "List of people who left Islam" contains a subtle prejudice, I think the concept of these lists is useful. Consider someone doing research on, for example, Richard Dawkins book "The God Delusion". Such a person might wish to research people that became Atheists versus those that left Atheism for Agnosticism or even a full religion. Without a "list of ex-Athesits" such a researcher then has to carry out the research that has already gone into the production of this page and we're now discussing should be deleted. Ergo, pages of this type are in and of themselves useful. I think the title of this particular "Islam page" should be changed to move it in line with the other articles and it should be a <b>strong keep</b> -- as should its compatriots. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoricus_edb3.html" title="User:Coricus">Coricus</a> 04:41, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep and rename</b>. This article AfD is now being used to justify deleting all other similar purposed <i>ex-</i> articles. When people change their philosophical worldview and <i>leave</i> one particular religious belief then they don't always move straight into another but may contemplate for a while pending the establishment of their new identity. It may be an instantaneous conversion or a slow understanding of where they want to be next. Thus they may reside on one list and not be on another as a convert for many years, if at all as <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> applies and they have to have said in their own words what they are doing.

<dd>Muslims are more vocal, but I think "ex" lists are inherently focussed on the negative and can annoy any group being named. When I created <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ex-atheists.html" title="List of ex-atheists">List of ex-atheists</a> I did get an atheist who expressed annoyance. Several atheist sites that discuss atheists who convert to a theistic or deistic system go through efforts to say that the person is lying about ever being an atheist or when that fails they emphasize that the person in question had an "immature" or false atheism. Although in fairness I did come close to a point violation in creating it as most of the ex-lists struck me as religion bashing. (Back then they weren't so much about saying what a person later joined, the focus was almost solely on leaving a religion) Anyway in principle I think <a href="../../../f/o/r/Former_Latter-day_Saints_3c42.html" title="Former Latter-day Saints">Former Latter-day Saints</a> would also irritate LDSers, etc. Conversion lists I think are only irritating if you find the religion in question repellent. If you don't care then people converting or leaving it is likely disinteresting. Otherwise conversion lists are of interesting as conversions have effected entire nations. Leaving is only that significant when the person converts to something. (If Queen Christina of Sweden quit going to Lutheran services, but didn't go anywhere else, I doubt it would've been as significant)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>Delete</b> Not really notable and precedent has been set since the last afd, the tributes to Eddie Guerrero page was removed, various other "raw specials" like homecoming and such have been deleted, and tribute to the troops will be deleted soon. And this creates a non-npov slant, anything about the page that needs to be said can be put on Owen's main page. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 10:08, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I still maintain my original argument that it was the first notable in-ring death in pro-wrestling (or at least for WWE), and the first wrestler to have been tributed from their passing while an active member of the WWE roster, and as such it should be kept. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelvSYC_688e.html" title="User:KelvSYC">kelvSYC</a> 17:08, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Merge and Delete</b> I have had a good look at the page and at Owen Hart's page. I think this can be scaled down and easily fitted into his profile/article.

<p><b>Keep</b> I really could care less about this individual school, but I think all high schools are notable enough to be listed on wikipedia. Many high schools are larger than universities, and all universities (at least all of them I have ever searched for) are considered notable enough. (and if you only consider <i>some</i> high schools notable enough, then what are the criteria for a high school being notable enough? I would think being the only one in a city, as this one is, would qualify as much as a library or any of the other types of things listed here.) If this high school is not notable enough, then there are thousands of high school wikipedia entries out there that need to be deleted too, since it wouldn't be fair to single out one high school over the others.

<dd><b>Delete</b> per nom; I'm quite comfy with weeding out all those thousands of school entries, thanks.

<dd>Depends on what your definition of "many" is, I suppose.

<dd>As a side note, I have fleshed out the article a bit more, and intend to do so even more in the coming weeks/months, if that is why the original poster was concerned. However, you have to start with a stub to be able to work up to a bigger article as you find more information sometimes. (ok, I suppose you don't <i>have</i> to, but it is easier for me to do it that way sometimes.) The objection raised, however, was that the article itself is not notable, no matter how much information is there, which my original objection above deals with.

<dd>On the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> page cited by <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Riley_1176.html" title="User:Adam Riley">Adam Riley</a> above, it makes clear that high schools (or, schools in general) are considered notable if "The school is locally distinctive in any two of the areas listed under criterion #2, or in any other areas for which it has received local press or other coverage". It can clearly be shown that most high schools in general (and this one in particular) are either locally distinctive or have received local press coverage in one of the following areas (from point #2):"* Academics * Age * Alumni * Architecture * Awards * Events that have occurred at the school * Extracurricular activities, including sports"</dd>
<dd>Most notably (for this high school) there has been a lot of local press coverage for the sports teams, there are lots of events (sports, musical, and otherwise) that occur at the school, there has been local press coverage having to do with academics, and since the school is the only one in the city, approximately 90% of the people who live or work in the city are graduates, so by default (almost) any local story on a member of the community is also a story on an Alumni. Thus, at the very least 4 out of the 7 stated areas are relevant, and the 3 remaining ones could possibly be included as well, when only 2 (by the wording of #3 quoted above) are needed. Remember, it only needs to be shown to be "locally distinctive" in the case of a school.

<dl>
<dd>(1) WP:SCHOOL doesn't enjoy consensus approval (and I for one don't approve of it). (2) The press coverage you refer to will in most cases be trivial with respect to the school. Coverage of an alumnus, a football game, a school play, etc. can't help us write an encyclopedia article about the school. You said above that you intend to expand the article in the coming weeks and months; I'm all for that, but there's no indication that it's even possible to do that. The material that's in the article right now is either not encyclopedic (e.g. the mission statement), or doesn't come from external sources that show notability. Do you know of any non-trivial external sources that we could use to write a good verifiable article about this school? That's what <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> means at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 20:14, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>(1) <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> may not enjoy approval by everyone, but it is nonetheless the standard by which the notability of schools is judged. If you have a problem with it, then I would urge you to lobby to have it changed or removed, but until then it deserves at least partial consideration. (2) The press coverage is coverage by local media of the school. If you consider this trivial, then I would estimate 90% or more of all the content on university and high school pages is not notable, because most of the information is only verifiable via local media. Also, how can a building such as a library or a train station or anything else like that which is used less and recieves less press coverage be more of a subject of an article than a school? In short, if this high school page is not notable enough to be on wikipedia, then the thousands of other high school pages which are not any more notable need to be deleted as well, and there needs to be a mass campaign to get rid of all of them.(<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardsplayer4life_41e9.html" title="User:Cardsplayer4life">Cardsplayer4life</a> 20:46, 14 December 2006 (UTC))

<dd>No, it is not "the standard", it is a standard some people use. Other people use <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>, or their own judgment, or just go with (their interpretation of) wikipedia policies. And I wouldn't mind to get rid of most of the school, library, fire station, train station, ... articles, since most of them have the same problems: only (very) local notability. Wikipedia should decide (perhaps urgently) if it wants to include everything with only local notability (local sports people, local festivities, local schools, and local shops for local people), or if it wants to restrict itself to those things with at least regional or preferable national notability and coverage. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 21:22, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough. I would say according to <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> it still passes, but that is not really the overarching point. The overarching point is that there is sufficient disagreement about whether these types of articles (those showing local or regional notability) should be allowed, and until that is decided and there are sufficient guidelines one way or the other, then these types of articles should not be removed.

<dd>Pan Dan, in <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> says that "A topic can fail to satisfy the criteria because, though it may be found in reliable, non-directory sources, it is mentioned trivially rather than being a main subject of the published works. ...One common recommendation across all notability guidelines is not to nominate articles on such subjects for deletion but to rename, refactor, or merge them into articles with broader scopes...." I don't see why, if the subject ends up failing to meet notability, we shouldn't instead of deleting, merge it into, for example, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batesville%2C_Arkansas_193b.html" title="Batesville, Arkansas">Batesville, Arkansas</a>. <b><a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchi_5602.html" title="User:Schi">schi</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchi_51f0.html" title="User talk:Schi"><font color="orange">talk</font></a></sup> 18:42, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In general a merge can be a good idea. In this case, I'm not sure there's any material that's appropriate to merge. The town article already mentions this high school and already mentions that it's the only one in town. The mission statement and athletics sections are verified only at the school's website and other outlets associated with the school itself -- and I think that external sources have to take note of any information before we consider it notable enough for inclusion anywhere on Wikipedia. That leaves us with the school song, mascot, school colors, and administration, which to varying degrees are somewhat likely to be verifiable in external sources. If someone wants to merge this info into the town article, I guess that's OK by me, except that it would sort of knock the town article off balance, because the school song, etc., seems pretty trivial compared to the rest of the information in the town article. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:28, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(Adding to comment) I note the school article says "Batesville High School has a long history of success in many different sports." If it's true with Batesville, as with many towns, that high school athletics are a big part of the town's cultural life, and someone can find external sources, e.g. the local paper, that discuss the history of this school's athletic exploits, I think it would be entirely appropriate to augment the town article with a section on sports at the high school. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:36, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nah, this vote is relevant. One of the criteria is well-known sports teams (i'm paraphrasing), and I would think that a high school state title is enough to warrant an article.

<li>The truth is, very little. As the three points above outline, and my own point, detail why the article should not be kept. There is a certain level of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> required for inclusion on Wikipedia. For music-related entries, see <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> -- Mr Brewster seems to not meet any of those requirements. Perhaps he may at some point, but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CBALL" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> either. If it is deleted and Mr. Brewster qualifies in the future, the page can be recreated. Neither is it necessary to create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nevski&amp;oldid=65606434" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nevski&amp;oldid=65606434" rel="nofollow">substub-level articles</a> on every alias of every single hip-hop artist.

<li>There are now at least three links in this discussion to the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">wikipedia page that outlines music-related notability requirements</a>. The article must *at least* meet one of those (the more the better), must be verifiable (citations are nice). A lot of people seem to think that this article is self-promotion.

The <a href="../../../z/a/d/Zad_al-Ma%27ad_4af1.html" title="Zad al-Ma'ad">Zad al-Ma'ad</a> was written by <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_al-Qayyim_0901.html" title="Ibn al-Qayyim">Ibn_al-Qayyim</a> who lived around the mid 1200s i.e. over 600 years <i>after</i> Muhammad. It is all historical to us, yes, but the definition of primary source is one in which the document was created at or near the time being studied, often by the people being studied. This is obviously impossible so is it a secondary source&#160;? <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_al-Qayyim_0901.html" title="Ibn al-Qayyim">Ibn_al-Qayyim</a> was a "commentator" who would have used the Quran (a primary source) as well as Hadith and other stuff - it goes on. Anyway, Ibn_al-Qayyim though would be veiwing the events of the life of Muhammad from a <i>historical</i> perspective as it happened 600 or so years prior to his own life. The Zad al-Ma'ad (and other relevant works of Ibn_al-Qayyim) are thus historical works derived from primary sources and are thus secondary sources and if Ibn_al-Qayyim is accepted as a notable commentator then his works are notable secondary sources. <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 20:26, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - I know of Victor A. Gunasekara (humanist, I'm an atheist thus the overlap) who has commented on this with e.g. <a href="http://www.uq.net.au/slsoc/manussa/tr05manu.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.uq.net.au/slsoc/manussa/tr05manu.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.uq.net.au/slsoc/manussa/tr05manu.htm</a> in which he says " After the slaughter of the men of the Jewish tribe of Quraiza, and the enslavement of the women and children, Muhammad took Rihana, the wife of the chief of the Clan as a concubine. Of this incident Gairdner asks: "What of Rihana, the beautiful Jewess, taken to Muhammad's tent on the very night of the slaughter, she with a face yet wet for a husband massacred in cold blood, he with a soul newly stained by the blood of that husband?".(19) Rihana later tried to poison Muhammad." The reference is Gairdner <i>Reproach of Islam, p. 96-7.</i>.

<li><b>Delete</b> Slavery was neither something specific to Muhammad, nor other encyclopedias or books I've seen have such sections. <i>Slavery was not a significant point in life of Muhammad that could deserve an article</i>. Usually, we should have an article on something where it is a significant part of someone's life otherwise it is violation of undue weight policy. Slavery was practiced until recent times and was approved by all religions. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 07:07, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is the second time someone has wanted to delete an article I have written under rights of notability so you'll forgive me if I sound...unhappy. While I will admit when i first began the article most of the infomation provided on The Abridged Series was from my own personal interpretation (It has since been edited several times) It is simply because I am not Little Kuriboh, and therefore can not give use reliable sources, short of asking Kuriboh himself (Something I have been trying to do, but have been unable to due his busy lifestyle). Another thing to point out is not every article subject on Wikipedia has been the subject of published works, nor has every article subject won a notable independent award. As to the host issue, Youtube is hardly a trivial host. Although, yes, anyone can upload onto the site (I myself own an account there) some of the contributors are well known companies such as NBS and CBS just to name a couple. I would also like to point out that episodes 1-14 were recently realeased onto Bittorrent (As close as it will ever get to a DVD release) thus taking it away from hosts all together. I am aware that the article doesn't read like other pages, but I am trying my hardest to change it. Also, unless the article is deleted, I am trying to improve it as best I can (Episode guide, etc) Finally, People LIKE this page. The articles talk page only has one person wanting to delete it (For it's notability) I have worked hard on it, and am pleased that people have taken an interest in updating it. in other words, I don't think you should delete this page.

<p>If you are going to delete this article, I will not stop you (I know other people simply keep putting old pages back up after being deleted.) However, I would like to say two things. The first is that I will be keeping a copy of this page in case THe Abridged Series reaches the specifications needed to to be classed as a wikipedia article. the second thing is that after reading the articles talk page, I discovered several people found the article to be useful (Note i said useful, not "They liked it".) Cactus Bob said and i quote "I personally searched for this topic myself. I believe that this page is a valuable resource for finding references that would be different to research on one's own", while MoChan said "I actually found out about this series in the first place thanks to this article". I always thought Wikipedia was here to inform people, that was the only reason I began this article. I think that the series is notable enough to get a page here, even though it's hasn't won any awards or been featured in publications, but judging from this page, many of you don't think the same. I can understand that. We all have to follow the rules, otherwise we'd have chaos. Dearing 16:30, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not quite accurate; Wikipedia's purpose is to be an online encyclopedia, not to "inform people," a vague aspiration under which damn near anything could be justified. That being said, you saving a copy of the article in the event the guidelines change or the subject meets those guidelines just makes good sense. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 17:10, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Encyclopedia-A comprehensive reference work with articles on a range of topics." extract taken from Wiktionary's article on Encylopedia. Now to me, that just says "A Reference book used to tell people about all kinds of stuff," Which is what I use Encylopedias for, to look up info on things I want to know about. I couldn't find a page on The Abridged Series, so I wrote one in the hopes I could tell other people about it, and they'd find it useful. and for what it's worth, they did.

We could data dump the New York City telephone directory into Wikipedia and some people would find it useful. Usefullness is a subjective argument.

<p>"Comprehensive-Broadly or completely covering," so yes, essentually it IS all-inclusive.

Perhaps it does qualify as "original research," but as the writer of this article argued earlier, when there are no available primary sources, you are restricted to origial research. And seriously: if there ever are any "primary source" documents that discuss Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series, they will be published on the Internet, just the same as this article should be. That's just the way of modern publication. So what draws the line between this article and a "primary source" article hosted somewhere "non-trivial"? And this is where the ignorance comes in: There HAVE been third-party publications about this cartoon series, on many Internet sites that should be considered non-trivial. But again, where do you draw the line? Compare the entire Internet-savvy population of the world with the hundreds-of-thousands of viewers watching this series. The tens-of-thousands of them who found out about the series by reading about it on third-party Internet sites. I think it's pretty clear which side of your ambiguous line this article should fall on. And in regard to the "notable awards" argument, I don't know how many awards you would consider notable that are given out to online cartoon parody dubs. Especially considering that the series has only barely been around for 5 months. Do you take into consideration the fact that it may be up for nomination for any of these "notable" awards? I think as a rule of thumb it would be reasonable to leave the article up until the series has been around for a year, to see if it gets any of these awards (of course, with a disclaimer that states that many scholars argue it doesn't deserve to be on Wikipedia, but it may be in consideration for gaining a quality that would deem it notable). And finally, the distribution issue. I don't know the laws on parody very well, but I'm sure there's someone in the Wikipedia community that can give some insight into this. All I suggest is that it's rather unlikely that something with content as legally questionable as parody would not easily be redistributed outside of open-source free-content-sharing communities like Youtube. Someone earlier in this AfD also mentioned the release of episodes 1-14 to Bittorrent, which sounds to me like it fits the bill of "well known and independent of the creators," although it too would fall under your trivial clause, wouldn't it? But there's the ambiguity again. In short, I think that this article's deletion will prove that Wikipedia's one great flaw is that it cannot understand how to alter the guidelines of "what is encyclopedic" to reflect the changes that the Internet has caused. You can take the paper out of an encyclopedia and put it online, but that doesn't mean you've got an online encyclopedia, you just have an encyclopedia that is online.DoomTree87 04:04, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unless they're just fansites, then why don't you use them in the actual article? By the way, we aren't saying that "Internet = trivial".

<dl>
<dd>The most important difference is that a primary source article, or even a secondary or tertiary source article hosted <i>anywhere</i> makes a far better source for this particular article than does this particular article. Also, having an article on Wikipedia just means that someone wrote an article about you on Wikipedia. It means absolutely nothing in the notability department. I have literally seen people stick obituaries on Wikipedia. For obvious reasons, those have been long since deleted, but you can see articles about similarly unnotable people and things <a href="../../../p/r/o/Category%7EProposed_deletion_dc1f.html" title="Category:Proposed deletion">here</a>.</dd>

<dd>That's rather amusing, given that I recall hearing LittleKuriboh himself say that he was releasing them in Torrent form on his YouTube profile, which now says something else.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> when debating articles for deletion. Calling this deletion "ignorant and despicable" is not warranted. Anyway, you said that this article is encyclopedic "…With the exception of: no third-party publications, no notable awards, and no mainstream distribution…" How is it then encyclopedic? It's got no reliable independent sources and it's got no claim to notability. You say: "There HAVE been third-party publications about this cartoon series, on many Internet sites that should be considered non-trivial" What are they? If they exist, please present them as evidence in this article, otherwise this is an empty declaration. How exactly is a series being released on bittorrent an indication of notability? Bittorrent is an open-sorce file sharing protocol that anyone with a pc, internet connection, and a bit of knowledge can use to share files. It's not an indication of notability.</dd>

<dd>You can see an example list of acceptable awards at the bottom of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If there are similar notable and independent awards that are given for this category of web items, then they can be considered as well. (Remember this guideline if for all web content: blogs, website, webcomics, online videos, etc. There are recognized awards in many of those categories, but not in all.) If the subject of the article has been nominated for multiple awards then it may be considered notable. An article need not be "[left] up until the series has been around for a year". If it became notable, then it can be easily re-created. The re-distribution clause is mainly meant for blog content that is republished in main-stream media. It can also apply to online videos that are re-show on other media. An online video example of this is <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_Rock_%28song%29_942c.html" title="Canon Rock (song)">Canon Rock (song)</a>. The video lead to major discussion on CNN, NPR, New York Times, etc…</dd>

The problem I have with merging is that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Game_%28rapper%29_14c6.html" title="The Game (rapper)">The Game (rapper)</a> is already being crowded with information regarding his feuds, and it doesn't really need more info.

<dd>I also monitor the article; I believe that the information in the G-Unot article could be cleaned-up and easily merged with similar/identical information in the <b>50 Cent and G-Unit</b> section; it might add two to three small paragraphs to <b>The Game</b> article. The <b>G-Unot</b> article already reads out of context, as if it's a section ripped from a more informative article; merging solves that problem. -- <a href="../../../w/e/i/User%7EWeirdoactor_7234.html" title="User:Weirdoactor">weirdoactor</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/e/i/User_talk%7EWeirdoactor_eae5.html" title="User talk:Weirdoactor">t</a></sup><sup>|</sup><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Weirdoactor_bb16.html" title="Special:Contributions/Weirdoactor">c</a></sup> 19:44, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Fails to assert notability. —<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 19:50, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Perhaps with a slight expansion to address whatever concerns there are. The reasoning is as follows:
<p>1) The guidelines for Resources under <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines</a> are basically non-existent, so it is unclear as to what criteria are being utilized to judge the validity of this entry.</p>
<p>2) Even under the more general guidelines for articles/entries, it should be noted that The Music Box and its staff have been resources for and have provided content to other mainstream media outlets.</p>
<p>a) Print: Its editor and staff have been resources and contributors to at least a few mainstream publications/newspapers. Both the Florida Times-Union and the Louisville Courier-Journal, for example, are the major papers that serve their respective areas.</p>
<p>b) Radio: Its editor has made guest appearances on at least one major radio station, where he served as the co-host of a regular segment. <a href="../../../w/k/z/WKZE_cb6d.html" title="WKZE">WKZE 98.1 FM</a> is a large and well-respected commercial station in Connecticut.</p>
<p>That The Music Box has passed both the editorial and the commercial considerations of at least a few major print and radio outlets means that it has been recognized within the industry as being a notable, reputable, and authoritative media outlet in its own right.</p>
<p>Also, given that The Music Box is based in Illinois, these (Kentucky, Florida, Connecticut) are big geographic distances to traverse for a non-notable publication.</p>
<p>When combined with the <a href="http://www.musicbox-online.com/wkze.html" class="external text" title="http://www.musicbox-online.com/wkze.html" rel="nofollow">2-year duration of the radio segment</a>, these facts lend very strong credence to the notion that The Music Box has knowledgeable expertise that has been recognized outside the scope of its own existence, which therefore makes it a notable resource/publication.</p>
<p>In addition, I also submit the following:</p>
<p>3) The registered users who created the article in February 2006 (and have since worked on it and categorized it) clearly have felt that The Music Box was a notable resource. It is puzzling that after all this time, it now is being targeted for deletion with a simple 'nn' designation.</p>
<p>4) The Music Box has been published since 1994, and while one could argue that longevity is not necessarily indicative of notability, it also could be argued that its having a track record of 12+ years is.</p>
<p>5) The Music Box is well-written and informative, the latter being the very definition of a useful resource. Again, taken on its own, this might not refute the argument that it is not notable, but the publication's well-reasoned reviews and its attention to accurate historical detail make it worthwhile to include.</p>
<p>6) Perhaps it also is worth mentioning that in its 12+ year existence, The Music Box staff has conducted and published interviews with many well-known artists and music industry representatives, including <a href="http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-int.html" class="external text" title="http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-int.html" rel="nofollow">Bruce Hornsby</a>, <a href="http://www.musicbox-online.com/bspr-int.html" class="external text" title="http://www.musicbox-online.com/bspr-int.html" rel="nofollow">Burning Spear</a>, <a href="http://www.musicbox-online.com/dm-long2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.musicbox-online.com/dm-long2.html" rel="nofollow">author and historian Dennis McNally</a>, <a href="http://www.musicbox-online.com/po-int.html" class="external text" title="http://www.musicbox-online.com/po-int.html" rel="nofollow">Be Good Tanyas/Po Girl's Trish Klein</a> and <a href="http://www.musicbox-online.com/trainint.html" class="external text" title="http://www.musicbox-online.com/trainint.html" rel="nofollow">Train</a>. For years, The Music Box also has covered quite a few albums from major artists prior to their release. Clearly, the industry views The Music Box as a notable resource. 71.155.233.121 00:50, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete'</b> The original article (first in history) reads <i>Byoblue is one of the colors used as a table post background for the forum BYOB on Something Awful. After much research, we found that it is not a named color and took it upon ourselves to name it byoblue.</i> This seems to show that it is original research. Tens of thousands of color names are made up, e.g. by paint manufacturers and I see no cause to start collecting those with no cultural significance and not in any formal standard. Those not familiar with color science might like to note that there are <i>24 million</i> hex color values, so a project to catalog them all exceeds the scope of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 17:48, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thus, why the original version was edited, since Byoblue is much more important than just a background color.</dd>

<p>I'm nominating this article for deletion a second time for several reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>The article does not establish the notability of the mall outside of Tom's River Township, New Jersey. Articles in the English language Wikipedia should have a much broader appeal.</li>
<li>The information in the article will probably be obsolete within 6 months. Simply due to the fact that the turnover rate for stores in malls can be high. So an interested editor is going to have to volunteer to periodically check the information and update the article as necessary.</li>
<li>Some of the material is promotional in tone.</li>
</ol>

It isn't on a stock market index, and we have no evidence that it meets the ranking index criteria either. The link is to a directory entry, so is clearly trivial coverage. The other stated sources are old enough to not be readily available online, but sources don't need to be online. The New York Times page number looks odd; what does the RER prefix mean? I'm guessing one of the regional or special editions, rather than the main paper. If it is one of the regional editions, that would indicate that the NYT thought it was only of local interest. If a special edition, I don't know what it means. The other appears to be in a trade publication, some of which are just paid advertising and some of which are good sources. I can't tell about this source either, so I don't know what we should do with the article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 22:10, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> In addition to general philosophical issues I have with these second (and third, and fourth) attempts at deleting articles after failed AfDs, this article provides materials from multiple reliably sourced publications in full compliance with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> that deal directly with Seacourt Pavilion as the primary subject of each of the articles. To address the justifications for this AfD, 1) notability is established per unique feature offered at this mall, 2) There is a very limited number of stores listed, most of those listed are majors and anchors that have made a long-term commitment, and there are more than enough editors who have expressed an interest in maintaining this article to ensure that any changes are reflected, and 3) promotional tone is a wonderful opportunity to dig into the article and make it better, but a very poor (if not invalid) rationalization to delete an article. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 18:58, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm not convinced that this article has established why the mall is notable outside of New Jersey.

I see one reference to the New York times that seems to be a simple article about its construction. One other reference is simply a listing in a directory. The other reference seems to be a magazine that is not notable.

<dd>You are right. Every product does have some sort of advertising in it. It isn't that this article is blatant advertising; if that were the case, I would have nominated it for speedy deletion. The problem with this article is that the church is non-notable. According to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28local_churches_and_other_religious_congregations%29_07e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (local churches and other religious congregations)">Wikipedia:Notability (local churches and other religious congregations)</a>, in order for a church to be considered notable, there is three criteria to be met. 1) <i>Local churches are usually notable if the scope of activities is national or international in scale and information can be verified by a third party source.</i> While this church may attract members from immigrant communities (which is most likely true since half of the GTA is foreign born), it is not considered national or international scale. I doubt that more than a handful of people in Vancouver or Iqaluit are familiar with this church. 2) <i>Individual local churches in notable denominations are not inherently notable, and do not warrant a separate article unless sufficient notability for the local church itself is established through reliable and verifiable sources.</i> There is a link to the church website, which I will discuss in a moment. 3) <i>Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found.</i> There is nothing listed that it did anything non local in scope. For example, I'm not noticing that it has any national press coverage, or even that there were any abroad missionary trips (although that wouldn't count for notability, either). You could say that the website is considered to be reliable and verifiable sources. However, under assertions to be rejected, <i>Internal documents cannot be used as an assertion of notability. However, they can be used as source material for an article...[i]nternal documents can include, reports, newsletters, press releases, magazines and websites published by the church itself, or any denomination or other organisation it is part of.</i> Therefore, the church website doesn't count. Even if you listed the website for Congregational Christian Churches of Canada, that wouldn't count either. This church does not deserve to have a Wikipedia article. I understand that you are concerned about other articles being able to exist. I suggest and invite you to take a look at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>, where you can take a look at the criteria, and process of AdD, and invite you to even contribute by listing articles that do not meet qualifications, either. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Riley_1176.html" title="User:Adam Riley">Adam Riley</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Riley_dcbd.html" title="User talk:Adam Riley">Talk</a></sup> 21:37, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As one&#160;!voter puts it, <i>We shouldn't be combing through fansites looking for speculative material to make an article out of.</i>. The question of whether or not it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> was discussed in some depth, with credible arguments for, some creative interpretations of that policy, and some individual elements undoubtedly having credible arguments against OR, but the overall subject - insignia not covered in canon - is pretty much a guarantee that, whether or not it is technically OR in every respect, it contains core elements which must be original research, and it unquestionably represents a level of detail in excess of what is generally considered appropriate for a general encyclopaedia. Material of interest only to a very small number of dedicated fans - carefully avoiding that piece of Wikijargon which I know is on the tips of several tongues. Friends, let's not fight any longer. This can go to memory Alpha, I'll happily hand over the source if anyone wants it, but on the basis of the arguments presented below this is simply too far from the core principles of verifiable material neutrally stated from reliable secondary sources. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:02, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

"Alternate ranks of Star Trek are Starfleet ranks and insignia that have never appeared in canon Star Trek productions or materials, but have been described in non-canonical literature or fan sources.

<li>Well, in the first AfD, Husnock said that established editors had been working on this for over a year. I appreciate that they thought they were creating a good article (and one that might be a credit to another wiki, let me add), but if experienced Wikipedians put a lot of work into an article and it still failed (by a long measure, I think we can agree) to demonstrate that the topic met our standards for coverage, I am unconvinced that any amount of work could result in the article meeting the inclusion criteria. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 01:03, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

IMHO, excising material because it is non-canon is non-npov. Anyhow, there's a lot of conjecture in this article, but some of it is sourceable to published secondary sources; that material should be siphoned over to the "regular" ranks and insignia article; readers can decide on their own whether to "buy into" canon and non-canon material. --<a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 01:03, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The way I read that, quoting a statement directly from an off-screen source (such as a technical manual or a novel) is fine, as long as you make it clear where it's from, and that it's not canon. OTOH, using any source to invent new material yourself would definitely be OR.</p>
<p>"The Branch Admiral rank appears in the non-canon "Star Trek: The Next Generation Officer's Manual"" (the claim that it appears in this book is a verifiable fact)<br />
"Leonard McCoy rose to the rank of Branch Admiral" (not stated on-screen, so it's conjecture)</p>
<p>Here are a couple other examples to illustrate my point (totally made up, of course):</p>
<p><br />
Good, in-universe tone: "Luke blew up the Death Star (source: "A New Hope" movie)"<br />
(based on canon source)</p>
<p>Good, out-of-universe tone: "In the novel "Dark Side", it is suggested that Luke used the Dark Side of the Force when he blew up the Death Star. However, this novel is not considered canon."<br />
(sources the claim, but makes it clear it's only suggested, and it's not an established fact within the fictional universe yet.)</p>
<p>Bad, in-universe tone: "Luke used the Dark Side of the Force when he blew up the Death Star. (source: "Dark Side" novel)."<br />
(it's not clear from this sentence that the source is non-canon)</p>
<p>Bad, out-of-universe tone: "It is suggested that Luke used the Dark Side of the Force when he blew up the Death Star"<br />
(unsourced, dismiss as purely original research by the editor until a source is found)</p>
<p><br />
If anyone has some arguments about this reasoning, please share them here.</p>
<p>Now, onto this article - the old Warrant Officer section was a mess, but it's been much improved. The only section that still bugs me is the Admiral's ranks - four versions of TOS ranks, based on two websites? <i>(cough) OR (cough)</i>. I asked for a definitive source last time this came up, but none's appeared, so I'm going to delete this section - it can be put back if sourced.</p>
<p>The main concern that would make me jump between keep and merge is <i>the size of the article</i> - if the current article (minus admiral's ranks) is below the current minimum size for an article it should be merged to the main ranks page (while making very bloody clear that these aren't canon ranks). If articles of this size are commonly allowed to stay independent, then the same standard should be applied. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 01:52, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Keep/merge - I would say that this article does indeed have references to merit some sort of inclusion, so I feel that deletion is unnecessary. As for merging, I'm told that in the past these actually were merged but they were forked as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia.html" title="Starfleet ranks and insignia">Starfleet ranks and insignia</a> became too large (and is already quite difficult to load with the mass of images).

<li><b>Keep</b> I'll come out of retirement to vote on this due to my original argument: 17 sources are provided from various star trek manuals, publications, and live action productions. Warrant officer section was heavily re-written to reference exactly where the material came form and how the rank evolved over the years from no apperances at all to heavy apperances in Star Trek literature with O'Brien stated in the novel of "Emissary" that he held a "warrant". I'm sure this vote will not help, since forces at work seem intent on deleting these articles and I am making no further edit controbutions to this website with perhas the exception of reverting obvious vandalism. With that said, please no one bash my vote, call me names (like "Craftateer") or state that I have no idea what OR is.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article signs its own death warrant in my opinion with the comment, "Alternate ranks of Star Trek are Starfleet ranks and insignia that <i>have never appeared in canon Star Trek productions or materials</i>, but <i>have been described in</i> non-canonical literature or <i>fan sources</i>. The main sources of such Star Trek rank insignia are Star Trek novels, technical manuals, fan magazines, and <i>internet websites not directly connected with the publication of the show</i>." It seems an admission to lack of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and and inherent violation of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. At most these insignia have been described in a book- the pictures are mostly pure conjecture and OR. By way of example. The 'ensign first class' insig is apparently descibed in the book "Doctor's Orders". I have included its picture right. How much of the book was taken up with the description of the insignia for so accurate a rendering to be produced?- <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 12:55, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To be perfectly honest, I've got no idea. I've listed it as an unknown for now, until we get some sort of confirmation - thanks for pointing it out. Still, even if the rank is just described in the "Doctor's Orders" novel and not illustrated, we can still list it as a non-canon rank - just one <i>with an unknown insignia</i>. I think I'll have a quick look at some of the other ranks that claim to be only mentioned in novels, but still have rank insignia shown. In the worst case scenario that all the rank insignia listed from novels are bogus (no appearances as cover art or anything), we'd have to replace two or three pictures in one section of the article with an "Unknown". That's hardly a convincing case to wipe out the entire article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 14:23, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

It appears that nobody has previously, on the basis of these continuity errors, published a hypothetical rank system which accounts for them.

<dd>A simple list of non-canon ranks, each individually sourced, is not "a novel narrative".

<dd>You appear to be relying on a very narrow interpretation of <i>novel narrative or historical interpretation</i>. This is a narrative, and historical interpretation, of continuity errors, and it is novel. What more do you want? You can easily disprove the claims of OR by citing secondary sources which provide a similar narrative or interpretation. What we get in the article are primary sources. That's no use at all for disproving a charge of original research. Quite the opposite: it vindicates the claim. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 14:31, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>- Assume that the rank "Dogsbody" appears in the non-canon book "Stuff".</dd>
<dd>- The statement of fact, "in the non-canon book, "Stuff", the rank of Dogsbody appears" is not OR, since it does not extrapolate the original work. It is a descriptive claim, which complies with the OR policy I quoted in bold, since it is "easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge" - anyone who reads the book can confirm that the rank appears.</dd>
<dd>- A host of secondary sources is not necessary when making a factual claim about a primary source. (Compare with Hamlet - you don't need a secondary source to simply say, "In the play "Hamlet", Hamlet meets a ghost". If you want to start discussing character themes and motivations, like "Was Hamlet insane?", however, then you <i>do</i> need secondary sources.)</dd>
<dd>- "Dogsbody is a canon rank" is incorrect, since the source is non-canon.</dd>
<dd>- Interpretation like "Dogsbody is roughly equivalent to Ensign" is OR, unless this claim also appears in the book. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 22:45, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since there appears to be a level of confusion, let me explain a few things about Star Trek franchise's understanding of canon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, I do want to point out that everything on star trek is a fake. It is all fiction, someones original fantasy (not even research).</li>
<li>A lot of material published by the official creators of the show is considered fanon such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Animated_Series_3340.html" title="Star Trek: The Animated Series">Star Trek: The Animated Series</a>. This is primarily to maintain series continuity. They do not want to introduce something that will hunt them later on.</li>
<li>Practically every star trek episode has a novelized non-canon (fanon) version almost always written by the same people who write the script for the episode. These aren't fan work as the word "fanon" suggests but official publication not considered canon. Novel series have a canon within themselves and they often do contradict the official canon TV show. Tucker never died in the novelized version of <a href="../../../e/n/t/Star_Trek%7E_Enterprise_849e.html" title="Star Trek: Enterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a> unlike the tv series.</li>
<li>There are official yet non-canon publication such as Star Trek games, Star Trek Encyclopedia, as well as various "tech" manuals of the show that occasionally cover material never shown on TV. These books are 100% original fantasy just like the show. However, the people writing the books and making the show are the same people.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for wikipedias approach to the matter at hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia's policy on original research does not care if material is considered canon or fanon. So long as it is published (Star Trek Encyclopedia certainly is published), OR can no longer apply. If you feel there is unpublished material on the article, feel free to comment them out.</li>
<li>Conjecture (speculation) is acceptable on wikipedia provided its not OR (ie my speculation). For example creators of the show have long 'speculated' how ST:TOS admiral insignia supposed to look like. Same thing happened with the movie pins. Different tech manuals and etc have contradicted each other until canon was established with later movies. Star Trek Encyclopedias representation of the pins have evolved over time in accordance with canon. We have entire articles based strictly on speculation such as 9/11 conspiracy theories article.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the merge idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>That is a very bad idea. The article <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia.html" title="Starfleet ranks and insignia">Starfleet ranks and insignia</a> as is is about 32ks and thats just wiki code. A merge would make that article very hard to load on computers with slower internet link. This article originally was part of it and was forked off of it for this very reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the move to other wiki idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memory alphas project-scope does not include fanon with the only exception being <a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Animated_Series_3340.html" title="Star Trek: The Animated Series">Star Trek: The Animated Series</a>. This is similar to wikipedias project scope. As encyclopedic they can be, dictionary definitions or entire books are not welcome here but instead on wiktionary and wikibooks respectively.</li>
</ul>

<dd>"Practically every star trek episode has a novelized non-canon (fanon) version almost always written by the same people who write the script for the episode." This is just wrong. There are exactly two novelisations of episodes or films written by the person who wrote the episode, compared to what, several hundred episodes?

<dd>Ok, I guess my knowledge is flawed. I am after all getting old. So please remind me, what is the status of the novels? Are they written by random fans? --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 11:37, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well not fans but random writers would be about right. The other problem with the novels is that because they are non-canon, the powers that be don't care if multiple writers do follow-ups to the films or novels that don't match up with each other. Take the last original cast movie - there are a number of novels set just afterwards - none of which match up. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 11:43, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep (after rename)</b> The title is POV, it should be changed to IDF operations with significant civilian casualties, to avoid any hint of bias. My concern arises when the list itself, irrespective of its title, is referred to as "a POV attack page".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Unverifiable - Unless someone wants to argue that one of these incidents is a worldwide media hoax, we should accept that all of these were, in fact, <b>IDF operations with significant civilian casualties</b> - i.e. on date A, some civilians (estimates range from B to C) died at location D, and the IDF was operating in the area at the time. So change the list name to something that reflects that. Any arguments about sourcing, and whether something was a massacre or not, belong in each specific article - this should be just a navigation list, not a full article. (Btw, if someone wants to argue that "significant" is biased, we could change it to just IDF operations with civilian casualties, so even 1 is enough for a mention, but that'd result in a lot of red-linked articles like we see in the terrorist lists below. If we have to go down that road, though, fine, I'm up for it - fair's fair for everyone.)</dd>

(I'm assuming those groups took responsibility for <i>every single action</i> listed there, and that there are no "alleged" attacks in those lists.)

<dd>The neatest option I see is a split into two lists. All IDF ops can be left in the current list (after a rename to List of IDF operations with civilian casualties, I forgot "List of" before), and a new List of Jewish paramilitary operations with civilian casualties list can be created to move those non-IDF incidents into. If we could think of a good NPOV name, we could keep them together, but it's becoming more and more unwieldy, if we can't use "massacre" or "alleged massacre", and we can't say "Israeli forces", since some incidents occured before Israel was created. "List of Israeli military or Jewish-aligned paramilitary operations with civilian casualties"? is getting ridiculous. Any thoughts on the split into those two lists? Like I said before, as long as incidents on both sides of the conflict are easily accessible, I'll be happy. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 07:58, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The only source where the term "massacre" is used is from the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, I suggest that its use to describe that incident constitutes POV, and it should be removed from the title. If this list gets renamed to "alleged massacres", so should that list. Look, either we ban the terms "massacre" and "alleged massacre" all together, we establish a common definition for their use, or we only use "massacre" when the mass media uses the term itself. But whatever policy we choose, we have to be <b>consistent</b> when applying it.</dd>

<dd>I'm saying that it is inherently POV to take a list of attacks from both sides and copy only one side into a separate article. Further, it is absolutely improper to <i>relabel</i> incidents as massacres when they are not described as such in the article.

<li>We've had another five "delete - pov" votes, but no-one's directly addressed what I asked before, so I'll try again. Is it POV because of the term "massacre" in the title? If so, rename to List of Israeli operations with civilian casualties, and replace the word "massacre" throughout the list with "incident". Is it POV because it only lists one side's attacks? If that's reason enough for deletion, then <i>every list which only list one's sides attacks</i> should also be deleted, starting with the six lists I mentioned a couple pages ago.

<p>The subject of this article does not meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Under the criteria for musicians and ensembles, he could meet number 10, but I disagree with the notion that any of the appearances in games were notable enough to require more than a passing notion in the respective articles, especially considering the great amount of minor artists that are featured in things such as Dance Dance Revolution. The article is not referenced properly, with most of the references being to trivial web sources.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. This falls under the guidelines of Speedy_keep #3, the end of sentence 2: "making nominations of the same article with the same arguments after they were strongly rejected". There was a split consensus for the last nomination, where notability was majority <b>keep</b> and verifiability was majority <b>delete</b>. This has been settled though, since {{unreliable}} has been removed and all of the sources ARE, in fact, nontrivial. <a href="../../../b/k/i/User%7EBkid_df17.html" title="User:Bkid">Bkid</a> 21:56, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thus by your own account, Speedy Keep #3 cannot apply as there was no consensus one way or the other ("strongly rejected" requires consensus, which was clearly lacking). <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 06:13, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Incorrect, There was consensus on the point of contention on which <s>you nominated</s> the article was nominated, therefore speedy keep is applicable. Beyond that, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is not a policy. As it states in the article itself it is, in fact, a <s>rule of thumb</s> guideline.

<li>I see the point here, although the article was not created by him, and the guidelines set in <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> don't specifically limit to reverting vandalism—simple factual errors could also be edited.

<dd>Once again, the notability claim was supported by the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_DM_Ashura_c7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/DM Ashura">previous AfD</a>, so unless there is a specific point, I don't think the reason "per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>" is satisfied. Could you perhaps justify your claim a bit clearer? <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> does make some good points regarding notability, and maybe something he said could be used to clarify your point. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDougk_db9d.html" title="User:Dougk">dougk</a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDougk_3107.html" title="User talk:Dougk">Talk</a> ˑ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dougk_f141.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dougk">Contribs</a>) 12:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's go through the qualifications of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>: not close on #2 through #6, #8, #11, and #12; falls short on #10 (as it appears to be his "only claim" - and he creates music for software, which many would consider less than "notable" per the description); while some people could argue about the applicability of #7, his work is not representative of a specific city, particularly his native <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. This leaves #9 (won or placed in a major music competition) and #1 (subject of reliable, independent coverage).</p>
<p>Some would argue that his winning Konami's music competition is notable enough, but others would counter that it is not unlike the jingle contests of the 1950s and 1960s and therefore not "major enough" to satisfy #9; regarding #1, triviality is in the eye of the beholder. Almost all of the links provided are not independent of the subject and do not exhibit notoriety beyond that of a limited audience of "the beat game community", and the one that could have worked if the article originated in something a bit more circulated than a college newspaper. It's a very close call - <b>weak delete</b> unless/until notability beyond the beat game community is better established via WP:MUSIC #1 or #9. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 06:45, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - A consensus to keep the article on the point of notability was to <b>Keep</b> and therefore cannot be renominated on this point. The article does have proper references, and they are non-trivial in nature. They are, however, specialized, but seen by a wide variety of people in the Bemani Community. This does not lend to the sources' triviality.

<li><b>Comment and Amendment</b> - The closing admin placed {{unreliable}} on the page with instructions to remove it once the issue had been handled.

<dd>Um, just because it has notable subjects doesn't mean anything. <i>I</i> could make a documentary about the most notable people and it still wouldn't warrant an article or assess notability (the notability is on the subject of the article, not the subject of the article's subject). <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">Cbrown1023</a> 22:53, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, my argument wasn't "just" that it had notable subjects, it also offered reviews &amp; film festivals. What criteria is being used here to decide the notability of this film? Documentaries, with a few notable exceptions, are rarely blockblusters, yet obviously many rise above "you tube" status. What criteria would a notable independent documentary fulfill that this one fails to? I'm open to to being convinced, but frankly, the nomination somewhat mistates the google hits (there's a <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_%28magazine%29.html" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a> review and the "directories" are the schedules of film festivals that this film has been in) and there are no other comments of substance. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 03:00, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>Here is another example of an artist who in my opinion should be listed somewhere. Emerging can be many things to many people. Some artists are always emerging. Is emerging a dirty word? Am I missing something here? Seems the butt of a joke even. Oh well.</p>
<p>Notability standards for artists should be slightly different than say if they were an author or lawyer. People often times are trying to find info on artiists in all kinds of places and obscurity based on notablility doesn't help the seeker at all here on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Shouldn't Wikipedia make it easier to find things like in a dictionary and isn't it set up to supposedly be democratic at least?</p>
<p>Artist sites are developed differently and react differently and made for differing reasons. These site are established to do something in a totally different way than say a product site. Should the criterion be different here? I dont think it bodes well to pat everyone on the back and say job well done when nothing was accomplished except a delete of someones time and energy.</p>
<p>Maybe the artists themselves should have something like a WikiArtProject site set up separately to deal with all the complex nuancing and exclusivity issues and problems. Who knows? I just have an opinion after having worked with so many artists for over 20 years in galleries, museums and non-for-profits and my background is behavioral psychology, not art.</p>
<p>Also, in googling artists, I realize why so many sites only have one mention of an artist, which is fine by me, depending on the site and the type of gallery, museum or non-for-profit that administers the site. Many public and private institutions only have so much money for space that they are willing to devote and I suspect that if you are a non-for-profit that a single listing can and does go a long way if it is presented in the right, read nuanced, way and this is the point I am trying to make here. Nuance has to occur when subjectively deciding on whether an artist has merit. If a person is a full time artist and pays the bills and if this person is hardly ever mentioned in a googleable manner does she/he not have any kind of merit at all? Please do not bend art and artists into a wikifyable set of information that may only deminish the role they play in our society.</p>
<p>So many gray areas and so many ways to ill-understand them. Please be passionate but please consider that art is truth based in the reality that creates it and our future without it is not a culture. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">Artsojourner</a> 06:51, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, this guy finished Bard. Know how hard and to what high standards Bard holds? This, in and of itself, is something of merit. I assure you but yet again this is only a nuance that has to be discerned. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">Artsojourner</a> 06:51, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An article on the seal -- i.e., the insignia -- of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_efeb.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a> -- not notable beyond <i>maybe</i> a passing mention in the College's main article. Is the seal important beyond Dartmouth? Has it been recognized as historical, ground-breaking, notable, etc. beyond Dartmouth? Has it made an impact on the world beyond Dartmouth? I would characterize this as an indiscriminate collection of information. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 21:16, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep of merge</b> It has good, interesting information - why not keep it? An alternate suggestion: perhaps an article on Symbols of Dartmouth College - since in addition to the seal having an interesting history, the Indian mascot has attracted national attention and is barely mentioned elsewhere on Wikipedia. --<sub>└</sub><i><sup><a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith120bh_b04a.html" title="User:Smith120bh">Smith120bh</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../s/m/i/User_talk%7ESmith120bh_4622.html" title="User talk:Smith120bh">TALK</a></sub></i> <sup>┐</sup> 00:01, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I like the idea of Symbols -- you're right, the Indian mascot at least deserves as much treatment as the seal.

<p>Although I've put a lot of work into this article, I've recently realized it does not pass <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, because there has never been a definitive work on the subject (<a href="http://www.gamespite.net/toastywiki/index.php/Site/Metroidvania" class="external text" title="http://www.gamespite.net/toastywiki/index.php/Site/Metroidvania" rel="nofollow">the toastyfrog article</a> does not count). When I first joined Wikipedia, it welcomed neologisms, quirky articles, and even original research with the expectation that such seeds would sprout into full, referenced articles. The current Wikipedia is a very different beast, or maybe I was just deluding myself. This article does not belong in the current Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/u/v/User%7ELuvcraft_7624.html" title="User:Luvcraft">Luvcraft</a> 22:07, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to Castlevania. Even though it is a neologism it is a likely enough search term.

<ul>
<li>I feel that wikipedia as it currently stands would not even allow the information from this article to be merged into Castlevania because, again, there is no definitive work on Metroidvanias. It would just get immediately culled as "original research". Even if it was allowed, it wouldn't really belong in either the Castlevania or the Metroid article. <a href="../../../l/u/v/User%7ELuvcraft_7624.html" title="User:Luvcraft">Luvcraft</a> 23:26, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>the interview conducted for his article was done by a group of straight edge kids for a documentary. this documentary never made it past an amature level and never gained much notice out of the straight edge community. a few people from the crew that made the documentary went on to be Team Empire members. this is why it said that we conducted the interview ourselves. also many of the facts and quotes come from the documentary "Ive Got the Straight Edge". A member of Team Empire knows Austin on a semi-personal basis, and he provides us with updates on things like his MMA and musical status. also, because of the nature of Austin's notability, it is hard for there to be mass media coverage about him. There is little to no mass mediacoverage about anyone in the Straight Edge community. get back to me on any thing else i can clear up. -Steve and Team Empire<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStraightxedge_245f.html" title="User:Straightxedge">Straightxedge</a> 03:18, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>A note from the article creator: VCX is an adult film production studio and distributor that's been in business for 25 years now. VCX own the rights to <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debbie_Does_Dallas_f560.html" title="Debbie Does Dallas">Debbie Does Dallas</a>, The Devil In Miss Jones and hundreds of other classic adult films from the 70s and 80s. Many of these films are still very popular today, which is why there are Wiki pages regarding them. VCX does their own wholesale distribution as well as video production. Whether the Wiki page is created/monitored or maintained by us or someone else -- there should probably be a page about VCX on Wikipedia (because of Debbie and Devil, if nothing else). If a page explaining the company responsible for some of the most popular adult films ever bothers fellow wikians so much, go ahead and delete it so it can get recreated at a later date by someone else (saying the same info, showing the same logo, having the same external link).

<li>Situation requires some investigation. The word "hoax" implies fabrication by the creator of the article. In this instance, the article creator, <a href="../../../g/v/n/User%7EGVnayR_1f8b.html" title="User:GVnayR">User:GVnayR</a>, has hundreds of good-faith edits going back more than a year which generally is not the profile of a hoax creator. Interestingly, however, this user's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:GVnayR" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:GVnayR" rel="nofollow">block log</a> has an entry from August 2006 in which the blocking administrator, <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">User:FayssalF</a>, initially blocked for one week and then indefinite with an explanation of "creating multiple hoaxes articles," but unblocked two hours later with an explanation of "mistakingly believed he was creating hoaxes." I see nothing on the talk pages or archives of either GVnayR or FayssalF that sheds any light on what happened at that time, which was before this article was created. I'm going to leave notes for both pointing to this discussion.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>A non-hoax source for believing the contents of this article, linked to in the article although not necessarily a reliable source by current Wikipedia standards, is the company website of Coyle's Country Store, <a href="http://www.coylescountrystore.com" class="external text" title="http://www.coylescountrystore.com" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which states that "A.J. Coyle was a true inventor, years before the current craze for ready-made foods, he invented instant coffee." This is contrary to the history at <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instant_coffee.html" title="Instant coffee">instant coffee</a>, which reports that "Instant coffee was invented in 1901 by Satori Kato, a Japanese scientist working in Chicago. However, it was not marketed commercially until Nescafé launched in 1938." This, in turn, is potentially inconsistent with <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_Carver_7b3e.html" title="George Washington Carver">George Washington Carver</a>, which lists instant coffee as one of over 300 applications that Carver developed for peanut products, though it does not say that Carver invented instant coffee itself. Further research is required and it may be that a deletion is ultimately indicated but to simply declare a "hoax" with the suggestion that the article creator is responsible is premature, though I find no non-Wikipedia and non-store Ghits associating Coyle with instant coffee and my hunch is that we may be dealing with a sales gimmick perpetrated <i>by the store</i>, not by the Wikipedian.</dd>
<dd>With regard to the article about the store, it could be notable if its owner truly invented instant coffee, but I don't see a case for notability otherwise.

<li><b>Delete</b> as unverified and contradicting pages that do or could have reliable sources. Googling finds lots of references, including coffee-company websites and Carver historians, who indicate Satori and Carver, respectively, as the inventor. That's an interesting discrepancy to resolve on the relevant pages. No idea whether the discrepancy is due to different meanings of "invented instant coffee". maybe "concentrated" or "evaporated" vs "freeze-dried"...was freeze-drying even known in Carver's day, for example. But this AfD isn't about that...I found no hits for Coyle. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 04:11, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've heard of him before. In fact, there was quite a lot of discussion among certain groups here in London last year, because of his actions. I'll try to find the news article online. It was in the Times last year. Jamie p077 18:34, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I prodded this article a few days ago but an anon editor deprodded without any explanation. The original reason I gave was "Loose collection of ideas related only by the fact that they don't exist, ie, inappropriate subject for an encyclopedia article" and I stand by this assessment. It also looks a little like crystal-balling but I'm not sure. Any objections? <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 23:34, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per those above. This will remain a scattershot list unless and until any of the technologies named are actually invented, at which point they would cease to qualify anyway. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:44, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> I have to say that although this article seems like it shouldn't be in an encylopedia, this page has been useful for me--I'm currently researching the effect science fiction has had on technology, and this page has allowed me to take a new secondary approach to my topic. Although it is a loose grouping of ideas, I think this page should remain here.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>However, maybe if the ideas were cited--i.e. "Time travel is referred to in this novel", etc."--then this article would be better. <a href="../../../m/e/w/User%7EMewok_fa04.html" title="User:Mewok">Mewok</a> - <a href="../../../m/e/w/User_talk%7EMewok_51dd.html" title="User talk:Mewok">Mewok</a> 23:43, 15 December 2006</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I'm not really sure that would help overmuch. Citations would obviously be a great blessing in any event, but surely the best place to talk about time travel being referred to in this or that novel is in the articles on time travel and/or the novels in question? I'm also not convinced that a cited version of the list would be anything more than a cited list of indiscriminate information. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:07, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
