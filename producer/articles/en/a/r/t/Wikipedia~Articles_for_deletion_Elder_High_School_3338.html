<p>I'm actually <i>from</i> Ohio, and I've never heard of this place.

<dd><i>Oh,</i> it's <i>that</i> school. I think I can be forgiven for not recognizing it based on the previous description, though. I still believe that schools need to prove notability <i>in the article</i> (not just hypothetically) if they are to be kept, but this one now accomplishes this (it really didn't when I nominated it). -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 22:17, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Any other High Schools out there beat that date? <a href="../../../w/e/a/User%7EWeaponofmassinstruction_5523.html" title="User:Weaponofmassinstruction">Weaponofmassinstruction</a> 05:05, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Extreme keep</b>. These are precisely the type of school articles we should encourage. Seems highly distinguishable to me! —<a href="../../../r/a/d/RaD_Man_2e7f.html" title="RaD Man"><b>RaD Man</b></a> (<i>talk</i>) 10:04, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. All schools are inherently notable. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_090d.html" title="User:Andylkl">Andylkl</a> 10:20, Feb 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Being able to fill a 9000 seat stadium is a claim for at least local note, the internet broadcast is also interesting if true. As for all schools being of note, if an elementary school can fill a 9000 seat stadium then I'll accept it's notable... <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 12:42, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. So here is your formula for high school notability, boys: establish that it has a big football stadium and a popular football team. The article says 20,000 kids have graduated from the place in 80 years. That is about 250 per year. But it has a 9000-seat football stadium. It seems they have their priorities a bit twisted. How would you like to have graduated from "The Pit", a notable high school football stadium? A locally notable football stadium doesn't make the school out back notable. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:12, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with you, their priorities seem a bit twisted to me as well. But we list professional sports teams that get less than 9000 fans, and people don't have to go and watch sports (to me, the average school is where the set curriculum is taught, which is why I'm only occasionally convinced that a school article stands on its own rather than as part of the local school board or geographical article). So, yes, this establishment is of more note to me as a sporting venue than a school. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 10:19, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neutral. High schools are <i>not</i> inherently notable, but this one does establish some minor notability. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 22:11, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This didn't cover the important topics. Elder High School appears to have been at the heart of one of the biggest sex-abuse by priests scandals ever, but this wasn't even mentioned. People who say delete should check if the place is notable (Google, for example) and people who say "keep" should check it covers the important facts. This should be encyclopaedic, not vanity; <b>keep</b> now. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozzerati_67af.html" title="User:Mozzerati">Mozzerati</a> 22:39, 2005 Feb 1 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Agree with Mozzerati. Furthermore, VfD is not a cleanup tool. GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 22:50, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> major notability has been established. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:07, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. (Vote change) OK, you convinced me. This place is even more messed up than I thought. Notably messed up. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:09, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. This article attempts to establish notability, and it <i>may</i> be notable enough. An article like this can certainly be given a chance for organic growth. The important distinction is that this is actually an <i>article</i>. It never ceases to amaze me how certain individuals on wikipedia continually vote to keep "articles" that are one or two sentences and give no good information on a school. Even if all schools end up being notable, keeping a two sentence stub that says x school is in y city and the principal is named Bob is a disgrace to wikipedia. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 06:02, Feb 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, now that notability (sex scandal) has been established. This differentiates it from most schools, which are inherently non-notable. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:09, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
