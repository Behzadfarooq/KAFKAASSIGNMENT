<p>I was at the meeting of the WPCUG in Windsor Ontario ,on Oct 20/05 when this article was created. It was used as a demo to illustrate how to post an artile on Wikipedia and it was intended that members would log on and edit or expand the info in this article as per your policies. The demo lasted over an hour and a half. Most people there including myself, had never heard of this web site and were quite interested. Your protocalls and/or language requirements were new to us so much effort went to showing how various elements could be created. It was intended an is a learning tool. I assure you this is neither a vanity ad article nor a hoax. Art Belanger belanger@mnsi.net</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, unfortunately since this usergroup appears not to be notable enough beyond its current membership. You might as well have used the sandbox for the demonstration of the wiki. Please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What wikipedia is not</a>, specially the section on "free hosting". Of course, you and your usergroup are encouraged to keep contributing to wikipedia. Reading <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContributing_to_Wikipedia_bc52.html" title="Wikipedia:Contributing to Wikipedia">Wikipedia:Contributing to Wikipedia</a> may also be of help. -- <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune.welsh_2e22.html" title="User:Rune.welsh">Rune Welsh</a> | <a href="../../../r/u/n/User_talk%7ERune.welsh_7599.html" title="User talk:Rune.welsh">ταλκ</a> | <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#339900">Esperanza</font></a> 20:20, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for this artile is to give history of our users group. The article the way it stands is a stepping stone for our membership to give it life. The point of the Wikipedia is knowledge, knowledge of things present and past, which is what we entended out entry to be. It was not a 'vanity' post as was suggested. I ask what we would have to do to keep this page on your site. We feel that the history of our club is something that can benefit the internet community. Michael Celotto mcelotto@cogeco.ca</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The first thing you see on their web site is the link to their entry on Wikipedia and anyway what about all the other WPCUG groups?. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> 17:47, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b> or <b>Userfy</b>. If what these anons are saying is true, then perhaps one them should create an account with Wikipedia (it's free) and work on the article in their user-space until it is acceptable. As it stands now the article is just advertising. It addresses the reader (ie. "We are located...", and it has an external link in its header). Besides that it has nonsense text (ie. "Stuff Entered here") and inaccuracies (ie. "club was formed before I joined long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"). --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 18:23, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</s></li>
</ul>
<p>Actually I do have an account with Wikipedia (mcelotto) I'm the person who is in charge of the website, and I gave the demo on who to use the wikipedia. The reason that we have the entries (ie. "Stuff Entered here") and inaccuracies (ie. "club was formed before I joined long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"), is because I was showing the users where to enter their information. I assure you that the information will be updated from what I have put. Actually if you look at the entry now, there is club history. I appoligize for the "(ie. "Stuff Entered here") and inaccuracies (ie. "club was formed before I joined long time ago in a galaxy far, far away")", but it was a way to show our membership how to enter information, because well the club did start before I joined. It has been corrected now, again I appoligize. Also the entry in the missage from Michael Celotto (me) I didn't sign into my Wikipedia account, and when I was giving the demo on the entering of information, I didn't even think to log in at the time. How do I edit the article in my userspace? I will also say that I did not know that we could not put our website's address in the header, I will change that. --mcelotto</p>

<li><b>Userfy</b> to mcelotto. He appears to really want this article on Wikipedia. If it is not notable enough for the main-space, certainly it is notable enough for his user-space. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 06:58, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am the president of the WPCUG and let me set the record straight. The posting of the page on your site is meant to document the history of our users group in Windsor that has been serving the area for more than 20 years now. The first posting was used as a learning tool to introduce members to wikipedia and show them how the site works, the content was a starting template. The night of the page was posted had the members were so involved browsing and viewing wikipedia and its contents that our time at the meeting ran out and the page could not be updated from it very simple template. The object was to have the members go home and at update the content. The posting of the deletion notice has stopped that process. I am asking that you get the club a chance to update the page and its content so it can be a valuable link to the clubs history. Let me also apologize for the way the fist page was left on your site. I assure you this is neither a vanity ad article nor a hoax. President of the WPCUG Larry Ruston pres@wpcug.com</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and give the new users a little <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> and a little space for the joy of editing. This group has a <i>very</i> long history by measure of the history of personal computers, so there's your notability. Because it's near to me, and I was Vice President of a similar user's group in the same general area, I have knowledge of and can vouch that it has existed for more than 20 years. WPCUG members, this is when you should find some sources to cite to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> the data in the article. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 03:07, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> as I want to chage my vote. This group may not be as notable as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_Computer_Club_eb49.html" title="Chaos Computer Club">Chaos Computer Club</a> but they are just as notable as <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nordic_University_Computer_Club_b1c2.html" title="Nordic University Computer Club">Nordic University Computer Club</a>, Linux User Group of Mauritius and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalmers_Computer_Society_1667.html" title="Chalmers Computer Society">Chalmers Computer Society</a>. The article has improved over the past few days (I did some minor edits to the article) and I think it's keepable. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> 11:48, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm still not seeing how this is isn't basically the same as the WPCUG website. Also, I don't think we can have this article by this name. The <b>Westchester PC Users Group</b> might complain... <a href="http://www.wpcug.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wpcug.org/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 10:35, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's what disambiguation pages are for. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 15:51, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>First I would like to thank everyone for the help that they have given us with our page. In regards to the <b>Westchester PC Users Group</b>, we at the Windsor PC Users Group would be more than happy to change the title of the Wiki as to not cause any arguments. Our page as it stands now does give history to the group. I do appoligize for the way that we left the page originally, I should have looked at the rules of the Wikipedia more closely, it was just poor preperation on my part...--Mcelotto 03:23, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
