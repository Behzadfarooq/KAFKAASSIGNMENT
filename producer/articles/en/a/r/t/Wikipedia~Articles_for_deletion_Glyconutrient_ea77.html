<p>Glyconutrient(s) is a term coined and used by con-artists to bilk cancer patients out of their money. There is <i>no such thing. Every last claim they make is bogus. Every scientific reference they list says something very different from what they imply it says</i>. There is no way they should be allowed to use Wikipedia to try and give the topic more credibility. These charlatans repeatedly offer money support to <a href="http://www.glycobiology.org" class="external text" title="http://www.glycobiology.org" rel="nofollow">the Society for Glycobiology</a> and their offers are repeatedly refused because legitimate scientists would never allow themselves to be associated with this in ANY way. This article needs to be removed, and any opinion otherwise is self-serving and should be ignored. Stauffenberg 05:41, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Merge or delete</b>. As a biological engineer, I'm quite offended by the lack of science present in this article. "Cellular braille"?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia content does not have to be true; it just has to be sourced (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). There are plenty of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quack.html" title="Quack">quack</a> theories on the Wikipedia; it is appropriate to include traditional scientific viewpoints on these theories in the article.

<dd>In defense of <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby1011_3500.html" title="User:Bobby1011">Bobby1011</a>, he actually posted a note on my <a href="../../../i/s/o/User_talk%7EIsopropyl_e31b.html" title="User talk:Isopropyl">talk page</a> explaining to me why deleting this article is a disservice to the community. He qualified it using the same logic that you are using now, and probably closed/redirected when he saw the information was already available at another article. Don't be too harsh on him; though he might have acted prematurely, it was probably in good faith. Although I disagree with the article, I am changing my vote to a conditional <b>keep</b> provided that it gets <i>overhauled</i>. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsopropyl_2165.html" title="User:Isopropyl">Isopropyl</a> 06:19, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>censor? The entire web is filled with this crap. Search the term on google. This is an ENCYCLOPEDIA. It could remain and be appropriately described which would only serve as debunking the con, and then it would be POV. Why should anyone have to devote time to debunking this? The "glyconutrient" crowd go out of their way to imply scientific validation where none exists. It is not appropriate to state something and provide a list of scientific articles as references when NONE of the scientific articles say anything even remotely close to what they are implied to say. That is FRAUD. The only reference you could provide for this is self-serving books written by the fraudsters or their websites. How is that appropriate? I just decided. I'm the second coming. Bow down to me. Worship me. Reference...ME! Clearly...POV. As is the term "glyconutrient" by it's very FRAUDULENTLY MANUFACTURED nature. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Stauffenberg (<a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStauffenberg_fc75.html" title="User talk:Stauffenberg">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stauffenberg_182d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stauffenberg">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<dd>These are strong arguments - for improving the article via consensus editing. They are not grounds for deletion. In particular, with your reference to "debunking," do you deny that "glyconutrients" are out there? No. Do you deny that books have been published about them? No. Since those things are true, why should you know about them, but not the Wikipedia reading public? You should also consider that not everyone shares your opinion of these theories, which fact is encyclopedic in itself. If disagreement with the content of an article were grounds for deletion, I'd nominate <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> today - those guys were jerks. -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 07:30, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> If the opinion stated by User:Stauffenberg is true then there is every reason to keep the article and describe all the opinions within it.

<li>I don't know enough about the topic to vote for or against deletion, but if the mainstream medical community thinks that it is quackery, that certainly needs to be brought out in the article. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 16:40, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
