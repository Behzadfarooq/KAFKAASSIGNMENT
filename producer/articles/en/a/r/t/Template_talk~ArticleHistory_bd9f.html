<p>This template combines all the featured content-related templates into one, to reduce clutter on talk pages, and make it less confusing when an article has had multiple FACs, FARs or been demoted and repromoted etc. Good Article status, Articles for Deletion, Peer reviews and WikiProject reviews can also be included.</p>
<p>The parameter <b>currentstatus</b> controls what text appears at the top of the box, a set of parameters of the form |action1= |action1date=|action1link=|action1result=|action1oldid= produces a row in the history section at the bottom of the box. Action1 refers to the earliest event.</p>
<p>This template <b>should not (and cannot) be used for nominating articles for processes such as featured article candidate or featured article review.</b></p>

<p>Am I correct to assume that a former featured article candidate, which is a good article, is best described as "FFAC"? I'm confused because there is a FFA/GA, but no FFAC/GA. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 13:45, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, learning to read does help... GA already says "Good article which is not a former featured article"&#160;:), so it's not as confusing; still maybe a little... --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 13:51, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>FFA/GA is the only combination status. There are currently about 350 former featured articles. If such an article later becomes a GA, the FA folks wanted the former featured status still displayed. A former featured article <i>candidate</i> (FFAC), on the other hand is an article which did not pass at FAC - there are a couple thousand of such articles. If one is or later becomes a good article, it is a GA. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 14:35, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not entirely sure what you are asking. The idea of {{<a href="../../../a/r/t/Template%7EArticleHistory_86b0.html" title="Template:ArticleHistory">ArticleHistory</a>}} is to list every completed review-like event, so it will easily have multiple GAN and FAC events listed, and perhaps others, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pericles&amp;oldid=111906110" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pericles&amp;oldid=111906110" rel="nofollow">Talk:Pericles</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Edwin_Taylor_Pollock&amp;oldid=111908057" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Edwin_Taylor_Pollock&amp;oldid=111908057" rel="nofollow">Talk:Edwin Taylor Pollock</a> (Note that the fac on the latter is outside ArticleHistory, as it is not yet a completed event). The <code>currentstatus</code> is the current state of the article, and GAs promoted to FA are simply FA. (They are unlisted from <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">WP:GA</a>.)

<dd>It was probably a dumb question, but I <i>was</i> actually asking the question you answered&#160;:) The relevant talk pages have been updated, and thanks again for your help. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 17:53, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only combo <code>currentstatus</code> currently supported is FFA/GA, and as presently implemented, FFA/GA is a display option for GA.

There was just one detail I think needs fixing, when you flag an article as "FFAC" (which in this case was wrong); the text talks about the "Featured Article" history; but the history is called "Article Milestones".

<p>There is now one topic that has lost FT status (and a second on the way), so this template should probably get a <a href="../../../f/t/r/WP%7EFTRC_37ff.html" title="WP:FTRC">FTRC</a> action. <s>We can probably keep it simple and only tag the main article as a former FT like we do with failed FT nominations.</s> On second thought, we might as well tag all members of a former FT.

<p>I think the template docs would benefit from some instruction on how to fill in the "oldid" line. Here's what I suggest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "oldid" is a several-digit number which refers to the exact version of the page at the time of that particular action. This version can then be viewed when a user clicks on the date in the list of milestones.<br />
<br />
There are multiple ways to obtain an oldid. For example, while looking at a page's history, it should be possible to hover the mouse over the date of a particular change, and then the URL will appear at the bottom of the window in the browser's status bar:<br />
<br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=89723590</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the above example, the final number, <b>89723590</b> is what should be used in the oldid field.<br />
<br />
This number can also be obtained by stepping through the diffs in an article's history, and looking for the oldid in the URL line.<br />
<br />
When dealing with a large number of possible changes, researching each oldid can become tedious. In this case, it can be helpful to use a javascript tool made by <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_pda_8c8c.html" title="User:Dr pda">Dr pda</a>. To use it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <tt>{{subst:js|User:Dr pda/articlehistory.js}}</tt> to your monobook.js page.</li>
<li>Refresh your browser cache</li>
<li>In your browser toolbox along the lefthand side of the page, you should now see an additional link entitled "Article History"</li>
<li>Clicking on the link while you are at an article's talkpage, will search the talkpage history for notable events related to the article, and then display a list of these dates and the associated edit summaries</li>
<li>Next to each summary is the word <tt>(oldid)</tt> Clicking on it will provide the associated article oldid for that timestamp.</li>
<li>For further documentation, see: <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_pda_articlehistory.js_2f3a.html" title="User:Dr pda/articlehistory.js">User:Dr pda/articlehistory.js</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today's main page FA's talkpage (<a href="../../../f/o/u/Talk%7EFourth_International_f865.html" title="Talk:Fourth International">Talk:Fourth International</a>) is listed in both <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_featured_articles_ab1f.html" title="Category:Wikipedia featured articles">Category:Wikipedia featured articles</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_featured_article_candidates_%28contested%29_8613.html" title="Category:Wikipedia featured article candidates (contested)">Category:Wikipedia featured article candidates (contested)</a>.

<p>May I propose this?</p>
<ol>
<li>To rename Date to Version. This seems to convey exactly what is in the column.</li>
<li>Add a column or something separated by slash in the same Version column to put down the Talk Page at that time of that Version. I thought of this when Elonka made a useful edit at an article history template, showing the Talk Page at the moment when the GA template was put by someone. This would give the reader an insight into the discussions at that time of that particular version.</li>
<li>Add a place when it was linked to High Traffic Site.</li>

<p>I'm not sure whether or not this would be too complicated, but I was thinking that we should have the option of allowing people to enter a second Featured topic. There have already been two articles which were members of more than one FT, and <s>another is</s> two more are in nomination. I was thinking that the first FT could use the existing code, and a second one could be added with ft2name= and ft2main=. For example, for the currently nominated FF8 article, it could be: <tt><br />
|FTname=Final Fantasy titles<br />
|FTmain=no<br />
|FT2name=Final Fantasy VIII<br />
|FT2main=yes</tt>.<br />

<p>There really should be a better long-term way to handle FTs. Is it possible that an article could be the main article on two FTs? <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 17:20, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that this template handles FTs very well, and adding optional <tt>ft2name</tt> and <tt>ft2main</tt> parameters should be good enough to fix this problem. In almost all cases, an article in two FTs will be the main article in one topic and a member article in the other. I think there could, however, be a few cases where an article could be the main one of two topics. Off the top of my head, for example, a singer-turned-actor could have a "movies staring John Doe" topic and an "albums by John Doe" topic which would both use the "John Doe" article as their main one. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArctic.gnome_12d9.html" title="User:Arctic.gnome">Arctic Gnome</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/r/c/User_talk%7EArctic.gnome_882b.html" title="User talk:Arctic.gnome">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arctic.gnome_a82a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arctic.gnome">contribs</a>)</small> 18:03, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've almost got FT2 right, but I had to add an <tt>ft2link=</tt> paramiter because the original <tt>ftname=</tt> parameter assumes the link of the <tt>=ftc</tt> action link. Right now I have:</p>

<dd>Easiest would be to combine this with the the regular FT text, and if a second FT parameter exists, it gives both topics it's part of as one text.

<dd>In fact, the way it is currently coded appears to have a bug, if an article is part of one FT then is nominated as part of another which fails, the failed FTC seems to be linked. This can't happen with current FAs and FLs because the latest FAC or FLC must have been a success or the article wouldn't be FA/FL. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 04:32, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Gimmetrow (mostly) and I have carefully worked through all FA article lists that should have it, and all links to old FA templates. All FAs and FFAs currently have it (you can see the tally of the number of each at <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">WP:FA</a> and <a href="../../../f/f/a/WP%7EFFA_4199.html" title="WP:FFA">WP:FFA</a>). All <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FACs</a> that weren't promoted (failed) since January have it. All <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFAR_432e.html" title="WP:FAR">WP:FARs</a> since about January have it. Many FACs that failed during 2006 or prior don't yet have it; what prevents us from adding those is simple; most of the old GAs don't have complete templates on their pages, and searching for and adding back in the oldids will be a pain. Some GAs have it, but that has been sporadic—Gimmetrow will have a better answer—but since GA is such a random process anyway, it's hard to get it fully implemented there. As far as I know, the template is implemented about as fully as we can accomplish for the FA process; holdups are at GA. Not sure what you really want to know; give me a better idea and I can better answer. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 15:54, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I suppose what I really wanted to know was how "completely implemented" the template was. And your answer pretty much answered that question. Can't a similar code be used to search for when the "GA" template was added to the talk page, and then suggest an oldid update? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:17, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Dr pda's script is rendered useless on GAs because *SO* many reviewers don't use edit summaries when passing GA and/or don't add the oldid. Once, I decided to start working on this, and it was taking me up to ten minutes to find each oldid on GA. I don't think it's worth it. Now, if someone wants to encourage THEM to go through the entire list of GAs, and make sure the talk page has an oldid on the GA template, we might have a whole 'nother story. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 16:20, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The bot also has some code to try to find the GA oldid if not present. In addition to the problem Sandy mentions, some talk pages are archived by moving, splitting the edit history.

<dd>To accomplish implementation on all GAs, you'd need to get a drive at the GA Project for editors to 1) upload <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_pda_8c8c.html" title="User:Dr pda">Dr pda</a> (<a href="../../../d/r/_/User_talk%7EDr_pda_2152.html" title="User talk:Dr pda">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dr_pda_8044.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dr pda">contribs</a>)'s article history script, 2) go through all 2000 GAs and check for oldid to add back to the GA template (and peer reviews and facfaileds while they're in there), 3) make sure templates for all other pieces indicated in Dr pda's script are accurately listed on the talk page with no dead links (that includes old archived facfaileds and peer reviews), and 4) put a worklist of talk pages <a href="../../../a/r/t/Template_talk%7EArticleHistory_work_0c22.html" title="Template talk:ArticleHistory/work">here</a> that are GimmeBot-ready so that Gimmetrow can run through them and convert all the templates to articlehistory. (We've found it's not optimal for editors to be manually installing articlehistory themselves, as there are usually errors—better to let Gimmetrow run GimmeBot.) It's a lot of work; that's what Gimme and I did on all the FAs. Of course, while you're in a talk page, might as well group the articlehistory templates together, and add the banners, too&#160;:-) (Isn't it nice of me to volunteer Gimmetrow's time—if someone takes this on and starts the list on the work page, I can help review the article pages for readiness&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 17:00, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>OK. I've started a thread over there <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EGood_articles_fe2d.html#Finding_oldids_for_the_GAs" title="Wikipedia talk:Good articles">here</a>. If you could, please clarify what I've said, especially what you mean by "GimmeBot-ready". <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 22:12, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
