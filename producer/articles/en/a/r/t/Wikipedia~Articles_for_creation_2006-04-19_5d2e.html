<p>About his concert with the Guayaquil Symphony Orchestra under the direction of renowned conductor José Serebrier: “Jorge Saade captivated the audience with his talent and technical command of the instrument…….the soloist demonstrated that with his strings he could mesmerized the audience, leaving in the atmosphere a profound emotion. Conductor, soloist and orchestra a great fusion of rhythm and harmony.” Freddy Russo “EL UNIVERSO” Guayaquil, Ecuador, Mayo 2005</p>
<p>About the Duo Paganini's recording: "Two of Ecuador's most renowned classical musicians....Saade Scaff's violin ranges from sweet, singing passages to dancing pizzicato lines and electrifyingly brusque attacks....this is an especially appealing foray by two of the finest soloist of the Americas." AMERICAS MAGAZINE, Mark Holston. Organization of the American States, Washington DC, April 2004</p>
<p>"Saade-Scaff played with all the passion attributed to Latin music....the violinist is reminiscent of Paganini, who was rumored to have made a deal with the devil to acquire his skill with the violin. During Friday's performance, it was as if Saade-Scaff was channeling the spirit of Paganini, and he was playing to save his soul. In fact, he played so vehemently that he broke a string on the last note of the last piece he performed." Domenick P. Moore, "THE KEYSTONE" Kutztown University, Kutztow, Pennsylvania. April 2003.</p>
<p>About the Washington Symphony Orchestra Gala Concert: “An spectacular final addition to the evening was a virtuoso performance of the Vivalvi violin concerto by Ecuadorian violinist Jorge Saade-Scaff…” The Washington Times, Washington DC, April 2003.</p>
<p>“ … sometimes dazzling, at other times soulful interpretation…judging for his playing, with its highly developed technical and expressive acuity, as well as by his impressive verbal and musical communications skills, this artist clearly deserves the favorable attention he has received over the past two decades.” David Lasky, “WORCESTER TELEGRAM &amp;GAZETTE”, Worcester, Massachusetts, 2002</p>

<p>loned calves could signal drugs boost Cloned calves Both unique but exactly the same George (left) and Charlie (right) Researchers announced on Tuesday that they had successfully created two identical, genetically engineered calves, a step that could lead to the mass production of drugs for humans in cows' milk.</p>
<p>Three scientists responsible for cloned calf Calf cloners: Drs Steven Stice, James Robl and Jose Cibelli Named George and Charlie, the calves were created through a combination of cloning and genetic engineering by Dr James Robl at the University of Massachusetts and Dr Steven Stice of Advanced Cell Technology Inc.</p>
<p>The calves are not the first animal clones with altered genes - lambs Molly and Polly have a human gene expected to make them produce a protein helpful in blood clotting.</p>
<p>But even Dr Ian Wilmut, the Scottish researcher who genetically engineered the lambs and the now-famous cloned sheep Dolly, acknowledged that drug-making cows could be more valuable because they produce much more milk than sheep.</p>
<p>Researchers said the cows mark the most viable step so far toward "pharming" - developing pharmaceuticals using farm animals.</p>
<p>No surgery needed</p>
<p>Dr Robl said the technique his team used to clone the cows was a variation on the nuclear transfer process Dr Wilmut used last year to clone Dolly, the first mammal cloned from an adult cell.</p>
<p>Dolly the cloned sheep Dolly technology superseded But Dr Stice said unlike the method used with sheep, cloning the cows did not require surgery and it was relatively quick.</p>
<p>In nuclear transfer, scientists remove the nucleus from an egg and replace it with the nucleus from another cell.</p>
<p>The egg is then placed into the uterus of a surrogate mother that gives birth to an offspring that has only the genes of the original cell.</p>
<p>But the process can require at least two operations. The University of Massachusetts researchers said their genetically altered egg was grown in a laboratory, then inserted into the uterus without major surgery.</p>
<p>The calves were born last week at a ranch in Texas.</p>
<p>They contain two genetic alterations - a "marker" gene and one that made cells resistant to an antibiotic.</p>
<p>Those markers have shown up everywhere, from the blood to the spleen to the bones.</p>
<p>One of the researchers, Jose Bernardo Cibelli, said the team's technique takes cells that have already differentiated to produce a specific type of tissue - muscle, for example - and brings them back to the state where they can divide and form every type of cell in the body.</p>
<p>Dr Robl and Dr Stice say that process could lead to the ability to produce cells that can be transferred into humans to treat such diseases at Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>"The cells that we use are very easy to program, very easy to genetically alter," Dr Robl said.</p>
<p>Major development for "pharming"</p>
<p>Molly and Polly differ from Dolly in that they were cloned from the cell of a sheep fetus, not an adult animal.</p>
<p>Twins Molly and Polly Molly and Polly to be tested for factor IX The lambs were born in July and will be tested this spring to see if their milk produces useful quantities of factor IX, a protein that helps blood clot.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the factor IX could be extracted from the milk and used to treat patients with hemophilia, an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood lacks the ability to clot.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts researchers say they have pregnant cows carrying fetuses that have been altered to produce milk with the human serum albumin, a protein essential to the blood that is widely used by hospitals.</p>
<p>Advanced Cell Technology, the company founded by the researchers, already has a deal to produce albumin.</p>
<p>"We've taken a significant step toward making this commercially viable," Dr Robl said.</p>
<p>Neither the lambs nor the calves are absolute pioneers.</p>
<p>Other techniques have been used to reap drugs for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and heart attacks from the milk of genetically engineered sheep or goats.</p>
<p>These animals, however, were produced by injecting genes into a fertilized egg and then implanting the egg in a surrogate mother, a technique less efficient than cloning.</p>
<p>Scientists at the Embryo Transfer Society Conference, many of whom are researching animal cloning, said the arrival of George and Charlie has been much anticipated.</p>
<p>Society president Dr Caird Rexroad says "It's not Dolly but it's a substantial contribution, We've all been awaiting more information on what you can do with cattle. A cow can make a tremendous amount of protein."</p>

<p>Far from the city activities and crowd a young men was mending his dreams by setting interiors and supervising paint work and all that, his meager budget wasn’t a hindrance to embark on this new journey, he was full of dreams and energy he had to fulfill for his family and himself. Though a lot many times he was advised not to waste his earnings by establishing office so far away, he continued his wok, and started off in the early days of mid 70’s as an aspiring architect, through his sheer will and perseverance he proved everyone wrong that distance and locality can be a problem, Nayyar Ali Dada emerged as one of the finest and most sort after architects of Pakistan within few years, corporations, businessmen and government bodies lined up for him to get his attention to their projects, from a very humble family background nayyar made it big time and won accolades and benefited from the development work done in that era and onwards. One of the crucial edge Nayyar Dada earned was his adamant belief that one should realize the requirements of the region and must recognize that architecture is the reflection of personality, and culture in a broader sense, this philosophy was missing at that time of Pakistan, his idea of pushing mogul architecture which represents Islamic architecture considerably to promote his ideology caught attention. His master piece was his show of immense talent and worthiness of his beliefs which came into form as the Alhambra Arts Council Lahore in late 70’s, earned him Agha khan award for architecture in 1998. Nayyar Dada completed hundreds of other projects earning great repute, becoming the most prolific architects to date, none is comparable to him so far so Pakistan is concerned. Still at 60, Nayyar Dada is busy day night, invoking many new thought levels to young Pakistanis by delivering lectures on creativity, setting up Art cafes, and experimenting different forms of design and materials. Once a young aspiring architect went to him asking for advice on job and future prospects in architecture, he said “look man, leave aside architecture, whatever you want to do you can achieve it …just stand up and go out, don’t sit and think&#160;!..its all depends on your will and hard work!”</p>

<p>Gamma irradiation is the use of gamma rays from a radioactive source material to sterilise medical equipment and sometimes food.</p>
<p>As gamma rays are ionising radiation, they can kill living cells. In medicine, this is used to sterilise medical equipment. The item is packaged in an airtight bag, through which the radiation passes, killing micro-organisms inside the bag without damaging the equipment.</p>
<p>In food irradiation, the gamma rays kill micro-organisms in the food, ensuring that the foodstuff will not rot. However, this cannot prevent food poisoning as irradiation does not destroy the poisons produced by the bacteria. This is still not a widely-used procedure, due to popular concern over risks caused by consumption of irradiated food. The process does not, however, result in the food itself becoming radioactive or contaminated with radioactive material.</p>

<p>Global System of Trade Preferences</p>
<p><br />
The Agreement on the Global System of Trade Preferences Among Developing Countries (GSTP) was established in 1988 as a framework for the exchange of trade preferences among developing countries in order to promote intra-developing-country trade. The idea received its first political expression at the 1976 ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 (G77) in Mexico City and was further developed at G77 ministerial meetings in Arusha (1979) and Caracas (1981).</p>
<p>In 1982, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 in New York defined the basic components of the Agreement and established a framework for negotiations. In 1984, the G77 began preparatory work in Geneva on various aspects of a framework agreement. In 1985, the New Delhi ministerial meeting provided further impetus to the process of negotiations in Geneva. The ministerial meeting in Brasilia in 1986 established the provisional framework of the Agreement and launched the first round of negotiations on preferential trade concessions. In 1988, the text of the Agreement was adopted and the first round of negotiations concluded in Belgrade.</p>
<p>The Agreement was envisaged as a dynamic instrument of economic cooperation, proceeding with step-by-step negotiations in successive stages. Following a comprehensive review of the operations of the Agreement since its entry into force in 1989, the Committee of Participants recently decided to launch a new round of negotiations to broaden and deepen the scope of tariff preferences. Ministers of GSTP Participants met in São Paulo tonight, in the context of UNCTAD XI, to launch the new negotiations.</p>
<p>Following are several principles and features of the Agreement:</p>
<p>The GSTP is reserved for the exclusive participation of members of the Group of 77 and China and the benefits accrue to those members that are also "participants" in the Agreement. The GSTP must be based and applied on the principle of mutuality of advantages in such a way as to benefit equitably all participants, taking into account their respective levels of economic development and trade needs. The Agreement recognizes the special needs of the LDCs and envisages concrete preferential measures in their favour. To provide a stable basis for GSTP preferential trade, tariff preferences are bound and form part of the Agreement. The GSTP must be negotiated step-by-step and improved and extended in successive stages, with periodic reviews. The GSTP must supplement and reinforce present and future subregional, regional and interregional economic groupings of developing countries and must take into account their concerns and commitments. To date, 43 countries have ratified/acceded to the Agreement: Algeria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroon, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Ecuador, Egypt, Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Romania, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Tanzania, Venezuela, Viet Nam and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>UNCTAD services the Committee of Participants and provided technical and administrative assistance in setting up the GSTP.</p>

<p>Travis Tack was born in Chicago, in the fall of 1987. At the age of 6, he began attending an international school in London. Located on Abbey Road, the school turned out diverse and unique minds, from Members of the British Parliament and award winning authors to Steve-O from MTV's Jackass.</p>
<p>Once in school, Tack was quickly diagnosed with several learning disorders. Writing quickly became the focus of most of his energies. Travis Tack's formative years were spent floating between London and the states.</p>
<p>Tack grew up in Kensington and Notting Hill, spending summers in Martha's Vineyard, where his family has a house. For a short period of time, he was a member of the Gate Theatre's Young Writer's Program. Tack also records music under the name of "The Lifesize Canvas". However, one of the most influential moment in his life was the discovery of stand-up comedy. He has performed in various venues across the world, but began at the Comedy Studio in Boston's Harvard Square.</p>
<p>Travis has worked with Italian, horror film director, Mariano Baino. His main focus is writing and he recently completed a script for a short film called "Cells". He often works on projects with fellow writer, Carson Cole Arthur.</p>
<p>It's a little known fact, he once screwed up an order of food for the Kennedy family while working at a fish market. Jesse James is one of his ancestors and his great uncle, Vernon M. Geddy, was Mayor of Williamsburg, VA.</p>

<p>Snowboard Cross or Boarder Cross is a downhill race where four to six snowboarders simultaneously compete to cross the finish line first. The racers must pass through gates on a course which includes banked turns, table top jumps, chicanes and other obstacles. The high speeds, number of riders, and technical ability required make this a dangerous and dramatic event. Early heats of the boarder cross usually include more riders (up to six), while finals usually race four competitors. Some contest include a losers bracket, the winner of which may advance to the finals. The top three, or two in contests with fewer entries, move onto the next heat.</p>

<p>In the early eighties rallying had a much different pace than it does today. A new catagory called Group B was created in 1983. It was intended for manufacturer's to show of thier engineering talents with little restrictions on design. Most of these cars saw 500 or more horsepower which was far faster than modern day WRC cars and with fewer of the modern refinements present on todays WRC cars. The main requirement of Group B was 200 homologated road-going examples. Tweaked evolution versions only required twenty cars. This made Group B cars increase performance and speed at a rapid pace. Soon wings would be neccessary to keep the cars on the track.</p>
<p>First on the scene was Audi which introducted four-wheel-drive to the rally scene with the Quattro. Audi dominated the Group B scene from early on. The Quatro was joined by other Group B cars such as the Lancia 037.It was not until 1984, that the Audi and similar front-engined cars would face a new challenge. Peugeot. The 1984 Tour de Course saw the debut of the Peugeot 205 T16. This new design practically rendered the Audi and similar designs obsolete. It was a small lightweight car that focused on a mid-engined design.</p>
<p>Under the direction of Jean Todt, the Peugeot 205 T16 became the new king of the hill. After a successfull introductory season, Peugeot took the 1985 and 1986 Manufacturers' title. Among the competition was the Lancia Delta S4, Ford RS200, Austin-Metro 6R4 and the Audi Quatro S1.</p>
<p>Ari Vatanen drove very successfully for Peugeot (not only in the 205 Turbo 16, but also the 405 T16 and others) and watching in cockpit video of him in action in the 205 Turbo 16 is an awesome sight - dont forget this was a small car with over 400 horsepower at the wheels!</p>
<p>Group B racing came to an end in 1986 with an unfortunate accident involving an Delta S4. Sadly, Lancia lead driver, Henri Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto, were killed in a high-speed accident while racing. Group B was instally cancelled for the 1987 season. After Group Bs cancellation, Peugeot used much of their experince developing the 205 T16 for the Paris-Dakar Rally</p>
