<li>Coming in 8th in an archery event at the Olympics in 2004 would give a person a claim to being the 8th-best archer in the world. Coming in 8th in an archery event at the Olympics in 1900 meant that he was the 8th-best archer who happened to be at the Paris World's Fair that day. The <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900_Summer_Olympics_98eb.html" title="1900 Summer Olympics">1900 Summer Olympics</a> were not contested at the same level of competition as contemporary Olympics, as suggested by the fact that contemporary sportswriters failed to keep track of the subject's given name.

<li><b>Keep</b> all Olympians. Participation in the Olympic Games is certainly sufficient for notability. As for the "fact that contemporary sportswriters failed to keep track of the subject's given name", please note that all Olympic Reports until 1964 similarly "failed".

<li><b>Comment</b>. The official Olympic reports included athletes' first names well before 1964; see <a href="http://www.aafla.org/5va/reports_frmst.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aafla.org/5va/reports_frmst.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> for examples. Note that the 1960 Summer Olympics report devoted over 200 pages to a list of every athlete participating in the Games, including their full names, dates of birth, places of birth, heights, and weights, none of which are known in the case of <a href="../../../l/e/c/Lecomte.html" title="Lecomte">Lecomte</a>. Furthermore, even if an athlete's full name had not been printed in the official report, his or her full name would be known if they had accomplished something of merit -- it's not as though sports historians are wondering, "I wonder who this <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Ewry_b5e2.html" title="Ray Ewry">Ewry</a> is, who won 3 gold medals at Paris 1900?" They <i>know</i> who <i>he</i> is. I guess I'm much in the minority here, but I do not think that merely competing in the 1900 Olympics is an accomplishment comparable to competing in the contemporary Olympics in the 21st century, since the idea of having to qualify for one's national team was a minor aspect or nonexistent in 1900. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:51, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Abstain</b>. I think we might be a little hasty here. I've gotten a decent amount of google hits, some of which are from Russian web portals I've heard of, as well as places selling or reviewing his works. Now mind you, he does appear to be a shameless self-promoter, as I'm also seeing hits of him on entirely unrelated things. Mind you, however that any hits from modern Georgian culture do *not* google well at all due to language/script/unicode issues. He seems to me to be a low-to-mid-level author; his books are still in print and seem to be moderately available, his radio plays also seem notable. There's also the issue of his Georgian Medal of Honour. His website notes that it was translated from Georgian by a professional(!) translator, which would make it seem that his command of English is shaky, at best. -<a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Tim Rhymeless</a> <a href="../../../r/h/y/User_talk%7ERhymeless_4dd3.html" title="User talk:Rhymeless">(Er...let's shimmy)</a> 09:45, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If final consensus is to <b>merge</b> DO NOT merge with <b>radiocarbon dating</b>. It doesn't belong there. What's missing there is a section on chemical pretreatment of samples to be dated since that's a source of misunderstanding. A radiocarbon date is as good as the dated material. If it has been contaminated by old or young carbon, the date does not represent the historical or geological event ascribed to the sample. What it would be useful is to include, in all dating articles, clear statements about the difference between the dates of minerals in rocks vs the dates of geomorphological formations composed of the same rocks. <a href="../../../j/c/l/User%7EJclerman_3d71.html" title="User:Jclerman">Jclerman</a> 10:25, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. <i>I'm</i> not a meatpuppet, and I think we should toss that accusation around less casually.

These are historically important sites for the web, and I think they deserve keeping on those grounds—otherwise, as sites slip into the past, we'll be deleting our communal memory too.

<dd>Perhaps you should add my name to the list as well, since this page was brought to my attention through a discussion concerning the deletion. Of course, since <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> does not know me, nor zompist or notmydesk, personally, the accusation of script-use is pretty serious especially when it can be easily disproven. Having an active community, especially consisting of people who have their own extensive entries in Wikipedia, should not count as evidence of untoward behavior, but actually gives credence to the argument that the site does in fact hold relevance. I find it even more ironic that two people involved in this discussion are people who at one point or another had personal run-ins with spinn, yet one of them wrote the article and the other voted for the original deletion. Personally, I see this article not necessarily simply falling under web content, but rather a description of the history of an influential and active home site of an active, influential web personality. While spinn may be no Lawrence Lessig in his Alexa ratings or Technorati listing, his influence on many other personalities like Lore Sjoberg, Zompist, and notmydesk should not be discounted. Maybe it should just be rewritten to be about him instead of referencing his through his home website. --Leth</dd>
<dd>I'd consider "meat-puppetry" as untoward, if I understand the term. I'm interpreting it as your being under the impression I'm just telling my friends to post in the article's defense. It's especially ironic, since Schumin is specifically <i>not</i> a friend, given the amount of abuse I've heaped on him in the past. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinn_39bd.html" title="User:Spinn">Spinn</a> 05:13, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The original Afd was rushed through on 5 delete votes (including Elkman who, though having a perfect right to vote, did not disclose his personal interest), and was based on a misstatement (that Spinn wrote the Wikipedia article). This is not a shining moment in Wikipedia consensus. Instead of defending this rush job, calling names, and relying on inappropriate criteria, I'd love to see the Delete people acting like encyclopedia editors and making an actual case.<a href="../../../z/o/m/User%7EZompist_e93c.html" title="User:Zompist">Zompist</a> 05:06, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I'm obviously a bit biased, but I think my logic is sound. For each point:
<ul>
<li><i>Criteria for inclusion.</i> It meets #1 of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Discussion should really be over at this point. I don't understand why it isn't. (By the way, Bobby1011 said it meets #3 as well, but to my knowledge it doesn't.) Yes, it's because of the <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysfunctional_Family_Circus_6214.html" title="Dysfunctional Family Circus">Dysfunctional Family Circus</a>, but the articles and interviews aren't about the DFC concept in general, but the SpinnWebe version. When asked in an online chat about "internet parodies", Bil Keane talked about the SpinnWebe version specifically. These are not simple site listings or trivial coverage. These were people from Associated Press and <i>Wired</i> calling me and asking me for quotes. And yes, that's SW's one claim to fame, but there's no requirement that all aspects of the web site be publicized to confer notability.</li>
<li><i>Alexa ranking.</i> Immaterial. Alexa is a research tool, it's not a stated standard for inclusion in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. It's a means to determine if it meets the guidelines, but it doesn't matter, the previous point already established it. Besides, what about ground-breaking web sites that no longer exist? They have an Alexa ranking of nothing, should we delete those, too? What's <a href="../../../x/o/o/XOOM_2df0.html" title="XOOM">XOOM</a>'s Alexa rating? What's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Spot_15a4.html" title="The Spot">The Spot</a>'s Alexa rating?</li>
<li><i>Speedy deletion</i>. Yes, the article was deleted, and I understand that. As it stood, a neutral third party could not immediately see the article met <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Yes, it was reinstated with identical information--it probably shouldn't have been. However, having been alerted to the issue, I added the detail that brought it under inclusion guidelines. This is all in line with <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#If_you_disagree_with_the_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Guide to deletion: If you disagree with the consensus</a> (third paragraph). This article is no longer a candidate for speedy deletion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So, yes, the site is a shadow of its former glory. But Wikipedia is not a popularity contest. It <i>had</i> glory, with ample (and provided) evidence to support it, and thus clearly meets Wikipedia inclusion criteria. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinn_39bd.html" title="User:Spinn">Spinn</a> 05:26, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - per Spinn above, and if you don't think he's a fair witness, pretend I said it. The site was highly notable in my rememberance of the web nearly 10 years ago (my god it's been that long). If notability is measured substantially against current Alexa rankings and other subjective and moving criteria, then every site will eventually be NN and deletable (save a lot of disk space.).

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This page was already listed for deletion, the vote was to delete. The webmaster (Spinn) and others associated with the site rallied people to recreate the article (see the number of blank red lines voting in the speedy delete page and this guy apparently just registered to vote in that page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:TreyVanRiper&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:TreyVanRiper&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>).

I put a speedy delete template and that as well was removed by <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">User:Schuminweb</a> (as Ruby pointed out, that user also participated in Vote Stacking and many of those voting keep here got his messages see his page history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Schuminweb" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Schuminweb" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

I did not want to have a revert war so I just left it like that and advised the admin who closed the previous afd about the situation. They also rallied around another page I put up for afd (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mirsky%27s_Worst_of_the_Web_9dd8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mirsky's Worst of the Web">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mirsky's Worst of the Web</a>) and <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotmydesk_b639.html" title="User:Notmydesk">User:Notmydesk</a> made a snide remark "kids these days..." along with a remark by <a href="../../../z/o/m/User%7EZompist_e93c.html" title="User:Zompist">User:Zompist</a> "According to your user page, you were eight years old when Mirsky created his page. You don't know what was notable then" (by the way, that user put up his own site in another Wikipedia page <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zompist.com.html" title="Zompist.com">Zompist.com</a>). Wikipedia is not for ads for websites and trying to break with wikipedia policy to perserve this article is ludicrous. With regards to DFS, even the article itself states that the website did not create DFS.

<li>You're not helping your case by mistating things that are easily checked. I didn't create (or in any way affect) the article about my site. And of course it’s no coincidence that people will look at other Afds you are doing. I have nothing to do with Mirsky’s. The comment about your age is a reminder that many of us were around on the web in that period, when you could have no personal experience of what was notable or not. Do you have some other reason that your opinion about the noteworthiness of 1995 websites is worth listening to? As for Spinnwebe's notability, see my points above. <a href="../../../z/o/m/User%7EZompist_e93c.html" title="User:Zompist">Zompist</a> 08:33, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>First of all, if you're going to argue about whether or not to take down a page, shouldn't you argue based on the merits of the page itself, and less on the people placing votes, or resurrecting a page? You're guilty of argument ad hominem, an obvious logical fallacy. Secondly, I take offense that you claimed I joined Wikipedia only to vote to keep Spinnwebe. You might have noticed <a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETreyVanRiper_7a6d.html" title="User talk:TreyVanRiper">my talk page</a> where someone thanked me for my participation in a discussion regarding Citadel BBSes. I only recently created my user page because, frankly, I'm relatively new to the Wikipedia, and frankly, I didn't really want to create my own home page originally, because I don't really think I'm all that important. - <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyVanRiper_bafb.html" title="User:TreyVanRiper">TreyVanRiper</a> 13:56, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>JD, perhaps the reason people "rallied" against your suggested deletion of Mirsky's page is that you were off-base in suggesting it be deleted, based as it was on a simple counting of yahoo hits and not taking into account anything regarding the history and notability of the site itself -- much as you're doing with spinn's page. And, frankly, if you're going to take me to task for me "snidely" saying "kids these days..." you might want to take a number of others here to task for snidely calling myself and others "meat-puppets."--<a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotmydesk_b639.html" title="User:Notmydesk">Notmydesk</a> 16:05, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's a shame, I could recreate all this fairly easily, but I think it's bad form if I do it myself.". So it is infact confirmed that they just c&amp;ped back the same old page that was deleted (many sites make copies of old wikipedia pages).

<li><b>Comment</b>. I won't keep commenting here, but I do want to note a few things: (a) I can't speak for anyone else I resent the implication that I'm here because Schumin "recruited" me. I have zero interest or involvement in SpinnWebe; I read AfD and comment where I have something to contribute—I didn't see Schumin's note until after I commented here. But informing people who have spoken up in a debate that it's continuing in another forum <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">could be seen</a> as a courtesy instead of a conspiracy. (b) Wikipedians have a right to comment, even if they have some involvement in the issue being discussed. Please note that the alleged meatpuppets actually made arguments and didn't just do the usual newbie "<b>Dont Delete our Board you fuckers!</b>" kind of nonsense we often see on AfD. (c) The Mirsky nom is a separate issue, but "kids these days" sounds funny rather than snide to me. Maybe you have to be old to get it. (d) Most importantly, if you read the page JerseyDevil so triumphantly adduces, instead of just his cherrypicked examples, in my opinion you'll see Spinn working fairly respectfully <i>within</i> the Wikipedia process to get his page reinstated. To hold up that page as some kind of evidence of bad faith is just not appropriate. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 13:10, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, I had no idea that Schumin has attempted to 'recruit' me. Frankly, this is argumentum ad hominem, and shouldn't influence one's vote. There's a difficult problem here; Wikipedia would want to avoid having a bunch of fanboys jumping on the bandwagon and defending the honor of some po-dunk nothing web site that some idiot posted, but doesn't really belong on the Wikipedia. On the other hand, I would think that the Wikipedia would want to know about an influential web site from the early days, and would want people who are informed about that site (who, most likely, would be that site's fans) to provide credible information about it. This is why I urgently ask the voters to consider the merits of the page based on the page's merits, and not the merits of the people voting for it. Otherwise, you risk turning the Wikipedia into something less than useful. -- <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyVanRiper_bafb.html" title="User:TreyVanRiper">TreyVanRiper</a> 14:38, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Delete</b> or <b>Speedy Delete</b>. Hey, I <i>wrote</i> the original article (actually, expanded it from a stub). It was a decent article on a marginal-but-probably-acceptable web site. I voted to keep it on the original AfD, which was not heavily populated -- 4-1 against, IIRC, including the nominator. I think its too bad it was deleted. BUT. It was deleted properly in-process, and I think we need to respect that. Whether AfD might need reform (e.g., at least <i>n</i> total responses are required, where <i>n</i>=8 or whatever) is an interesting question but not germane to to <i>this</i> case. We need to stand by the principle of <i>stare decicis</i> or we'll never get anything done. In fact, per the nominator, I don't think this should even be here. <i><b>It is NOT acceptable for Wikipedia to be bullied into revoking a properly placed speedy by out-of-process deletion of properly formed and placed speedy tags</b></i>, period. The only correct recourse is <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> (although technically that is only for correction of out-of-process deletions, and this deletion was done properly).

<li><b>Comment</b> It's true, I think, that the page was legally deleted. But at least one or two of the delete votes were ill-informed, and some folks knowlegeable about the subject had no idea that there was a vote for its deletion until sometime after the vote had finished. Suppose, for example, that a group of people on Wikipedia decided to choose some obscure topic (e.g. Fugue, the musical form), set up a vote for its deletion, and cause the page to get removed. Because few people knowing anything about Fugues would have noticed, the page would get deleted, perhaps for no good reason. Then, if someone said, "Wait a tic... that isn't right..." and put the page back up, would you still feel that it should remain deleted? - <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyVanRiper_bafb.html" title="User:TreyVanRiper">TreyVanRiper</a> 14:28, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just to play devil's advocate for a moment (since I'm not arguing deletion based on traffic rankings etc); your argument is apples and oranges. Avril Lavigne warrents an article regardless of Alexa rankings (et al) because she is notable independant of her website (and would be considered under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

If SpinnWebe were an entity outside of a website, you could apply criteria to that entity that were completely independent of web rankings and other criteria that are traditionally applied to websites. Your point about applying current Alexa rankings in the context of a discussion about the historical value of a site has some validity though, but in that case I would recommend better demonstrating the historical context and value of SpinnWebe in the article.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:44, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I just mean the one that was c&amp;ped, before you made the new changes. The references make the article look better, the Wired article mentions you and the site but solely in the context of the DFC. It seems that the only notablity that the website really has is regarding the DFC, so why not just merge this article with the DFC article? Or just make Spinnwebe redirect to the DFC page as it already has a lot of info about Spinnwebe's relationship with it. Also, it would help the argument to have a link to the New Yorker piece (though, I understand that since it was created so long ago it would be difficult to find). Simply stating that it was cited in the New Yorker doesn't help because we can not verify it.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 20:23, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>"the one...before you made the new changes."</i> Then you are arguing a previous version should be deleted, not the current one. Even if I find my old copy of this magazine, I am at a loss how I can present it to you, since scanning it and uploading it to Wikipedia would most probably violate copyright. I (and others) tell you it is there, and <i>if you assume bad faith</i>, then yes, you can't accept it as a reference. Even if I scanned it and mailed it to you personally to satisfy your doubt, then the reference would still hold the same weight for another editor two years from now. I am not sure, then, how any printed, offline material can be taken as a reference. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinn_39bd.html" title="User:Spinn">Spinn</a> 20:45, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The New Yorker is readily available on a complete DVD set; I have it, and checked the issue in question. It's a short article; but 1. it's the New Yorker, man; how much coverage has <i>Wikipedia</i> gotten in the New Yorker? 2. it's not like it's one entry in a long list; the magazine at that time singled out one website every two weeks for notice. In effect, it's a judgment that it's one of the two dozen notable websites for that year. <a href="../../../z/o/m/User%7EZompist_e93c.html" title="User:Zompist">Zompist</a> 22:05, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Cdcon got it exactly right. As I stated, the Wired article mentions Spinnwebe solely in the context of the DFC. The role of Spinnwebe on DFC is already mentioned in the DFC article. On it's own merits, Spinnwebe alone does not warrant an article.

<p>I'll propose this as a possible way forward here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone calm down&#160;:)</li>
<li>We acknowledge that process was, if not outright violated, at least a little bit bent by the recreation of the article</li>
<li>We acknowledge that there is at least an <i>argument</i> to be made for the notability of this site</li>
<li>The article be deleted without prejudice, and that interested parties be allowed to create a spanky new article (or merge the information into the DFS article if they choose)</li>
<li>If the article is recreated, it should be judged on its own merits and not on the history of the current article or the personalities involved</li>
</ol>
<p>Does that seem feasible? That way the process is respected, but separated from concerns about the encyclopedicity of the information. I realize it's a pain in the ass for those who don't think it should have been nominated in the first place, but it's an attempt to find some common ground. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 16:28, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Spinn's concern but I don't think it's reason to resist. Rodii has accurately noticed that the complaint of the deletionists is primarily "abuse of process" (AfD double-jeopardy, Meatpuppets, etc.); very few have made arguments against its notability. This needs a substantially clean slate. I don't usually hang out at AfD but when I saw this article and deletion debate mentioned on some user page it brought me to the realization that Wikipedia fails to impart much of the richness of the early history of the Web, which I think is a form of <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">systemic bias</a> based on the fact that web content is so ephemeral (and possibly the rise of a younger userbase, which is making me feel old). IMHO DFC, 1-900-ZWEBLÖ and IADL were some of the earliest examples of participatory humorous sites in the vein of <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.html" title="Fark">Fark</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/m/SomethingAwful_0538.html" title="SomethingAwful">SomethingAwful</a>, etc. SpinnWebe is right there in my own memory with <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Hall_5b6f.html" title="Justin Hall">Justin Hall</a>'s links.net. (And I'm also amazed to find that so little is written in that article on the "founding father of personal blogging".) As such, Spinn - I think if you check your notes and ask some of your oldest fans to reminisce a bit I think we can find some additional facts and citations which can accurately portray the historicity and notability of this site in a new article. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 18:29, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmm. Interesting case. Several people, from Jimbo on down, have noted at times that AfD has problems, and this case is a good a example. It is, however, understandable. There is a <i>lot</i> of Wikipedia:vanispamcruftisment produced every day, and people are busy. I second the suggestion the simply delete without prejudice and <i>list on deletion review</i>. Yes that's a pain in the butt and seems like beauracratic niggling. But the thing is, precedent. There are <i>lots</i> of entries of the my web site/my 8-person company/my and my buddies garage band/our 6-member games forum/my boyfriend etc. variety deleted <i>every single day</i>. The last thing anyone wants is for anyone to get the idea that they have some basis for recreating these without going thru deletion review because, hey, SpinnWebe. There is a marginal but valid case for taking this to deletion review. In fact, why wait -- why don't you take the <i>original</i> article to deletion review <i>now</i>? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 14:09, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because deletion review is for procedural errors in deletion, and I don't see any. It was originally deleted according to Wikipedia procedure, and again, it was reinstated according to <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#If_you_disagree_with_the_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia procedure</a>.</dd>
<dd>I see no risk of creating precedent, either. If My And My Buddies Garage Band was deleted, and then later reinstated with references to its <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a> review, then I see no problem with that. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinn_39bd.html" title="User:Spinn">Spinn</a> 15:45, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, see my comments above. Leth</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Changing my vote to Keep.
<ol>
<li>OK OK OK. This <i>was</i> deleted in-process but I think that it would be valid to list on deletion review, on the grounds that <i>none of the delete votes refuted or even made reference to the Keep arguments</i>, and the Delete <i>arguments</i> consisted mainly of "non-notable, delete". Remember, <i>AfD is <b>not a vote</b>, it is supposed to be a discussion</i>, and the Keep side "won" the discussion, therefore a case could be made that the closing admin erred in not relisting or keeping the AfD open. Even if one holds that only the votes made after the Keep side had completed its arguments could be expected to address those arguments, that brings the "vote" down to 3-1 against at best (including the nominator), and it could be argued that that is not a quorum.</li>
<li>If this were to be listed on deletion review, I think the "keep" arguments would win the day, as (IMO) they have done here. So why go through all that -- let's just consider this thread to be a deletion review, and let the closing admin treat it as such.</li>
<li>OK, yes, the article <i>was</i> deleted in-process (marginally), and yes the speedy-delete tags <i>shouldn't</i> have been removed, and yes this discussion <i>should</i> be taking place at deletion review, and yes this <i>would</i> be a bad precedent. But let's not be total process geeks here, the bottom line is that the article was deleted too quickly more-or-less by mistake and should be kept. As to setting precedent, people are not gonna remember this thread a week from now let alone point to it as a precedent. I think that <i><b>just this once</b></i> it would make sense to make an exception.

<dd><i>The "Nipple Server" sounds like something that should be banned by the Communications Decency Act, but this curious exercise in Web creativity is much weirder than anything our congressbeings could imagine. Every weekday morning, page author Greg Galcik has been aiming a Casio digital camera at his left breast, firing and uploading the image to his site. Viewers are then requested to rate the day's specimen from 0 to 10 on "Color," "Perkiness," "Panache" and the vague category "Overall nipplish quality." (Fortunately -- or unfortunately -- there's nothing that special to see. No wacky piercings or anything.) Galcik explained earlier this year that the site's no big deal to his parents or his wife, as "they know what kind of weirdo I am."</i></dd>

<dd><i>"Family Circus" creator Bil Keane is worried about a less-than- wholesome parody of his kid-friendly comic on the Web. Keane said last week he was mildly amused by the "Dysfunctional Family Circus" when it began five years ago, but then his readers started to complain. The Web site - SpinnWebe, maintained by Greg Galcik - uses Keane's cartoons while allowing site visitors to make up the captions. The results are often sarcastic or dark humor and, predictably, sometimes obscene and pornographic, Keane said. King Features, which syndicates Keane's comic, and Keane's attorney sent Galcik a letter last week threatening legal action unless he removed references to Keane's work.</i></dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Completely unsourced and thus not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. The statement that these particular phrases are not technical terms but are designed to "distinguish the insider from the neophyte," currently rests entirely on the authority of the article's editors. Because it is unsourced, it is difficult for the reader to verify which entries are accurate. For example, I say that "back-of-the-envelope" is an example of an inaccurate entry; it is used by physicists and engineers, not mathematicians. But since no source is given, you have no way to judge whether I, or the article, is the more trustworthy. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:49, 23 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see how a claim's being unsourced implies that it is unverifiable. It seems to me that missing sources are a ground for <i>improving</i> the article (e.g. by adding sources), not deleting it. Claims like "mathematicians use <i>iff</i> to mean <i>if and only if</i>" are easily verifiable, even if they are not currently sourced. Moreover, some things are so easily verifiable that it seems downright silly to source them. For example, if I state in an article that Washington D.C. is the capital of the U.S., do I really need to provide a source for this claim? In short, it seems that there may be a risk of being over-vigilant about <s>verifiability</s> requiring claims to be sourced, to the point of actually decreasing the quality of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/b/t/User%7EDbtfz_4176.html" title="User:Dbtfz"><font color="maroon">dbtfz</font></a><a href="../../../d/b/t/User_talk%7EDbtfz_3ffd.html" title="User talk:Dbtfz"><sup><font color="slategray">talk</font></sup></a> 19:22, 23 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Corrected my own words: I don't think we can be over-vigilant about verifiability, properly understood. <a href="../../../d/b/t/User%7EDbtfz_4176.html" title="User:Dbtfz"><font color="maroon">dbtfz</font></a><a href="../../../d/b/t/User_talk%7EDbtfz_3ffd.html" title="User talk:Dbtfz"><sup><font color="slategray">talk</font></sup></a> 20:38, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy says "This means that we only publish material that is verifiable with reference to reliable, published sources." It is the <i>source</i> that is verifiable, not the truth of the claim. The policy says "Editors adding new material to an article should cite a reputable source." Obviously if you have not cited any source at all, then you have not cited a reputable source.
<ul>
<li>You should sign your comments. The verifiability policy is also clearly not talking about jargon, but about "facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments", which do not include jargon. There exists a style guide encouraging definitions of jargon terms, as I mention below, and pretty clearly implies that the jargon is considered as auxiliary to the main encyclopedic content. If you like, you may think of this page as the collection of all explanations that would otherwise have to be inserted parenthetically into all the other math articles when these terms, which only mathematicians understand, are used. And if they were inserted there I doubt you would ask for them to be sourced. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 07:00, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The verifiability of this article, which concerns a topic of broad, common knowledge to those for whom its subject is interesting or useful, is in the assent of its readers to the claims it makes. For such topics a source is unlikely to be found, yet the verifiability of common knowledge is not in doubt (as long as it is presented by a member of the group to which it is common). Using the same principle you invoke, one could argue that no clarification of documented fact is acceptable in the encyclopedia. This page documents clarifications of terms that can be found in virtually every mathematical document published in the last century (in English, anyway). It is a reference, not an opinion piece. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 01:42, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

Where does it say that anything in Wikipedia can stand solely on the authority of its contributors?

<li>Since you ask, it states in <a href="../../../e/x/p/Wikipedia%7EExplain_jargon_88b6.html" title="Wikipedia:Explain jargon">Wikipedia:Explain jargon</a> that we should do just that: explain jargon. It does not mention the necessity of rigorously citing sources for the jargon, and I interpret this to mean that the intention of the policy is to encourage authors to define terms which are not standard English but which are standard in the context they are used, according to the authors' understanding of the usage. In fact, it encourages the creation of an article such as this one. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 06:54, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

The problem seems to be with WINAD itself, which needs further explanation.

<li><b>Comment</b> As a non-fan of baseball and looking at the two articles, could baseball jargon and baseball slang not be combined? There seems to be little to differentiate the two at the moment. I think that this article discusses the effects of baseball jargon on American English - and through the mass media on other forms of English too - so perhaps if they can't be combined this could be <b>cleaned up</b> to make clear that is isn't discussing baseball as such. <a href="../../../%28/a/e/User%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User:(aeropagitica)"><font style="background: #800080" face="Ariel" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;(aeropagitica)&#160;</b></font></a> 07:41, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I reached this decision by noting that all of the KEEP votes, with the exception of the first, were made by users with accounts that were either less than 2 weeks old or appear to have only been used recently in edits related to this discussion. Anybody that's a member of a group would logically try to prevent this article from being deleted, but after looking through the article myself, while it's a VERY well-written article that you should all be proud of (it's better than 99% of the schlock that gets fed through AFD), it's unfortunately not notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/o/0/User%7EMo0_25cf.html" title="User:Mo0">Mo0</a>[<a href="../../../m/o/0/User_talk%7EMo0_eb76.html" title="User talk:Mo0">talk</a>] 22:42, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Understandable arguments, but being one of the main people who created this, I have to agree to keep it, no offense intended. Elite Roleplaying itself is a large RPG group with 3 divisions and a defined governmental system. It may seem minor, but it has been involved in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_Voyager_Elite_Force_7248.html" title="Star Trek Voyager Elite Force">Star Trek Voyager Elite Force</a> community (and the Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy community, but not for so long) and has gained quite a history with a great amount of members (probably around 200+). Now, look at an article like Bravo Fleet. Bravo Fleet is a Star Trek SIM group, just as ERP is except with the inclusion of in-game RPG and a Star Wars division. We have and have had a large member database just as Bravo Fleet, and there is even more valid information that can be included in the ERP article than the Bravo Fleet article. The Elite Roleplaying article isn't small but very detailed with some very interesting information on a group that has been active for about 5 years. While creating this article, I also avoided the use of personal POV, I respect neutrality in articles. I also greatly contemplated whether this article would be nominated for deletion, as it is being done right now. I made this in a way to avoid being an advertisement, but to be informative and interesting, I even had assistance by a great number of people in retrieving proper information to make sure all was complete. If Bravo Fleet can be kept, I think Elite Roleplaying should be kept. If this article is deleted, then the Bravo Fleet article should be discussed as well.

<li><b>Comment</b> - A poll was already done for the deletion of the Bravo Fleet article, a non-consensus was declared. Many of the arguments that contributed to it are most likely what is involved in the decisions for the deletion of this article. As another note of 'interest' per se, this article was not meant for advertisement. We (the group) felt that we had an adequete amount of valid information that could be added to Wikipedia. Elite Roleplaying isn't just 'another Star Trek clan', we distinguished ourselves in our communitys (we aren't even a clan actually) and were able to grow due to a successful and dedicated memberbase. Even as we speak, further expansion plans are being created. Elite Roleplaying isn't just a 'Star Trek clan'. - <a href="../../../e/n/z/User%7EEnzo_Aquarius_7bb4.html" title="User:Enzo Aquarius">Enzo Aquarius</a> 13:11, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - It seems fairly obvious that this organisation is large enough and with a rich history in the development of roleplaying (especially given links with Destiny's Wind "ERP's Sister Star Trek Project.")to dispute the initial reason given for deletion. A non-notable gaming community? The sister project of Destiny's Wind? I'm afraid that the initial reason given is in no way justified. There is nothing to support such an arguement. - <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelios-LithiumUK_18e7.html" title="User:Helios-LithiumUK">Helios</a> 18:36, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't see why it should be deleted? The article refrains from PoV's, it adheres to a strict non-advertising and purely informative stance. It is in no way being used as a 'personal webspace'. Elite Roleplaying is an organisation that has been around a long time and has a large and rich history with regards to Elite Force Roleplaying and the sister project of Destiny's Wind. Why should it be deleted? All you have done is compared it to a fairly irrelevant example. Please can you give something more direct? Does it break any particular rule? Does it act in a manner that it deserved to be deleted? The non-notable tag really can't be justified in this particular situation.

<li><b>Keep</b> ERP Was the forerunner to a very popular trend of gaming within the Elite Force community, and many of its ideals and practices have spread to others, ERP Is not using wikipedia to advertise itself, The article is a very well drawn up and informative peice of information concerning a large part of the history within the elite force community. ERP is not a clan, it is a group of people who started out with one goal, and acheived it. The wiki article is not an advert, and is not harmful In any way that I can understand. What saddens me most is I beleive the issue was drawn to your attention by someone who is not concerned for the integrity of wikipedia, but by someone who outlawed themself from the ERP community by causing major disruptions, and I personally beleive that this is more of an act of revenge than concern for the misuse of wikipedia webspace. The article is Completely factual, and very well constructed, There are many outside of the ERP community who could speak for its integrity, and recognise what it has acheived over the years. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerrick7891_4faa.html" title="User:Merrick7891">Merrick</a></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - We strive to have an enjoyable experience with our peers and colleagues in a roleplaying environment, it's not about greatness but about working with great people. We work together well in our community, and this article also reflects that, we got together to make an article on a topic we felt was valid for Wikipedia, we did not use personal bias, we did not make an advertisement article and we made it very informative. There are also a number of edits by those that aren't even Elite Roleplaying with no complaints from them.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Ok, I'll list and rebut the sections I believe it is felt that the article fails on. <i>Self-promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006 that: "Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so."</i> I don't believe this is breached, as the article maintains NPOV throughout. <i>Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small "garage" companies are not likely to be acceptable.</i> Again, as far as I can see, the article is indeed written in the aforementioned objective, unbiased style, and therefore does not breach this, either. ERP is also verifiable by most of the RPG community of Elite Force and Jedi Academy. As such, I believe it should be kept. -- Berle</li>

<li>First, I'm on board with not using Alexa rank of 880K as evidence of anything other than how worthless Alexa can be as a sole judgement criteria at times. That said.... Being aggregated by <a href="../../../a/9/_/A9.html" title="A9">A9</a> doesn't in itself confer notability I don't think, under a reasonable interpretation of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. (Do all 299 other sites have articles here? Do they defend notability using that criterion alone?) I agree that a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilawyering_a5b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilawyering">wikilawyering</a> interpretation might, by some major stretching, confer it, but we should do what is reasonable. I'd like to see some other evidence of notability such as citations by other clearly notable sites, writeups in published material, researchers citing it, or at least something more than 4 pages of hits in Google (I may not have searched effectively, it is true) before I'd change my comment from <b>delete</b>, but for now, that's what it is. <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 00:02, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm well aware of what the current guidelines say, but thanks for repeating them for the benefit of others. There are two counters to them in this case, in my view.
<ul>
<li>First: These are <b>guidelines</b>, not rules. A site that does not meet any of them can nevertheless be found notable, and a site that some claim meets all of them can nevertheless be found not notable. That is, meeting them is not a free pass, it's a guide to how to proceed in deciding what to do.</li>
<li>Second: In my view the problem is with what "distributed" means in this context. I think most people would agree that, for example, Google does not "distribute" the sites you can look up there... it merely lets you find them. Yet, it fits the above definition with some stretching. Even the Google news pages aren't making the sites they find stories from notable merely by making the stories findable. We have debated other aggregators before, such as <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a>'s keenspace, and the conclusion has been in the past that merely being syndicated or distributed by keenspace is not sufficient to make a site (webcomic in that case) notable. With 300 sites aggregated by A9, it will take some convincing to show that is not the case here. Yes, A9 is well known and independent of the site (and notable!), but that's not relevant to whether its notability is transitive to this site.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, if this site truly <b>is</b> notable, it will be easy to find other evidence of it, evidence such as I and others outlined, citations by others, influences, references, writeups, articles, and so forth. The fact that you repeatedly cite the WEB guidelines (here and on talk pages elsewhere), instead of doing that, is why I feel it gives the appearance of wikilawyering, which will tend to leave a bad impression with others popping in here to express their opinions. You'd much rather they came in here, got interested in whether the article is or isn't notable, found some other reason to dig around, and enhanced the article or this debate with additional information and notability instead of concluding that your apparent wikilawyering is proof of non notability (by someone looking for adverts or to increase notability by USING wikipedia to enhance inward links... not saying that's you but we see that a lot), and moved on. IMHO anyway. So, consider finding those other evidences and I will be falling all over myself to change my current feeling, as I am <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/inclusionist" class="extiw" title="m:inclusionist">inclusionist</a>!!! I hope that helps.

<li><b>NOT Delete</b>. This article is undergoing continual updates by the author as research continues. The author has responded to one of the commentators because of the availability of a talkpage. Some others have no means of a direct response by the author. The author is NOT memorializing this person, but is attempting to write a credible contribution of one person's high imprint for change on society around her at a time when a single woman in that location was considered a "spinster" and did not value herself beyond her front door. Also, "noteworthiness" can lie outside the average, limited public view and current judgments -- which is actually possible, given none of the commentators have any way of knowing her personally, nor have the understanding behind the choices she made. Also, if a commentor happens to be an atheist, their also lies the possibility of an underlying bias in their comments on this particular article. And the commentary of "remarkableness" vs. thinking "jerk" was actually the use of another person's opinion. I should have kept the article as a "Draft" if that was possible. I am still fairly new to writing for Wiki. mshafbMshafb 17:16, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your statement that <i>"none of the commentators have any way of knowing her personally, nor have the understanding behind the choices she made."</i> proves each persons point on here, that while she sounds like a great person, she is not of encyclopedic value and thus doesn't warrant inclusion here. Additionally, your assertion that someones religous views might determine their thoughts on this article are both offensive and unwarranted, you have no idea as to the religious beliefs of the users here. I notice how you claim that the "remarkable person" content was someone elses opinion, yet you make no effort to properly cite this information, or remove it as biased and POV. The article is riddled with POV, contains original and non-verifiable research and is written of a subject who does not meet the criteria for biographical inclusion here. This is not a statement to your ability to write a memorial, nor one against the character of the subject. There are many non-encyclopedic sites on which you may write a tribute/memorial article. I would suggest looking there as the consensus here is delete. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 22:14, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rationale for this page is as an experiment under the proposal for <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStable_versions_171e.html" title="Wikipedia:Stable versions">Wikipedia:Stable versions</a>, but no timescale for same has been outlined (much less an experimental hypothesis) and there's been no activity on the "reviewing" for a week. Indeed, said discussion would more usefully have been conducted on the talk page of the "main" article, which is by no means "unstable", so could have been done in place. There seems to be the secondary goal here of greating a "parallel non-wiki wiki" in the existing namespace, which seems to be highly problematic without explicit consensus. So in essence this leaves us with an unnecessary <a href="../../../f/o/r/WP%7EFORK_4e79.html" title="WP:FORK">fork</a>, that's needlessly <a href="../../../p/p/_/WP%7EPP_1ffd.html" title="WP:PP">protected</a>, and doesn't comply with the <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">naming conventions</a>, and is cluttering up live category space with the ill-named duplicate. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 06:17, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Anons are allowed to <i>participate</i> in the discussion (if they can provide good arguments for or against), just that their <i>votes</i> aren't usually counted. This is more of a discussion than a vote - supposed to be a method of charting the user community consensus.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. This debate isn't conclusive enough in the delete direction for me; the final comment is correct since Alexa headlines 3month moving averages, whilst this site's daily/weekly rank is better 1,000th. Since the debate rests mainly on unexplicated "nn" or "low alexa" I don't think the deletion case is made at present. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:18, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Futuristic Sex Robotz passes all conditions for performers outside of mass media tradition. (Note the Daily Tar Heel article.) Your reasoning against the validity of a self released album in MP3 format is lacking; I'm sure you could release a full-length MP3 album using GarageBand, but the fact remains that it's entirely irrelevent. FSR has a large fan base that is primarily propagating the band via word of mouth and on web forums that are *not* being spidered by Google. The music video on FSR's web site has been downloaded 500,000+ times that can be verified (not counting an unknown number of mirrors) and the band has been in the Nerdcore_hip_hop article for months without question. The authors of this article have verified references to establish significant notoriety. Additionally, your original complaint is heavily biased. "Um... yeah, great." While we're at it, let's delete everything else you find personally offensive, shall we? Cellophane 08:20, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Umm...Google compresses most of those results, as many of them are from quoted forum posts.

Consider the possibility that Google hasn't spidered a significant amount of coverage as of yet. Also, FSR's views about intellectual property combined with the fact that the album is free and not printed on a physical medium make it incredibly unlikely that the band will be recognized by the music industry at large, especially on sites such as allmusic.com. The idea that Wikipedia relies on industry controlled recognition to gauge notoriety is disappointing. Cellophane 13:33, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Band has gone beyond simply "making a few MP3s in GarageBand" by creating a music video that has gone on earn fame and even an award for best music video within the Halo community -- a gamne that grossed $125 million US in its first 24 hours. The game itself has several articles written on Wikipedia specifically on fan videos (e.g., red vs blue, the codex series), making it a valid genre to achieve notability in. The video went on to become so popular that it even inspired a group of impersonators who tried to capitalize on their name by calling themselves "Clan FSR," starting their own website, recruiting members, and even creating crossover videos of their own with other groups under false pretenses. (The impersonators were since revealed and most references were removed in embarassment, although you can still find hints of some -- though not all -- of this in google caching.). Google searches are unreliable, for a number of reasons. First, because the name is long, and people may "mispell" the word "Robotz," abbreviate the group, or most likely, simply link to the files directly. Aside from Halo blogs (which are low in number but feature high readership), the main means of promotion for this genre has been livejournal and instant message, which google either doesn't store, or doesn't store longterm. Unfortunately, there's no way to measure that. However, download counts should speak for themselves. Yes, the band has not sold millions of copies, nor has it signed on with a major label. However, the band has managed a strong following for itself within its own (admittingly niche) genre. -Schrodinger82</li>

I would even go so far as to recommend that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> should be improved in such a way that notable acts that are simply not "press friendly" can be gauged in terms of notoriety using a far more consistent and reliable means than the vague suggestion of Google hits. If Wikipedia is not documenting phenomenon, including something as simple as a DIY, underground musical act, that major media outlets *don't* necessarily want the public to know about or are not in a position to cover, that seems to be arguably contradictory to the goals of the project. In many cases, the requirements outlined in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> strike me as absurdly arbitrary. Cellophane 14:46, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

In any case, whether it satisfies it or not, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> needs work. It doesn't specify how notability relates to the varying scope of a genre/style.

This 66mb album has burned through 300gigs of bandwidth in 3 days via HTTP alone. That's very arguably no less than the output of a very popular Podcast, relatively speaking.

<dd>You're totally missing my point, though, and that isn't even close to being related to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Podcasts and music are essentially the same medium, not to mention that video is exponentially larger in data than audio.

<dd>I don't think I missed your point-- you're arguing that its notable because so many people downloaded it. Hence, I replied with an example of why being downloaded a lot(millions of times in the case of tourette's guy...despite video format taking more time to download) doesn't matter as far as notability.

<dd>I'm not making the point that an arbitrary number of x downloads automatically equals notability, I'm making the point that relatively speaking, the group is more notable than many other articles that remain undesputed, and Podcasts are the most similar example. Tourette's guy doesn't have an article because it's 1 out of a billion ridiculous videos on the internet. Futuristic Sex Robotz should have an article because it's 1 out of 8 or so notable acts in a notable genre. If you think this article "clearly" doesn't meet music notability, then you're one of the many others looking at this discussion and thinking "group releases album on own with no record deal, it can't possibly be notable," without giving any consideration to the fact that it's been recognized by verifiable sources as a significant member of a genre that is recognized by Wikipedia. It makes absolutely no sense to me as to how this group can be in the artist list of Nerdcore Hip Hop without any doubt whatsoever, but can't have an article of its own. Authorities on that specific genre as opposed to just hip-hop or music as a whole recognize it as meeting the requirements of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nerdcore_hip_hop" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nerdcore_hip_hop" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nerdcore_hip_hop</a> Do you see any argument over whether or not Futuristic Sex Robotz belongs in that article? None. And there's nothing that distinguishes Futuristic Sex Robotz from the others that means that it has to be an external link while everything else has an article. --Cellophane 16:10, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

Because the amount of effort you are putting into having one article deleted is amazing. Seriously, why do you hate this article so much?

Go kill one of the other 999 articles that NO ONE will complain about. With the amount of support this article has, much from registered, experienced users (don't ask me to cite my references, but you know what I mean&#160;;)) this article will not be deleted, and if it is, it will be restored at some point again.

<dd>If you're wrong, then we aren't ignoring policy. Unfortunately, you're so convinced that you're right, any attempts to reason with you are pointless. Maybe the majority of experienced Wikipedia editors would agree with you, but just because we *don't* agree with you, our opinion must just be a symptom of ineptitude? That's logically false. You need to consider that the standards upon which notoriety is established, however specific they are, are still a matter of personal interpretation. I agree with Smitz in that it's astonishing just how dedicated you are to having this article deleted.

<dd>Fine, I'll try and convince you. Their only claim to notability is that not many people make nerdcore hip hop. Where do we draw the line? Can anyone make a nerd-rap album and get an article? To this, you might answer that they've been mentioned in a college newspaper and a gaming website. In reply to that, I suggest you read WP:MUSIC which says "Has been prominently featured in any major music media." Neither a gaming website nor a college paper is a major medium or a music medium. Thus, the basis for keeping this is simply that its nerdcore hip hop alone-- a precedent its important we don't allow to be set.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 16:01, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In his defense, from what I can tell: (a) he didn't start the article, and (b) the changes he made appear to be factual clarifications, some of which were more modest than the original wording (e.g., “The Futuristic Sex Robotz are the world’s first ‘Gangster Nerd Rap’ group” to “Futuristic Sex Robotz is a self-described ‘Gangster Nerd Rap’ group”). I do agree, though, that this probably still violates Wikipedia policy (I don‘t, however, agree that it‘s as cut-and-dry as a character judgement).

<dd>How many of your countless edits every day are just pointing out other people's regdates and number of comments? My guess is a lot. Also, if you refer back to WP:MUSIC, you'll see that the criteria for inclusion and proof of notability has been changed, completely nullifying this entire argument. You yourself even quoted the line that was changed earlier in this AFD page, finishing off with something along the lines of "Not only are they not Major media, theyre not music media". Oh well, because major music media is no longer a requirement. So your BASE argument of notability is rendered moot by the changes to WP:MUSIC.

<li>I agree that the subject is worth having an article on, but I nominated this for deletion because the article currently contains nothing (that I see) suitable for keeping, and I'm not knowledgeable enough about the subject to cut it down to a stub as you said. I was thinking it could be deleted as POV and then re-created as a viable stub when someone is able to do so (I understand this to be a valid procedure in these cases—please correct me if I'm wrong), but if you or someone else can change the article in this way now, please do so and I'll be happy to vote "keep". –<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESommers_4abf.html" title="User:Sommers">Sommers</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESommers_adb5.html" title="User talk:Sommers">(Talk)</a></sup> 00:07, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Quess I'll admit my ignorance on the Wikipedia way but by deleting nearly all the content the motivation for more than $200 million in expenditures in just the last year would be lost and RHIOs would appear to be an isolated concept. I'm unclear what fact or source cited in the article has raised an issue whether that fact/source has been modified to meet a desired POV and why reporting facts doesn't constitute a NPOV. While not everything is known about RHIOs it is a given that the US has a health information technology reform effort underway, it has the root causes in high cost and quaility, 150 or more RHIOs have been started, and they are state, local and rural. So, what is the issue that another POV might make?- futurekansas 01:58, 24 February 2006 (UTC) 01:57, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Fascists</b> You guys are all fascists. Thousands of people have worked on this paper, you pathetic morons. These are just the editors in charge. What's so bad about having it there? Is it taking up precious space? If the wikipedia is supposed to be a collection of information, why is everyone such a dictator as to what stays? And to the person who said "this is merely a list of who works on it": your negatism and complete ignorance astounds me beyond belief. Above those qualities, however, is your narrow reductionism.

<li><b>Improve or Delete.</b> This biographical article does not address the global importance of its subject. The article suggests that McVeigh is famous in Australia for performing a (presumably) multimillion-dollar financial transaction. The article does not give comprehensive details on the transaction. I think McVeigh can be characterized, at this point, as a <i>major player in a single local news story</i>. <font style="background: #000077" color="white"><b>Cdcon</b></font> 22:24, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Is there anyone here who I identifies as a real person with contact information. If so I'll gladly put up my own. Perhaps everyone should before a vote is counted. The most relevant issue with McVeigh is his prominence, illustrated by many press articles and his involvement in newsworthy events. The issue of the quality of the article is a separate matter, it should certainly be improved as several users have noted. 59.167.73.44 05:16, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Obviously this article was started by someone with a direct involvement in the MUSU matter, and equally obviously it has been attacked by others with some other kind of involvement. Since Wikipedia allows anonymous editing it really can't complain when this kind of thing happens, and it will go on happening at an increasing rate, as Wikipedia becomes better known, until something is done to tighten up the rules on who may edit. That being said, the MUSU case is a major story in Melbourne, and McVeigh is a fairly major player in it. It may be that all the allegations against him are bunk (I have no idea), but that doesn't alter the fact that they have made him newsworthy and notable. Obviously if the article is to be kept it needs vigilant editing to keep out everybody's POV.

<li>I reiterate my view that the article should be kep, that is clear but equally clear is that those editing have a point of view. I certainly do.

</ul>
<p>One assertion by Capitalistroadster contained the assertion that one of McVeigh's targets "fled overseas" to escape "charges." No part of that is true and nor is it even claimed that "charges" were laid. Presumably if the target in question, Andrew Landeryou, had fled and then returned nearly a year ago, he would have been punished for doing so. If Wikipedia is sensitive about defamation as some suggest, such claims should be considered carefully.</p>
<p>The only Police investigation confirmed is into Dean McVeigh's actions, which is supported by a document that was at one stage linked to I see but is now deleted.</p>
<p>McVeigh's actions as Liquidator of MUSU, particularly the contempt of court issue is a big deal and needs a separate treatment from any article about the Student Union. They are very different subjects. I have been reading through the Wikipedia rules and notice the mandate to assume good faith. I see very little of that here and what seems to be my some a manic determination to make political points. There are real issues of controversy here and they should be addressed correctly. I would like to contribute to that and I would hope a compromise could be achieved. 59.167.73.44 12:31, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Response</b> liquidating the Melbourne Student's Union and "worldwide fame for successfully defending Simpson" seem to have different levels of notability.

<p>I acknowledged the difference in scale. We have articles on local councillors, even though they are not as notable as presidents and prime ministers.

<dd>I think the defence of OJ Simpson, moreover the successful defence, was pretty remarkable, not merely a service for a notable client. More than 10 years later that trial is memorable and, although I have extremely little interest in US celebrity news, I would be prepared to discuss at a backyard barbecue ( but perhaps not stop a barbecue) on the subject "how come Simpson was not convicted?" No one got Skase, but I do not recall McVeigh's name in connection with Qintex. No doubt he was involved, I don't disbelieve the <i>Age</i> assertion - but not prominently. I think we should write the articles on the two professional bodies first and then look for prominent practitioners. As Ambi put it, the poor chap who is "<i>just a random insolvency practitioner who had the misfortune to run into some vengeful student politicians with a lot of time to spare</i>" should not be our choice of prominent accountant in Australia.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 06:38, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Merging is an inadequate solution</i> as it would delete all references not relating to MUSU, which while the principal reason for his notability would exclude reference to a highly unusual event, his removal by a Supreme Court judge in the Rug's Galore case and his involvement in other interesting Melbourne insolvency cases.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>REDIRECT</b> to <i>Richard Prince</i>. There seems little support for the standalone article but certainly insufficient support to delete it outright.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article is being expanded (by me). It is not a vanity page as it is about the artwork not the artist. The series of paintings is one of the few serious artistic attempts to explore issues of <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurse_stereotypes.html" title="Nurse stereotypes">stereotyping of nurses</a>. The artist is notable and the paintings have been widely exhibited. <b>Google for "nurse paintings" gets 521 hits. " 'Richard Prince' artist " gets 191,000 hits. "Pulp fiction art" gets 6,350,000 hits.</b> So the subject of this article is notable in TWO areas--nursing, and art. Mr. Bunker deleted the stub article with no notice or explanation and now has proposed it for deletion after I complained to him about his vandalism. Is there a new policy forbidding stubs? Deletion of articles should be taken quite seriously and those voting for deletion should <b>do a little research</b> before flippantly voting as an instant reflex.

<dd>I apologize (again) for deleting the article without going through the proper procedure. The stub status of the article isn't the issue.

<dd>Also, Richard Prince may be of "less than monumental stature" but his artwork has sold for $US 1,000,000 and set records at auction. That would suggest that he is considered "important" in the art world, although I agree "monumental stature" still would be a stretch. <a href="../../../t/h/b/User%7ETHB_9e7b.html" title="User:THB">THB</a> 19:17, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Seemed reasonable at the time, but now I understand it was not appropriate and I want to apologize to y'all for doing so. I thought the entry had been made by automation somehow since it was unreadable codes.&#160;: ) Well you have to admit until you understand this process it can be pretty mystifying. Also, while I'm entering this I would like to clear up that I do not know the person who started this wikipedia entry, nor had I ever had any conversation with him at the time he started this page. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikkicraft_a7ce.html" title="User:Nikkicraft">Nikkicraft</a> 07:10, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nikkicraft, all your actions were completely proper. The article should never have been <i>speedied</i> -- that is basically for nonsense like JOE SHMOE ROXXORS HE IS THE COOLEST KID IN SKOOL etc. -- and the Prod delete system specifically calls for moving articles here to AfD if there is any reasonable basis for discussion, which it appears that there is. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 21:18, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, you get a lot of hits; because she has a lot of self promotion on the web. Actually find just one site we could use as a source for a living person that claims she is noteable.

<li>You can say that as often as you like, if you're insistent on demonstrating your lack of competence in using Google. Though it looks more to me like you just dislike her politics and want Wikipedia censored to remove references to somebody whose ideas you don't like, even though she's well known, treated as notable in press and commentary, and her activities are often reported. Looks more like censorship and bad faith than any real question of notability. <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/vaw00/edited_transcript.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/vaw00/edited_transcript.html" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> <a href="http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/women/html/wh_001800_antipornogra.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/women/html/wh_001800_antipornogra.htm" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> <a href="http://www.afsc.org/pwork/0506/050612.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.afsc.org/pwork/0506/050612.htm" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> <a href="http://www.prostitutionrecovery.org/prostitution_timeline.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.prostitutionrecovery.org/prostitution_timeline.html" rel="nofollow">[35]</a><a href="http://ontheissuesmagazine.com/russell.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://ontheissuesmagazine.com/russell.htm" rel="nofollow">[36]</a><a href="http://www-tech.mit.edu/V105/N32/pro.32n.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www-tech.mit.edu/V105/N32/pro.32n.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a><a href="http://www.barbelith.com/topic/8447" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.barbelith.com/topic/8447" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> <a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2002/March/17/style/stories/01style.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2002/March/17/style/stories/01style.htm" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> <a href="http://www.feminist.org/research/chronicles/fc1990.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.feminist.org/research/chronicles/fc1990.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 18:03, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Someone help me out here. I'm just looking foe ONE <b>good source</b> establishing <b>noteability</b>. I look at the source <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/vaw00/edited_transcript.html" class="external free" title="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/vaw00/edited_transcript.html" rel="nofollow">http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/vaw00/edited_transcript.html</a> that you provide and it mentions her in passing as having a useful web site "i recommend the websites set up by the activist Nikki Craft under various acronyms including Always Causing Legal Unrest (ACLU), which are very high quality." Having websites for your causes does not make one noteable. The nexy site of the nine you gave that I look up <a href="http://www.prostitutionrecovery.org/prostitution_timeline.html" class="external free" title="http://www.prostitutionrecovery.org/prostitution_timeline.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.prostitutionrecovery.org/prostitution_timeline.html</a> establishes she is noteable by saying "<b>1984</b>: National Rampage Against Penthouse and Hustler begins. Organized by long-time feminist activist Nikki Craft in retaliation for the December 1984 issue of Penthouse magazine where Japanese women were shown tied up, hung from trees, with several appearing to be dead. Over 21 communities participated in almost 10 states. Hundreds of pornographic magazines were destroyed, resulting in over a hundred individual arrests and countless raised consciousnesses" Great I think, noteabilty. So I google "National Rampage Against Penthouse and Hustler", the noteable organization she organized and ggofle show one hit, this one! Is this site written by Nikki or a friend? I don't know. I'm still lacking a <b>good source</b>. So instaed of researching the other seven, I put it to you: find me one <b>good site</b> that establishes <b>noteability</b>. Don't give me nine bad ones. Is there a good one in the seven I didn't investigate? Point it out. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 19:41, 23 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Site 3: This is a speech given by Andrea Dworkin, and says "The full speech is also available on Nikki Craft's Andrea Dworkin tribute site", with no other mention of Niki. This link does not establish Niki's notability (its about Andrea, not Nikki).</li>
<li>Site 4: A "Timeline of the Sex Industry in the United States". "1977 Women Armed For Self Protection is founded by long-time feminist activist Nikki Craft", Niki's Nostatusquo site seems to say this group's last action was in 1974? So I'm not enamoured with the reliablity of the site. A group that existed only in the 1970s cannot really be fairly judged by online hits alone (imho), but what there are don't establish notability enough for me - other sources would need to be cited.</li>
<li>Site 4: This site also says (in the same bullet point): "Craft also founded The Kitty Genovese Women's Project, which released a list of over two thousand men indicted for sex offenses against women in Dallas, Texas." Nothing I've found online seems to give any more information about this group than this one action, that Nikki founded it and that Nikki is keen to mention she founded it. Again this appears to have happened in the 1970s so I'd be willing to concede it is underrepresented online. All in all, this doesn't on its own show she is notable enough.</li>
<li>Site 5: This is a scathing review by a feminist against pornography of a book that is pro pornography. Nikki's name is mentioned only once, when the reviewer lists 12 anti-pornography feminists (including herself) who the book's author <i>does not</i> mention. Quite how this is meant to show notability I'm not sure.</li>
<li>Site 6: This is about a small group (membership estimated at 15-30 women) at MIT in the mid 1980s, who demonstrated against violence against women. It mentions that the group "has arranged for groups to attend lectures and forums for such activists as Catherine MacKinnon, Audre Lorde, Andrea Dworkin and Nikki Craft.". This does show some notability, but nowhere near enough on its own.</li>
<li>Site 7: "But modern feminist figures like Dworkin, Nikki Craft, Melissa Farley, Susan Faludi-- their works &amp; choice of words + issues harken back to the idea of women as OVEREMOTIONAL, VICTIMIZED, IN NEED OF PROTECTION [legal and otherwise], SENSITIVE, and most of all, DIFFERENT FROM MEN." This is from what is an opinion piece (I'm not certain whether this is a blog-type site or something more notable) "The Trouble with Modern Feminist Spitfires". This is the best of the sites so far, but again it just mentions her in passing.</li>
<li>Site 8: Is an interview with Andrea Dworkin, one question is "I noticed your Web site was built by Nikki Craft, the radical feminist who was active in Santa Cruz during the mid-’80s? How did you two meet.". The publication is a newspaper in the Santa Cruz area. Undoubtedly the best of the sites presented so far, its pushing the notability of Nikki a bit higher, but again I would prefer a reference that actually deals with Nikki.</li>
<li>Site 9: The site is "The Feminist Chronicles" a page listing notable events in feminism (from the pov of a feminist organisation) for 1990. It includes a two-line note of her protest over the Esquire magazine and subsequent arrest and 23 days in prison. Another source confirming what we already know, but providing less notablity (for me) than some others for being within the movement.</li>
<li>Conclusion: These sites collectively say to me that Nikki possibly does, <i>just</i> deserve an article, but in a large part only because she is very good at self-promotion. It would be very easy to get the impression that she was the biggest thing to happen to femminism in the 20th century, wheras it appears she has just been a minor player in a lot of events. It is a very borderline issue from what I've seen. These links do a significantly better job of proving <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Dworkin_4ba1.html" title="Andrea Dworkin">Andrea Dworkin</a>'s notability, she definately does deserve an article. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 23:21, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I started the article about Nikki Craft. Inclusion of Nikki Craft in constructive criticism of organized <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturism.html" title="Naturism">naturism</a> and <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nudism.html" title="Nudism">nudism</a> is absolutely critical in presenting major points of view on the subject of clothes free recreation, especially as it related to clubs and <a href="../../../a/a/n/AANR_c5ed.html" title="AANR">AANR</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Naturist_Society_54f1.html" title="The Naturist Society">The Naturist Society</a>. Many noteable nudists and naturists are very familiar with Nikki's site and I think her critcism has been essential in leading to reform in the nudist/naturist community, which is still much needed to continue to provide for the safety of those who enjoy clothes free activities. I also believe her other activist work is highly noteable as well as a <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topfree_equality.html" title="Topfree equality">topfree equality</a> activist and as someone fighting <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misogyny.html" title="Misogyny">misogyny</a> in popular culture. I am really surprised a hand full of people would move so quickly armed with such incredible uninformed arguments to delete this article given the breadth of her work, the fact that she is so well known. The debates she has had on Jenny Jones with controversial figure <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Lange_ac27.html" title="Ed Lange">Ed Lange</a> are significant enough by themselves. If it wasn't for her work, thousands would laud Lange as a nudist hero without understanding the darker sides of the man, which must be noted. The influence she has had over several decades of much-needed activism cannot be ignored.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDandelion1_c27f.html" title="User:Dandelion1">Dandelion1</a> 03:42, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. This site should not be deleted as her work for women's freedom has been tremendous and spans over three decades.

<li>Nikki is a nice person with a lot of friends, that doesn't make her noteworthy. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 07:57, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>WAS 4.250, I have to ask why you are trying so hard to ignore the evidence you claim you want? First you claim that you can't find anything notable about the subject, as though your own failure to find what is easy to find constitutes a lack of evidence. Then you claim the hits on Google for the subject's name are self-promotion. WAS 4.250, there are *over 10,000* hits in Google, and the subject did not place most of them there. Then I post on the Talk page references to articles about the subject in the New York Times and the Dallas Morning News, and you immediately reply that <b>VERIFICATION</b> and <b>evidence</b> is needed, as though what I posted wasn't good enough or that you wilfully ignored it. (You said you didn't see the references in the post you were supposedly replying to, making me wonder whether you're really interested to see what's being presented.) You then questioned whether these references prove noteability! (Perhaps you will read them and tell us, and if you will not perhaps you will not seek to dismiss them.) Dandelion1 then provides more evidence of noteability, including a debate with Ed Lange on television, and you dismiss this as "testimont". Another user cites Craft's work as inspirational and you dismiss this as "Nikki is a nice person with a lot of friends, that doesn't make her noteworthy." WAS 4.250, the user never said that Craft was her <i>friend</i>. The user said that Craft's <i>work</i> was inspirational. That ought to give you some clue that the subject is recognized for the work which is the basis for the article. Incidentally, I know that Andrea Dworkin dedicated one of her books to the subject, though I don't know which one just yet. Between multiple articles in major newspapers, television appearances, and recognition by major authors, along with the majority opinion of those who have voted, I would think that would be enough to confirm the appropriateness of having an article about the subject. I am beginning to wonder whether any amount or style of evidence will be satisfactory to you, and whether you have some personal bias which is causing you to resist the evidence so forcefully. If you respond to this I will appreciate your carefully replying to what was actually said, rather than what was not said, and that you do not make your case by ignoring what I have said. -<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbluejay_da97.html" title="User:Michaelbluejay">MichaelBluejay</a> 08:26, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you, Dandelion1, but I don't think mediation is warranted at this point, nor even possible for this particular kind of disagreement. We simply have a difference of opinion, and the way to express that difference in the context of an RfD is just to vote, which we have done. I am concerned that WAS 4.250 may be biasing editors who aren't paying very close attention to what's actually being said, but I will try to trust the integrity of the community as a whole. -<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbluejay_da97.html" title="User:Michaelbluejay">MichaelBluejay</a> 08:58, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>The fact that he is ignoring sources just seems to me to be a type of trolling behavior, he is just dragging this debate on way further than was needed to verify her noteability.

<li>His move to use hastily use the {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDelete_bfa0.html" title="Template:Delete">delete</a>}} tag I believe was not done in good faith and without regard to the noteability of the subject and the relevance of this article to others linked to it. He is clearly ignoring evidence. His actions are provoking endless debate that is not warranted given the sources provided here. How long to we have to keep responding to HIS denial of evidence? Is everybody who supports this article a "friend" of Nikki's to him? These kind of accusations are provoking an emotional response. Give me a break. My opinion stands. I believe his behavior is unwarranted. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDandelion1_c27f.html" title="User:Dandelion1">Dandelion1</a> 09:15, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume Good Faith</a>. When this article was nominated for speedy deletion the associated comment was "<a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikkicraft_a7ce.html" title="User:Nikkicraft">User:Nikkicraft</a> says <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikki_Craft_af1b.html" title="Nikki Craft">Nikki Craft</a> is noteable because of links to Nikki Craft's websites". Which was a fair reflection of the state of the article when it was nominated, the only clue that this wasn't vanity for someone who doesn't know the name is that the article existed previously in a more neutral form. If WAS 4.250, like me, didn't spot the previously existing versions then he was acting in good faith. Speedy deletion requires two people (sometimes called "tag and bag") - the first person to nominate the article for speedy deletion, and then a second person to check that they too think it qualifies for speedy deletion. If both agree then it gets deleted, but like here, this was not the case and so it was not speedily deleted. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> replaced the speedy deletion tag with a "proposed deletion" tag which is the relatively new halfway house between speedy deletion and AfD. This was disputed so I brought it here. Re the 10,000 google hits claim, this is not notable in and of itself - a very large number of those are for sites run by Nikki, which cannot be used for external evidence of notablity per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. As has also been established above, there are also a significant number of the rest that prove nothing other than Nikki runs the website about someone who is notable. I know someone who runs the most informative website about <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Robinson_f690.html" title="Tony Robinson">Tony Robinson</a> - that does not make her notable.

<dd>Rewrite? This page is only a few weeks old. There was apparently a premature call to quicky delete this page. People on this page requested substantiation. I have never been, hmm, let's say self-promoting enough to write a book about my work or even compile my "credentials" in a concentrated and thorough way. Too busy doing the activism and research. I'm doing so now at the request of those on this page who have asked me to do it. P.S. If it is not acceptable for me to enter this up here after the text I'm replying to and it should it go at the bottom of the section I will move it after I can find out. thanks for your patience. --<a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikkicraft_a7ce.html" title="User:Nikkicraft">Nikkicraft</a> 02:13, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: It is inconvenient for some of you that Nikki's notability peaked in the 70's and 80's before the advent of the Intternet.

Thre is a lot of documentation about her in what amounts to old "newsletters" which are problematic for citations do we just have to do a better job at traditional scholarship.

<li>What has been established is that we lack a consensus to delete, so the article will probably stay and its contents will have to be made to conform to the requirements of verifyability. See <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> to read <i>Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy. Its primary method of finding consensus is discussion, not voting. In difficult cases, straw polls may be conducted to help determine consensus, but are to be used with caution and not to be treated as binding votes</i> and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVoting_is_evil_8af3.html" title="Wikipedia:Voting is evil">Wikipedia:Voting is evil</a> to read <i>Voters feel misled at the end of a poll if the numerically superior option is not the one acted upon. "But it won the poll!" they claim, and not realizing that a poll is no substitute for consensus, are understandably upset, feeling that their voices have not been heard.</i> to understand that this is a dicussion in the form of a vote as opposed to an actual vote. The comments that make sense (are believed by the admins that delete or don't delete) are what count. The "voting" is not binding. What's best for wikipedia is what counts and thoughtful discussion takes precedence over voting numbers. At wikipedia, its the evidence and arguments that represent consensus that count, not the raw voting numbers. So far there is no consensus to delete. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 04:09, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>AAAAHHHH HHHAAAA!</b> You are ready to conceed the point? Good. Do you know how to close this item out and properly remove the delete tag? You have to update the Talk page and logs also.

<li>I think you maybe have a wrong impression. The tag's not going to get deleted until the AfD process is closed by an admin after the appropriate amount of time has expired.

<li>It was my vague impression that if AfD can be pulled by the orignal AfD'er. I mean, if someone stupidly put an AfD on one of the Presidents of the USA, you would think that they could also pull their own tag and save the admins the trouble of having to do so for them. Also, the article has undergone major changes during the AfD process, so maybe that is yet another case. If I am wrong that we can sew this thing up today, sorry! -- <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.122.118.161.html" title="User:68.122.118.161">68.122.118.161</a> 15:07, 26 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The AfD can be "pulled" by the original nominator, but this normally only happens when there is a clear consensus that the article should not be deleted or if the nomination was made in error - this rarely happens after the first day or two and never when there are good-faith votes to delete. The only other times a discussion is closed early are if the article is speedy deleted (definately not applicable here), or the nomination was in bad faith.

<li>Well, there has been a massive rewrite an only one call, early on, to delete. I think that the article is now solid: notable, supporting documentation, the works. If the person who had added the delete tag had done a little more homework, they might have used a milder tag. OTOH, the article is now so much better that it was, for me, worth the crisis and an opportunity to be a hero to a lady that I have known of for almost 25 years but never just never happened to have contacted before. We talked for hours and hours as if we were old friends. <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~amorrow/" class="external text" title="http://home.earthlink.net/~amorrow/" rel="nofollow">AWM</a> -- <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.141.235.70.html" title="User:71.141.235.70">71.141.235.70</a> 23:11, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. I've just had to delete three identical (with slightly different titles) articles that were simply advertisements for this person's website. She is clearly a determined self-publicist, and this article is a straightforward example of that. As Skinwalker points out, Google hits are unreliable in such cases (she's tried to add at least four links to hereself on Wikipedia, and who knows what she's done elsewhere? If she's so notable, let's delete this, and wait to see if anyone else starts a decent article about her.</li>

<dd>Did you fail to notice that somebody else DID start this article about her? She didn't start it herself. It's unfair for you to label her a self-publicist when she didn't start the article and has had only minimal input into it.

You had asked me for documentation, and I'm just now beginning to supply it and going to some effort to comply with your request.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is more broad than a lot of you realize. Nikki is a very important figure and its very hard for me to write articles about related subjects without her being part of a the discussion. She is way too important to leave out. There is no other major figure like her offering the type of criticism with the kind of real results she has provided out there. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDandelion1_c27f.html" title="User:Dandelion1">Dandelion1</a> 04:30, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is written in English, Dandelion, and I know how to read. This page is about a 'writer', and yet there's not a single reference to a written work she's produced. It's a page about an 'activist', and there are no biographies written about this so-called notable activist. I've never seen such a clear example of a vanity page. -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 16:05, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Nikki Craft has written articles for Clothed with the Sun (now known as <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nude_%26_Natural_4e93.html" title="Nude &amp; Natural">Nude &amp; Natural</a>) magazine. That makes her a writer as well as an activist. I don't understand why her website isn't considered a written work. Its very well known. What kind of web encyclopedia doesn't recognize web writers?

<li>This is currently a POV screed that makes an astonishing number of claims without a sources. While it appears that Craft does have some slight notability, this page already needs a massive clean-up, and I'm deeply concerned about how "linky" this article is: <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Nikki_Craft_ddb1.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Nikki Craft">Special:Whatlinkshere/Nikki_Craft</a>. It also appears <i>de rigueur</i> to add a link to one of her many websites whenever she is mentioned. I cannot believe, based upon the evidence presented, that this is anything other than an agressivly self-promoting individual leeching bandwidth, both in person and by proxy. An unfortunate feedback loop can occur, where the initial numbe of google hits suckers us when looking for sources, and we feed the machine. None of these are reasons for deletion, however. Trim this back to the stub that is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, hunt out and remove all internal links that are inappropiate or give appearance of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">undue weight</a>, terminate with extreme prejudice anything that does not conform to the guideline on <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">external links</a>.

<li><b>weak keep</b>. I've read all of the debate here, and on talk, and while I am still not convinced she is as notable in her fields as some of the claims, I am very persuaded by the arguments of <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> and <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Brenneman</a> that she has been so successful at self-promotion that the Nikki Craft penomenon is notable. There is a need to keep a continuing, strong eye on the article to ensure NPOV and verifiability and on related articles to keep at bay the tendency to promote the influence of her and her wesbites above that independently and neutrally observable and verifiable. Wikipedia is not a vehicle to promote something or someone - we report on what is already notable. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 19:40, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As I said earlier this article was started without my knowledge or permission. When I was asked to add content and documentation to the article by the person who started it, who I did not know at the time, I was not aware there was any option to delete this article. I thought once an article was opened that was it and that is why I did not attempt to get it closed down, though that was certainly my first impulse. However, once it was opened I would not be willing to sit by and accept the article being shut down prematurely, or on false grounds in a way that negates three and a half decades of my work, as some here were attempting to do through misrepresentation of my work and my motivations which have been misconstrued.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I appreciate very much Dandelion respecting my work enough to start the article in the first place, and for all those who voted to keep the page and defending it staying here. It means more to me than I can say for a variety of reasons. However, now that I do know there is an option to delete the article--and I have not made up my mind for sure about what I will do--I would like to know if the is an option for a "living persons" to delete their own article due to concerns about violation of privacy and other concerns. I would appreciate advise on this topic. I have tried to fix it so I can be emailed off my talk page, but it does not work. I did get as far as confirming the email address, but it never allowed the option to send an email on the page, so I don't know what is wrong or how to fix it and I don't want to publish my email address here because of robots and spam. But if you do want to email me about a deletion option privately, perhaps it is not appropriate to post it here, then please go to <a href="http://www.nikkicraft.com" class="external free" title="http://www.nikkicraft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nikkicraft.com</a> and email me at the address on that page.</dd>
<dd>Also, now that it has been established that the article will not be deleted there are many peripheral and inconsequential links that need to be deleted and were there only for the purpose of substantiating this "notability" requirement. Now that that is done they need to be removed. Also, if it's a problem to link scanned articles that substantiate the content on the Wikipedia chronology then we can move them to another website other than my own. I don't care if the links are off my own website, just as long as the documentation is unrefutable. So anyone can let me know the preferred way of presenting that documentation. thanks, <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikkicraft_a7ce.html" title="User:Nikkicraft">Nikkicraft</a> 22:27, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Comments by <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a> paraphrased from discussion on the WP:Music talk page: The WP:MUSIC criteria do not mention anywhere that the bands must be national in scope. Many local bands have in fact released albums (crit#3), have been featured in magazines (crit#4) or indeed are among the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (crit #6). Indeed the point of the criteria is to weed out the examples cited such as teenage garage bands, etc. and not in any way those local bands that have been playing for years, have been featured in local music media, and have locally-successful records. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadangry_e9cc.html" title="User:Madangry">Madangry</a> 02:26, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> On further review, perhaps is doesn't, though I at first thought that "Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable)." sactioned it. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby1011_3500.html" title="User:Bobby1011">Bobby1011</a> 01:21, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is a Non Notable American Footballer. His sole claim to fame appears to be that he injured someone in a tackle. Imagine if we list all footballers all around the world who play in their leagues? I believe that Nassau has some particularly splendid football leagues -even if they play with a rattan ball. I originally put this up for PROD claiming lack of notability, but it was removed as apparently there is a consensus that all American footballers are notable, by definition.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Personally, I'd scale back on that statement unless a precedent exists. In this case, it does - all NFL players have articles and always survive Afd and a project even exists to support the precedent. In other cases, it's not so clear. That's why we have <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> so that every person that has ever walked into a recording studio holding an instrument doesn't have an article. If we allowed that, I bet there would be millions of articles on those alone, 98% of which no one cares about. The number of people that have ever been on an NFL roster is far more manageable. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 17:14, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is not to present a theory this hotly disputed as factual, that is POV</li>

<p>If it is POV to call it a "conspiracy theory", then why are all other theories labeled "conspiracy theory"? those being labeled as "conspiracy theory" clearly proves that it is NPOV to call it a "conspiracy theory".

<dd><b>Comment</b> Striver, I read the article before I rendered my opinion and my reasoning stands as stated: You did not source your claims nor provide any evidence that this is a widely held theory, or in your words <i>"accepted as factual by many people in many parts of the world"</i>. I know this is the official account and like I said, it should be ridiculously easy to source your claims... but you have to source it. You can't just assume that everybody knows this is the mostly widely held belief of who was behind September 11th. Furthermore, I don't see any reason for this article to exist as a standalone. It is mentioned in the main September 11 article and if you have a concern that the concept that some people see this explanation as a "conspiracy theory" is not accurately portrayed there, then mention (along with sourcing that some people consider the Bin Laden connection a conspiracy theory) at <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>... and don't automatically assume bad faith just because I disagree with you.... and it's not a "vote" as you stated, this is a gathering of opinions.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:13, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Ok, sorry if i gave the impression of assuming bad faith. I apologise.</p>
<p>About sourcing, what do you expect me to source? That all western governments officialy belive in the Bin Ladin conspicacy theory? That the 9/11 commision belives in it? That every single major newspaper in the USA and Europ belive its factual? That anyone not beliving in the Bin Ladin conspicacy theory is considered a idiot? That i have on several occasions claimed to be a nut case for not beliving in the Bin Ladin conspicacy theory?</p>
<p>I dont get it. The <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> claims the Bin Ladin conspicacy theory to be factual, and therefore i have put a pov sign on it. I suspect we are not conecting....</p>
<p>Im sure you dont mean that the article should be deleted for not sourcing such an obvious statment?</p>
<p>My reason of it being a standalone is simply that it is POV to give a full account of it in the main article, while all other conspicacy theory COMBINED get this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Almost immediately after the attacks, conspiracy theories about possible U.S. Government involvement and other speculations were fostered by political opponents to the Bush administration, anti-American groups, those looking to make a quick profit, and some who had doubts about the mainstream media account.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>That is POV. I didnt try to put it in <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>, since i would probly get baned for it&#160;:P</p>
<p>Further, it is the most reqognized conspiracy theories, so if any, this one should get its own article. Optimaly, the main article should only state the non-contested facts, then have a section where it summs all conspiracy theories, including the bin laden one, giving the bin laden one most space, then linking to <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>. The <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> should the START by summing the bin laden one, and linking to it, then going though all others on it self. OR just have all conspiracy theories on the same article.</p>
<p>It is simply POV to present the Bin Ladin conspicacy theory as the factual in the main article, and everyone else being sumed in two lines as shuved into a single article.</p>
<p>It is even pov to present Bin Ladin conspicacy theory as a theory, and only giving all others only two lines, and shuving them to a single article.</p>
<p>Just on a hunch, i belive this could be NPOV: Presesnting non-contested facts, then giving the Bin Ladin conspicacy theory some space, then giving all others theories COMBINED 30% of that space. If ONE or several theory is called a conspicacy theory, the ALL should. either all are called conspicacy theory, or none.</p>
<p>I repeat: It is simply POV to give ONE conspiracy theory FULL coverage in the main article, to the point of it not even needing any article, while shuving everything else into one single article.</p>
<p>It is also pov to label some, but not all, as a conspicacy theory.</p>
<p>It is also pov to present one conspicacy theory as factual.</p>
<p><br />
One more thing: You seem to assume that i belive "conspicacy theory" is a pejorative label. Some people do. I dont. I regard all theories about who and why the attacks where done as a conspicacy theories: a theory about a conspiracy.</p>
<p>In that view, i dont even see what this means: "along with sourcing that some people consider the Bin Laden connection a conspiracy theory"</p>
<p>That sentance seems to to say that you belive the "conspicacy theory" to be pejorative. During my whole argumentation, i have assumed it is not pejorative. The reason is that people tried to remove the "conspicacy theory" from titles, saying it was pejorative, but the majority did not agree with them.</p>
<p>Anyone beliving "conspicacy theory" is a pejorative term needs to support the removal of it from ALL article, since it is POV to have pejorative terms in titles.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:30, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Some people seem to belive that a "conspicacy theory" is not the same thing as a "theory about a conspiracy". How do you objectivly decide if one theory is a "conspicacy theory" or a "theory about a conspiracy"? I claim it is not possible to do it obectivly. If im wrong, please correct me.</p>

<dd>Striver, no problem... no offense taken. I may be riding my sourcing stick a little hard today. I'll see if I can find something that would satisfy me.</dd>
<dd>I don't think you would necessarily take alot of heat for adding this to the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> article if it was written correctly. "Conspiracy Theory" is sort of a loaded term because it suggests to some people that there is some doubt as to the validity of whatever is being claimed. Calling something a "Conspiracy Theory" <b>is</b> generally considered a pejoritive term (and indeed while it appears you did not intend it that way, I read it that way); at least in American English. It evokes UFOs, Alien Abductions, and a vast network of people who were dedicated to killing John. F. Kennedy. What I meant by "along with sourcing that some people consider the Bin Laden connection a conspiracy theory" was in the light of "Conspiracy Theory" as the possible pejorative: simply that while a majority of people believe Bin Ladin and Al'Qaeda were materially responsible for the September 11th attacks, ther are people out there that do not believe this to be the case and that his connection to 9/11 was manufactured. Perhaps I misinterpreted your intent with this article, but that also illustrates the connotation that is inherent in the term "Conspiracy Theory". I can see you disagree, but I imagine if you took a poll here, the majority would consider "Conspiracy Theory" to be a negative connotation term.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:59, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bro, if that is the case, and we are supposed to agree on that definition, then why is wikipedia claiming my view to be "doubt as to the validity" of its claim?</p>
<p>Isnt it POV to label my view with a pejorativ term in the heading?</p>
<p>How is it not like renaming <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> to Jesus worshiping?</p>

<p>I apologize if it is perceived as bad faith. Yes, it was in some way a rhetorical question. But i stil stand by the question: What is the difference, and how do we OBJECTIVLY claim one is "conspicacy theory" or a "theory about a conspiracy". I know that some people perceive "conspicacy theory" to be objective, while a "theory about a conspiracy" to be pejorative.</p>
<p>Tom harrison, Are you among them? Do you belive there is a difference between them, and that "conspicacy theory" is pejorative? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:42, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I personaly do not belive there is a difference, not more that SOME people belive "conspicacy theory" to be pejorative. The discution of wheter "conspicacy theory" should or should not be used in Wikipedia articles concluded that the word was NPOV, so im going with that standard. Both being NPOV means that none is pejorative, meaning that both "conspicacy theory" and "theory about a conspiracy" are synonymos. If not one of them being pejorative, what other difference are there? I can not see any other difference. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:45, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tom, you wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Not at all. A conspiracy theory is an objectively identifiable thing. A theory involving a conspiracy is different objectively identifiable thing. There is no issue with using 'conspiracy theory' in article titles, as long as it's used correctly.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Please Tom, i urge you, spell out the difference, dont dance around it. Say:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"A "conspiracy theory" is X, while a "theory involving a conspiracy" Z, and Z and X are not equals since Q"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>If you do that, you will inevitibly come to one of the following conclusions:</p>
<p>A: There is no diffence between Z and X</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>B: There is a difference, being that one is less credible.</p>
<p><br />
If the answer is B, then it is pov to use it in Wikipedia titles. But earlier discution have concluded that it is NOT pov to use it in titles. Thus, the answer must be "There is no diffence between Z and X".</p>
<p>And it is with that reasoning i say its NPOV to say "9/11 Bin Laden conspiracy theory" --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:55, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The two phrases refer to different things; They are not just different ways of saying the same thing. There is a difference, and it's spelled out in detail in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a>, which you might find interesting reading. Have a look at the references while you are there reading it. There's an extensive body of academic literature about conspiracy theory. <i>Conspiracy theory</i> can be used as a pejorative, but it need not be. You can recognize a conspiracy theory by its structural <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html#Features" title="Conspiracy theory">features</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy.html" title="Conspiracy">Conspiracy</a> as a legal term is a different thing. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 22:05, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Acctualy, you are missing my point. It is undisputed that there was a <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>. That is NPOV to say as a fact. But it is POV to say that Bin laden did it. The event is one issue, who and why is a totaly other. And there are many theories of who and why it was made. My problem is that ONE of this theories is singled out as factual, and thus merged with the factual parts of the event. The facts and the theories need to be separated, no matter the popularity of a theory--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 22:56, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> There is no need for this article. The entire basis for its existence is fully covered in the 9/11 conspiracy article. Whether Striver likes it or not, the 9/11 commission account is the verified factual account until or unless proven otherwise. It does not have the status of theory, it has the status of historical fact so does not need to be presented as a theory. Other historical facts that are disputed do not lose their status as fact simply because there are conspiracy theories about them. The format that existed with the main article covering what is the established historical record and a separate section regarding conspiracy theories that dispute the historical record seems perfectly reasonable. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 09:57, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It not being a theory is not true. The Bin Laden theory can not account for many things, for example why building seven was demolished. It is heavly contested by mutliple scholars in multiple fields. It is not factual, even though many people belive it is. It is pov to have such a disputed theory stated as a fact. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 13:44, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The page contains nothing of interest, and as far as I can see, the person it's about has done nothing notable to write an article about. As for "a Guiness Book entry... would make her notable": *snort* 69.181.66.75 08:05, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is a very restricted event from Brazil.

Right now, she has about 2 milion scraps. As you can see, this is an information very restricted to the brazilian orkut comunity, but I think it's big enought. I also would like to point out that the portuguese version of the article is being voted for deletion, and the last time I checked it was 12 to delete and 11 to keep (I think that by the rules there, you need 3/4 of <b>delete</b> to delete the article). <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgumacoisaqq_3232.html" title="User:Algumacoisaqq">algumacoisaqq</a> 03:44, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm nominating this because I have no idea what it is. No, seriously, I can't figure out what it's trying to say, and the site it references has only one link - a link back to this Wikipedia article. Go figure. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 07:14, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The entry makes sense if you break it down. It refers to Permanent URL's (PURLS), the handle system (handle.net), and the DOI system (doi.org). These are systems for referring people to content in a manner that protects against broken or expired links. If you've ever bookmarked a page that can no longer be found, then you can imagine the need for a permanent URL that hunts down the current location of the content contained within the URL. A Link in Ink, like a DOI (Digital Object Identifier), is a unique URN that points to a directory. This directory is maintained by web publishers who update the associations between DOIs, e.g., and their associated URLS. I wouldn't be so quick to delete this. I've seen a printed flyer with Links in Ink embedded in the copy. These links have referred me to online resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you cite sources that have used this system? Given that the associated Web page is completely contentless (how does one even create a Link in Ink? There's no information available) I would suggest that this Wikipedia page is at best, premature. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 07:32, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Nonnotable. A google search for "link in ink" (in quotes) returns only <b>71</b> results, and only three of the first ten seem to have anything resembling relevance to what's described in the article. <a href="../../../t/h/s/User%7EThsgrn_05b9.html" title="User:Thsgrn">Michael Ralston</a> 07:34, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Does a lack of of google search results mean that the article is of no use? I'm not convinced that popularity-according-to-google should measure the merit of an wiki article. There is now an example of an implementation of the system. I think one idea would be to inform that the technology is purported by LINKinINK.com</p>

Whilst editors may not be in the know of is relevence in the empowering of young people. His upcoming second national tour later this year is supported by the UK Government, in which he has personal backing of Education Secretary Ruth Kelly, and previous Shadow Education Secretary, now leader of the Conservative Party - David Cameron MP. With a little bit of research this can be supported. I also see you have Lynda Waltho placed as 'a famous person' in Stourbridge. She is one of the said MPs to support the education campaign on a local level, on behalf of the UK Government. She can be contacted.</p>
<p>As a completely seperate comment to this. Having been a reader of Wikipedia for quite some time you can't be feel that editors often come accross as 'know it all's' who when it comes down to it, don't know a lot apart from there own first hand knowledge. As someone who has worked in education for over 30 years, I find it quite remarkable how, Wikipedia advertises itself as an independent website, yet if certain people who are not knowledgable of a certain somebody or something, inclusion is questioned.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> If Wikipedia adopted a Limbo namespace, this article could be moved to Limbo during the discussion on deletion. Moving an article to Limbo would remove it from the article namespace and prevent search engines from delivering suspicious content while the community decides whether to keep or delete it.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>No consensus</b>. Discounting sockpuppets, anons, and new users, I see roughly a little less than 3:1 ratio in favour of deletion, which IMO is right on the borderline between keeping and deleting. I have to be honest and say that I find the arguments for deletion to be a little better than the arguments for keep. However given that this is right on the borderline, and the credo of AFD is <i>when in doubt, keep</i>, I must close this as no consensus. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><i>e</i></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">athphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 03:51, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The given reason is: "Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of fame, achievement, or perhaps notoriety." This page is only here to announce that this person alleges that they slept with a celebrity, and went on to announce that in many places.

This is not a "breaking news story" either. The first published references to the allegations are over a month old now. There is other biographical information included on Paulus in the article as well where sourceable.

<dd>I don't think anyone is suggesting that it be recorded in the Aiken/Paulus entries as proven fact, but I think it would be inaccurate to delete the controversy from the record. Fact: John Paulus has gone public with a claim. Fact: major media outlets around the world have reported it. That's called a scandal, and like most scandals (from Keeler to Lewinsky and beyond) it doesn't stand on firm factual ground, because it is subject to claim and counter claim. To pretend the scandal doesn't exist would be either naive or - worse - a sort of censorship, either because some Wikipedia users are Aiken fans, or narrow-minded. To be frank (with apologies to <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">User:Katefan0</a> who clearly believes that anyone with less than 100,000 Wikipedia edits to their name should belong to a silent sub-class) the Paulus entry should be tidied down to the barest details of the claim, the extent of its reportage and its status as proven/disproven, and it should be noted in the Aiken entry.

<dd>Whether John Paulus proves the claim and whether it is true, is irrelevant for wikipedia. What matters is that Paulus has come forward with a claim, and that the claim has received some level of notability. That's the only thing that counts. Not the motives of the article's creator, and not the truthfulness of the claim. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 18:07, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. I believe that this publication should maintain a higher standard. I refer you to the Aiken talk page, where attempts to insert Paulus' allegations began immediately upon publication. Even now, the story is not yet a month old. Six months from now, will anyone even remember John Paulus? The introduction of sockpuppets to this situation makes it even more suspect. It appears that there are a few people who wish to use Wikipedia as a means of promoting Paulus' career and/or to taint Aiken's.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is not in the business of tabloid news. If this story enters the pages of Wikipedia, it should be as a complete arc, not as a part of some sort of on-going "daily news" style process. There are other outlets for that kind of thing. -<a href="../../../j/m/h/User%7EJmh123_f81e.html" title="User:Jmh123">Jmh123</a> 19:56, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia is indeed not in the business of tabloid news, but it is also not in the business of opinionizing on public issues. If someone comes forward with a claim about a notable person (like Gennifer Flowers or Katelyn Faber have done before) and that claim reaches notability (as evidenced by the media who have taken up on this claim), it becomes notable enough for wikipedia. Even if the claim proves to be false and the claimant is an attention whore. But I most strongly and vehemently agree with you on the indesirability of possible sockpuppetry or meatpuppetry in this AfD. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 23:07, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>So is that what the qualification is?? If a story gets published in 5 or 10 (or whatever number you pick) tabloids and gossip columns, then it is valid for entry into Wikipedia?? Because there is a LOT of trash out there that meets that qualification, and you would be opening the door. Just saying . . . 66.82.9.58 20:04, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Point in fact: People magazine just published THIS WEEK: "Who's your favorite American Idol?' Clay 69%, Kelly 27%, Fantasia 4%". MSNBC just put Clay on their "IT" list YESTERDAY <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4043608/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4043608/" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> with the quote "With American Idol trouncing the Olympics and all other comers in the ratings, it is no suprise that <b>the most popular "Idol" contestant in the shows history</b> made our "IT" list.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I fail to see how a popularity poll influences the debate one way or the other. Wikipedia's own (current) definition of a sex scandal is "a scandal in which a public figure becomes embroiled in a situation where embarrassing sexual activities (or allegations of them) are publicized". Wikipedia even maintains a "list of sex scandals". It should also be pointed out there is a precedent for this debate ... in 2001 porn actor Chad Slater/Kyle Bradford claimed he had slept with Tom Cruise. That got widespread reportage "in gossip columns" and newspapers/tv/radio, and it is not only listed on the Tom Cruise page, Kyle Bradford has a Wikipedia entry of <i>his</i> own. If nothing else, Wikipedia should be consistent within itself. (<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhoby_3650.html" title="User:Whoby">Whoby</a> 00:43, 26 February 2006 (UTC))
<dl>
<dd>I agree that popularity is not an issue. The references were in response to Rabinids "repercussions extending to Aiken's career" logic. My point was that Paulus so far has NOT caused any repercussions (as evidenced by the People and MSNBC references) - and therefore Rabinids references have nothing to do with whether or not the Paulus article should or should not be kept. The Kyle Bradford comparison is faulty because Tom Cruise actually SUED, which was reported in mainstream news and made it notable. So far Paulus is just a pesky gnat being ignored by most of the world - not real news. 66.82.9.58 01:00, 26 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Given it's widespread reportage (Google it) I think your assertion that it's not "real" news is incorrect. Who are you to judge? The horse has bolted on that one - it's had wide dissemination in the news media, therefore it's news, full stop. (Perhaps not your kind of news, or just not news you like, but it's still news.) My point is this: it fulfils Wikipedia's own definition of a sex scandal, and there are comparable precedents (big name + pesky gnat) already on record in Wikipedia ... Tom Cruise/Kyle Bradford, Paula Abdul/Corey Clark etc. If you exise Paulus, then you have to exise every other unproven party in a sex scandal. If not, then it should not only be restored to the Aiken article, but frankly, it should be added to the "list of sex scandals".

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> as hoax unless backed up with strong verifiable references. No Google hits for him or his book besides Wikipedia and its mirrors, though there are a few for other people of the same name. The whole thing seems fake... for example, the claim that the tomb of someone who wrote just one book (of poetry, no less) is visited by "millions of people" each year. So the grave of an obscure poet with a single published work has roughly one-fifth the yearly foot traffic of, oh, <i>Disneyland</i>?

<li><b>Comment</b> if any editor cares to look at my record, they will find I've been active in working against systemic bias and have voted for and rescued articles from many non-English sources. I've also edited quite a few poetry articles, so that's my literary side talking and has nothing to do with racism.

<li><b>Keep</b>: The time since this software's initial public release is somewhat irrelevant, as this category of application is itself relatively new. A quick search of Wikipedia shows similar application listings, none which are both free and native in look-and-feel to someone interested in researching this particular category on OS X, demonstrating some value in keeping this entry available. Given the presence of other similar pieces of software and the relative youth of the category, in combination with the non-obvious software name (increasing the likelyhood that someone would need to look up its functionality), the page should stay. --Dannysauer 23:38, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I never said that I expected his vote to be given as much weight as an established user. It doesn't much matter, anyway, as the votes for "delete" outnumber the votes for "keep", but I do take issue with the implication that I am, in some way, trying to manipulate the system.

<p>I've been watching this article for a few months now, and all it does is act as a depository for redlinks to artists who'll most likely never have an article written about them. Whilst there <i>are</i> some notable artists redlinked, most of them are not. Thus, the article is practically useless, and only serves as a billboard for people to get their non-notable projects listed. Also, 'Category:Noise music' does a better job. <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 22:36, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think the purpose of this list is to serve as a code repository, but rather as an illustrated overview of different programming languages. The <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hello_world_program.html" title="Hello world program">hello world program</a> has a long tradition in introductions to specific programming languages. Even if this list is judged to be an unencyclopedic topic, its contents should first be <b>merge</b>d into the individual programming language articles. I'm not sure what "other lists of implementations" the nominations is referring to. If this is part of a systematic effort, perhaps a centralized discussion may be better. If not, this list can be judged on its own merits. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 23:13, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Update for amended nomination: I agree that "hello world" programs are generally too trivial to be of much pedagogical value. However, hello world programs have an established tradition, which should not be ignored completely. So let's either <b>keep one list of "hello world" programs (merge the two "hello world" lists)</b> –OR– <b>merge all "hello world" programs into their respective PL articles and delete both "hello world" lists</b>. Furthermore, let's <b>keep the list of Fibonacci programs</b>, since they illustrate the workings of a programming language (assignment, conditionals, recursion/iteration) much better. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 23:57, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>transwiki</b> to WikiBooks.

<dd><b>Comment</b> as much as I would like to vote keep, since this AfD seems unreasonable since the article <i>just</i> passed Afd, Jimbo is in fact right that it is original research, since the sources used are correspondence, which is pretty much as original research you can get. If the statements had been used in a printed source to support a similar argument, and that was referenced, it would not be. As it is, it is original research.

<li><i>Suggesting</i> the use of a technology that had already been around for five years at the time, and which had already proven its usefulness for building specialized knowledge bases in various implementations, is hardly the most remarkable achievement in the world. Everything was there -- the failing encyclopedia project with the funding, the social connections, the technology. It was natural for things to fall into place. Hence it is no surprise that Larry came up with the Wikipedia proposal independently one month later. If you want to give people credit, think more about <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Cunningham_d473.html" title="Ward Cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a> or <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clifford_Adams_127b.html" title="Clifford Adams">Clifford Adams</a> (the developer of the original wiki software used by Wikipedia, who also came up with one of the first <a href="../../../c/a/m/CamelCase_3f45.html" title="CamelCase">CamelCase</a>-free implementations).

<li>Delete. Having a separate article about Rosenfeld doesn't bring any clarity into the history.

What could be usefully added to the article about Rosenfeld that could not be added to any of these articles? His personal notability is not established and details from his personal life are therefore irrelevant. While having a Wikipedia article about you can be considered an honor, it can also be a huge PITA, and there's no reason we should inflict it on someone whose claim to fame is very doubtful at best. I suggest that those who are interested in digging into the history either improve the consistency and NPOV across the aforementioned range of articles, or start tracking down Rosenfeld and work on a nice story about the early days of Nupedia and Wikipedia for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a>, which welcomes original research like that.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 23:33, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The 'guy in the elevator' argument very much is apt. Jeremey was the first person to show me a wiki and suggest that it be used to solve the problems we had with Larry's Nupedia design. But Larry and I both agree that Larry showing it to me at a later day was causally relevant in a way that Jeremey's happening to show it to me was not. There are literally dozens of people who are very important to the history of Wikipedia, including for example Eloquence who has joined this thread, and who was instrumental in a number of ways in the entire process. (Did you know that the final formation of the Wikimedia Foundation was prompted when he called me on the phone to tell me to hurry up and do it?) Unless we're so strangely inwardly focussed that we think that every single person who played any small role in Wikipedia should have an article, this one clearly should go.

<dd>Okay, Jimbo, I'm theoretically happy to change my vote, but I'd be doing so on the basis of the idea that Rosenfeld had <i>absolutely nothing substantive</i> to do with the creation of Wikipedia (and I would also then be inclined to remove mention of him from the Sanger article, given that his mentioning the idea of a wiki to you prompted no action).

<dd>Jimmy's original research reasoning is incorrect (the article is as based on published sources about Wikipedia's history; that these happen to be Wikipedia mailing lists is irrelevant), that does not invalidate the AFD nomination.

<dd>Just for my own understanding, do mailing lists really count as published sources? They're clearly not physically published, they're not "peer reviewed", I'm a little confused by this. Frankly, I consider neither mailing lists nor blogs acceptable sources. Notability was the criteria for the last AfD, and it passed. Saying that the issue now is once again notability makes this seem like even more of a questionable Afd. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a><a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">emi</font></a> 00:19, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It depends on what you're trying to source. Otherwise you might as well throw away virtually all of the references on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html#References" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia#References</a>. Something you said on a mailing list does not become more factual because someone who writes for a peer reviewed journal decides to cite your mailing list post in a paper (as Joseph Reagle recently did); in fact, if you review his recent paper, you'll probably disagree with some of his interpretations and might even find yourself quoted out of context. Why not, then, quote the mailing list posts he himself cites directly? It is where sources are <i>interpreted</i> and judgments of notability or truth are made that we go into POV and original research territory, and this is where we should refer to authorities.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 00:36, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point is to get as close as possible to a primary source for a factual claim without adding elements of original research (results of personal interviews and studies that have not been published, hypotheses that have not been verified, valuations that are subjective, and so forth). If you want to make the factual claim "Climate models have been used by the IPCC to anticipate a warming of 1.4 °C to 5.8 °C between 1990 and 2100", then of course you need a scientific publication which backs up this claim. If you want to source the claim "<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Sullivan_6a55.html" title="Andrew Sullivan">Andrew Sullivan</a> has argued that the Republicans should take a more liberal stance on same-sex marriage", then of course Andrew Sullivan's blog is a good source for that (though an unalterable copy might be desirable in some cases). Virtually all our articles about Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia projects are, by necessity, based on Wikipedia's own electronic publications and project websites as sources; using some academic reference to make a claim about Wikipedia's history would actually be less useful in many cases, since you're moving further away from the primary source.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 00:29, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree to a certain extent. Encyclopedias are supposed to be <i>based</i> on secondary material, with the occasional <i>openly available</i> primary info to back up the claims made by the secondary material. This article is entirely based on primary source material, it's not just quoting Jimbo to support assertions made by secondary sources. Also, I don't know about the availability of this material. Could most people go on the internet and find it, outside of the wikipedia site? I think that's a real problem with original research. For instance, let's say that I went to a library in the middle of nowhere and looked at the papers of Athol Fugard. I could quote stuff that he said in his letters and stuff, it would be true, it would be verifiable if someone could get to the middle of nowhere and look at those same papers. But it's original research, because it's not published, it's not <i>reasonably</i> verifiable. If, however, the letters of Athol Fugard have been published, and a score of libraries has them, it would be reasonable to quote them, because they're publically available, verifiable, no longer quite such original research. Thus I maintain that although I find this article borderline notable, since I think that a person who started something notable on a particular path is thereby notable, it is original research and should be deleted. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a><a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">emi</font></a> 18:24, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
