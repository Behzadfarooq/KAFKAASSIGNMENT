<p>I know there was a VfD for this one already, but that was more than a year ago, and I think it needs to be reconsidered. This article is some of the most blatant POV I’ve seen yet on Wikipedia. Even the American mainstream media, which has a definite pro-Israel bias, does not refer to suicide bombings as massacres. “Massacre” is a very emotive word, and does not fit with the mission of being informative. A list like this should simply be called what it is – a “list of major suicide-bombings against Israel since 2000.” The page was designed to give readers the impressions that Israel has been victim of repeated “massacres,” while killings of Palestinians are left out. The Israel human rights group BtSelem, however, reports that more than three times more Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during this period than Israelis killed by Palestinians <a href="http://www.btselem.org/English/Statistics/Casualties.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.btselem.org/English/Statistics/Casualties.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The authors of this page claim that it wasn’t designed just for killings where the victims were Israelis, but the wording was cleverly designed to exclude any actions by the Israeli government, since of course it will always deny that any of their actions intentionally targeted civilians. So therefore none of them will ever appear on this list. So anyway, unless this article is dramatically changed, so as to remove the word “massacre” and either include violence against Palestinians or be clearly labeled as “violence against Israelis,” then it deserves to be <b>deleted</b> as POV propaganda. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 08:07, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - it's quite irrelevant that the list doesn't mention Palestinian casualties - nothing prevents creation of a similar list on numbers of Palestinians killed in specific Israeli actions - and putting a "See also" linking to it on the bottom of this page. I agree that "massacre" is a loaded word, but most of these events involved the deaths of 20+ people, so the title is not misleading... no objection to substituting "suicide bombings" for massacres. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 14:00, 2005 Jun 15 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, all lists are POV forks to some extent. Does the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_serial_killers_by_country.html" title="List of serial killers by country">List of serial killers by country</a> diminish mass murders (who kill equal numbers but in a shorter time) by not including them, because the authors of that article are concerned with one particular type of multiple killer? Does the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_war_crimes.html" title="List of war crimes">List of war crimes</a> diminish the deaths that happen as a result of non-war related genocide, or airplane crashes, or industrial accidents? We could have one giant "List of all events in which more than 10 people died at one time", but that would be mush, so we divide things up into neat categories that are bounded by identifiable markers. That's why lists of which people in country X (or conflict X) were killed by circumstance Y are legitimate. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 17:05, 2005 Jun 15 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, they could be investigated to see if they fit the description. I would assume that something which without warning deliberately kills, say, ten unarmed civilians going about their daily business would generally be described as a massacre, any effort to pretty it up would be adding a POV; sometimes things speak for themselves. Compare to the constant campaign to delete quotes from Ann Coulter from her wikipage because they make her look bad and thus are POV. We could put a comment in for each whether it was suicide bomb or more personal methodology if we're dubious about calling a suicide bombing a massacre. I don't know if ten is the accepted threshold for a massacre or not. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 16:16, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

The term "massacre" is an appropriate description for killings of large numbers of civilians at once, and I would consider it an accurate description of at least some of the events linked. However, 10 is probably too low a threshold (I used 50 myself), and Blackcats is certainly right to highlight the weasel wording that allows massacres by Israel to be kept out of the list. <b>Keep and cleanup</b>. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 17:16, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
