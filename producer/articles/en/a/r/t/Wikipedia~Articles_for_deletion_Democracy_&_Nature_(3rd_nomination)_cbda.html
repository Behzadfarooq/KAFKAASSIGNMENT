<li><b>Keep</b> Whilst the current article is far from perfect that is no reason to delete it. It is not true to say that the contents of the article are not verifiable.

<li>Well, this does appear to exist. I suppose copies my be found in somewhere that they keep books. It may even sit on a shelf next to a notable journal. But that's not the hurdle for inclusion. I see <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Democracy+%26+Nature%22+journal&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Democracy+%26+Nature%22+journal&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">less than ten thousand hits.</a> In the first ten pages I could not find it cited, or referenced, or reviewed. Simply statements that is exists, and that it sits on the shelves. Looking at <a href="http://news.google.com.au/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Democracy+%26+Nature%22+&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com.au/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Democracy+%26+Nature%22+&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">Google news</a> I see no hits. This is a very bad sign for something that is claiming to be an <i>"international theoretical journal"</i> of any note. On the desk next to me I have a copy of the <i>Journal of Modern Physics</i>. It's a real journal, too, but not a terribly notable one. Except it gets <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Journal+of+Modern+Physics%22&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=nw" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Journal+of+Modern+Physics%22&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=nw" rel="nofollow">186,000 Google hits</a> (almost 100,000 with <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Journal+of+Modern+Physics%22+references&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Journal+of+Modern+Physics%22+references&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">references</a>) and a pleasant suprise with <a href="http://news.google.com.au/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Journal+of+Modern+Physics%22" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com.au/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Journal+of+Modern+Physics%22" rel="nofollow">a news hit as well.</a> Not an impressive one, but trumps zero by a considerable margin.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I'm TheVel, Karmafist has blocked my address for a long time now and I don't know if he is ever going to stop, so I write without signing in (maybe he forgot to unblock me or something). I want to remind to brenneman that D&amp;N have stopped publishing for some time, and its successor, "International Journal of Inclusive Democracy", is an on-line magazine. He cannot compare D&amp;N with journals that are still publishing issues, especially with journals about physical siences, which of course concern far more people in contrast with journals of social sciences (especially if the latter are radical)! I want again to stress that if our criteria depends solely on popularity and google search (instead of qualitative criteria, like the contributors, the members of the international advisory board, the length of the publication etc) then we are just adopting to the standards of our massive society that promotes explicitly the popular (no matter what it might be, right or not) and not knowledge. Do I dare to vote here? Yes, I vote <b>Keep</b>, since I'm a member for a few months and I've done some editing here. Respect my vote. New users should be allowed to vote if they support with reasonable arguments their votes. TheVel, 10 Janyary 2006, 12:55
<ul>
<li>Well, no one should be "voting" really, but anyone who tries to tell you that you can't provide evidence and support it with a persuasive argument is doing both you and Wikipedia a disservice. The whole "new user" this is complicated, but thank you for pointing that out to me regarding being out of print. I was aware of it, but I will consider further how the metric should scale. Thanks again. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 11:11, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:I have been a reader of Wikipedia entries for some time and as was surfing it yesterday I saw the entry on Democracy &amp; Nature, the site of which I have used several times in the past for research. I was surprised to see the deletion nomination and I wrote a comment to this effect. To my surprise, I saw today that some administrators called me and many others (presumably because they do not belong to their closed club) as 'sockpuppets'. I am not a sockpuppet of anybody and I do not accept to be insulted as such by any so-called 'administrators' clearly abusing their power. I don't know whether you have the right to rule out any comments by new users that you do not like but certainly you do not have the right to insult users. OK?

<li><b>KEEP</b> Two nomination on AfD failed and not without good reason! So many scholars and intellectuals that do not adopt Inclusive Democracy have contributed there! What else is needed! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.16.239.115 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.16.239.115_30ce.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.16.239.115">contribs</a>).</small> (user's first edit)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Two nominations failed? Also I have to say its extremly irritating to keep seeing (user's first edit) after comments. Surely the closing admin can work that out themselfs, and frankly it makes it sound like your saying "You cant play my game cos you're new!" like some spoilt brat.

<ul>
<li>So you're not saying keep because it's encyclopedic, or because it contributes to the sum of human knowledge, or because it's notable and people may want to look it up. You're voting keep because you're petulant about the edit count notices? This is more important to you than WP:NPOV or WP:V? - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 00:22, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Frankly I'm bored with people who want an article deleted demanding an explanation as to why people voted <b>Keep</b>. You can see very well my reasoning in my previous post. If you think the article has POV issues, go and tidy them up. If you have time to post calling me names you most certainly have time to do that. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 01:26, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry that you're "bored". I can only council you to see <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Discussion" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion#Discussion</a> where is says quite explicitly <i>"Always explain your reasoning."</i> A specific and testable statement lends itself to discussion, a vague complaint about behavior in the AfD does not. And, "frankly", I could not find reasoning in what you had provided, so I asked. You've now made yourself more clear: POV is not a reason to delete. So, if can determine that this article cannot be made NPOV, would <b>that</b> be a reason to delete? - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 02:36, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm sure no one will begrudge your right to privacy with your mates. However, given the user's experience, I am also certain that he could produce oodles of text to justify his vote. I therefore assume good faith and believe his opinion should count. What is more troubling is your propensity to only question votes that do not adhere to your line of thinking. In my opinion, that sort of rigid tunnel vision is best avoided if we want to build a viable project that serves the interests of all users. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 05:36, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, it a bit of a slog. Crappy edit summaries all around don't help.

If the reason that this can't be made NPOV is about <i>personality</i> then this isn't a matter for AfD.

<li><b>Keep</b>&#160;:: IMHO the opionions expressed by some of the above deletionsists point to an agenda designed to censor Wiki-content that does not concur with their POV or to exclude an article becuase of its writer not its content.
