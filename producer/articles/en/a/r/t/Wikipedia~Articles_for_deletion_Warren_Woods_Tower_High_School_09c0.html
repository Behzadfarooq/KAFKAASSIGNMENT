<li><b>Delete</b>, just another school like any other. The existence, nature, history, and development of schools are all very important topics that deserve extensive discussion. Individual schools that do not stand out from the crowd in any way are <i>not</i> important; their existence is a random fact, not a part of human knowledge. We have articles on cherry trees in general, but not on the rather fine example outside my window, even though its existence is easy to verify; we have articles on prominent people, but not on me, even though I can find plenty of independent sources that discuss me; we have articles on the telephone, but we do not include lists of phone numbers.<br />
