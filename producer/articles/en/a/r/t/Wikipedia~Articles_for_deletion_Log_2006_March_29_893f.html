<li>Am I reading the Google hits thing wrong? Because the description above says it only has 125 hits, but when I click it I see 1,540.
<ul>
<li>For some reason, when I click on it now, the amount of links is reduced to under 80. I'm counting the amount of "unique hits", you can find out the unique hits by clicking through the google pages until the end. The reason I count unique hits only is because for webcomics, literally thousands of hits are all from one site like buzzcomic. And I had a look at your additions to the article too, they're pretty informative additions too, but I just don't think that singular drunkduck comics do not have that large a following. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 15:38, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I dunno, is it really fair to judge a comics viability based on its choice of hosting service? I really think that the comic should be looked at as a seperate entity from Drunk Duck.</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete:</b> I definitely believe that this comic falls under the "noteable" category, as it is the top-read comic on DrunkDuck, and it was nominated for several prestigious awards at BuzzComix, but has since opted not to compete for awards. This does not change the fact that it was obviously of a high enough quality that it was nominated in the first place. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExperimentmonty_1859.html" title="User:Experimentmonty">Experimentmonty</a></li>
<li>Do Not Delete. I second the above reasoning.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> High quality, several award nominations and a large fanbase.

<li><b>Keep</b> As above --85.12.80.1 07:01, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> 1,620 hits on Google. The wiki page is second.</li>
<li>Do Not Delete. This comic has been around for a while, and was once in the top 10 on webcomicslist.com (which is now defunct).</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - 1,620 hits is not notable by my standards -sorry. --<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> 19:18, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> E&amp;A is the webcomic that got me hooked on webcomics. I have yet to see another that can really compare. The hosting's only part in the comics standings is that because the hosting was crap for so long, the comic lost a fair bit of its following. We're coming back, but you can't judge its validity or lack thereof so soon after such a major crash. This comic has been around for years, is well produced, is near a thousand strips, and has a major loyal following. If webcomics list were up I have no doubt it would be in the top ten. This sounds like a cornerstone of the webcomic industry to me, not a negligible side note. Do not delete this, please.</li>

<li>Now now, there's no need to attack Drunk Duck; I've seen a lot of very quality work come from there. They provide a helpful service and don't ask for anything in return. Anyway, although E&amp;A is an important comic to me, I have to admit that it does not meet Wikipedia's standards for inclusion.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: 8 Easy Bits has a fundamental uniqueness to it. So far as I know, no other webcomic shares its premise or style.

<li><b>Week Keep</b>: I have little experience with Wikipedia itself, but I have helped work on other Wikis. I feel that a Wiki is for informational purposes about everything, no matter how mundane. I have found other articles in Wikipedia that had less of a reason to be here than this, and they're not being discussed for information. Why? Because it's handy. Give this webcomic a chance, and spread the word rather than pushing it back into oblivion. --<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirAPKered_ecb2.html" title="User:SirAPKered">SirAPKered</a> (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SirAPKered_a1fd.html" title="Special:Contributions/SirAPKered">contribs</a>) 12:32, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - If you take a look at "eight easy bits" on Google now, it only gives back <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22eight+easy+bits%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22eight+easy+bits%22" rel="nofollow">45 unique hits</a> and about 300 in total. The reason for the high amount of links beforehand was because Google was indexing roughly 3000 links for a forum user with "eight easy bits" in his signiture. I do disagree with the synopsis that being launched in 2003 makes for a long running webcomic, it has only managed 97 strips and if you look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">List of webcomics</a>, you'll find many more webcomics which have lasted much longer. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 22:18, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Eight Easy Bits comics tend to be at least three to four times as long as typical webcomics, and have exceeded seventy panels on a single page. Not to mention that it's a very sprite-intensive comic, with sprites and graphics extracted from many different NES games. You can't dismiss it out of hand based on the "97 strips" criterion. <a href="../../../l/e/b/User%7ELebob_0e74.html" title="User:Lebob">Lebob</a></li>

<li><b>keep</b> The Wikipedia policy says nothing about notability. It merely states that it isn't a dumping ground for random information, and with the organization and content in the article, it isn't random information. 07:24, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the comic is often linked by other webcomic authors, and thus seems to be somewhat notable, at least in the webcomic community. "Notability" is such a fuzzy criteria anyway, and there's little to no mention of it in Wikipedia policies. This does not seem to be a vanity or advertising page, and that's the closest thing on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> to a "notability" requirement that I can find. --<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeartBurn_Kid_1f88.html" title="User:HeartBurn Kid">HBK</a>|<a href="../../../h/e/a/User_talk%7EHeartBurn_Kid_0c33.html" title="User talk:HeartBurn Kid">Talk</a> 16:07, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Due to the fact that Hannchann's own links link to 916 and 11,600 sites respectively, I find the statement to have little merit. It is linked to by VG cats, whose author is himself quite notable, giving it plenty of merit in the webcomic world. Beyond that, several of the comics written are four or five pages long, giving the sparse updates a good reason. --Funk Masta K 00:15, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> While I personally don't hold any strong like or dislike of this webcomic, and I'm sure that my opinion isn't as valid or accepted as some more established members, it seems that it has some notable points. The comic is linked by VGCats, it has been online for something like three years. It's fans seemed to believe that it was worthy of an entry, which show's that people feel strongly about the influence of the comic. The entry seemed somewhat well written and I don't actually see any reason for the entry to be deleted, though I don't see much of a reason for it to remain either. -- Moggy 05:17, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

I believe that he should be allowed to continue to contribute to other areas of the project, but he has shown vast amounts of immaturity in regards to deletion in his defense, nomination, and support of deletion of articles.

If the domain name remains expired, the terms of this entry deletion might be different. (Ex - Votes to keep to preserve the history of the comic.) Perhaps it would be best to make sure if the domain will be renewed before continuing with the discussion of deleting this entry.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It does have a proper citation. "How to Make a Sprite Comic in Eight Easy Bits" is the entire name of the webcomic. How else would you put it? And why doesn't it belong here? It's not advertising, as the author of the comic was unaware of its creation until someone pointed it out to him (or so he claims), and it's well written. A bit more professionalism would be good, but other than that, it's quite descriptive and is up to date. Besides, plenty of comics, especially webcomics, don't become famous from the get-go. It's a well written comic, one that lies under the shadow of its crude presentation (the website, which is just the comic, is pretty ugly). I'd be willing to bet that if the site were to get a complete makeover, it'd receive a lot more traffic.206.248.72.52 05:00, 5 April 2006 (UTC)Ipsum</li>

<p>This is why the "5000" is a guideline, not a rule. I've been quoted in several papers with a daily publication of several million; I get a few hundred ghits (and I have a non-common name), and I've been quoted on Fox News. I'm just a dopey college student and I don't rate a wiki article. Getting quoted in a paper is not alone a sign of notability, regardless of how popular the paper is.

<dd>Im not debating your notability, and further, he has not been simly quoted, he has been called as a representative of a nation wide movement, and also given time to talk long about his issues on both TV and Radio!

<dd>He's the media coordinator for a website the purports to front for the entire "9-11 Truth Movement" I'm using myself as an example why his credentials aren't that impressive. I know I'm not notable, yet in my uninteresting undergraduate career I'm still managed to pretty much match his media credentials. And I'm not even trying to pass myself as the rep for some movement.

<dd>You seem to have something against the French&#160;;-) And yes, I was quoted on Fox News because I couldn't get an interview taped before the story broke.

And it does not matter if he is <i>truuly</i> the representative of them, he was there <i>as the</i> representeative of the 9/11 movement. Further, i challenge you to find one single 9/11 movement activist rejecting him as a notable and prominent representative of the movement. angain, he was not quoted or taped, he was there <i>live</i> on both the tv and now, yesturday, on local radio, and he is working on a movie that will break in 10 days. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 22:58, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> isn't a guideline; it's mentioned on a guideline page only as a proposal, and if you bothered to follow the link to the proposal itself, you'd see that the version you favor has been rather solidly rejected, and the existing proposal (still under development) is quite different. As for <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Amy_77d6.html" title="Air Force Amy">Air Force Amy</a>, I cite the recent Afd <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Air_Force_Amy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Air_Force_Amy" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> as a precedent (as other editors cite previous AfD decisions), and don't pretend that that there's a consensus WP:Air Force Amy policy or guideline. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 14:56, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's called a "standard" -- they DO have standards in Texas, right? -- and it's widely accepted as such, no matter how much handwaving you and Monicasdude do. More to the point, as a standard for article creation, it's not up to me to prove anyone fails it, it's up to you to prove he passes it -- or are tests done differently in Texas? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:25, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's not a matter of how things are done in Texas, its a matter of how they are done on Wikipedia. The deletion process states "When in doubt, don't delete"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> In other words, the default position is always to keep the article - the burden of proof falls to anyone who wants it to be deleted to achieve at least rough consensus to do so. And I notice that once again you make a gratiuitous comment about Texas, rather than sticking to the substance of the issue at hand. Perhaps that is because there is no substance to your nomination for deletion? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 05:45, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To my way of thinking, this is absolutely not a POV fork; people are playing fast and loose with that term. A <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_fork_623c.html" title="POV fork">POV fork</a> occurs when someone can't get their edits accepted on a page so they create another one for those edits - say, their belief that John Kerry is a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martian.html" title="Martian">Martian</a> keep getting reverted on <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a>, so they create the article Viewpoint that John Kerry is a Martian. <b>That's</b> a POV fork. This article doesn't exist to sneak information on the 9/11 commission through the back door that way; this article exists to point out the fact that some people are calling it a Whitewash Commission. Which is a perfectly legitimate thing to point out, just not something that necessitates an entire article. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 17:23, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>If an article was created that said "<b>Tricky Dick</b> is a nickname for Richard Nixon," that would not constitute a POV fork.

<p>Most of the article's content is speculative. It appeared as a tech demo, showing off the GBA's capabilities at E3. It was never spoken of again. It makes no more sense than an article on the Zelda SW tech demo, or the Mario 128 tech demo, or the FFVII tech demo. Additionally, the same itself is speculative, and most of the article's content is a quote of a provided link. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 10:30, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>...Yes, a tech demo. Not a game, a tech demo. It'd be like if the PSX had a tech demo of a vase that you could examine. Are you saying that every single tech demo deserves an article? And as for Super Mario 128, that is not just a tech demo. It was the name given to his next game. I was referring TO the tech demo, which became Pikmin, not a Mario game. This is not a game, this is a single video of a demo that was not intended to become a game. It was not announced, named or cancelled. It was a tech demo featuring a single level that was not intended to be anything more. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 11:02, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Mario 128 is just a tech-demo right now. The game will most definitely not feature 128 Marios running around as in the tech demo. In the same way, this tech demo does not necessarily have to show in-game footage in order for it to be considered a tech demo. - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkhawk_b946.html" title="User:Darkhawk">Darkhawk</a> (29 March, 2006 @ 17:30 EST)

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. I originally tagged this article for speedy, but its creator, Captain Internet twice removed the tag, appending the last time a comment to the effect that he would improve the article so as to demonstrate the subject's notability. I construed this as a "hangon" request and consequently tagged the article for "hangon" (I moved his message to the talk page, where also I explain my reasoning for applying the "hangon" tag on an article that I tagged for speedy); nevertheless, as the searches above demonstrate clearly, there is no notability to be demonstrated, whatever Captain Internet might add to the contrary. Thus, I think that JzG was altogether correct to bring this to AfD and that, even as typically it might be indecorous of us to support deletion of a page that has been tagged "hangon" (or has been edited in such a way as to reflect "hangon" sentiments, notwithstanding the failure properly to tag the article), here the subject is empirically shown to be non-notable and we needn't to wait for edits to the article. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 18:29, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I'm the one who made the entry. There were confusing problems that led to a duplicate entries so I'd feel fine about everything being deleted and starting all over again, as long as someone doesn't come along and, without doing any research, figures since <b>he</b> hasn't heard of Baron Wolman he doesn't belong in Wikipedia! Feel free to remove all the duplication or whatever. It looks like you've determined that Baron Wolman is a worthy inclusion. You removed the photo which his assistant took.

<li><b>Keep</b>, decent enough Google Scholar profile. There seem to be cultural differences between Euro-American users and others about how to assert professorial notability, but that's not a good reason to keep deleting articles on subjects who have (at least) reasonable claims to notability, often on very notable subjects. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 14:57, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm not convinced that he is notable as an academic: a senior lecturer is roughly the equivalent of associate professor. Unless it can be established that he is a world-leader in his field (in which case, why isn't he a full professor?), I think we have to assume insufficient notability. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 21:05, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Dr Ugail may not be a world leader in his field, but since the Republic of Maldives has only 300,000-odd citizens, I think he counts as a notable national figure. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 22:24, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Dr Ugail has a credible list of publications recorded in his university staff page <a href="http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/staff/index.php?type=pu&amp;u=hugail" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. He has contributed articles to major international research journals and international conferences in his field. Despite being relatively young (34 years old to date) he has major research grants (e.g. see for example <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewDepartment.aspx?Organisation=196&amp;bannerlink=Institution+summary&amp;Department=17338" class="external autonumber" title="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewDepartment.aspx?Organisation=196&amp;bannerlink=Institution+summary&amp;Department=17338" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>). Though one may not consider him to be a world leading figure (eg. not a professor) one should also note his rate of progress in his career. For example, within a short space of 2.5 years he has been promoted to Senior lecturer which the usual academics take on average 10+ years. He is certainly a notable and respected figure in the Republic of Maldives. More importantly he is a source of motivation to many young Maldivians.</li>

<p><strike>*<b>Weak Keep</b>. There's already an apparent consensus that Lost characters are notable enough for Wikipedia - and this is a recurring character in Lost.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Normally I vote against the lists I find on AfD. But this list has some value because an attempt has been made to classify the news aggregators into various categories. So it isn't just an indiscriminate list. It's a useful supplement to the <a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggregator.html" title="Aggregator">news aggregators</a> article. If some of the links could be wikified to reduce the linkspamming, then I would vote for a stronger keep. I see the links as a problem, but not the list itself. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 17:00, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It doesn't matter if the list has been sorted or not, it remains a violation of Wikipedia policy to have an article that is a mere collection of external links. If the article was a list of internal articles about agregators, such as List of news web sites, that would be fine. As it is, there is no way to guess at which sites are worthy of inclusion and which were added as spam. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeL_c5a8.html" title="User:GraemeL">GraemeL</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraemeL_c70d.html" title="User talk:GraemeL"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:31, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with what you say. But I don't think this is a "mere collection of external links". This is an <b>annotated</b> list, with additional information like capabilities and compatibility of the aggregators. While most of the aggregators have external links, I counted 13 wikilinks without external links, which convinces me the author has tried to find internal links where possible and is not intentionally spamlinking. Someone put a lot of work into this list.<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 17:47, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>One more point. The example you gave of a "good" list, List of news web sites, is not useful at all. This list can be replaced by a category because all the links are just pointers to wiki articles, and there is no additional content that expands on the meaning of the list. If it was deleted, no information would be lost. So its a good candidate for deletion/replacement with a category. That cannot be said of the article which is the subject of this debate. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 17:56, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> - If there is a Web site out there with pretty much the same info (or better), I vote to put a link to it on the News Aggregators article and delete this one.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: "No encyclopedic content whatsoever" is a lie, just read the entries and they give a small description of the programs (which is good for comparing the options to others. The article could and should be strengthened with more detailed feature information.

<p>I can't make up my mind whether to speedy this one as an attack or whether to flag it for extreme cleanup to remove the POV. The answer, I guess, hinges on whether the guy is thought notable.

<p>There is no need for this.

There is no discussion of anything about the translations, just a bare list. We have a sidebar with links to wikipedias in other languages, and for this particular topic, we have <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_in_translation_3067.html" title="Harry Potter in translation">Harry Potter in translation</a> which actually has some interesting content, including a list of languages the books have been translated into.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Who is to say there's no need for this information? Personally, I find the list kind of interesting. While the books have articles in the other languages, they dont neccessarily have articles in <i>every</i> language that the books have been translated into. Further, it's easier to read through a list than to manually click onto a foreign language wiki, where its less likely to be understandable, because well, it's in a foreign language. Also a nice thing about this article is that there are occasional translations back into English, showing how the translator chose to represent the book titles&gt; For example, the article notes that in German, <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> is <i>Harry Potter und die Kammer des Schreckens</i> (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Fear), or that the French version of the first book is <i>Harry Potter at the School of Wizards</i>. You're not neccessarily going to get that from a foreign language wiki. At the most, this information could be <i>merged</i> into <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_in_translation_3067.html" title="Harry Potter in translation">Harry Potter in translation</a>, but I think there's enough information there to merit keeping it in it's own article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The concern with this list is that it consists of titles of each Potter book translated into another language, in the script most used for that language. Most of it is likely incomprehensible to the majority of English Wikipedians, either because they don't know the language, the script, or both. Where the script is comprehensible (or even preferred), the user is better off reading about it in that tongue (and script) elsewhere. The second issue we have to confront is how to maintain this? There is, incredibly for such a long list, not a single reference. Wikipedia is a very welcoming encyclopedia, but it has certain constraints. We do not have a panel of expert editors or professional peer-reviewers or teams of expert translators. We cannot reasonably be expected to maintain a list in the mainspace which the vast majority of us can't even read (with understanding). This was a novel idea, and I wish I could support its inclusion, but given the above concerns I can't. —<i><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;cursor:crosshair;"><b>Encephalon</b></span></a> 01:36, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</i></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The idea has merit, it just needs to be better organized and focused. Perhaps re-ordering it by region, rather than title. Also, the inclusion of English translations and images of the book covers would make this a much more useful entry. Definitely worth fixing, not deleting.<a href="../../../r/h/i/User%7ERhindle_The_Red_036b.html" title="User:Rhindle The Red">Rhindle The Red</a> 12:55, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If Wikipedia existed in the early twentieth century and you posted an article about Picaso before he became famous, or if anyone else did, it should have been deleted because it is impossible tl tell for sure who will be a famous artist or musician.

<dd>Gallwapa - what you are saying may very well be correct, and warrants some investigation - however, "WorldWide Dream Builders" would appear to be a different entity than the World Wide Group.

<dd>Well, to me, it treads too close to a indiscriminate collection of information. We could have List of people who work in factories where M16 parts are made, too, but it wouldn't have any encyclopedic value either. As I said on the talk page, this could all be covered by a single sentence in <a href="../../../m/1/6/M16_rifle.html" title="M16 rifle">M16 rifle</a>. But, I realize not everyone may agree with that, hence the Afd. Even if people want to keep, does anyone have an opinion on whether M4 Carbine in popular culture should be a seperate artice? It was a redirect for a while but was recently reverted. If we must have such a list, so be it, but do we need <i>seperate</i> lists for every different variation of the rifle? There are verifiability concerns there- see my comments on Talk:M4_Carbine_in_popular_culture. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:11, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Wikipedia is not a collection of trivia. The M16 and its variants are so ubiquitous it's pointless to name every movie or video game it appeared in. I doubt there's really a <b>significant appearance</b> like a flight sim might be for an aircraft. This isn't a rare gun that appeared in one or two movies; it appears in practically every modern war movie and modern FPS. It'd be like a Honda Civic in popular culture article with an entry for every 2-bit film where you could see the Civic parked somewhere--<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 16:07, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Weeding out "2-bit" appearences would require a cleanup tag (or at worst involve a dispute over page content) not a AFD.

I don't have a problem with having a "Popular culture" section within an article, <i>as long as it is kept short and under control</i>. However, as soon as people spot a trivia section, they have an uncontrollable urge to add something they've spotted at their favorite movie or game, and it gets out of hand.

<li><b>Comment</b> Whether a page is notable or not would be a dispute over page content, which could be handled in turn by those concerned (perhaps being handled by a major cast memeber?).

I would also point out FN P90 in popular culture was proposed for deletion, h had similar arguments levled against it and the result was to keep. Finally, I would support doing a proper merger of AR-15 related firearms into one popculture page. The idea of adding stricter guidlines could also be a good alternative deletion.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: If people really think there could be an <i>article</i> here, not just a list, why not work on Guns in popular culture or something? Does the M16 family specifically have a different impact on popular culture than any other group of similiar rifles? Is anyone actually saying that an AR15 with a 20-inch barrel has a different impact on popular culture than an AR15 with a 14-inch barrel? I think we're either going to end up with a simple list (which should go away for not being an article) or a bunch of original research about the impact of specific models of guns on culture (which should go away for being original research.) <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 22:56, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're coming at it backwards. The logic is... weapon X is notable, and gets an article. In some cases, specific usage in popular culture (movies, games, sometimes books or other) is sufficiently notable to include in that article. In some cases, there's so much of that info that splitting it off seems like the right thing to do. It's perfectly reasonable to question whether that info should be notable; I did so a few months ago, but the conclusion keeps coming up "yes". As long as it's notable enough to keep somewhere, how do we organize it... which is the real problem. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 23:02, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Maybe there's no getting around the fundamental disagreement. Tools are great topics for an encyclopedia. This is why we have <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sledgehammer.html" title="Sledgehammer">sledgehammer</a>. Notice that we do <i>not</i> have List of people who have used a sledgehammer or List of stores that sell sledgehammers. If reputable sources are talking about the impact of guns on popular culture, by all means someone can make an article about that. Keeping lists for individual guns (and, worse yet, even variations of the same gun) doesn't make sense to me until someone produces a reliable source that says that gun X has a different impact on popular culture than gun Y. I think we're getting this sort of stuff mostly because it's videogame-related, not because it belongs in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 23:09, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

No idea why it was AFD'd, ask User:Andyru. Just listing it properly. kotepho 18:45, 29 March 2006 (UTC) This article was nominated for deletion before when I was extremely new to Wikipedia. The argument was not presented well. Please take a look at the following discussions: [ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/William_Oosterman" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/William_Oosterman" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/William_Oosterman</a> ] [ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Williamo1" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Williamo1" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Williamo1</a> ] [ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Citywide_Church" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Citywide_Church" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Citywide_Church</a> ]</p>
<p><b>Delete:</b> user Williamo1 (and his socks) are using this article as a personal soapbox. Look at the edit history. Any person just diving into this issue is going to be immediately horrified at the past of Roy Gordon Lawrence. However, nobody on Wikipedia ever cared about him before Williamo1 first created the page. It was created in a manner to portray public informance (seems justified)... however, quickly has turned into a personal vendetta and soapbox for him. Williamo1 seems to be using this as a sex offender registry, tracking the whereabouts of this person. He pays no heed to the fact this man has changed his lifestyle form his past and pokes fun as his current life as well as tried to descredit the church he attends by suggesting all sorts of crazy things (saying he won't cooperate with police etc.) This article either needs to be deleted to remove the soapbox (which only Williamo1 cares about), or at least its history should be deleted (kept as current) and Williamo1 and his IP should be banned from further edits (I don't wish to edit it either). Note that nobody in Wikipedia cared about this subject matter except Williamo1 (and myself) -- though a few people have stepped in to help control the POV editing by Williamo1 and another stepped in to help format the article better.

<li>Note: I recognize that relisted this as AFD may (at first glance) seem like the wrong approach -- at it may be. I tried RFC once, and had no response (though I wonder if I did it correctly). Please have a look at the links I listed above... it does take a little time to understand the soapbox allegation -- with a little looking you'll see exactly what I mean. Advice appreciated -- I hope I've stated things clearly enough, as a first glance at this issue won't provide you with enough info to see where I'm coming from Andyru 17:26, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Generally, we don't delete articles because old versions had problems. Also, I can't tell from your comments if you're seriously suggesting List of known paedophiles and their current addresses or if that was sarcasm (in any event, I wouldn't want such a list here).

If we are to debate honestly the merits of retaining this article, it has to be on the basis of notability. This man's notability ultimately derives from acts he committed 15 years ago. I don't see national or international press coverage of these events; I don't see wide or constantly maintained press interest in this individual and, although I note <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a>'s point about paper -v- Web, I don't see widespread Internet coverage. The fact that the subject held a responsible position when he committed crimes may interest or titillate us, but I do not believe that it confers notability. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 15:01, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you don't feel there was *sufficient* national coverage. But surely you acknowledge there was national coverage. You're statement "<i>I don't see national or international press coverage of these events</i>" seems to ignore coverage in a national magazine, as well as newspapers from Alberta, BC, and Ontario. That is national coverage. Again, I'm fine if you don't think that's sufficient. But you're making a literal mistatement. It's also offensive to suggest this is done to "<i>titillate us</i>". Read the article. There's no "titillation". And yes, I concede your point that in 1991 there was not "<i>widespread Internet coverage</i>" (I don't see how you note my point, then seem to miss it). Can I ask you if you actually read the cited offline news stories (which is necessary to have a basis for the opinions you expressed)? Again, I got no problem with people deciding this is not notable, in their opinion, but I object to what I see are factual errors expressed.. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 15:15, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right - I should have been more specific and stated that I didn't see any <i>significant</i> national coverage. My point about the Internet is that it is reasonable to expect a greater Internet presence for anyone notable enough for an online encyclopaedia - no matter when the events happened. I don't believe I suggested the article was designed to titillate people, and I'm afraid I disagree that it is necessary to read the offline news stories to express an opinion on the notability of this individual. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 17:05, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm quite fine with you deleting this article. But, I seriously hope you would agree that there are many other articles, that are supported largely by offline sources, which very much warrant inclusion, and are of great value (note: I'm talking of other articles here, not this one). Some of the best references for articles are still on paper. The fact we're online in no way means we should hostile to offline sources. In fact, the offline sources are often more reliable than online ones. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:25, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Extremely minor character from "Powerhouse," a short story by <a href="../../../e/u/d/Eudora_Welty_46b3.html" title="Eudora Welty">Eudora Welty</a>. A <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~DRBR/welt_pwr.html" class="external text" title="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~DRBR/welt_pwr.html" rel="nofollow">transcription</a> of the story reveals that "Uranus Knockwood" is simply a name on a telegram. This might be worthy of note on a page about the short story "Powerhouse" or <i>Thirteen Stories</i>, the collection containing "Powerhouse" (neither currently exists), but as a separate article it's bound to remain a minor stub at best. I'd bet this was added more for the silliness of the name than for any encyclopedic content.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the namespace is incorrect. Aside from the obvious formatting issue, there's no evidence that Uranus Knockwood's middle initital is "P". - <a href="../../../r/y/n/User%7ERynne_b8d8.html" title="User:Rynne">Rynne</a> 18:03, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do not delete</b>OK. Y'all are a bunch of squares and tools. Now, I can understand that y'all care about Wikipedia. However, why do you have to actively go around enforcing the rules. This should be done passively. For example, if you're browsing along and you find the article for <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heritage_College_9a3c.html" title="Heritage College">Heritage College</a> (the only page this was linked to) and you look under notable alumni and you're like who is this Jonas THE STEAMROLLER Graham and then you look and you're like: "Oh. Not worthy of a Wikipedia article. (yet!)" and so you delete it, then I would be fine with that. But as far as I can tell, y'all have nothing to do with "Hurtige" so you do this for no point. You're just doing this enforce the rules. But rules are made for a reason: because breaking them causes harm to others. But seriously: how much harm does this cause? Think about it: how much harm does this cause? I stole 2mb or so from Wikipedia: big deal. Do you know how much bandwidth you're wasting by continuously going back to my page to make sure I haven't removed the "some square wants to delete this page" thing? I'll give you an analogy here: imagine you're a cop. Do you go around looking for people smoking weed and drinking in parks after midnight or do you go around looking out for more serious things such as assault and arson and stuff? Of course if you see somebody smoking weed in front of children or something whilst patrolling, or if you get a call that a bunch of drunken kids are threatening to burn down houses near the park, you might go and charge them for one of those MINOR crimes. But actively pursuing the small stuff is just not worth it. In fact, the fact that y'all care so much makes me pity you! What do you gain from doing this? Only a reputation for being a stiffly stifferson, you stiffly stifferson. Just ignore it and you'll hardly notice it. But no... despite the fact that you don't get paid for it, you've got to waste your time enforcing all the stupid rules and stuff that nobody cares about. Way to go! But I am willing to compromise: if y'all give me a week to show it off to my friends, you can delete it after that.

<li><i>Comment:</i> I don't see why we can't have the topic mentioned in two places. It would be harder to find the it if it were embedded in "non-piercing body jewelry". People already reading about non-piercing body jewelry could be interested in this topic as well, but I'm sure that there are others looking just for info on anal jewelry. It's definitely informative, as I certainly did not know there was such a thing as anal jewelry until I saw the article.
<p>Also, I agree with Easyas12c in that this entry was not in clear view of visitors until it was listed on the AFD page.

<p><s>It's a one-man hit piece on a non-notable individual.

<p><s><b>Delete</b> this article and <b>do not merge</b> into <a href="../../../t/u/t/Tuttle%2C_Oklahoma_d59c.html" title="Tuttle, Oklahoma">Tuttle, Oklahoma</a> (indeed delete the info about Jerry in that article also.) This is a funny but unbelievably minor occurance (and yes, it is why I looked up the city) that just isn't appropriate for Wikipedia. It was broken by the Reg and then picked up as an 'oddly enough' piece by Slashdot (note the foot), Digg, Reddit et al. Nowhere else in the media. No lawsuit, FBI, nothing, just an obnoxious email exchange from a manager who got out the wrong side of the bed and doesn't understand computers. It's a funny story that will be forgotten within a week - no, ok, maybe a month. _If_ it develops into a significant lasting internet meme or "tuttled" gains traction I do of course retract this. In that case I think the incident should be recorded here (it was Jerry as a person that was involved in this) rather than on the <a href="../../../t/u/t/Tuttle%2C_Oklahoma_d59c.html" title="Tuttle, Oklahoma">Tuttle, Oklahoma</a> page; it's an incident concerning Jerry, not the town. A single line in the town article referencing Jerry would then be enough (as with <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploding_whale.html" title="Exploding whale">exploding whale</a>, something that doesn't happen every day.) -- <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlorg_b615.html" title="User:Blorg">Blorg</a> 21:13, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<p>Comparisons don't necessarily mean anything. Just because someone is compared to someone else, does not necessarily make them as good as that artist. Comparisons are even more pointless when it's with another great musician. Are we going to put an article comparing the Beatles to the Stones? No. They're both good, similar in some ways, different in others. Imagine if we compiled a list of musicians compared to the Beatles. That would be every post-1970 band in existence!<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkhawk_b946.html" title="User:Darkhawk">Darkhawk</a> 22:16, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes, you are both correct. I've been thinking about this, so to clarify my position. I think this is one case where Wikipedia is Not Paper might not apply. I would much rather leave such lists up to expert music critics. Don't get me wrong, I'm ready to watch the page; but for someone to cite such a claim in a paper or akin should come from a reputable music source such as Billboard, Rolling Stone et. cet.

<li><b>Merge</b> into List of solar eclipses article. The eclipse is now a historical eclipse and its only claim to noteworthiness is that it is the most recent total eclipse. Apart from being an eclipse, it is not particularly noteworthy from an astronomical point of view because it was not particularly long or short nor had particular historical events associated with it. By comparison, the longest total solar eclipse of the 20th century, 1991 July 11, does not have a separate article. This eclipse was well studied because the path of totality passed over major observatories in Hawaii, USA. The same criteria should be applied to other eclipse articles that are not significant from an astronomical perspective. The article <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse_on_1999_August_11_8d05.html" title="Solar eclipse on 1999 August 11">Solar eclipse on 1999 August 11</a> is only noteworthy because the line of totality passed over Europe, but in eclipse terms and from a global perspective the 1999 eclipse itself is not particularly noteworthy. Therefore the article <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse_on_1999_August_11_8d05.html" title="Solar eclipse on 1999 August 11">Solar eclipse on 1999 August 11</a> should also be considered for deletion or merging for the same reasons as the article <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse_on_2006_March_29_a587.html" title="Solar eclipse on 2006 March 29">Solar eclipse on 2006 March 29</a>.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Each Total Solar Eclipse is unique in its event. Conditions on the Sun and areas seen on Earth have a major effect on visibility of corona, photosphere and wisps etc. The occulation by the moon shows different effects as well. They rarely (not in a lifetime) happen in the same path of totality (let alone a same duration). Expand the report to cover path and duration spots. Secondary, as a memebr of the ASV <a href="http://www.asv.org.au" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.asv.org.au" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>] the recording of these events only serves to enrich our understanding of the events, for those located out of east travel range (not counting rich eclipse chasers).

<li><b>Questions</b> and <b>Comments</b>: For the good Wikipedians who are planning to vote for <i>Keep</i> or <i>Merge</i>, I have a few questions to aid you in your decision. Consider the criteria to use to determine whether particular total solar eclipses merit a separate article. If the vote is for <i>Keep</i>, there may be a case for creating more articles for individual eclipses. Should we create articles for other recent total solar eclipses? If so, which ones? When creating articles for individual eclipses, what selection criteria distinguishes a notable eclipse from a non-notable eclipse? Does the eclipse have to pass over a large populated area, or any populated area, or are all total solar eclipses notable regardless of the remoteness of the location? I feel that a vote for <i>keep</i> really means <i>keep -- and create more articles for particular eclipses</i>. Examples: There is no article for Solar eclipse on 11 July 1991 even though that eclipse was notable for being over 7 minutes long and by being particularly well observed by the astronomical community. A friend of mine saw the Solar eclipse on 4 December 2002 but that eclipse lacks an article. I experienced the Solar eclipse on 23 October 1976 from <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> but that eclipse also lacks an article. --<a href="../../../b/2E/d/User%7EB.d.mills_9f02.html" title="User:B.d.mills">B.d.mills</a> 07:03, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> or <b>Keep</b> (pending paradigm shift) because, whether it's supposed to be or not, enyclopedic information is based upon its impact on humanity (culturally, economically, scientifically, etc.). For example, take the 2005 hurricane season, you have the storms that affected the socio-economic status of some areas (Katrina) and those that didn't. You'll notice that those which did have seperate articles and those that didn't have smaller entries in the main 2005 Atlantic Hurricane Season article. Another example, the Olympics. Though its cultural impact lasts only for a short while, it still greatly impacts society for that short while, nonetheless. Eclipses should only have seperate entries if they make a noticeable, strong impact on humanity, unless you guys want an encyclopedic paradigm shift or something (which I kind of doubt by reading other comments). Other than that, all pertinent infirmation should go to either the list of solar eclipses or the main article. Sauvastika 20:39, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep,</b> for all of the reasons thus far presented. Some have noted that other prior eclipse do not have a dedicated article - therefore, neither should should this one [of 2006 March 29]. However, the problem with this argument is that Wikipedia is ever expanding. In fact, nothing is stopping anyone from creating a new article for the 11 July 1991 eclipse right now. And I think it would be a good idea to have a page charting all known eclipses - to which this one can be linked. Stephenw77 01:41, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I think every solar eclipse deserves a separate article. Someone called it recentism, but I think even after 10 years it will be interesting to find some more information and pictures of an eclipse, than just list of countries, in random order, from which it was derectly observed. We should just make some kind of template for eclipses, which would include useful encyclopedic information, using, for example, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse_on_2006_March_29_a587.html" title="Solar eclipse on 2006 March 29">Solar eclipse on 2006 March 29</a> as reference. Even if my vote is discounted, you have my opinion, wikipedia contains tons of useless articles, so why don't we keep a useful one? 213.197.129.54 22:59, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. A whole different chunk of the world's population gets to see each eclipse and that's one reason why each one is an event. Further, since this doesn't involve distorting a pre-existing article, nor is the article very long, this is hardly a particularly egregious example of recentism. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanward_c6b7.html" title="User:Danward">Danward</a> 23:04, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. All total eclipses are rare and significant enough to be notable. The only sense in which this is "recentism" is that events that have occured since Wikipedia was begun are able to have more data included since data is more readily available while the event is taking place and shortly thereafter. (see also articles on recent olympics as opposed to earlier olympics). If more data can be found on previous total eclipses, those eclipses should also have articles written based on that data. <a href="../../../t/y/l/User%7ETyler_McHenry_2cd2.html" title="User:Tyler McHenry">Tyler</a> 06:35, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm listing this here rather than on {{prod}} because a similarly-titled article (<a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Mathews_9663.html" title="Scott Mathews">Scott Mathews</a>) is currently on AFD, and I wanted to minimize confusion. This Scott Mattews is a different musician than that, and to the best of my knowledge, he's also a different guy than the genuinely notable drummer for <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:9y5g8qmbbtc4~T1" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:9y5g8qmbbtc4~T1" rel="nofollow">The Derailers</a>. <i>This</i> Scott Matthews is a non-notable singer/songwriter with one album that hasn't been released yet. Googling his name and that of the album turns up only ~15 google hits, and he doesn't have an Allmusic page. We don't have an article on his label (San Remo Records), and a google search for them turned up 74 pages, most of which were either irrelevant or mirrors. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 22:48, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>; I am the author, and a Coist. You can accept or reject my word according to your judgement, but I hope you don't dismiss every obscure article as a 'hoax'; Coism is not a schoolboy 'fad' (I am, regrettably, no longer that young,) just because it was conceived recently by a small number of people (as, throughout history, all religions were, according to Atheists). To clarify, however, the principle of Coism was conceived by a small group of us who became acquainted via the internet, rather than invented in a chat-room. If you consider it too obscure to warrant an article, fair enough, but Wikipedia is supposed to be a 'definitive' collection of all human knowledge. I think it is not that Coism is too spurious a subject to warrant an article, rather that not enough other equally obscure subjects have articles as well. There may only be a handful of us, but are there no diseases with far fewer sufferers that are listed on Wikipedia? Furthermore, does Wikipedia have a 'maximum' capacity for knowledge? And what is the threshold of 'obscureness' that must be passed to warrant an article? <a href="../../../m/j/e/User%7EMjefm_0b21.html" title="User:Mjefm">Mjefm</a> 16:32, 30 March 2006 (UTC) 16:28, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>"If you consider it too obscure to warrant an article, fair enough..."</i> That is correct. <i>"...but Wikipedia is supposed to be a 'definitive' collection of all human knowledge."</i> I don't know where you got that idea. Wikipedia does not want to be an indiscriminate repository of everything under the sun. The standards are basically that, in order to be covered in Wikipedia, something must be <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. We have at least half a dozen new religions or belief systems a month, some spurious but many sincere, and most known to at best a few dozen people. The sincerity of your beliefs is not an issue. What is an issue is whether there are any significant number of people who follow, or have even heard of, this belief. It seems quite clear that, at this time, the answer to that is no. If at some point this belief should spread and actually become notable, it can, at that time, be legitimately covered here. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 18:18, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A useful term that is actually reasonably widespread among this field; I can try to find more published uses, but a quick google revealed its use in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0977325008&amp;id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=cisgender&amp;sig=DrZ6iHvnZo83XNEWn0vhPy_ntIw" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0977325008&amp;id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=cisgender&amp;sig=DrZ6iHvnZo83XNEWn0vhPy_ntIw" rel="nofollow">this book</a> (Medical Therapy and Health Maintenance for Transgender Men: A Guide For Health Care Providers, by R. Nick Gorton MD, Jamie Buth MD, Dean Spade JD), in addition to a reference found in google scholar (not sure if it's the same one referred to above, but this one <i>has</i> been published): <i>Debating Trans Inclusion in the Feminist Movement: A Trans-Positive Analysis</i> (by Eli R. Green), in: "<a href="http://www.haworthpressinc.com/store/product.asp?sku=5799" class="external text" title="http://www.haworthpressinc.com/store/product.asp?sku=5799" rel="nofollow">Challenging Lesbian Norms:</a> Intersex, Transgender, Intersectional, and Queer Perspectives", Edited by Angela Pattatucci-Aragón, PhD Director, Center for Evaluation and Sociomedical Research, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan. Perhaps those keen on deleting pages that define specialised terms and lack references can turn their attention to <a href="../../../c/o/o/Category%7ECooking_techniques_d7e7.html" title="Category:Cooking techniques">Category:Cooking techniques</a> — none of these terms (e.g. <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saut%C3%A9ing.html" title="Sautéing">Sautéing</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basting.html" title="Basting">basting</a>) have cited references from academic publications as far as I can tell. <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 00:49, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you think <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basting.html" title="Basting">basting</a> is a neologism... nevermind. That is the same paper from google scholar though, I was incorrect that it was not published (the version I read stated it was yet to be published). The <i>Journal of Lesbian Studies</i> is at least described as peer-revied by others. The book seems to be unpublished as far as I can tell. It is a book that is released under GFDL and googling for the ISBN comes up nothing. This is still a far way from demostrating that it has significant use. I'm changing my vote to <b>Transwiki</b> though. kotepho 01:37, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - A term and concept in development. Cisgender was referred to at the recent (2006) ILGA World Transgender pre-conference. Its usefulness is still being explored, one thing for certain it has far more possibility of theoretical usage than 'RG" (real girl) and bio-boy (STW, 02-04-06)--68.203.186.198 19:49, 3 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"usefulness still being explored" seems to me to be the <b>strongest case yet made</b> for this article's deletion. Personally, I think that it <i>is</i> a useful term, but that's not the issue here — it's more relevant to note kotepho's failure to find usage of it in a search of academic databases. Until there is some wider consensus on its usefulness and usage, this term does not fit on wikipedia: see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, let alone <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>.<br />
I fear that some contributors to this discussion appear to be applying inappropriate criteria, by asking whether the term is useful to them <i>personally</i> rather than whether it fits wikipedia's criteria. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 13:23, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is from the top of the WINAD page: "Nearly everyone here agrees that in general, stub articles are to be encouraged, provided they meet certain criteria. There are likewise some differences of opinion as to whether just definitions are acceptable for beginning an article. If you want to make everybody happy, add a little encyclopedic information of some sort —don't just give the meanings of the word." It seems to me that this article already has encyclopedic information in talking about the social and political context in which the word emerged, who uses it and why. It would fail to meet this policy if it only consisted of the lead section. The article could certainly be improved though; perhaps you would like to help? <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 03:12, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You can interpret this two ways.
