<dd>What is official policy on this? It seems disengenuous as people will already have voted one way or the other.

<p>Just because ED is mean and obnoxious does not make an article ABOUT it the same. The WP article about it does not show favor or endorsement to the information and humor style on ED; t only describes it. In essence, we have a NPOV-secure article about a controversial subject. We should be applauding, not deleting. These aren't good reasons to exclude an article's subject.

<p>If everyone agrees to a "delete" consensus based on votes I will agree. However, I want to be sure that if the vote is keep or no consensus, that no admin will take it upon themselves to delete. Note extreme hostility, possible retaliatory nature of this deletion request:</p>

<dd>What is the policy if any for renomination of an article after it has successfully passed a deletion vote? Is there any amount of time that it must be excluded for renominations? Or can people repeatedly relist immediately? Thanks, curious. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 01:08, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's no hard and fast policy, although it's discouraged.

<dd>Thanks. I am concerned that given the hostile nature of an attack on one admin that spawned this, that there is no way to get a "fair shake" now. What recourse exists (if hypothetically it came to that)? Just submit for undeletion?

<dd>I was just going to say that. If an article is deleted it is never "gone". They can always be brought back, and, while I'd like to see this one go, it is likely to stay. You are free to report and admin you believe has abused their powers, there are plenty of places to do this, and, if this article is deleted unfairly, it will be restored. -- <b><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanes_f250.html" title="User:Banes"><font color="darkblue">Bane</font></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanes_bff7.html" title="User talk:Banes"><font color="darkblue">s</font></a></b> 01:31, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Folks if a Wikipedia admin is being attacked and trolled as it appears was happening when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclopædia_damatica&amp;oldid=64163624" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Encyclopædia_damatica&amp;oldid=64163624" rel="nofollow">this version</a> of Encyclopædia damatica was online (note the now deleted image of the front page of the site featuring <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">User:MONGO</a>) it's normal that those who are doing the attacking and trolling (particularly accounts that were socks meant to do so) are blocked and banned. All of that falls into Wikipedia's policies. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 13:39, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed, no problem with that. I'm curious if any policy exists however on admins editing complaints about themselves? Just curious, I'm still learning some of this as I go.

<dd>While the image should have been reverted, there was nothing technically wrong with the deletion. Scores of other abuses of power are evident, but not concerning the image. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:45, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The revisionism is amazing here. The image was the only issue, and the page was not attacking anyone. Since the image was <i>deleted</i> rather than <i>reverted</i> to a non-attack image, we have no way of showing who was actually doing the attacking. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:45, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Attributing 'revisionism' to other editors in a justifiable disagreement is extremely unproductive and unlikely to resolve the conflict with mutual respect - as it implies a motive to disinform.</dd>
<dd>And in this instance (where you are claiming that since the image's content isn't available now there's no way to know who was attacking whom) your use of that term is a really stunning achievement in unintentional irony. Such an idea is the very 'root' of revisionism. An admin here suffered off- and on-wiki personal attacks as a direct result of his 'be bold' policy. The image's status does not retroactively eliminate that fact.</dd>
<dd>Jeff, as an erstwhile admin <s>admin</s> you should be at least as concerned with maintaining <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and protecting the integrity of a fellow user (MONGO) as you appear to be with protecting a vanity site. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 13:53, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'll assume good faith and believe that you haven't seen this unfold over the last three days. He suffered attacks that probably weren't warranted at the time in an off-wiki article.

<dd>If I were an admin, which I'm not, I wouldn't be throwing my administrative weight around to affect the outcome of this article. MONGO's integrity may be lauded in other areas (I've never encountered him prior to this flap, to my knowledge), but his multiple violations of basic policy and guideline regarding page protection, editing, and good faith to other editors has been noted. As for "protecting a vanity website," I don't consider this page vanity, and I believe that it barely skirts the guidelines for web inclusion, guidelines that are way too strict anyway.

<dd>OK. Does that make him responsible for any and all content on an outside website then? Also, again, for better or worse, what content is featured on a 3rd party should have no bearing on the relevance, right to exist, nor content of a WP article. See my Smoking Gun example below. If that site put up EVERY single piece of public-record information for all staff and corporate/foundation info for WP, does that mean that this site no longer is valid to exist within WP or as a link from WP? If we deslist that, do we censure the other pages that pick up the story? If the NY Times reports on the Smoking Gun getting censured, do we censure the NY Times article?

<p>(moving to new line since the old is getting cluttered, response to existing conversation)</p>
<p>For what it is worth, why does what appears on an outside website excuse anything that happens for behavior "on" Wikipedia? I'm not saying its right to put his personal data up, but the ED site is not the ED article (and that personal data for better or worse is a legal public record--that's from a WHOIS lookup, apparently). The ED article linked to a 3rd party site no different than how <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitruth.html" title="Wikitruth">Wikitruth</a> does. All valid and fine within the bounds of WP. Some troll put an offensive reference to MONGO up on the ED article in response to a satirical lambast of him over on the ED site. Not advocating right or wrong, just saying what happened. In response, MONGO starts banning people, locks the ED article on WP, and removes the link to the ED site from the ED article *AFTER* he locked the article. Bias, and against policy. Yes, rules can be thrown out, as they can be the long term basis of setting precedent/being a new policy. But he did this also (later stated) under the guise that the ED *article* was an attack article, and that anyone who contributed to a WP article was a "troll" and should be "perma-banned". I said it before, MONGO should have completely recused himself from this entire mess from the VERY beginning. If I was an admin and someone torched me on ED, slashdot, kurishin, etc., I would have no business getting into 1) edit wars; 2) using my admin powers on that issue. At all. It's wrong. There are 900+ admins. He couldn't get someone non-biased?</p>
<p>For that matter, if <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boing_Boing_1638.html" title="Boing Boing">Boing Boing</a> tomorrow runs an article flagrantly torching Wikipedia itself, Jimbo Wales, or Netscott, or rootology, or MONGO, would it be appropriate for that user to go in, and begin editing the article about that outside site, and REMOVE the links from WP to it? If you say "no", then why was it appropriate in this case with the ED article? Is it because of ED's reputation? Should that even matter? Why should any one instance be considered 'different'? Bad, bad, behavior. 20:51, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ONE image acted as an attack. ONE. And no one who edits the article has shown any tolerance for attacks on other editors in the article, or tolerance of attacks on other people in the article. One <i>image</i> does not mean that an admin has the right or responsibility to completely ignore multiple policies and guidelines in response, period. As for me, I've never kept my association with ED a secret, and I, to my knowledge, have never been involved in any of the nasty stuff that sometimes goes on there, nor have I used the ED page to attack anyone, nor have I edited the ED page with any sort of agenda. I don't get involved with that sort of stuff on either side of it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:21, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree with Netscott. Wikipedia should ALWAYS attempt to evaluate actions and errors on the side of protecting an individual's privacy. While authoritarians may be unable to understand the true meaning of 'Fuck process' and 'ignore all rules', that doesn't them invalid, especially in an instance like this. Such concepts (while anti-authoritarian) are core principles, and part of 'doing the right thing' in this community. And at this point, relentless and continued sniping at MONGO in direct avoidance of the validating circumstances of his actions (suffering serious on- and off-wiki personal attacks) seems to me to be little more than trolling. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 21:10, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Reply to both of you (Netscott and RyanF): Before this I had nothing to do with ED, the ED article, MONGO, or Hypocrite. I edited stuff about my one started project and random articles here and there, helping out. I found this mess and tried to help and got dragged in by lots of inflammatory stuff. I *STRONGLY* disagree that articles on subjects that are critical in any way of WP should BE covered. Not having equal and fair coverage of your critics is wrong. It turns you into a one-sided, half-true thing. In regards to privacy of MONGO and all that: I agree, furtherance of an attack via WP is wrong. But again! If an OUTSIDE SOURCE slams WP in some form, removing links to that is EVEN MORE WRONG ON SO MANY LEVELS IT'S INSANE.

If the Smoking Gun puts up personal records or internal records of something to do with WP someday, do we censure the Smoking Gun article? That is my concern.

<dd>The article's notability (which has not increased as a result of this planned attack on a WP admin's identity) makes it a valid case for deletion, imho. The abuse leveled at MONGO doesn't make it notable enough to keep, and shouldn't. It's a non-encyclopedic-entity. An article in the NYTimes (which in fact is a reputable source) is a whole lot different than ED, a site that few of us knew about before these attacks (and which remains non-notable). -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 21:28, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The notability of the article is on the same level of MANY other website articles on WP, and in fact more in many cases. I think an extensive review of either the web notability policy is required, or I suspect if a legitimate "delete" concensus is reached, that a great many less notable articles may be coming up for AfD with the standards you and others are trying to reaffirm here. I saw probably a couple hundred at the least just surfing WP the other night. AfD votes will be backed up a bit I think unless notability reqs are reassessed. NOTE: That would not be retaliation. That would be following "rules". Of course... if concensus is "keep" or "non concensus", the article will remain as is standard, correct? <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 21:41, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>RyanFreisling is correct.

<dd>An article whose content is verifiable from reliable sources, and which unequivocally and again from reliable sources demonstrates the significance of its subject, is in no real danger. Very occasionally there are issues with biographies of living individuals, but not with most articles. So, if you are really <i>relaly</i> concerned with keeping this, go out and get some citations from reliable secondary sources. Otherwise there are no guarantees - the closing admin is well within their rights to work on the balance of arguments presented, by reference to policy, and entirely ignore the numerical count and any amount of argufying. And really we would not want it any other way. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 21:55, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Does anyone see any way to close this that won't just result in a deletion review? I fear that a DRV would end up being a pointless duplication of the Afd. I suppose we could immediately start trying to work toward a consensus on how to close this, but then <i>that</i> discussion would simply become a pointless duplication of the Afd.

<dd>AfDs oridinarily have to run their course... As I recall they take 5 or 7 days. Afterwards the closing admin(s) looks at the general consensus and the arguments provided and makes a decision for whether or not an article is kept.

<dd>(ec) I know how Afds usually go, but I find it hard to believe that a few more days will result in any more relevant points being made. However I suppose an early close on such a popular Afd would be an unpopular move. I'll admit I've been slightly tempted a few times already to just go ahead and close it as a delete, on the simple basis that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is a key policy.

<dd>Speaking only for myself, I do not intend to use DRV assuming the closing admin either sides with me or gives a substantial explanation for their reasoning that does not ignore the WP:V and WP:OR issues raised by numerous delete supporters. I would also note, that like page protection, AFD is not a vote on the content of the article in any form, and even if the article by some infantesimal chance survives this process, it is imperitive that it folow each and every single one of our policies - from <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 21:56, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think an early closing would be a very bad idea, and provide gratuitous extra fodder for ill will from anyone who disagreed with the decision, whichever way it goes. I hope those asking for speedy closing would consider that our task is not only to arrive at the correct decision, but to do so in a way that tends to minimize heat and static.</p>
<p>It would also be very good if, before the closing, we can get the discussion away from all the red herring side-issues, like people going on about whether ED attacks Wikipedia, and if we should or shouldn't delete it based on that. I think the central issue really is the matter of independent reliable sources, and the AfD should be closed based on whether those can be provided, and whether the article, when its content is limited to what can be sourced, is anything more than a sub-stub. I'm pretty sure those sources don't exist beyond Alexa and the Domain registry, but I would be quite happy to be proven wrong. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 22:17, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I didn't agree with that. I agreed that the image was an attack.

<dd>So let's see... if the image is displayed on the page, then through simple logic does the page not take on enough attack characteristics to be labeled as such? That image seriously had undue weight and dominated the article. It's true that the article is not an "attack article" now but with the image it had displayed and a link to the site leading to a main page article that personally attacked and harassed <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">User:MONGO</a> the description "attack article" is plausible. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 01:41, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So you may want to actually point out where this vanity would apply with each of these people.

Your moving of any protests or commentary away to the talk page, and your now hiding of it under a "conflicts of interest here!" style banner simply make it seem like any discussion to the contrary doesn't matter. Falls right in line with everything else you've assumed since you started this AfD, from the faulty reasoning to the bad faith you've shown to other editors from the beginning. Want to allege a conflict of interest? Be my guest, but don't attempt to minimize those who feel differently.

<p>Netscott said that an impartial, "fair" admin review may be difficult as I requested in the Vanity Section. I propose in these extenuating circumstances it may well be impossible. Move that this AfD be tabled pending higher than admin level review. I hate to be a pain but given how heated some admins and friends of MONGO are over the 3rd party site attack on him, and how insanely fierce EVERYONE is on every little point, that there is no way to get a clean unbiased review here. Perhaps if no higher than admin level review can be done that this whole AfD should be tabled for a set amount of time of plus one month, at which point a new one can be opened. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 01:27, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>MONGO, MONGO, MONGO! Let's stick to the reasons WHY this article should or should not exist, as I for one am tiring of the constant accusations being spread around here about me, which has nothing to do with why the article should or should not exist. The point of the argument is: can the article be reliably referenced following policy, does it pass our really low standards of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and does it pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Aside from a couple of links that show when the website was created and the alexa rating, I can't find anything that otherwise demonstrates, following policies, that the website even exists or can be reliably referenced.

<p>Said it on the talk page for ED--why do the people here not go out and AfD *every* WikiMedia project I cited on the main page of this AfD? If you are truly commited to your honest good faith convictions that this has nothing *nothing* to do with ED itself as an outside party or the attack on MONGO, I challenge you here to demonstrate good faith by prooving so.

<dd>Aagin, this isn't about me demostrating good faith. It is about what criteria this article has that can be verfied by our policies to warrant inclusion.

I then deleted that since it was more than obvious that the old image was going to be used to continue to harass me. I protected the page because editors with only a few edits and other people closely involved with ED were here harassing. This website isn't some playground.

Other articles about non-notable websites will be deleted in time. This one's time happens to be this week, and it just doesn't matter what provoked that. I don't see anybody's good faith as being in question, because deleting one delete-worthy article while there exist other delete-worthy ones just doesn't begin to look like the actions of someone who's out to harm the project.

<p>As my concerns for a fair impartial review by an admin in my opinion based on what is certainly heading for basically Negative Concensus has spiralled as much as everything else to do with this... It's simply not happening since everyone is absurdly heated. Again: this AfD should be suspended in general as it's become a four ring circus of bias and POV assaults by everyone. But:</p>

<p>1. We hash out three impartial editors (and just them) to stub down the article in a sandbox page on ED article to strictly content that merits inclusion as a Web-related stub. The Alexa notability and the few incoming legitimate links make this worth while for inclusion in WP as that. I nominate Netscott, crazyswordwoman, and Badlydrawnjeff. I propose that if MONGO, myself, Badlydrawnjeff, and Hipicrite all agree in writing to this as the main people involved thus far in the endless back and forth, PLUS at least ten total people agree, then the AfD be suspended as is, and those three work it on a sandbox. Netscott is for removal, Jeff for retention, and swordwoman has been amazingly levelheaded thus far. If they agree to do the edits on the sandbox, if not, I'll renom people, or ask that they themselves nominate others. One pro delete, one for, and one who's been neutral. There's no other way out of this quagmire. Once the three of them have brought down the article to meet all standards amongst themselves, I propose that William M. Connolley be asked to handle unlocking and moving their version of the sandbox to the live page as he's been great and impartial to both sides. If within two weeks they can't give William a page that he agrees is appropriate to go on Wikipidia, it's unprotected, and people can AfD their heads off, but I will myself almost certainly abstain on that one. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 08:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>2. Based on the ludicrous morass here, as second compromise I nominate that the AfD be suspended/terminated and the article left as-is for now and locked by William M. Connolley still. The AfD tags come down, the article is just locked. One week afterwards to give EVERYONE time to cool off, Netscott can put in the EXACT same AfD. Same wording the whole nine yards. However, the compromise here: I propose that if MONGO, myself, Badlydrawnjeff, and Hipicrite all agree in writing to this as the main people involved thus far in the endless back and forth, that we are NOT under any circumstances to post in the AfD main page on the "new" AfD discussion beyond saying Speedy Delete, Speedy Keep, Abstain, Keep, and so on. Our reasons are MORE than noted at this point on both sides, and all of us have turned this into a digital Vietnam. If all four of us agree in writing plus at least ten others, I put this forward as the second option. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 08:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>3. If both meet full support (that's twenty eight agreements total--that should be good for concensus I'd think), as a matter of Good Faith I propose that number #1 is then automatically selected as the option in effect if the three editors and william agree. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 08:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>4. If we don't go for an attempt at compromise and push this mess of an AfD as-is, this a) going to a bigger circus of a deletion reversal, and will certainly reach RfC (probably a couple for the myriad points argued) and almost certainly ArbCom.

<dd>Gosh, would it be more effective if you come out against the move, thus driving the masses towards it by some law of mangetic repulsion? That would be ironic, or something, because the suggestion to move the article there came directly from Encyclopedia damatica, from a hard core supporer of the article. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 11:00, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Encyclopedia damatica is leaps and bounds more notable than Wikipedia Review or Hive Mind. The only thing they have in common is criticism of Wikipedia, and ED only has about 50-100 pages on that. 71.112.141.236 12:19, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've called our MONGO, Hipicrite, and Netscott now several times to answer. The ball is in their court for better or worse to save everyone tons of grief. Even if it gets deleted I can easily see someone shoving a new article under parody or a whole section into livejournal. Which if someone editing under LJ moves into a fork off the LJ article, recreating the ED article, we're back at square one. Unless MONGO, Netscott, or hipicrite DO have bias, they should address this (not an attack, simple fact based on all evidence to date on both sides). <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 15:00, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is not appropriate to move a page to another namespace while an AFD is ongoing. You would require buyin from far more than just three to do so. I suggest you make the article in the Wikipedia: namespace, and vote delete here. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 15:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there any policy reason prohibiting what hipocrite has suggested? What policies for source, AfD, etc. do Parody articles fall under?

<dl>
<dd>Rootology, I really don't think there's a "policy reason" that you can't create a subpage of Parodies for ED. I'd check out the subpages that already exist, and consider using them as models. If one were to be deleted, it would be under MfD. Wikipedia:Parodies exists for the same reason BJAODN exists - to amuse Wikipedians. ContiE's suggestion that this would be a slippery slope allowing for something like WP:Brian Peppers is unfounded, because Wikipedia parodies have the distinction of being related to the project, and thus of inherent interest to Wikipedians, whereas random topics like Brian Peppers don't have an excuse like that.</dd>
<dd>I think the move to a Parodies subpage would be a good solution. The cross-namespace redirect is a different matter; we can't have that. The encyclopedia is the encyclopedia, and the project namespace is the project namespace. Part of the integrity of the encyclopedia rests on that distinction being kept unmuddied. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 19:43, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Secondly, *If* a delete vote is reached (not likely it looks like) and the ED article is removed, is there any policy reason prohibiting it's recreation after in the parody space? <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 15:11, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Eh, so an article that gets deleted is just moved to the Wikipedia namespace and everything's fine? That sounds rather silly to me. Let's have WP:Brian Peppers! --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 15:15, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jimbo pulled his veto power on the Peppers things. I think it would take a board vote to overrule him there. But yeah, if the Parody section is *NOT* bound by the normal rules and standards, it's a good option and fits with other similar articles already there. I'm asking for comment if theres any policy reason I can't recreate it there now, or any policy reason to prevent the deletionists from just torching it after I do. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 15:23, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My reason would be that the page will serve no purpose other than being a mirror of a deleted article. That's simply not what the Wikipedia namespace is for. I'm talking about moving the whole unreferenced article there, I don't mind writing a few words about it on Wikipedia:Parodies. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 15:31, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not a mirror, it would be the actual site. I'm saying we should move it there regardless of keep or delete. Unless it's against the rules if this is deleted I *will* move it there afterwards. If this is so notable that so many editors are going bananas over it its CERTAINLY notable enough to be in the parody wiki space. No one can legitimately argue against that given this circus. But... the day ED the site gets more sources, it moves right back on over to main space. Actually, given how insane this fighting is, I *eagerly* look forward to that say, just so both sides have to shut up and live with a legitimately sourced article, so that we don't have to go through this circus again. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 15:35, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, the main name space URL will redirect to the same source content mirrored under parody. Wouldn't the individual links just pick up on the redirect and carry over? <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 15:41, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, they would, and that's exactly my problem. Beside the fact that there's a Wikipedia guidline that discourages cross-namespace-redirects, this would basically keep the article, and even worse, it wouldn't even have to abide by any of our fundamental rules, because it's not in the main namespace anymore. This is <b>not</b> acceptable. All links from the main namespace to the Wikipedia namespace article should be removed at minimum. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 15:47, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree for the reasons I stated. You summarize my opinion incorrectly. I don't support deletion because either the article or the site are crap - I support it because <b>both are crap</b> and you cannot make a useful article about a useless topic. The fact that the editors have been involved in personal attacks, spamming and trolling to undermine Wikipedia admins isn't a factor - but it's certainly context.

<dd>Agreed. Administrative *AND* bias by his friends since MONGO got his feelings hurt. To be honest I'm overall EXTREMELY AND UTTERLY disgusted by every side in this. What should be included in WP should have NO BEARING ON IT'S CONTENT NATURE OR ANYTHING EMOTIONAL. Ever. Period.

<dd>As a trained researcher, the Guardian is a decent source, "but" what they have to say about ED doesn't say anything at all. It is a reliable source based on the ability to demonstrate that the Guardian is big and well known, but they don't tell us anything about ED...what is it that they tell us that is informative? So we say that in the Guardian they use one sentence to tell us nothing except that ED has a picture of Bush with some markings on his forehead...how does that help us with the article as far as establishing notability? They got a brief sentence somewhere...surely there are thousands of websites that have been mentioned at one time or another by some large entity that everyone has heard of...but that doesn't help us establish notablity, especially when based on one sentence. ED's 15 minutes of fame lasted 3 seconds in this circumstance.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 17:28, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think per the ArbCom decision re: MONGO links to ED are to be removed/blocked.
