<p>Bafendo is large enough for an article on Wikipedia fore it is the small who will some day be the big company that it is meant to be. Bafendo is a force to be reckoned with. Bafendo is worthy and it is very important to the people it helps and to the people who love it! --Bafendo 09:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You may not think it is not old enough but it is. We are an important company to our clients! We deserve a chance! We demand a chance! Bafendo may only be three years old but we are good at what we do and we will not be bullied into deletion. We deserve this and we're not giving it up without a fight! And anybody who thinks they can bully the small is a fool! Fore the small will one day grow big and crush the ones who tried to hold them back! We've struggled before but no more! This is it do not delete our archive we deserve to be here as much as Microsoft. Sure we aren't an international corporation but we have something they don't have... reliable products and affordable service! And I'd be a fool not to stop the deletion of our archive! So think about what I said and think about not being another barrier which a small business must face! As I said before... I will fight this!!! --Bafendo 09:31, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not that I'm doubting you, but would you mind citing a source for that? The criterion itself says that it applies to "unremarkable people <b>or groups</b>", but perhaps there's a further elaboration elsewhere that I'm not familiar with. Regardless, though, this particular article while nominally about a company is almost exclusively about the personal exploits of one Mr. Bryce Frier... and I wouldn't be surprised if he were the sole employee. I've seen far iffier articles selected for speedy deletion by administrators. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 10:40, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There's three sources you could use. a) My word as someone who has been closing AfDs and dealing with speedies for the past 9 months (not perfect, I know). b) The actual wording of the A7 CSD — if you have to turn the lights down and squint a bit to get your interpretation in, then it's <i>the wrong interpretation</i>. c) Discussions on the talk pages of AfD or CSD (or both) where this subject has come up a few times. "or groups" does <i>not</i> cover corporations. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 10:52, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Duly noted, and I'll keep that in mind for the future. Thanks. Seems a bit odd though that speedy covers bands ({{db-band}}) and clubs ({{db-club}}) but not companies... but I'm still relatively new at all this and if that's what the consensus was, that's what the consensus was&#160;:) But in this case, we're in AfD-land. Do you have an opinion on whether this article should be deleted?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, while I've got an administrator's attention, I want to make sure I've got the rules understood correctly. A {{prod}} <i>can</i> be removed by the article creator (or indeed anybody) for no other reason than disagreement with the proposed deletion, but a speedy tag should <i>not</i> be removed by anybody but an administrator and should only be objected to with {{hangon}} or on the article's talk page... is that correct? Also, yes, I'm happy to take your word on the suitability (or lack thereof) of non-notable companies for speedy deletion, but what exactly is the point of <a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-reason_8c33.html" title="Template:Db-reason">Template:Db-reason</a>? <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 11:08, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>CSD is supposed to define a list of reasons for deletion so obvious that we can trust just one person to make the decision all on his sweeney; as a result, people tend to want to extend the list as little as possible. Bands (meant to cover high school garage bands who formed last week and haven't agreed on a name, sort of thing), clubs (e.g. the football team you and your mates organised for a muckaround after work), and so on were difficult enough to push through, without trying for corporations as well. As for {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}, yes, it can be removed by anyone at any time for any reason (or, indeed, no acknowedlged reason). Speedy tags can be removed by anyone, but should not be removed by the article's author; {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} exists for the article's author to contest the speedy deletion if he wants, but need not be used by anyone else. Administrators have no special status when it comes to removing speedy tags. {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-reason_8c33.html" title="Template:Db-reason">db-reason</a>}} exists mostly so that people don't have to remember all the other template names, and partly for when you have a reason for deletion that doesn't match existing templates perfectly (e.g. you want to note that it meets more than one of the CSD, or you've got a good reason that doesn't have a template yet — like Jimbo's statements on articles that run afoul of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 11:35, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks much for the tips... I want to be the best editor I can be, and I really appreciate getting good guidance. (I also owe you for demonstrating {{tl|templatename}}... substantially less cumbersome than &lt;nowiki&gt;{{templatename}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;!) I understand the hesitancy to expand CSD, but per below I've dumped my opinion on the appropriate <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia_talk%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_New_criteria_c4c2.html#A_newb.27s-eye_view" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion/New criteria">talk page</a> and this page has already gotten pretty far derailed from its purpose, so I'll shut up now.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">Don't bite the newbies</a>. I think "arrogant and obnoxious" is a bit harsh; the owner is new here, manifestly unfamiliar with the way Wikipedia works (and what Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a>), and probably fairly young. He's clearly very proud of his company and doesn't (or didn't) understand why it's not appropriate for an article. Our job is to help him understand. Yes, this article obviously deserves the axe, but User:Bafendo might become a valued contributor here if we don't run him off. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 02:00, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why doesn't anyone in the Wiki community like Bafendo? Sure I said small but that doesn't mean my company isn't important. We're big to our clients and we've had a few problems that have kept us small but we are finally growing. What we need right now is friends not enemys. Enemies make Bafendo look bad and a few of our clients have seen these "delete" comments and are now thinking of dropping Bafendo. Enemies we don't need! We need friends and allies. You don't want to kill Bafendo do you? Oh and by big I went giant like Microsoft ok Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)! And I may be new to Wikipedia but I do know what I am talking about! And you'll see how big Bafendo is when Western Digital markets LiquaDrive in a few years... just you wait! And just for the record; I will always fight for my company and I will never let anyone say it is not worthy and that I and/or Bafendo is arrogant and obnoxious! We are loved by many and we will never go away! --Bafendo 04:24, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Look, you. It has nothing to do with not "liking" Bafendo. You've already been pointed here, but here it is again: read <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Does Bafendo meet these guidelines? Well, let's have a look. Been the subject of multiple independent non-trivial media articles? Nope. Listed on a well-known and independent ranking of important companies? Nope. Stock a component of a market index? Heck nope, I'd lay very long odds you don't even <i>have</i> publically-traded stock. These are the guidelines. These are the criteria. They are <i>objective</i>. If a company meets any one of them, it is considered notable by Wikipedia standards and merits an article. If a company meets none of them, it is not considered notable by Wikipedia standards and merits deletion. That's it. If your company does in fact meet any of these criteria, please cite your sources and the article will undoubtedly be kept. If not, quit whining about it. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 05:53, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>So you want to play that way do you? Fine I might as well delete it myself since you people hate us so much! I think i'll tell everyone I know to stop using Wikipedia. Sure it wont make a big impact at first but when word spreads especially through the media the wheels start turning on something big. You've made a very big mistake one you will regret! To hell with Wikipedia if all of you feel this way. I hope you don't destroy another company! Besides there's lots of alternatives to Wikipedia. One is webster. This is not the end Wikipedia! This is not the end at all! You've made a powerfull enemy and a big mistake! We don't have to take anyones crap not even precious Wikipedia! We will be back and you'll see just how "notable" we are! You've made our list! And it's not a good list! You've been warned! --Bafendo 09:12, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
