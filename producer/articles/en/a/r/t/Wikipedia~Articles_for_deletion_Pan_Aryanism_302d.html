<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_nationalism.html" title="White nationalism">White nationalism</a>. I read both this article and the White nationalism article. Pan Aryanism is well covered in the White nationalism article. This separate article on Pan Aryanism adds nothing (in many paragraphs) that is not essentially covered in the White nationalism article. I think a redirect is appropriate due to the fact that Pan Aryanism is mentioned in the White nationalism article. ♠<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 01:28, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>How can there be"scholarly references" when PA is a brand new ideaology? If any of you think your such high powered scholars, please register on our site and level your criticisms. <a href="http://www.panf.info" class="external free" title="http://www.panf.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.panf.info</a>. I promise that unlike this place, you can speak freely as long as you do not disrespect White females,use slurs against White nationalities,or advocate non defensive violence agaist an actual real-world person.</p>
<p>PA is bearly mentioned in that article. It does not set forth the actual standards we use to identify who is White. It makes a complete mistatement that implies that we think that all people from Iran, Syria Lebannon and Turkey are White, than says we dont consider ANYONE from the Southern ME White. That is untrue. Yes most people in those first countries are White, and most from the latter are not, but there are exceptions in both instances Why is it that you are fearful of a comprehensive article on PA? Moreover, kindly specify what is "poorly written" about it? Finally, why should my questioning of your motives effect your vote. Dont you think that is childish? If You want the FAQ format changed, I can do that, though I dont see your point You act as if the typical article in Wik. is drafted like something out of Harvard Law Review. Please try to be more realistic- Diabloblanco, Chairman PANF</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Response to the above.</b> The problem with this article is that it reads like a screed from the organization’s informational pamphlet and it is written is such a manner as to try to persuade readers to the organizaton’s point of view. In the Wikipedia that is what is called “POV” (point of view) and that is not acceptable for an encyclopedia. An article on an organization must objectively describe the organization with no attempt at persuasion. Outside criticism of the organization should be included for balanced information. Your entire article could probably be scrubbed and reduced to about two paragraphs if written objectively. The entire FAQ section should be removed or reduced to about one paragraph. You must include sources of information and external links where possible. The article needs to be “wikified”—written in proper Wikipedia page format. The spelling, spacing, and sentence formatting need to be cleaned up and corrected. More information about the organization—or movement, or whatever it is—needs to be given. For example: How long has the organization existed? Who founded it, where, and when? How many members does it have? What notable persons are members? What kinds of activities has it participated in? What kinds of outreach does it have? What is the source of funding? What kinds of media attention has it received? Given these stated corrections, the article MIGHT be worth keeping as an objective description of the organization.</li>

If you simply speak of changing the tenses from "we" and fitting the format to conform to your standards, that can certainly be done I can also include the sites URL,as well as URLS from "Anti PA" sources,both inside and outside of WN, together with sources (Such as the works of Dr. Coon as well as sites such as DODONA and Racial Reality (the latter BTW is non-Racist)from which PS racial theory derives However, I do not know how to write an article that might not influence someones opinion, and with all respexct, neither do you or anybody else The fact that you percieve the article as promotional may simply be due to the fact that nearly all writing about White nationaism is done in a fashion that denigrates it and without the slightest pretense of objectivity Given this, an actually neutral description may seem "promotional by comaprison.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The parts about religion, and where you state "race should come first and you should support the self determination and survivaL of all Whites no matter where they live." aren't just POV, they're plain and out discrimination. Also, it is ok when articles influence someone's opinion, it is however not ok when an article on Wikipedia clearly states the opinion as being the objective truth. Wikipedia is here to educate people, not to brainwash them. -- <a href="../../../s/o/o/User%7ESoothingR_cd35.html" title="User:SoothingR">SoothingR</a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../s/o/o/User_talk%7ESoothingR_fba1.html" title="User talk:SoothingR">pour</a>)</small></sup> 07:03, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Since <a href="http://www.panf.info" class="external free" title="http://www.panf.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.panf.info</a> is the only site that follows the "Pan Aryanism" politics, I suggest we include the "Pan Aryan" info in a article that talks about the <i>Pan-Aryan National Front,</i> since we already have articles about other White nationalist discussion boards such as <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront_%28online_site%29.html" title="Stormfront (online site)">Stormfront</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanguard_News_Network_b657.html" title="Vanguard News Network">Vanguard News Network</a>.
