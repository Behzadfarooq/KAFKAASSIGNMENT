<p>Article could be classed as being pointless and unencyclopedic, i.e. the same as <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Gear_Dog_8f46.html" title="Top Gear Dog">Top Gear Dog</a>. It's not really relevent to the Top Gear article and adds nothing to the Wiki Project. It is also unsourced, and even if it was, would still add nothing to the subject. It is a very minor part which Bentley had with regards to Top Gear. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavesmith33_045e.html" title="User:Davesmith33">Davesmith33</a> 14:29, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

DrFrench also has some sort of agenda here in that he/she is constantly undoing other people's edits without first discussing them on the talk page.

<p>There may have been an odd reference added to the article now, but they are pityful to say the least and aren't exactly adding anything to the article. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavesmith33_045e.html" title="User:Davesmith33">Davesmith33</a> 21:38, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I was leaning towards keep, mainly because I actually recognized the name and consider this article to have some potential for improvement (as opposed to, say, the TGD article) but after doing some Googling, I'm rather undecided. Based on this AfD's nom and the editing history of the article in question, I'm thinking <s>weak delete unless somebody familiar with Mr. Bentley's work steps up to do some major cleanup</s> <b>keep</b>. -- <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeed_2.0_ad50.html" title="User:Seed 2.0">Seed 2.0</a> 22:49, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Indeed, when you compare the quality of this article to say, for example, the Top Gear Dog one, the difference is vast and TGD was deleted for the quality of the article!!!!! <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavesmith33_045e.html" title="User:Davesmith33">Davesmith33</a> 09:46, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

You've just come back for a 24 hour block for it, nobody wants to see you blocked again. I've posted to your talk page in the past (as have others) that I have no personal gripe with you, but you seem take this all very personally.

Chill out, reduce your <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikistress.html" title="Wikistress">wikistress</a> and try to think of constructive ways you can improve these articles rather than constantly vandalising them. <a href="../../../d/r/f/User%7EDrFrench_8fa6.html" title="User:DrFrench">DrFrench</a> 15:34, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep and suggest closing</b>. The article is now completely sourced. Notability isn't an issue (producer of widely watch TV show, presenter of two other TV programmes). To the nominator, next time mark the article as {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}, leave a message on the talk page and drop a message at a few of the article's main contributors to request sources. If no sources are added within a reasonable time frame (a week or so), then consider an AfD. Creating an AfD first is just extra work when the only complaint is the lack of sources, especially when they were as easy to find as they were for Bentley's article. If we started creating AfDs for every article that was unsourced, AfD would be flooded with thousands of requests. --<a href="../../../p/s/2/User%7EPS2pcGAMER_3063.html" title="User:PS2pcGAMER">PS2pcGAMER</a> (<a href="../../../p/s/2/User_talk%7EPS2pcGAMER_9645.html" title="User talk:PS2pcGAMER">talk</a>) 01:38, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
