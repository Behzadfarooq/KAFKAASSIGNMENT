<p>Bogus sociological article about sex among the elderly. When asked for references to this neologism, response has been to put up a citation to scholarly journal -- as if sociologist would use a boy's junior-high phrase -- and to slap a "vandalism" warning on my talk page. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 08:32, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The phrase is used because that's what the elderly themselves use. The only thing I put on your talk page was a request to explain why my reference wasn't good enough. You've been nothing but rude and abusive to me since I created this page (my first on Wikipedia) and attempted to work WITH you, and I don't understand why you have a vendetta of some sort against me. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBongout_63d7.html" title="User:Bongout">Bongout</a> 08:34, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>The phrase is used because that's what the elderly themselves use.</i> Really? Mind providing a smidgen of a scrap of a particle of evidence for that, as I've repeatedly asked?</li>
<li><i>You've been nothing but rude and abusive to me since I created this page</i> Yes, those standard requests for <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">verification</a> are <i>so</i> rude. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 08:49, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have already provided a scholarly, peer-reviewed source for the use of that phrase. However, that problem could be solved by moving the article rather than deleting it, so that's a discussion for somewhere and sometime else. As well, searching Google for "Prune tang" will provide amble evidence of the phrase's use.</dd>
<dd>I never claimed your requesting verification was rude. However, the snide, sarcastic remarks you used to request verification was rude. The way you accused me of editing your talk page to add a vandalism warning was rude (since, afterall, placing something like that on the page of someone so obviously committed to fighting vandalism as yourself would be farcical). The way you abrasively refused to clarify why you had a problem with my reference was rude. The way you put the article on AfD right after I explained to you in polite, civil words exactly how the paper was relevant was rude. I'm very new to Wikipedia, and I feel you're unfairly bullying me. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBongout_63d7.html" title="User:Bongout">Bongout</a> 09:01, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Asking you to back up your bogus-sounding claim with actual evidence and bringing it to wider attention when you refuse: <i>very</i> nasty behavior, ennit? But if your claims about this article -- and this word -- are true, you ought to <i>welcome</i> the attention, where you can prove the veracity of your claims and show me up by actual demonstration (instead of off-topic complaining). I'm asking you to prove a claim: if that makes me rude, then that means you're dealing with an army of Grinches here, since simple verifiability is a bedrock principle of Wikipedia. Don't like it? Go to Urban Dictionary or Uncyclopedia and try your luck there. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 23:47, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>My compliments - you're working hard. However, the article does not go into sociological analysis.

<li>The article does go into sociological analysis. ATHENS and MUSE simply don't carry all journals, especially not one as highly specialized as the one I drew the article from.

<li>The onus is on you to provide checkable verification for the article. A seemingly non-existent journal is not verification. If you can provide another scholarly article that cites that publication, a library reference anywhere in the world, details of its publishers, or a website for the journal or its sponsoring institution, there will at least be something to go on. As it stands, this article is an unverified dictionary definition. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 09:56, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

I am currently looking into things, but the best I can give you write now is the address of the publisher listed in the journal: Department of Sociology Publishing Division, University of Tirana, Square "Nene Terezat", Albania.

<li>It's oddly unsurprising that when I phone the University of Tirana (+355 4 228402), the lady there has no record of this journal. Though this discussion is livening up a tremendously boring day at work no end, I think you're reaching <a href="../../../n/o/w/Nowhere_to_Run_5511.html" title="Nowhere to Run">the end</a> of this one. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 10:37, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>What's more surprising is that in your user page, where, by the way, you say you enjoy obscure topics, you make no mention of knowing Albanian. The University of Tirana is a big institution, and do you really expect a mere receptionist at a general inquiry number to know of every publication at the university? It's more likely that some combination of the following interfered: a) communications difficulties; b) ignorance; c) disinterest in helping a foreign national, Albania still being one of the most insular countries on the Continent; and d) unluckiness. I have a copy of the journal, so it does exist. If people are unable to contact the publisher, I am willing to mail the journal to someone trusted who will verify that it does indeed exist. However, I really don't think we will have to resort to that. I am confident the publisher can be contacted. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBongout_63d7.html" title="User:Bongout">Bongout</a> 10:56, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't speak Albanian: the person I spoke to spoke English (and, by the way, they don't deserve your series of cultural stereotypes - they were lovely). I don't expect them to know the journal: I do expect them to know publishing divisions. Again, I repeat: the onus is on you to verify, and you have not done so. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 11:07, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you knew more about sociology, you would know it is very common for people to be excessively but only obstensibly kind to people who they consider to be part of an out group they feel they should be antagonistic to. I understand the onus is on me, and I'm trying everything I can think of to veryify it to your satisfaction. However, due to the obscurity (but not invalidity) of my source, I seem to be having trouble doing that.

<li>Incredibly obvious <b>delete</b>, although the author is to be congratulated (is that the word I'm looking for?) for their dogged determination. Picking an article written by an author in China published in a Albanian journal was a nice touch; props to Vizjim for the legwork.
