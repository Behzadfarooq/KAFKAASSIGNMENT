<li>A columnist for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a> of London is supremely notable. And before you say he's just or mainly notable as a food and restaurant critic, the first page of ten Usenet hits for the same Giles Coren draws from soc.culture.welsh, uk.rec.models.rail, alt.books.george-orwell, sci.military.naval, comp.sys.acorn.misc, soc.culture.hmong, soc.culture.lebanon, alt.support.childfree and rec.music.artists.springsteen (twice!), all in legitimate posts referencing or discussing something Coren has written about, mostly unrelated to food. <b>Strong keep</b>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 02:39, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A regular columnist for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a> is notable in my view. --<a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJuntung_66a1.html" title="User:Juntung">JuntungWu</a> 16:25, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><del>Conditional Delete</del></b>. It's certainly possible that Giles Coren is notable, but there's not enough in the article to show me that he is. Prove it to me (in the article, not in the VfD comments). <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a>'s comment above tells me more about the types of things he writes about than the article does. Right now we've got a stub that needs expanding. How long has he been with the Times? Is he politically conservative or liberal? Are his political views in line with, or in opposition to, the editorial opinion of the paper he writes for? How often do his columns appear? Some samples of his writing? Has he won any awards? Has he done anything else other than write for the Times? Is he a London native? These are the sorts of things which would make the article interesting. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 19:01, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>What you are saying that it should be deleted for being a stub, and that is a totally unacceptable proposition. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Philip</a> 10:46, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, that's not quite what I'm saying (although, I'll admit my statement above is a bit misleading in that regard). What I'm saying is that there's no evidence (or at least wasn't any when I made my original vote) that the guy was notable. Certainly the paper he works for is notable, but I don't believe in notability by association. Surely there are non-notable people on staff at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a>, just like there are at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a>, the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/u/Reuters.html" title="Reuters">Reuters</a>, <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a>, <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>, etc. All of these are notable news organizations, but that doesn't make everybody who works for them notable. What I was really saying is that it's not up to me, as a reviewer, to do the research to prove that the subject is notable. The efforts that went into making notability arguments on the VfD are lost once the vote is over; that same effort put into improving the article has lasting value. Anyway, I see that the article has improved enough for me to now change my vote to <b>Keep</b>.

<li>This isn't a vote on whether we should delete <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a>, though.

<li>I wrote this (admittedly somewhat daft) brief article because I wanted a tiny recognition for Giles Coren as both a writer of harsh wit and sheer oddity. For the most part, writers for The Times tend to be very conservative (William Rees-Mogg) or very liberal (Libby Purves). Mr. Coren stands out for his sheer 'irrelevance' and nihilistically dark humour. It would be a tad disappointing to delete this entry. I don't follow the minimalist arguments,- surely it's best to have as much knowledge as possible? Then again, I don't pay for Wikipedia's bandwidth etc. I suppose the subject is not particularly important compared with major characters in past and present society. Then again, I note nine noted users read it in a matter of days....

<li><b>Keep</b> I've never heard of him either - and I'm not American.
