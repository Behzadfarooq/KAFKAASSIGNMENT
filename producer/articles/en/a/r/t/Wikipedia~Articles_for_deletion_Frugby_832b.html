<li><i>Query</i> I deleted Frugby the first time it appeared (quite a long time ago), noting that it didn't seem to have been mentioned in the Oban Times, which I would take as an initial test of notability for new things in the area.

<ul>
<li>Keep: This page may breach some of the rules of wikipedia. It may have overstated some aspects of the sport, only in good humour. These problems can easily be rectified and the page's creator has already offered to cooperate with any suggested changes. As a member of the Oban community and frugby player myself - I can attest to the positive influence of this sport on the young people of the town. It is true that this sport has not yet been recognised by the Oban Times. As Dux (academic leader) of the local High School, I was misquoted only last week on the front page of said newspaper. The truth is that frugby has improved my life, and I believe it can have the same positive effect on others. This sport is refreshingly new, you dont need to be an athlete to compete. As such, I vote to keep this page and encourage other youngsters to share our enthusiasm for the sport of Oban's youth. Sincerely, Andy lennox (16) User's first and only edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Andy+Lennox" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Andy+Lennox" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>KEEP: I recently found this article in the Wikipedia after hearing rumors of such a sport. The rumors had made their way down from Oban Scotland by word of mouth all the way to Islington/Hackney London, where I see people playing it in the parks around here. I would use the words "Intrepid" "Brave" "Honourable" to describe these young Men (yes I use the word men, for who else can participate in such a lively sport) rather than such a cowardice word as "vanity." I am proud to say I support such an entry into Wikipedia and if it was not for my wooden leg (a war wound) I would be playing myself. Vote by Jab204, his first and only edit. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Jab204" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Jab204" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>

<li><b>totally keep man</b> yo, i am the lads Frugby coach. JohnK just brought this to my attention and i think you have totally gotta keep it. The boys came to me last Christmas asking if i would help them arrange times to play and i agreed. they have all worked so hard tom promote and develope the sport , this article took a lot of work as JohnK (the author) has a severe strain of dyslexia and so even trying to write an essay like this took some balls. as an after thought to BALLS, maybe some of you guys should try and grow some, i mean who the frig collects flags?! coach morrison 20:03, 21 August 2005 (UTC) Vote by the user is their first and only edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Coach+Morrison" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Coach+Morrison" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li><b>keep</b> I previously requested this article as i promoted the advent of Frugby in the boys school as a sort of project to encourage them to take up a sport. Frugby has now spread throughout the Scottish west coast and is becoming more and more popular. It may sound ridiculous but it is similar to the "jump london" craze a few years ago. Vote by user Poker Face, who's first and only edit was this vote. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FFrugby&amp;diff=21443973&amp;oldid=21398681" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FFrugby&amp;diff=21443973&amp;oldid=21398681" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
<li><b>keep</b> Frugby means alot to alot of people and to remove would be to remove the most important part of their community. Frugby has touched the hearts and souls of many people in the Oban area and this site is a perfect way of spreading the message further afeild. in these troubled times the only thinks that keep us saine are what remains of our community spirit.

<li><b>keep</b> I am the author of this thread and whilst that may make my opinion biased i really do see a need for this thread. I don't believe the thread is at all Vain; i tried to make it as informative as possible to as wide an audience as possible. On the subject of the logo; it is barely recognisable from the EA logo and it has been altered substantialy enough to avoid copyright infringement. If need be i would be happy to edit the article again to better meet with your criteria.<s>Johnk</s> vote cast by IP 80.44.126.27 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Frugby&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=21446503" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Frugby&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=21446503" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Through one of my many adventures throughout the World Wide Web, I have recently come across the sport of Frugby. Pursuing my curiosity, I tried Wikipedia to see if I can find out more about the support. Upon seeing this entry, I believe that this sport has potential throughout the world to become major. Deleting this entry will not help the inventors of Fruby, and it may stop the sport from becoming Global.</li>
</ul>
<p>How can it be vanity if i am not referring to myself or including myself? Also they are the social elite of the area. Half of them are Dux of the local High school, one of them is a fleet admiral in the navy, and the other is from America. So they are all elite.johnk <b>Keep</b> someone please have the courtacy to explain why this article has to be deleted? Believe it or not but it is actually not a piss take. Also why are all positive votes being deleted. The IP address is the same as it is actually possible to have more than one person using the same internet connection.</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, however these people are the ones who are most likely to read the article and ,currently, those who will get most out of it.
<ul>
<li>Since, it is most likely a local thing, what you could do is copy the information you have here and start up your own website about Frugby. There are various website providers willing to give you free space to use. But, on Wikipedia, we have criteria of what can be included. And some users feel that Frugby does not meet these standards. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 19:39, 20 August 2005 (UTC)#</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>what about the article you have about yourself? is that not, most likely, a "local" thing? Personaly i would say this is of more interest to more people than any article you have written about yourself. As this has been accused of being an essay on vanity (which it isnt) how would you describe your own autiobiographical piece?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>What I have is called a user page. Wikipedians, once they get an account, are given a page to put information about themselves if they want. If you sign up for an account, you are given one of these pages and you put the information about Frugby on there. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 19:52, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>how about i change my username to frugby and put the article there? or is that against the rules too?</p>
<p>what about if i include a single paragraph about myself?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Create an account called Frugby (which is legal). If put the article there and a paragraph about yourself on your user page, that is fine too. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 19:58, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>who should i contact with regards to a bribe to keep this page?
<ul>
<li>I do not take bribes, but most likely, the page will be deleted. And, if that is the case, you and your friends are not allowed to create it. If so, the page will fall under speedy deletion and will be deleted without going through this process. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 20:17, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
but everyone accepts bribes.... how about i threaten to kill myself?</p>
<p>also are you aware that an article entitled "---- hole" has been available for longer than this.</p>
<p>"Frugby" is the least of your worries.</p>

<li>---- hole was deleted as an attack page. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 20:33, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
