<p>Artist and Composer Mark Kostabi was born in Los Angeles in 1960 to Estonian immigrants. He was raised in Whittier, California and studied drawing and painting at California State University, Fullerton. In 1982 he moved to New York and by 1984 he became a leading figure of the East Village art scene. During that time he also developed a provocative media persona by publishing self-interviews which commented on the commodification of contemporary art. By 1987 his works were widely exhibited in New York galleries and prominently throughout the United States, in Japan, Germany and Australia. In 1988, inspiring extensive international press coverage, he founded Kostabi World - his large New York studio known for openly employing numerous painting assistants and idea people. In 1996 be began dividing his time between New York and Rome and consequently his work's already strong presence in the Italian art scene was vigorously enhanced.</p>
<p>Kostabi produces a weekly cable TV show, Name That Painting, where noted art critics compete to title his paintings for cash awards.</p>
<p>He writes an advice column for artists, Ask Mark Kostabi, for Artnet.com.</p>
<p>Kostabi has designed album covers for Guns 'N' Roses (Use Your Illusion) and The Ramones (Adios Amigos) and numerous products including a Swatch watch, limited-edition vases, espresso cups, computer accessories and a Giro d'Italia pink jersey.</p>
<p>Kostabi is also known for his many collaborations with other artists including Enzo Cucchi, Arman, Howard Finster, Tadanori Yokoo and Enrico Baj.</p>
<p>Kostabi's music has been performed internationally by orchestras and soloists including Rein Rannap, Kristjan Jarvi, Maano Manni, Delilah Gutman, the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra, and Kostabi himself. His CDs are: I Did It Steinway, Songs For Sumera and New Alliance. Retrospective exhibitions of Kostabi's paintings have been held at the Mitsukoshi Museum in Tokyo (1992) and the Art Museum of Estonia in Tallinn (1998). Kostabi's work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, The National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome and the Groninger Museum in Holland.</p>
<p>His permanent public works include a mural in Palazzo dei Priori in Arezzo, Italy and a large bronze sculpture in the central square of San Benedetto del Tronto, Italy</p>
<p>Kostabi has been profiled on 60 Minutes, Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, A Current Affair, Nightwatch (with Charlie Rose), The Oprah Winfrey Show, Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, Nonsolomoda, West 57th, CNN, MTV and numerous television programs throughout Europe and Japan. In print he has been featured in The New York Times, People, Vogue, The Face, Playboy, Forbes, New York Magazine, Domus, Corriera Della Sera, Panorama, Artforum, Art in America, ARTnews, Flash Art, Arte, Arte In and Tema Celeste.</p>
<p>The many books published about Kostabi include Sadness Because the Video Rental Store Was Closed, Kostabi: The Early Years, Conversations with Kostabi, The Rhythm of Inspiration, Mark Kostabi and the East Village Scene 1983-1987 and Mark Kostabi in the 21st Century.</p>

<p>The phrase "fuzzy blue mice with cell phones" was first written on a much-folded piece of paper. On each fold of the paper was written a different warning such as "Don't read it," "Don't say it," "Don't hear it," "Don't write it," "Don't eat it," etc. The person would unfold the paper, gradually seeing all the different warnings appear. At the end, one saw the phrase "fuzzy blue mice with cell phones" on the inside of the paper and of course disobeyed many of the commands by reading it, seeing it, often saying it (and therefore hearing it), etc. MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!</p>

<p>Northvia, an instrumental post rock band, formed in the fall of 2001 when Thomas Lloyd (Guitar) and Rob Colclasure (Drums) met in Tallahassee, Fl. Soon after Rick Arnow (Bass) and John Garner (Guitar) joined the group as when they first performed in February of 2002. After recording two EP in Hattiesburg, MS (S/T, Your Detached and Self Obsessed) in 2003 and 2004, Rick Arnow left the band and was replaced by Rob’s brother William Colclasure (Bass). Citing influences ranging from Radiohead to Samuel Barber, Northvia has developed their own niche in the post-rock genre. In 2005 they recorded their first full length album Sleeping in Ariports which has yet to have been released.</p>

<p>The Sack AS-6 is a circular winged aircraft design. Designed prior to WWII in Germany by Arthur Sack and it consists of an airplane resembeling a saucer. Instead of two of four wings, this aircraft was designed like a frisbee, however instead of the rotation action of a frisbee it was still a prepellar and wing design. From the side the Sack AS-6 looks virtually identical to the typical shape of man made plane. From above it looks like a circle with an engine and propellar extending outward from the cirle in the front.</p>

<p>Founded in Norway, Kansas in early 2005, Mehyam founders Lord Fishsnach II (Bass), and Furonymus (Guitar) began looking for like-minded individuals to help create the Black Metal machine that is MehYaM. They found those individuals in Re-Undead (Vocals) and El-Hammer (Drums).<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Since then, they have been dilligent in writing new material and making musical connections. In the last year they have gone through several lineup changes, before ultimately reuniting the original lineup to continue work on their yet untitled first album which was originally dated for late 2005. The album was never released. The band continues to work on it, and has given no indication as to the timeframe for it's release.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>However, the band did release a very scarce EP called "The Bagpuss EP" in the fall of 2005. The number of copies released is believed to be less than 25, making it an instant collectable for any black metal fan who can get their hands on it. The band has composed nearly 30 songs, and is in the process of slimming that number down to determine the final track listing.</p>

<p>In 1881 in Bürmoss by <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salzburg.html" title="Salzburg">Salzburg</a> he used the legal estate of a former <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glassworks.html" title="Glassworks">glassworks</a> company that went bankruptcy four years before and he bought a giant moor area. He expanded the factory with four glass ovens, which worked with turf. He also founded a brickyard, which was very successful and which existed throughout the seventies of the 20th century. Bit by bit he then bought further moor areas in the neighboring Weidmoos and at Ibmer moor, where he also started to cultivate hop. In the middle of the Ibmer moor area, in Hackbuch, <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Austria_6922.html" title="Upper Austria">Upper Austria</a>, he established another glass factory. The turf factory was very unstable because it depended on the weather a lot and the turf supplies draw to a close. Thus Ignaz Glaser bought a closed sugar factory in north bohemian Bruex und established a new glass factory. In that factory ovens were heated with coal from open pit, which made the company independent from weather conditions. After Ignaz Glaser’s death in 1916, his son Dr. Hermann Glaser, born on August 18th 1889, took over the glass factory, which experienced a short economical boom after World War 1. But then the company missed the update to mechanical flat glass fabrication and the Glaser Empire broke down in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>. In Bürmoos flat glass was produced by the company named Stiassny until the end of <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>, which had then bought the holdings. At this point glass fabrication was shut down totally. 80% of the population there was unemployed.</p>
<p>Ignaz Glaser’s grave is at the jewisch cemetery in Salzburg – Aigen. His son Dr. Hermann Glaser survived the Holocaust in <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai.html" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> and died on January 10th, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> in Vienna.</p>

<p>Electronics Australia was Australia's longest-running general electronics magazine.</p>
<p>It can claim to trace its history to 1922 when the 'Wireless Weekly' magazine was formed. This comprised a mix of general and technical articles on the new topic of radio.</p>
<p>In 1939 the magazine became monthly and was renamed Radio and Hobbies. As its name suggests it was a more technical publication for hobbyists, but it also featured articles on television, optics, music and aviation. It's base was however radio and many constructional projects were published. The magazine's foundation editor was John Moyle.</p>
<p>With the advent of television, 'television' was added to its title in the 1950s. The magazine then was known as Radio Television &amp; Hobbies, or RTV&amp;H. During these years numerous constructional articles on high fidelity audio, amateur radio and even electronic organs and television sets were published.</p>
<p>The growing fields of scientific, medical, computing and other applications of electronics necessitated a name change to 'Electronics Australia' in 1965.</p>
<p>Although many competitors came and went (eg Electronics Today International and Australian Electronics Monthly) during the 1970s and 80s, Electronics Australia survived into the 2000s.</p>
<p>For a couple of years more consumer electronics items were introduced, and technical material occupied the rear pages. Many Electronics Australia staff moved to its main rival <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_Chip_9dc4.html" title="Silicon Chip">Silicon Chip</a>.</p>
<p>A change of name to Electronics Australia Today spelt the death knell. All technical content was removed and EAT changed focus to become a purely consumer publication. Original readers and advertisers deserted in droves and the magazine failed to pick up new readers (there were already many established magazines covering consumer electronics).</p>
<p>The rights to Electronics Australia ar now owned by <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_Chip_9dc4.html" title="Silicon Chip">Silicon Chip</a> who have now some made back issues available on CD.</p>

<p>David Goesling is the blackwood Football Club's newest asset. He is known simply known as "gozza" or the "romancer of lanky". 2006 is gozza first year of senior football and has blossemed into a star of the future. His Bucket hands, likend to stuart Lowe or Jonothan Brown are known among his opponents and respect for this new player has spread like lanky's anus when he is in the company of gourdie. Many people like to relate "Goz" to ryan o keefe in which david can pull down coutless marks from a centre half forward postion or sweep the backlines and propell his team into attack. Recently David was put in the backlines to stem the flow from the best team in the league and gathered an amazing 20 kicks in only his second outing for the year.</p>
<p>In his first pre season hitout he recieved best on groud hounours whilst only playing a half against the mighty ironbank.

<p>UNITE is Australia’s newest union. It is a fighting union for fast food and retail workers in Victoria. The union grew out of the UNITE campaign for casual workers rights. The campaign first started in Melbourne in 2003 as an organisation fighting for low paid and casual workers. Its most notable campaigns were the ‘name and shame’ campaign on Brunswick Street in Fitzroy and the campaign to unionise Boarders Books on Lygon Street in Carlton.</p>
<p>Whilst the campaigning of UNITE did lead to improvements in the wages and conditions for some workers in Melbourne’s inner suburbs, it became clear that much more than a lobby group was required to take on the massive issues faced by workers in the fast food and retails sectors.</p>
<p>That is why in May 2006 UNITE decided to turn the campaign into a trade union covering fast food and retail workers. The fast food and retail industries are a source of employment for thousands of young people. The life of a worker in these industries usually means casual hours, low pay, workplace bullying, and unsafe work practices.</p>
<p>UNITE has been set up with task of making trade unionism relevant to young people. It is an organisation that educates young people about their rights in the workplace, that takes up the issues that young people face in the wider community and organises them to fight back and win the decent wages and conditions that they deserve.</p>
<p>Whilst UNITE is technically not be a ‘registered’ union it is able legally represent groups of workers in negotiations with employers.</p>

<p>Adyashanti is a spiritual teacher in the Bay area. He was born <b>Steven Gray</b> in 1962. He studied Zen under Arvis Joen Justin, a student of Maezumi Roshi, and Kwong Roshi, a student of Suzuki Roshi. He dares all seekers of peace and freedom to take the possibility of liberation in this life seriously. He began teaching in 1996, at the request of his Zen teacher with whom he had been studying for 14 years. Since then many spiritual seekers have awakened to their true nature while spending time with Adyashanti.</p>
<p>The author of Emptiness Dancing, The Impact of Awakening, and My Secret is Silence, Adyashanti offers spontaneous and direct nondual teachings that have been compared to those of the early Zen masters and Advaita Vedanta sages. However, Adya says, "If you filter my words through any tradition or '-ism', you will miss altogether what I am saying. The liberating truth is not static; it is alive. It cannot be put into concepts and be understood by the mind. The truth lies beyond all forms of conceptual fundamentalism. What you are is the beyond—awake and present, here and now already. I am simply helping you to realize that."</p>
<p>A native of Northern California, Adyashanti lives with his wife, Annie, and teaches extensively in the San Francisco Bay Area offering satsangs, weekend intensives, and silent retreats. He also travels to teach in other areas of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>"Adyashanti" means primordial peace.</p>

<p>Phi Rho Alpha is a local sorority whose Alpha Chapter was established at the University of Michigan in 2005. Its founders, Nicole DiPaolo and Sarah Daniel, desired to create a n organization that would be more accomodating of its sisters' busy schedules; at the same time, it would avoid common stereotypes and prejudices ascribed to many other sororities.</p>
<p>Phi Rho Alpha's letters correspond to the Greek translation of the sorority's motto, "Friendship Rooted in Individuality." This motto was formulated by Nicole DiPaolo and is considered the foundation of the sorority's ideaology.</p>
<p>Phi Rho Alpha's mission statement, written by Sarah Daniel and published on the Phi Rho Alpha website, is as follows: "The purpose of PHI RHO ALPHA shall be to establish a lasting bond of friendship and sisterhood between its members, to promote strength and character among its sisters, and to instill in its members the values of respect, individuality, and leadership."</p>
<p>Phi Rho Alpha's symbols are the climbing ivy and the pyramid. Its colors are sunset pink and aquamarine, both of which are represented by its jewel, alexandrite. The mascot of Phi Rho Alpha is the white wolf, and its flower is the pink magnolia. The significance of these symbols is revealed to new sisters during the intake process (known as "pledging").</p>
<p>The rush process for Phi Rho Alpha differs greatly from the more commonly known "Fall Formal Rush" utilized by most national sororities. Phi Rho Alpha hosts various "rush events" every semester (as opposed to only once a year) that give prospective members the option of meeting Phi Rho Alpha sisters and pledges in an informal setting. Interested women then submit an application form, downloadable from the website, and are scheduled for a brief interview. Once they are extended a bid from Phi Rho Alpha, they may begin the pledge process. Initiation generally takes place towards the end of the semester during which new members accepted their bids.</p>
<p>Phi Rho Alpha takes part in many philanthropic events during the semester, most notably the University-wide Relay for Life, a fundraiser for cancer research. Our members have also participated in events such as K-Grams, Dance Marathon, and Goodness Day. As of the 2006-2007 school year, Phi Rho Alpha will embark on its official philanthropy, the Reach Out and Read program.</p>

<p>Activities: • The 3rd CAG will provide support to civil administration, governance, economic development, and reconstruction. • The Marines and Sailors of 3rd CAG travel to communities and facilitate projects that repair, renovate or build public utilities, roads, schools, businesses, factories and medical clinics. • They assist the Iraqi elected official and ministry offices in restoring and maintaining essential and sustained services.</p>
<p>Structure: • 3rd CAG has approximately 200 Marines and Sailors, and is organized into a headquarters element, liaison element and four detachments. • 3rd CAG has one detachment that mans the Provincial Civil-Military Operations Center (PCMOC) in ar-Ramadi. CMOCs in Al Qaim, Haditha, Ramadi and Fallujah serve as the primary interface between the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF) and the al-Anbar provincial government. • The other three Detachments provide support to Marine and Army infantry battalions, regiments, and brigade of I MEF throughout al-Anbar. • Each Detachment consists of a headquarters element and up to nine civil affairs teams.

<p>Mission: • To support the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force and the Multinational Force West-Iraq in their endeavors to create an independent and secure Iraq. • Facilitate and coordinate relationships with the Iraqi Government, coalition forces, non-governmental agencies, and international organizations that will increase communication between the military forces, civilians and other agencies. • The goal of 3rd CAG is to ensure the people of Al-Anbar are equipped with the resources, knowledge, and confidence to become self-sufficient and obtain Provincial Iraq control. • 3rd CAG’s focus is to provide the people of Iraq with the tools and training they need to stimulate their economy and to have self-reliant economic growth.</p>
<p>Activities: • The 3rd CAG will provide support to civil administration, governance, economic development, and reconstruction. • The Marines and Sailors of 3rd CAG travel to communities and facilitate projects that repair, renovate or build public utilities, roads, schools, businesses, factories and medical clinics. • They assist the Iraqi elected official and ministry offices in restoring and maintaining essential and sustained services.</p>
<p>Structure: • 3rd CAG has approximately 200 Marines and Sailors, and is organized into a headquarters element, liaison element and four detachments. • 3rd CAG has one detachment that mans the Provincial Civil-Military Operations Center (PCMOC) in ar-Ramadi. CMOCs in Al Qaim, Haditha, Ramadi and Fallujah serve as the primary interface between the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF) and the al-Anbar provincial government. • The other three Detachments provide support to Marine and Army infantry battalions, regiments, and brigade of I MEF throughout al-Anbar. • Each Detachment consists of a headquarters element and up to nine civil affairs teams. They conduct tactical civil military operations and support three CMOCs throughout Al Anbar. • A municipal CMOC has recently been opened to support the municipal government of Ramadi on issues distinct from provincial matters.</p>
<p><br />
Background: • The 3rd Civil Affairs Group (CAG) was activated June 6, 1985 and is one of only two civil affairs groups, (the other being 4th CAG) in the Marine Corps. Both 3rd and 4th CAG are reserve units and have deployed twice since 2003. Currently for 2006, is 3rd CAG’s 3rd deployment to Iraq. • There have been two provisional civil affairs groups formed to support the ongoing civil affairs mission in Iraq. 5th and 6th CAG provided relief to the two permanent civil affairs groups. • Civil affairs units conduct civil affairs activities and plan and support civil-military operations. These operations allow the military to interact and coordinate with the people of a foreign nation to provide emergency aid or assist in rebuilding a community after a crisis situation. Depending on the circumstance, civil-military operations can include a variety of missions. • The Marines and Sailors of 3rd CAG have supported Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, active components of all branches of the U.S. Military during exercises and operations in Thailand, Korea, Kenya, Central America, the Caribbean, Japan and the United States, Operation Enduring Freedom, peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, and Southern Command Humanitarian Civic Assistance operations in Latin and South America.</p>
<p>Demographics: • The Marines and Sailors of 3rd CAG are a diverse group comprised of mostly reserve personnel. • The members of 3rd CAG contribute their expertise to the unit with vast skills and knowledge from their civilian jobs and personal backgrounds. • The Group includes engineers, teachers, lawyers, mechanics, a state-elected official, police officers/law enforcement, bankers, computer technicians, students, accountants, stock brokers, a surgeon, doctors, nurses, business managers, fire fighters, a pharmacist and active duty Marines.</p>
<p>Training: • During a three month period, the Marines and Sailors of 3rd CAG received training in Arabic language, culture, history, civil administration, a full-range of infantry tactics training, and Iraq-specific security and stabilization operations, to include convoy operation, patrolling, detainee handling, combat lifesaving and more.</p>
<p>Al-Anbar Province: • Al-Anbar, the largest of Iraq’s 18 provinces, is a vast desert region that stretches east from Baghdad to the Saudi Arabian, Jordanian and Syrian borders. Most of its people live in the many cities, towns and villages along the fertile belt of land along the Euphrates River.</p>

<p>Minitel, established in 1987, is as a leading value added, multi-platform distributor of IT software and hardware products in Portugal, with indirect sales through a 1200-strong reseller network and all major Portuguese retail chains.</p>
<p>Minitel main distribution brands include Adobe, Macromedia, Symantec, McAfee, Quark, Scansoft, Iris, Wacom, LaCie, Belkin, Microtek, Umax, Seiko Precision, Seiko Instruments, Hauppauge, Archos, Formac, Sonnet, Crumpler, Saitek, Topcom and Skullcandy.</p>
<p>Minitel expanding IT activities led to the creation of group companiesMultiple Zones Portugal SA (1993) and Multiple Zones Spain (1995), both catalogue companies operating in Portugal and Spain under the trademarks PCZone and MacZone, Webzone (2005), a computer store chain with the exclusivity of the Apple Store Centers in Lisbon and Oporto , and Netcetera (2004), a service company specializing in computer security.</p>
<p>In 2005 Minitel began distribution activities into the Spanish market, operating from its own offices in central Madrid.</p>
<p>Business Philosophy</p>
<p>Minitel distributes its product lines exclusively through indirect sales channels.</p>
<p>These channels, initially centered on computer VARS and computer resellers, have evolved over the years to embrace also large national superstores, retail chains and supermarkets, such as FNAC, Vobis/Worten (Sonae), Staples (Office Centre), Carrefour, El Corte Inglès and MediaMarkt.</p>
<p>This consumer channel allows Minitel to move in volume its fast moving product lines like antivirus software, computer peripherals and software, as an extension its dealer network, carrying often the same product lines but further providing installation, training and after-sales support. High-end lines like Quark and Adobe software, high-end digital image scanners and complex antivirus systems are addressed through computer VARs and specialized dealers.</p>
<p>The need to offer support for its high-end product lines, given the complexities of the imaging, security and networking markets, has driven Minitel to build and grow over the years a strong technical team, aimed to provide Minitel resellers and VARS with fast response pre and after sales support and training.</p>
<p><br />
Minitel offers first line diagnosis and repair services for all its distribution lines; additionally, Minitel provides its resellers with special funding and back to back financing programs, aimed at a variety of purposes ranging from extra credit terms for demo equipment to renting and lease funding to the resellers clients.</p>
<p>Drawing upon Minitel market experience and background distributing US computer products in Portugal, and to address emerging market opportunities for a catalogue direct business, Minitel launched in 1993 a direct marketing company, Multiple Zones Portugal SA, publisher of Macintosh and PC catalogues under the trademarks MAC ZONE PORTUGAL and PC ZONE PORTUGAL, and focusing through its catalogues on advertising and marketing PC and Macintosh products to small and medium-sized companies, Government agencies and public companies, home businesses and end-users.</p>
<p>The quick success of Multiple Zones Portugal led Minitel to start Multiple Zones España SA in 1995, exploring similar business opportunities in the Spanish market; headquartered in Madrid, Spain, Multiple Zones España publishes PC and Mac catalogues under the trademarks MAC ZONE SPAIN and PC ZONE SPAIN.</p>
<p>Through an agreement with Apple Europe , Multiple Zones Portugal opened the first New Deal Apple Centers in Portugal , on the flagship Amoreiras Shopping Center complex in Lisbon (October 2005 ) and at Oporto Av. Da Boavista, one of the city most prestigious business and shopping areas ( February 2006 ).</p>
<p>Minitel skills and in-depth knowledge in anti-virus and security technologies (Minitel is the main partner of Symantec in Portugal and one of its oldest distributors worldwide) were behind Minitel decision to start Netcetera, a service company which supports Minitel reseller community in the deployment of anti-virus, Internet and communication systems.</p>
<p>All 4 companies, although part of the same group, are totally differentiated from Minitel, through their own corporate identity, staff and independent management teams, allowing them market flexibility needed to quickly address and exploit emerging market opportunities and niches in the IT sector.</p>

<p>The hottest point of the day is generally the time from 12:00 noon to 3:00. From 3:00 to 4:00 the temperature decreases about 1 to 3 degrees, and usually stays around this temperature until sundown where it decreases much more. Although in Hawaii the temperature is much more dependable, and from about 4:00p.m. to 4:30p.m. the temperature is higher than any other time of the day. This is because the temperature builds up throughout the day and at about 4:00p.m. the temperature peaks. The temperature in michigan definately does not peak around 4:00p.m.</p>

<p><b>Jwhwlao Daimalu</b> is considered as a hero of the ancient golden period of the Bodos.Today,he is remembered as the cause of <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodo_people.html" title="Bodo people">Bodo people</a>'s tragedy because it is believed the he had cursed the Bodos for the deeds of some people who betrayed him.A statue of Jwhwlao Daimalu carrying his bow and arrows can be seen pointing his hand to the sky near the national highway of India in the Kharigao village of <a href="../../../k/o/k/Kokrajhar.html" title="Kokrajhar">Kokrajhar</a> District</p>

<p>Jwhwlao Daimalu was a senior official during the reign of King Iragdao.It is said that brave Daimalu along with his troops had defeated the King of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burma.html" title="Burma">Burma</a> and had brought white elephants as a token of victory.</p>

<p>It is believed that Lord Shiva had appeared in Daimalu's dream.Lord <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">shiva</a> had asked Jwhwlao for his needs for super natural powers.Given any of five fingers of the Lord to choose from Jwhwlao grabbed all of the fingers of Lord Shiva.The consequence of this is that jwhwlao got all the powers in the five fingers but then Lord Shiva cursed him that he was so greedy to be betrayed by his own blood. Daimalu had become very powerful as time passed by and by.The collegues of Daimalu were then becoming jealous of the bravery and power of daimalu;he could defeat two elephants at a moment.So the collegues somehow made the king to go against daimalu and thus Jwhwlao was put to prison.But no one could kill him because of the blessings of Lord Shiva.Then the officials brought Daimalu's step mother to meet Daimalu and they somehow managed to bring the step mother to their side.The step mother was able to find out that Daimalu can be killed only if they pour liquid metal into his ear.Thus the officials were able to kill Daimalu.But Daimalu,just before his death cursed that bodos will never prosper.</p>

<p>In 1976, a group of dedicated people with a dedicated pastor, James Hockensmith, began a school inside the newly built addition to the Sumiton Church of God. Classes for K-4 and K-5 were held in Sunday School rooms. The name of the new school was KIDDIE COLLEGE; the first teachers included Diane Cheatham in K-4 with Janice Greer and Mary Barton sharing the duties in K-5. In 1983, the highly successful KIDDIE COLLEGE expanded to include grades K-3 through seventh grade. The school continued to hold classes in the Sunday School department of the church. The name was changed to PATHWAY CHRISTIAN SCHOOL. The enrollment more than tripled. The name of the school was changed again when Pathway Christian School became known as Sumiton Christian School in 1986. At the same time, another giant step was taken. A new building was built and the school moved to their new home in the autumn of 1986.</p>
<p>S.C.S. had an administrative change as Rebecca Potts became head administrator and principal in 1989. Under the leadership of Potts, Sumiton Christian outgrew the main building. The school board and pastors council voted to build and in the fall of 1992 elementary and junior high entered Building Two, equipped with a library, computer lab, and cafeteria-style lunchroom. The enrollment had climbed to 325. Finally, in 1995, Sumiton Christian graduated it's first class.</p>

<p>Asynchronous Thread Messaging is when messages are sent but are asynchonous to the running of the program - i.e. the thread doesn't have to wait for the message to continue. Examples of this are found in CONIC and POSIX. There are many drawbacks with this model, however. Firstly potentially infinite buffers are needed to store message that have not yet been read. This is further compounded by the fact that the receiver may have been terminated. As asynchronous communication between threads is always out of date then many sending threads expect anacknowledgement in the form of a synchronous communication; ths can lead to the sender being deadlocked by the non-response of the receiver. The thread model must be more complex to cope with this; more communications are associated with use of asynchronous communication (as detailed above) and therefore more stringent fault checking, and graceful degradation of deadlocked senders must be implemented. Finally the correctness of the competed system is mre difficult to prove using traditional modelling tools, as the asynchronous nature of the messages makes their timing difficult to predict.</p>

The first collection of his modern poems was published in 1962 and he has published 8 more collections of poetry since that date. In 1964 he began writing critical and historical analysis of modern Persian poetry and his first voluminous book on this subject (known as "Sovar va Asbaab") was published in 1968. He directed two feature films and 20 documentaries during the next 4 years and, at the same time, taught Persian literature and culture at the Tehran University. In 1973 he left Iran to continue his studies at the London University. He finished his studies in 1978, returned to Iran after the Revolution and was forced to leave the country in 1980. He resided in London for 14 more years and immigrated to the USA (Denver, Colorado) in 1994. Nooriala was one of the first 9 writers who set up the Association of Iranian Writers in 1967.

<p>Investments in a market have different returns and level of risk. The most important point is not to compare the returns of different investments if they have a different level of risks involved. To do so the investor should have standardized way known as risk adjustment where an invester can compare 2 inventments with different level of risks.</p>
<p>In this way if the investor over exceeds the market other invested funds in the market then it is called outperformed the market or beat the market.</p>

<p>Folding Curves</p>
<p>It’s really quite simple- to curve. Our mind is accustomed to thinking folding paper will always result in a flat result. But that is not the case as folding only in a straight line can give you flat results, but if you fold in a non linear way such as a parabolic line/ curve; the result will be a 3-dimensional work of art with a curved fold. If you really work hard soon you will be able to create impressive and complicated works of art.<br />
Paper Folding<br />
Origami is an ancient Chinese and Japanese art of paper folding. Unexpectedly, information available online proved to be scarce. In the geometry of paper folding, a straight line becomes a crease or a fold. Instead of drawing straight lines, one folds a piece of paper and flattens the crease. Folding paper is analogous to mirroring one half of a plane in a crease. Thus folding means both drawing a crease and mapping one half of a plane onto another. As in the usual Geometry, the distinction is being made between experimentation with the physical paper and the abstract theory of "paper folding". "Abstract paper" may be folded indefinitely although in practice the number of folds is by necessity limited. In the Paper Folding Geometry, a straight line - a fold - is clearly a primary object; a point is defined as the intersection of two folds. But why a fold can be thought of as modeling a straight line? This question was posted as a problem in the American Mathematical Monthly in 1939 and answered in 1940 (E395, p. 398): In high school geometry texts and elsewhere one frequently meets the statement that the reason for straightness of a crease in a folded piece of paper is that the intersection of two planes in a straight line. This is fallacious. What is the correct reason? The answer is Let P, P' be two points of the paper that are brought into coincidence by the process of folding. Then any point A of the crease is equidistant from P, P', since the lines AP, AP' are pressed into coincidence. Hence the crease, being the locus of such points A, is the perpendicular bisector of PP'. To put it candidly, I am not sure why the reference to the intersection of two planes is fallacious. Perhaps, because the argument would require an additional assumption of a paper piece being a plane figure. However, it seems to me that the "correct" argument assumes at least as much. Perpendicular bisectors exist in geometries other than the Euclidean plane, e.g., they are naturally defined on a sphere.<br />
It's not an idle question. In essence, it's a question of the relationship between mathematics and the worldly experience. Here is a later day answer to the same question</p>
<p><br />
“It's a common knowledge that folding a sheet of paper yields a straight line. We start our discussion of paper folding with a mathematical explanation of this phenomenon. The model for a paper sheet is a piece of the plane; folding is an isometry of the part of the plane on one side of the fold to another, the fold being the curve of fixed points of this isometry. The Statement is that this curve is straight, that is, has zero curvature. If not, consider an arc  of the fold with nonvanishing curvature. Let + be a curve at (small) distance  from  on the concave side, and let  − be the corresponding curve on the convex side.</p>
<p><br />
Then</p>
<dl>
<dd>length + &gt; length  &gt; length  − ,</dd>
</dl>
<p>where the difference between length + and  − is of order</p>
<dl>
<dd> • length  • curvature .</dd>
</dl>
<p>On the other hand, the isometry takes + to  − , so</p>
<dl>
<dd>length + = length  − .</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a contradiction.” Pretty curiously the next sentence in the paper reads: In spite of what has just been said, one can fold paper along an arbitrary smooth curve! All it takes to accomplish this feat is to give up the requirement that the portions of the paper on two sides of the curve meet at zero angle. This requirement is implicit in the "flattening out" operation applied to a crease in paper folding geometry. As opposed to origami by which I mean a practical art of creating paper artifacts, paper folding as a mathematical discipline of geometric construction was introduced in 1983 by T. Sundar Row and first put on a rigorous basis by R. C. Yates in 1949. In 1991, the Italian-Japanese mathematician Humiaki Huzita formulated 6 axioms of paper folding each abstracting an operation feasible with a concrete piece of paper. I shall describe the axioms in terms of the construction with the straightedge and compass. He has shown that angle trisection can be performed for any angle defined by two folds.</p>
<p>Axiom Construction O1 There exists a single fold connecting two distinct points. This is the first of Euclid's Postulates O2 Given two points P1 and P2, there exists a unique fold that maps P1 onto P2. Draw the perpendicular bisector of P1P2: Sweep two arcs with centers at the two points and the same radii. Connect the points of intersection. O3 Given two creases L1 and L2, there exists a unique fold that maps L1 onto L2. Draw the angle bisector between L1 and L2 (If the lines are parallel, this is another parallel line midway between L1 and L2): Let O be the point of intersection of L1 and L2. From O, along L1 and L2 measure equal segments OA and OB. Draw two arcs of equal radii centered at A and B till they intersect at C. OC is the angular bisector of the angle defined by L1 and L2 in case they intersect. O4 Given a point P and a crease L, there exists a unique fold through P perpendicular to L. Drop a perpendicular from a point to a line: Find two points A and B on L equidistant to P. With centers at A and B, draw two arcs of equal radii till their intersection. Each of the cross points lies on the sought perpendicular. O5 For given points P1 and P2 and a crease L, there exists a fold that passes through P1 and maps P2 into L.</p>
<p>With radius P1P2 and center P1, draw an arc till it intersects L at point A. Drop a perpendicular from P1 on AP2 (Axiom O4). Remark: Obviously the construction is only possible if the length of P1P2 is not less than the distance from P1 to L. Therefore, axiom O5 can't universally hold. I will have to look into the original source for clarification. Even when it exists the fold may not be unique. O6 Given two points P1 and P2 and two creases L1 and L2, there exists a unique fold that maps P1 into L1 and P2 into L2. As shall be seen, axiom O is equivalent to solving a third degree equation. Therefore, in general, it can't be performed with the straightedge and compass. One of the simplest and most natural paper folding procedures is to form a flat "paper roll" by folding the paper several times with creases parallel to each other. In this manner, we obtain equidistant points on any crease not parallel to the fold. The paper folding geometry may be expected to justify this construction. Indeed, from axiom O4 we get the following. Statement Let points P1 and P2 lie on a crease L. There exists a unique point P on L (different from P1) such that PP2 = P1P2.<br />
Paper can be bent or creased. Because it is not stretchable, when we bend paper, its surface is similar to the surface of a cylinder or a cone on which some lines always remain straight.</p>
<p>But by creasing paper, one can create really wonderful shapes such as you may see in any book about origami.</p>
<p>It is less known that you can crease paper along curved lines, and so you can create paper sculptures and other objects built from curved surfaces without much gluing or taping with Scotch tape.</p>

<p><a href="http://lyricsfly.com/" class="external text" title="http://lyricsfly.com/" rel="nofollow">Lyricsfly</a> is a large collection of song lyrics indexed by suggesting search results in real time as fast as you type in the search box. The ads on this page are minimal and layout is very similar to the known Google search engine. The system is based on Google suggest ajax script which is used on four different types of searches.</p>
<p><a href="http://lyricsfly.com/artist/" class="external text" title="http://lyricsfly.com/artist/" rel="nofollow">artist</a> - which is the default front page option, the system will suggest artists from its entire library</p>
<p><a href="http://lyricsfly.com/song/" class="external text" title="http://lyricsfly.com/song/" rel="nofollow">song</a> - which rather quickly blasts through over 300,000 titles as you type</p>
<p><a href="http://lyricsfly.com/album/" class="external text" title="http://lyricsfly.com/album/" rel="nofollow">album</a> - an option incase you know the album and want to see just the songs on it</p>
<p><a href="http://lyricsfly.com/lyrics/" class="external text" title="http://lyricsfly.com/lyrics/" rel="nofollow">lyrics</a> - which actually searches the text inside the lyrics. A very useful function if you know the lyrics but can't figure out who the artist is or what the song title is.</p>
<p>The lyrics search does not however suggest every possible lyrics text as this would probably mean millions if not billions of phrases would have to be stored and called up in real time. Instead, the system uses previously recorded user input for suggestions and actually suggests what you might be looking for. If you manage to come up with a unique phrase and you don't hit the limit of songs found, your search phrase will be recorded instantly and will be added to the suggestion library for next user who types that exact phrase. Also, in the view page while actually viewing the lyrics the search phrase will be highlighted.</p>
<p>Lyricsfly has also a very slick correction/<a href="http://lyricsfly.com/submit/" class="external text" title="http://lyricsfly.com/submit/" rel="nofollow">addition</a>/deletion ajax based system. There are no signups required and all changes can be made very quickly and <a href="http://lyricsfly.com/db_stats/" class="external text" title="http://lyricsfly.com/db_stats/" rel="nofollow">approvals</a> are usually committed within 1-2 days. You can continue to correct a given title while other users might re-correct your correction. The delete option will let you "mark" a title as duplicate. You can also e-mail a link to each title as well as print from an optional print view which strips all ads and pictures as well as gives you an option to resize the font on the fly.</p>
<p>Pictures on lyricsfly are very minimal with artist pictures in the artist search option as well as album cover for most tiles. Clicking on the album cover will give you a larger view as well as an option to print it.</p>
<p>Ads are very minimal, currently limited to Google ads only. The site has a very <a href="http://lyricsfly.com/info/#popups" class="external text" title="http://lyricsfly.com/info/#popups" rel="nofollow">tight policy about popups</a> which simply put, will not ever be used as an advertising form.</p>
<p><a href="http://lyricsfly.com/info/#legality" class="external text" title="http://lyricsfly.com/info/#legality" rel="nofollow">Legal side</a> of the site is also interesting as the creators do not represent the service as just another large database offering copyrighted material for free. Instead, it is recognized as a search engine which crawls and caches lyrics just like others do web pages.</p>
<p>Overall, the site looks very promising, striking a very strong controversy against the widely popular lyrics sites. Most of which offer very little and trash their pages with popups and flash ads. While already very useful, the site will continue to grow and some day may be the most accurate and the cleanest place to get lyrics to your favorite song titles.</p>

<p>There are two versions of the song. The first, 'Ons Gelderland' is sung the most, but the second, 'het Geldersch Volkslied', is considered by many to be the official anthem. Since Gelderland is a province, and not a country, the officiality of either one remains undecided. Nowadays, the provincial government of Gelderland displays 'Ons Gelderland' on their website. In the past they have stated 'het Geldersch Volkslied' to be the official anthem.</p>
<p>A remarkable detail to note is that each version can be sung to the same tune. Since the texts have already been put to different tunes, this is a surprisingly convienient coincidence for many songwriters in Gelderland.</p>

<p>The first couplet sings about the geography of Gelderland. The second sings about the history and the third couplet is more of a <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymn.html" title="Hymn">hymn</a> to Gelderland, praising it as the Pearl of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The last lines are disputed, and often sung differently. They talk about a kingdom of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a>, which essentialy is nonexistent.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-30_31cb.html" title="Edit section: Dr. Mostafa Kamal Tolba">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dr. Mostafa Kamal Tolba</span></h2>
<p>Dr. Mostafa Kamal Tolba, world renowned scientist and for 17 years Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), has been an eloquent and tireless defender of the environment for most of his life.</p>
<p>Born in Egypt, a country whose economy depends on the waters of a river that flows through other states, made him aware of the link between environment and politics. He has always believed that common environmental interests should override political differences, even conflicts between nations. Dr. Mostafa Tolba was born in the town of Zifta, north of Cairo in 1922. He graduated with first class honours from Cairo University in 1943, and obtained his Ph.D. from the Imperial College, in 1948. He returned to Cairo to eventually become Professor in the Faculty of Science, Cairo University, where he established his own school in microbiology and is currently Emeritus Professor. He was also Professor in Baghdad University, 1954-1959. After this distinguished academic career, Dr Tolba joined the Egyptian civil service as Undersecretary of State for Higher Education and Minister of Youth, and on the international scene, as an alternate member of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO's) Executive Board. He became the first president of the newly established Academy for Scientific Research and Technology in 1971. As early as the mid-1970s, he concentrated on the issue of stratospheric ozone layer depletion as meriting careful monitoring on the scientific front. In 1972, he led his country's delegation to the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment which gave rise to UNEP. Immediately after Stockholm he was nominated as Deputy Executive Director of the newly established United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). Within 2 years, he became the Executive Director - a post he held until retiring at the end of 1992.</p>
<p><br />
In Vienna (1985), Montreal (1987) and later in London (1990), he managed to formulate the prototype model for dealing with global environmental issues and the effective mechanisms for the transfer of technology and funds to developing countries, as and when necessary, through the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol. It is to his leadership that much of the credit for directing the environment to the forefront of global thinking and action is due. He applied his belief that environmental decisions are inseparable from socio-political decisions in all his consultations with political leaders. His negotiating skills and scientific knowledge contributed to UNEP's most widely acclaimed success - the historic 1988 agreement to protect the ozone layer - the Montreal Protocol. The Protocol is recognized as setting a precedent for international preventive rather than corrective environmental action. At the Earth Summit in Brazil, he was at the helm of the negotiations when the Conventions on Climate Change and Biological Diversity were signed. He also successfully worked for treaties to protect the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. During the Iran-Iraq conflict he often had the warring parties at the same negotiating table discussing common environmental interests.</p>
<p><br />
Under his leadership, UNEP became the small core organization within the UN family, acting as the catalyst spurring governments, businesses, academia, IGOs and NGOs, to meaningful action. UNEP, one of the smallest members in the UN family, could leverage on average four times its modest budget to carry out more than a thousand projects. Pursuing his position during Stockholm, he diligently promoted his philosophy of "Development without Destruction". It implications are clearly reflected in his speeches, books and in UNEP's programmes, in many fields, and at many levels.</p>
<p><br />
Dr. Tolba has published over 95 papers on plant diseases, also more than 600 statements and articles on the environment. He has received many awards and prizes, both from academic institutions, governments and NGOs in many countries. These include honorary doctorates, awards, medals, and high decorations. He cherishes in particular the D.Sc. degrees from Moscow State University, and the University of Guadalajara; DLL, Williams College; fellowship of Imperial College, London; the Sasakawa Prize; the Only One Earth Award of the René Dubos Center; the Global Environmental Award (IAIA) in 2003; the Zayed International prize (2003); Global Environment Leadership Award (GEF) in 2003; the Distinguished International Service Award of the Regents of the University of Minnesota; high decorations from Hungary, Jordan, Morocco, Poland, Spain, USA, Yugoslavia, and the First Order Decoration of the Arab Republic of Egypt.</p>
<p><br />
Back in Egypt, Dr. Tolba established in 1994 the International Center for Environment and Development (ICED), a non profit organization, financing environmental projects in less developed countries through an endowment fund administered by an independent board of trustees. He is the president of ECOPAST - Centre for Environment and Our Common Past, Washington, D.C.; dealing with the impact of the air pollution on cultural heritage. He is also chairman of the Egyptian Consultants for Environment and Development (ECED). He is also member of many academies, institutes, committees and other organizations.</p>
