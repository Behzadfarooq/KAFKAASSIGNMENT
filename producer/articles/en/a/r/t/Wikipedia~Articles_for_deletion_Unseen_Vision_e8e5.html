<p>Only asserion of notability is the drummer once played in a band who is signed to an indie label that has an article.

<li>Sorry, I had to read that four or five times before I got that. Nobody in the band is notable enough to have an article. Nobody's <i>former</i> band is notable enough to have an article. And to top it off, the band hasn't even released a CD yet. Even I have more notability than that. <b>Delete</b> per nom. (Also, a quick note to <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalemir_04f5.html" title="User:Talemir">User:Talemir</a> that AfD isn't done by "voting" per person, but by consensus of the established Wikipedia community.

<li><b>Delete</b> We do not cover bands "for when they do make it". Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, and can't predict who will and who won't. Become notable first, then get the article. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 21:45, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article is about a band who's name is already copywritten, and the article is based on FACT and is not a biast opinion. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalemir_04f5.html" title="User:Talemir">Vincent</a> 22:19, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: first of all, names don't get copyrighted, they get trademarked. Second of all, I've trademarked the name VaniDeleteâ„¢ -- does my product get a Wikipedia article? (And in case you don't get it, the answer is no, because it's not notable.) <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> the patent and trademark office; if we were, we would've reached that millionth article a hell of a lot faster. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 00:07, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It is considered bad form to delete earlier comments, even your own, from an AfD discussion. I have restored them. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:27, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am still new to this site and trying to figure out how it all works. You don't have to be so rude. I am also changing my user name, so if you could delete my other or let me know how to then I will do so. <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalemir_04f5.html" title="User:Talemir">User:Talemir</a>. I did not know it was bad form to delete other posts, but as you can see it says it is basically a vote for yes with a descriptive reason why. If the band page <b>really</b> is not notable enough then it will be deleted, votes or not; do they really matter?</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: True, but I thought maybe enough votes for yes would ensure it could stay. I understand how this community works a little better now and I appologize for imposing so much, and pushing the article. But in plain black and white, if it doesn't meet require criteria; then it must go. This is <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalemir_04f5.html" title="User:Talemir">User:Talemir</a> btw, I changed my user name as you can plainly see. You may delete it whenever you see fit, I have saved the info IF they make it. Although it is my personal view from working with them that they will, but only time will tell.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Even if you met requirements mentioned thus far, please note that it is still a biased article. No matter how much you know that it is all true, you have yet to prove it. The article has no citations and references to any information outside of wikipedia that isn't a myspace website, and the main reason for that is because outside of your claim that the band was mentioned on a radio station, band has not been mentioned or talked about on any reliable source. No, even if you saved ticket stubs from Unseen Vision shows, they are not good enough. It is probably best to just let it go, and create a website for the band using Geocities or something. Please also note that the supernatural is not proven "to the full extent," as you say, but it does meet Wikipedia's standards. By the way, the Wikipedia standards are available for anyone to read. If you could just read the standards, there would be no debate as to what "the full extent" is, because what is important is the extent that wikipedia has asked for, the extent which has not been met... As it stands it is quite clearly suitable for deletion for an orgy of reasons. -- SB 06:02, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Thanks <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">User:Rockpocket</a> I didn't even think of that lol. Btw Sean, I understand and I already said delete it. But the band however does have it's own website. / .com to proove it is all true, you can go see for yourself. www.unseenvision.com, but this still doesn not classify the article or the band to be notable. I understand the rules a lot better today then I did months ago, I will tell you that much! haha</li>
