<p><s>Redundant with categories. If something like this is to exist at all, it should be like <a href="../../../c/r/i/Category%7ECriminals_by_nationality_1bcd.html" title="Category:Criminals by nationality">Category:Criminals by nationality</a>.</s> There is nothing principally wrong with organizing criminals by their religion, despite the obvious potential for abusive and frivolous entries, but the added value seems too questionable to warrant it. On the positive side of the relevance scale, you could consider a list of criminals subject to parental abuse. On the negative side, consider list of Catholic investment bankers. This list does not mention how their religion was <i>relevant</i> to the crimes committed by the people on it, because it usually simply wasn't. Weighing costs and benefits, I'd say delete it. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 09:07, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> There may be a gray area between clearly appropriate list articles and clearly inappropriate ones, but I don't think this inhabits that space. The topic lends itself too easily to ugly wars between editors, and it isn't useful enough to make up for that. Add to that the difficulty in deciding who counts as Catholic and what counts as a crime (<a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Mandela_1695.html" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>, for example, counts as a criminal according to one standard definition, but I'm sure all of us would be appalled to see him listed next to serial killers, rapists, and embezzlers). <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 09:18, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> because the topic is inappropriate, not because of a conflict with categories. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 09:19, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>&#160;: Criminals categorized based on nationality is reasonable because the criminals often operate in certain geographical areas so geographical categorization is okay by me. However, categorization based on nuances of faith is like "Criminals with a tattoo on the left arm". This seems arbitrary as catholic criminals affect everyone, not just catholics. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManikraina_d995.html" title="User:Manikraina">Manik Raina</a> 09:25, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I realize now the category remark is way off. Actually this would be exactly what you'd use a list for, since lists have ways of annotating entries and categories don't. However, my original reasoning stands: without (sufficient) redeeming value. I don't agree with Zoe that the topic is inappropriate, though; it's too easy to condemn articles based on that. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 09:26, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Bebe Rebozo wasn't even a criminal. POV list to attack the Catholic church. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 09:26, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - at least borderline POV. Listing a criminal under religious definition is irrelevant unless he states religion as his main motivation (and even then, they may use it as an excuse). At the very least, they did not follow the commandments of the religion. There were also several gangsters who were supposedly practicing Jews, but I would not regard list of Jewish criminals as a good idea - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 10:32, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - or will we have a list of Jewish/Islamic/Methodist/Agnostic/Atheist ect - if we had a list of people prominent <i>because</i> of their faith who were convicted of crimes - I could see the point, but in most cases here faith is incidental to the criminality - we might as well have a List of big-nosed criminals --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 12:38, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Any single <i>List of [insert your favorite religion/sexual orientation/political party here]</i> is relatively harmless. However, the information, unless the listing criterion is tied to the individuals listed in some substantive way, just doesn't belong in any encyclopedia. Information about any individual's religion, politics, etc. isn't encyclopedic, unless that information is part of what makes that person notable, a la <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Falwell_c0ca.html" title="Jerry Falwell">Jerry Falwell</a> and the like. It just doesn't matter that, for example, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cordwainer_Smith_4a28.html" title="Cordwainer Smith">Cordwainer Smith</a> was a non-observant <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a>, because it doesn't say anything about the man. And the same is true of almost everyone on every <i>List of X</i> here, where <i>X</i> is any label by which people have conventionally divided into "us" and "them". <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenwarren_49e7.html" title="User:Kenwarren">Ken</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKenwarren_3f39.html" title="User talk:Kenwarren">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kenwarren_de12.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kenwarren">contribs</a></sup> 13:04, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A little history: I nominated the comprehensive list of Catholics for being overly broad: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_Roman_Catholics_c703.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Roman Catholics">Votes for deletion/List of Roman Catholics</a>. The article was kept, but many wanted to break it up into smaller articles. This article was a section of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Roman_Catholics_4309.html" title="List of Roman Catholics">List of Roman Catholics</a>, and was recently split off into a separate article, as were many other sections. If it gets deleted it will just be returned as a section of the original article. We might as well keep the smaller lists, but in the greater scheme of things, it doesn't matter, the information will end up somewhere. It feels like we are going back and forth on this issue. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><b><font color="green">NoSeptember</font></b></a> 14:53, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not a good reason to keep this list. Delete it, and delete mention of it from the larger list. Personally, I'd have deleted the whole list of RC's - but there's no consensus there. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 15:13, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well I nominated the whole RC list (categories would do I thought), but if the community says keep it, we shouldn't pick and choose which sections to keep or throw away. None of the new smaller articles list people who are notable in their field because they are Catholics, they just list people in job X who happen to be Catholics. There is nothing inherently wrong with a list of criminals of a certain faith, as long as it is made clear that they are notable for their criminality, and not because of their faith. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><b><font color="green">NoSeptember</font></b></a> 15:46, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If the list is of people whose criminality and religion have nothing to do with each other, and who weren't notable for their religion, what purpose does it serve? That would make it no more informative than "criminals who worked in hardware stores" or "left-handed criminals" or "criminals between 6 and 7 feet tall". <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 03:39, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is part of the broader discussion on what lists should and shouldn't be doing, and you're quite right that there's no consensus on that. For the record, I would agree with deleting this information from the main article too, as my original arguments apply regardless of where this list is. This is a matter of opinion, yes, as it boils down to "relevance" again, that old bugaboo we can't ever seem to get consensus about, especially when it comes to lists. If Wikipedia contains all "information" there is to contain, it will be less useful simply by virtue of being indiscriminate. If on the other hand it's picky people will complain what it's picky about, as any piece of information will be useful to <i>someone</i>. See also <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_Jews_e94e.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Jews">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Jews</a>.<br />
A lot of support for deletion of this article is of course more a result of the "OMG POV/vandal magnet" angle than the relevance angle, and there is something to say for that, too. "A criminal who also happened to be a Roman Catholic" is not the first image that springs to mind for "list of Catholic criminals"; rather you'd think "list of criminals notable for being Catholic", a dubious concept to say the least. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 15:23, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This list is probably more intriguing than writers', politicians' etc. lists. Anyway- this "lists stuff" has been debated ad nauseam.

<li><b>Delete</b>. If you look at the page's edit history, you'll see I was about to put this up for deletion, but I changed my mind when I couldn't figure out how to make my case for deleting it. Bottom line is, I think Wikipedia would be better off without this page. Too little benefit and too much room for abuse. Only reason I can imagine people using this list is for flaming and abuse. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCoffee_bcb6.html" title="User:TheCoffee">Coffee</a> 19:05, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This list isn't offensive at all (anyway- the people who made it are , I'd say, Catholics themselves). It just enumerates various sorts of people that were or are nominally Catholic. For instance, along with painters, writers, criminals, politicians,..other lists will have appeared (natural scientists will be broken into mathematicians, physicists, chemists,..., adventurers will be expanded to include explorers like Columbus, royalty list (list including links to royal houses of Europe etc.).
