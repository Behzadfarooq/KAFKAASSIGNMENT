<p>I know I'm going to be unpopular with the trekies. Now, I conceed that Star wars is very notable (OK), and a page on the history of Starwars might be notable (OK?), and a page on a starwars fan-website might (just) be motale, and a message board from that website might be worth a passing mention in that article (possibly?), but a dedicated page with a detailed history of a message board of a website of a movie - is cruft. It is of possible interest ONLY to those involved, thus not encyclopaedic. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 07:59, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I admit I am a bit biased, having been involved to some extent in the writing of this history, but I notice wikipedia has a section for internet message boards. The JC is both the world's premiere Star Wars board <i>and</i> one of the world's largest bulletin boards, period. (See big-boards.com if you want proof. I believe we're still in the top 10.) If any message board deserves to be in wikipedia, we deserve it. I also notice some of our fellow big boards, including Gaia boards and IGN, have articles here. Dark Lady Mara</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I do not see why an article on this message board's history should be kept under any circumstances. It is simply unencyclopedic. Wikipedia is not a place to record the daily goings on of message boards-it takes an extraordinary interpretation of what an encyclopedia is to permit that. It fails Jimbo's verifiability test: if something was truly notable (and of such notability to be considered for inclusion in an encyclopedia) it would be the subject of independent study and/or reporting. Are there serious works on this message board (or <i>any</i> message board, really)? Has it been reported in the press for something significant? Are there sociologists or other scholars who study the board? Are there reputable secondary sources that one can use to write about the board? I mean, come on. This is an encyclopedia, and that's an internet message board. One's not going to be in the other. There is only one type of article that I can see having a rightful place in Wikipedia on the subject of message boards, and that is an article looking at message boards and how they are shaping or contributing to public discourse or forms of communication in developed economies. Not this.-<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#000">ζ</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Encephalon_dcee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Encephalon"><font color="#000">Σ</font></a> 11:32:43, 2005-08-11 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> Excerpts from aticle: "<i>July 8 - Obi Anne and Rox are promoted to GSA's in Fan Force.</i>" and "<i>April 17 - In a collaboration between the staff at TFN and the Fan Fiction authors and enthusiasts on the forums, the TFN Fan Fiction Archive Opens. While not the first mention of forceboat, Bib's "force boat parte!!!" was nonetheless the place where Forceboat came into its own.</i>" ...and there are hundreds of lines just like those and worse. Absolutely no reason to believe that anybody outside the forum itself would care about any of it. Wikipedia is not a free hosting service for forums to record their members' comings and goings.

<li><b>Keep</b> Quietmind I ask that those who are wanting the page to be deleted be aware that the current "article" on the page was not the right way to go for it. In addition to it being a problem in itself (it was lifted from another JC member's site, possibly without permission), as it was never meant to be used like this, it also lends itself to the sort of joke entries that have already been made. Unfortunately, the problems you see and are using as reasons for deletion stem partly from the very popularity that makes the JC as big of a board as it is. If I had my way, I would prefer to approach the JC and its history from a completely sociological and scientific lens. I'm interested in the sociology and psychology of internet message boards, and the JC has been truly remarkable in both areas. Instead of what has been used so far, I ask that you simply delete the "timeline" part of the article (which is what's so long, and causing other problems) and allow others to build the page back up in ways that will be of interest to anyone who wanders by, not just JC members or Star Wars fans. Unfortunately, a few people have taken a completely wrong (if well meaning) approach, and the result is an understandable desire to delete the page. As could be expected, a number of people have (or wanted to) added their relatively pointless entries ("Flarestorm trolls wikipedia", etc.). I ask that you not let this deter people who are actually interested in writing something that's up to wikipedia standards. The JC is a message board with a rich history, one that can be used to speak to both web life and real life. That is why I argue for it to be kept, and why I request that those who want it to be deleted reconsider their positions. Were you in our shoes, I think you would feel likewise. If you were able to see what a few of our members could do, I think you would agree that it would be a fine addition to Wikipedia.
<ul>
<li>You don't have to ask us to delete the timeline. This is a wiki, and you are a Wikipedia editor. <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">Be bold</a>! If you can improve the article to address the concerns of the editors who are in favour of its deletion, then you are encouraged to <i>please do so right away</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:30:59, 2005-08-11 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't see how anyone outside of the forum itself (or even inside for that matter) can care on what date Larry Fett or Darth Friedman was promoted to moderator. This belongs on their website, not this one. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:15, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not true. That's part of what I tried to say above. The problem lies not in the page itself, but in the approach taken in it. The timeline should be cut entirely. Just remove that and let a few capable people write something that other people *would* care about. You are basing your judgment on something that should not be there in the first place. Please observe the <a href="../../../d/e/v/DeviantArt_94f5.html" title="DeviantArt">DeviantArt</a> wikipedia page. That has been allowed to remain, and rightly so.
<ul>
<li>In writing about things that "other people <i>would</i> care about", I strongly recommend <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">citing sources</a>, such as (for example) news media coverage. Cited sources will lead you to things that people <i>have</i> cared about. Please be aware of our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a> policy and the fact that an encyclopaedia is a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:30:59, 2005-08-11 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, I ask how many of the other websites or forums that have wikipedia entries have been the subject of extensive media coverage? How many have merited independent academic study outside of wikipedia or other methods of online chronicalling? I can't recall seeing many books on IGN or DeviantArt at my library. Let's at least be consistent here. Dark Lady Mara</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, just another fan forum and thus not a notable webpage. All the timeline removal in the universe will not alter that fact. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 17:45, August 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you think it's "just another fan forum" and therefore not significant, I recommend you delete your entire section about internet forums for consistency's sake. Why are those other boards more "notable" than this one? Also, I do know as a fact that the JC has spawned ideas which influenced fandom and pop culture. Do you remember the cover of Mad magazine once featuring a fake Sith lord with an upside-down yellow lightsaber? That was a joke first invented on the JC which later spread around the fandom! Dark Lady Mara
<ul>
<li>1) Being ripped off by MAD Magazine (and no, I don't remember the cover in question because I haven't read MAD Magazine since it started sucking, which was a while ago indeed) does not notability make. 2) I wouldn't terribly mind seeing some of the other forums we have here go either, but I don't care enough to go out and hunt them down and especially not to just satisfy a bunch of fanboys that their little slice of the Internet is somehow special. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 06:52, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>
