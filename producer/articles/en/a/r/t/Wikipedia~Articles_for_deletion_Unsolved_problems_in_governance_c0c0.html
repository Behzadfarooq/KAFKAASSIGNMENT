<li>Keep. The degree of development of a subject can be assessed by the list of items which the practitioners admit are unsolved. Thus physics and mathematics have a large and growing list of unsolved problems. Assuming that <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governance.html" title="Governance">governance</a> is a proper concept or subject of study, like <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Control_theory.html" title="Control theory">control theory</a>, then it should be possible to state a list of the objects of study for the subject. If some item of the list currently cannot be solved, as in physics, then a description of that item can be added to this article. It's like the description of an addiction; the first step toward recovery is to admit you have a problem. Even the concepts of physics were once controversial. People have been burned at the stake for stating a principle of physics. So too for this subject. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncheta_Wis_6134.html" title="User:Ancheta Wis">Ancheta Wis</a> 01:08, 23 September 2005 (UTC) This is not to say that the items in the list might not be POV. But that is an agenda for discussion of each item. Note that there has been theoretical progress in this subject. See <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nash_equilibrium.html" title="Nash equilibrium">Nash equilibrium</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/e/Iterated_prisoner%27s_dilemma.html" title="Iterated prisoner's dilemma">Iterated prisoner's dilemma</a> for <i>solved problems</i> in this subject.</li>

<dd><b>Comment, not a vote</b>. I'm not sure if these two solved problems are properly considered part of governance. I think the real concern is that "problems" are not adequately specifiable in this domain that would allow someone to decide if a problem is solved or not. In physics there is experimental data that is either accounted for by the theory or not (yes, yes, I know there are fuzzy boundaries to this problem). In this sense its clear when a problem is solved. But, what exactly is the problem of "war"? And what sorts of things would lead the relevant scientific community to consider the problem solved? If there aren't undisputed answers to these questions, there is some serious worry about POV. I think this is a serious concern here since we don't have a large number of scientists as contributors and so we could easily be the place for one or two scientists to POV push. --best, kevin <font color="#BBBBBB">·</font><font color="#666666">·</font>·<small><a href="../../../k/z/o/User%7EKzollman_a660.html" title="User:Kzollman">Kzollman</a> | <a href="../../../k/z/o/User_talk%7EKzollman_107b.html" title="User talk:Kzollman">Talk</a></small>·<font color="#666666">·</font><font color="#BBBBBB">·</font> 02:00, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Your "solved problems" in governance are really solved problems in <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a>, no? <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a><sup><a href="../../../n/e/u/User_talk%7ENeutrality_6997.html" title="User talk:Neutrality">talk</a></sup> 02:47, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>More than anything, they are solved problems in mathematics. Whether the Nash equilibrium and prisoner's dilemma are in fact related to human behavior is itself an unanswered question. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 05:11, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Quotation from <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nash_equilibrium.html" title="Nash equilibrium">Nash equilibrium</a> (NE) article: <i>However, as a theoretical concept in economics, and evolutionary biology the NE has great explanatory power:</i> <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncheta_Wis_6134.html" title="User:Ancheta Wis">Ancheta Wis</a> 06:42, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that it's sometimes a useful model for human behovior doesn't answer the fundamental questions of when, where, and to whom it is most applicable. And certainly, for the behaviors modeled under this sort of game theory there are other competing explanations. The point I was trying to make is that the only sense in which Nash equilibria are a "solved problem" is that we have worked out the mathematics. The application of this branch of game theory to political science questions remains at issue. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 07:38, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thus <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nash_equilibrium.html" title="Nash equilibrium">Nash equilibrium</a> is a <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_%28abstract%29.html" title="Model (abstract)">model (abstract)</a>, an idealization which can make scientific reasoning about the subject easier.

<dd>I agree that the state of development of this subject looks terrible. You have to start somewhere in a wiki. Even the concepts of mathematics were primitive and undeveloped at one time. But the statement of <i>rules of the game</i> is an important part of the subject. The word <i>governance</i> and the root word for <i>cybernetics</i> are part of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Control_theory.html" title="Control theory">control theory</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncheta_Wis_6134.html" title="User:Ancheta Wis">Ancheta Wis</a> 06:42, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Anyone who is from a country that has been ravaged by war would see that its occurrence is a problem. You can be on the side of the victor in a war and still lose big-time. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncheta_Wis_6134.html" title="User:Ancheta Wis">Ancheta Wis</a> 06:42, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Obviously, there is a competing POV that war can be good, consider <a href="../../../j/u/s/Just_war_theory.html" title="Just war theory">Just war theory</a>, but in any case the main point is that this appears to be original research. I'm happy to change my vote if this turns out not to be the case. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 07:38, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../r/a/n/RAND_0a12.html" title="RAND">RAND</a> Corporation, one of the original research corporations in the US, was an employer of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Nash_dbb6.html" title="John Nash">John Nash</a>, the Nobel Economics laureate. They currently perform studies in governance and social policy, as well as their original charter as consultants to the US military. They were originally a <a href="../../../u/s/a/USAF_6999.html" title="USAF">USAF</a> thinktank which was spun off from the aerospace industry in Southern California after World War II. It is quite rational for a military organization to study war and its mitigation, thus RAND can propose solutions for the problems. The <i>unsolved problems</i> list is the obverse. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncheta_Wis_6134.html" title="User:Ancheta Wis">Ancheta Wis</a> 08:09, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> there's certainly an article in there somewhere and there quite an edit history to this so maybe it will emerge.

<li><b>Keep</b> but possibly rename <i>List of unsolved problems for Governance</i> or <i>List of unsolved problems in Civics</i>. I have added it to the Civics category where it clearly belongs. As stated above any area of thought benefits from its unsolved problems being clearly stated rather than avoided. The article should remain a list and not become a Forum for discussion of its members ( except perhaps on its discussion page). Where is the research?

<li><b>Delete</b> The term <i>problem</i> in the context of <i>social</i> or <i>politics</i> or <i>governance</i> implies unresolvable POV conflicts, as the article itself admits. Thus, the title itself is unresolvable POV, even if renamed. This is different to the definition of <i>problem</i> as used, for example, in mathematics, and the two should not be compared.
