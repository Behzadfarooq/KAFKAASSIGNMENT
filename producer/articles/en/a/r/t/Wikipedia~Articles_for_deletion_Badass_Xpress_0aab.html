<li><b>Keep</b> WAW is very popular, gets regular press coverage, they have fans across the United States and even in other countries due to a popular weekly downloadable internet show. I'm not offended, because the people demanding its deletion are completely ignorant to the product. The Wikipedia article does nothing to promote, as it doesn't advertise the website, doesn't make mention of their free, weekly downloads (only that it has a popular multimedia website for information purposes), and it doesn't advertise the one local aspect of it which would be saying where, when, and how people can attend live shows. It just says where they are, not when or how to get tickets. wawwrestling.com does a well enough job of all those things. All the article does is the one thing wawwrestling.com doesn't do, and that's explain the history of the promotion, which people obviouslly want to know because that's the full extent of the media coverage. To the people that don't think it's notable, it's existed since 1998 and has been quite successful, especially in recent years, and it's one of many independant wrestling companies that are the primary competition for WWE and TNA, and the starting point of future wrestlers. To the one who said "vanity," back up your claim and explain how this article is "vanity." There's an official website and a myspace site for "vanity." This article is purely informative, the information has been demanded, and now it's been delivered. JAPW and ROH aren't the only notable wrestling promotions on the east coast, WAW, CPW, WFA, and CW are all "notable." --User:Samx3i 05:29, 14 March, 2006

<li>Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize that, for my points to be valid, I had to edit more things. Fair enough. I'll go write an informative article about bias towards certain types of entertainment and then maybe you can actually take the time to read what I wrote above and consider it. You know what though? I don't want to be a part of any club that wouldn't have me as a member (Groucho Marx). You people have nothing better to do than to submit for deletion informative articles because they're not relevant to YOU but are otherwise in demand and are notable whether or not you like it. You make claims of "vanity" you can't back up and then dismiss my entire arguement because I'm new to this website and haven't done anything but edit the page in question and this one (yeah, this one, like I wasn't supposed to defend my own article). Maybe I haven't done more because I got laid off last Monday and looking for a job was more of a concern of mine that writing an article on Count Chockula Cereal. Honest, get over yourselfs, stop taking this so seriously, it's a website that collects informative articles written by its members. That's all I was doing. Why don't you spend your time writing something people want to read about instead of crying about waw. Or like I said, just delete it, I don't care anymore. This is all really pathetic. --User:Samx3i 05:29, 14 March, 2006</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>From Wikipedia's description of Encyclopidia "An encyclopedia or encyclopaedia, also encyclopædia, is a written compendium of knowledge." Now nowhere does it say copelation or relevent facts or mass content of important information. All subjects listed are fact based infomative articles, WAW CPW and BX are all existing entities. I also submit to you that if a local wrestling federation is to be deleted then why not delete all the Radio station? I crated the CPW page because i noticed other small wrestling federations on Wiki and decided that CPW was just as notable to relevent information as any other. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESundergod9_3847.html" title="User:Sundergod9">Sundergod9</a> 04:25, 17 March 2006 (UTC)
