<li><b>Delete</b> all three. These people are not notable simply by being eligible to be on the list, and I know a number of people who qualify for each list but are not on it. An incomplete list is not useful. Categories do a better job of "list of xxx people with Wikipedia articles" which is essentially what two of these are. The third is a copy of someone else's list of "notable Presbyterians", but that website neither provides references for the claims that those people are/were Presbyterian, nor for those people being more notable than all other Australian Presbyterians (and it's a personal view, not the UCA's official opinion). I would <i>keep</i> lists of people who are notable <i>because</i> they are/were Anglican/Catholic/Presbyterian (such as list of Australian Catholic archbishops, List of moderators of the Presbyterian Church of Australia). --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 11:50, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The problem with changing this sort of thing to categories is that you can put anyone in the category, and there's no way of verifying if anyone is an Anglican on the category page. I've started to attribute sources to all of the Anglican people, and it at least provides evidence that the persons in question have been or are involved in that particular church or denomination. I agree that the lists are very incomplete, but the way to stop that is to fix them up, not to delete them. <a href="../../../j/r/g/User%7EJRG_cdbe.html" title="User:JRG">JRG</a> 00:49, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Update comment</b> - for the List of Australian Anglicans, the persons' Anglicanism has been attributed in all cases to a source indicating their involvement with the Anglican church or their well-espoused Anglican belief; except for one instance, who was actually a Congregationalist and has been deleted from the list. I'm happy to add more people to this list, as I'm sure there are many more to be put in here. <a href="../../../j/r/g/User%7EJRG_cdbe.html" title="User:JRG">JRG</a> 01:19, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You have referenced the people in the list that they belong there (well done), and expanded the lead. There are still only 24 of them, so the list is clearly incomplete. The longer lead is still just as open - the correct reference for the list under that introduction would be the payroll for the Anglican Church, plus its membership lists. For example, <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Beazley_97c0.html" title="Kim Beazley">Kim Beazley</a> is not notable/famous/defined by the fact that he is a member of the Anglican church. He's famous because he was a politician. Ask five random Australians what <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Beazley_97c0.html" title="Kim Beazley">Kim Beazley</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Rudd_578c.html" title="Kevin Rudd">Kevin Rudd</a> have in common, and you're unlikely to find "they're all Anglicans" is the answer. They're all former leaders of the Opposition, and their politics are not defined by their denomination. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 02:03, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If we are to have a distinct categorisation, what do you suggest I change the lead (and/or the title) to? Rudd, for example, is someone who has distinctly called himself an Anglican (Howard and Beazley much less so) and would fit better in some sort of list. I don't want this list deleted, but I'm keen to work for something that is manageable and can be filled out, whereas I agree somewhat that it's a bit indiscriminate at present. <a href="../../../j/r/g/User%7EJRG_cdbe.html" title="User:JRG">JRG</a> 02:52, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You must also add each one of those references into the person's article to source the statement that they are Anglican within the article, and to justify the category that is also probably there (if it isn't referenced already). That's <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> for you! For example <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Stevens_afe6.html" title="Douglas Stevens">Douglas Stevens</a> currently doesn't have a single source in his article to reference what he is and the entire article content should be blanked if the rules are followed to the letter. --<a href="../../../s/l/f/User%7ESlf67_d959.html" title="User:Slf67">Steve <sub>(Slf67)</sub></a> <a href="../../../s/l/f/User_talk%7ESlf67_bed3.html" title="User talk:Slf67"><sup>talk</sup></a> 04:01, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd suggest <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_Anglicans_1e84.html" title="Category:Australian Anglicans">Category:Australian Anglicans</a> for members of the church with Wikipedia articles that reference their membership, and List of Anglican bishops in Australia (lower case 'b' - does it need "and archbishops" to be accurate, or are archbishops just a kind of bishop?) renamed and grown from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Anglican_Bishops_and_Archbishops_of_Sydney_6152.html" title="List of Anglican Bishops and Archbishops of Sydney">List of Anglican Bishops and Archbishops of Sydney</a> (incorrect upper case 'B' and 'A') or perhaps a list of lists if there are lots. Is there another group that need to be covered (staff but not bishops are just like members if they are not notable <i>because</i> they are Anglican). --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 07:16, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I still maintain that a list is different to a category; this list can be filled out and it will not be arbitrary to keep people (like Kevin Rudd) who have publicly espoused their association with the Anglican church. I think anyone who works for the Anglican church and is notable enough to have a WP article is not an arbitrary inclusion - Gordon Cheng and Tony Payne, for example, are notable Christian authors in the list that have worked in the Anglican Church (in stipendiary and lay capacity respectively) in the past (and still attend and are involved in Anglican Churches). While there are some arbitrary lists of Australians that should go, this one is one we can fix up. What's wrong with that? <a href="../../../j/r/g/User%7EJRG_cdbe.html" title="User:JRG">JRG</a> 12:09, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you check my recent edit history, I have voted to keep several of these, and kept one or two more from even being nominated. I agree that a list is different from a category, and the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Justices_of_the_High_Court_of_Australia_461b.html" title="List of Justices of the High Court of Australia">List of Justices of the High Court of Australia</a> you recently added to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Australians_a5aa.html" title="Lists of Australians">Lists of Australians</a> is appropriate. In my opinion, this one is not suitable as it is an incomplete list of people notable for something else who happen to also be Anglican. The person's articles should reference the Anglican connection, and put them in the category. It appears a number of people agree with me, and a number agree with you. Some poor admin has to make a decision based on this discussion.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per ScottDavis and others. While a list of people who have worked in the church would be worth having and keeping, this is not that, risks being unbounded over time and becoming an indiscriminate list where the only thing those on it have in common is their faith. As some have raised too, in some cases there may be verification issues. How is one an Anglican or a Presbyterian for example? I was baptised a Methodist, was associated with a word-faith church for many years then left it - would I be a Methodist, an evangelical, or none of the above? That's the sort of issues these things raise. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 00:42, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or rename</b> it fails the requirements for a list article to exist that are outlined in <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> in my opinion, because it would be unbounded. If it were changed to List of notable Australian Anglicans I would change my vote. Lists of notable persons can be bounded. As to the above discussions, I don't think that people on the list should need to be notable for their Anglican involvement, they can be notable for any reason. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 04:04, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not sure about a "dangerous precedent" - there are still plenty of worse examples.

<dd>I suggested List of Anglican bishops in Australia above. I don't think that ordinary clergy are inherently notable, and a category is easier to maintain for clergy and lay people famous for something else who are also Anglican. That title covers both the current <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_of_Australia_9135.html" title="Anglican Church of Australia">Anglican Church of Australia</a> and Anglican bishops from before that separate organisation was formed. There is already a <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_Anglicans_1e84.html" title="Category:Australian Anglicans">Category:Australian Anglicans</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Category%7EAnglican_bishops_by_diocese_in_Australia_5ae0.html" title="Category:Anglican bishops by diocese in Australia">Category:Anglican bishops by diocese in Australia</a> which only has 4 subcategories and one list instead of 25. The dioceses are listed in the rather short article <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_of_Australia_9135.html" title="Anglican Church of Australia">Anglican Church of Australia</a>. A few of those already have lists of their previous and current bishops. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 00:00, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm all for a list of bishops; however, we do have some notable clergy who are not bishops and some lay people whose claim to fame is mostly to do with their work in the Anglican Church, and I'm not sure what we do with these people - maybe I'll stick them on the end of the particular diocese page. <a href="../../../j/r/g/User%7EJRG_cdbe.html" title="User:JRG">JRG</a> 06:29, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The diocese is a possibility if they are associated with one in some significant way. The process I have used for biographies is 1) to make sure they are categorised properly and 2) look at the article and see which articles it links to should logically have a link back. Sometimes the logical link is from a subpage. It's usually obvious what made the person famous, and that is where the links to the article usually come from. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 07:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
