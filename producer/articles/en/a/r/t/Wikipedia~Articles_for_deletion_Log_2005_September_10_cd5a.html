Or are you suggesting that this slip in under the "reference tables and tabular information for quick reference" exception in 1.7.2, about Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics? I disagree with the application of that exception as well, as I feel there's a degree of utility required to qualify as a reference table (for instance, an SI/Imperial conversion table) that this doesn't have. And as this is a loose association of Wiltshire locations, I'd say it qualifies as a 1.7.2 violation. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 05:34, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm the one who wanted it speedy deleted. Seems like a waste of time to AfD it, but very well. Hopefully this is one of the things to be addressed in the deletion reform discussion I heard about, but for now the existing policy prevails. I repeat: Wikipedia is not a <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game.html" title="Video game">video game</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategy_guide.html" title="Strategy guide">strategy guide</a>. I realize that's not part of the official <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> policy, but I'm not the first person to say it, and I doubt I'll be the last. In fact, I think I'll go and suggest the addition of that right now. Non-strategic information on these bosses already exists in the article on <a href="../../../l/i/n/The_Legend_of_Zelda%7E_Link%27s_Awakening_971a.html" title="The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a>, so there's no need to merge it. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidSmaht_d49d.html" title="User:WikidSmaht">WikidSmaht</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidSmaht_41da.html" title="User talk:WikidSmaht">talk</a>) 04:50, September 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Last time I checked, Wikipedia gives out information about different areas of things. It seems to me that Link's Awakening bosses is a thing, and I have given information about it.

<li>Wikipedia is meant to be informative, yes. But <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. Tutorials, guides, and other forms of instruction should be collected into <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Main_Page">Wikibooks</a>. Most of the information in the article is about how to fight and defeat the bosses, written in the imperative tense. The rest can be, and essentially is, covered in the <i>Link's Awakening</i> article, in a section you inspired me to create with an older article of yours. Look at the edit history to see my example of what the article would be like without the strategy part. Also, some of the few other things in the article as it is are incorrect. For example, none of the dungeons in this game are referred to as temples. And all the bosses are Nightmares, according to the story. I do admire the images you collected or created for the article, though. If you hang on to those, I might have a use for them later. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidSmaht_d49d.html" title="User:WikidSmaht">WikidSmaht</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidSmaht_41da.html" title="User talk:WikidSmaht">talk</a>) 07:48, September 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Check imdb and the official web site. It's won one or two awards, and appeared in different festivals, in various countries. It's a theatrical release, not a direct-to-video deal (although it's now out on video). By Hollywood standards, its low-budget, but I'm not sure it is actually low-budget by Hungarian standards (I honestly don't know though, as I'm not Hungarian). Anyways, at a minimum, I want to give this article some time, to improve. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 05:36, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This battle has been fought before, over singles generally and Ashlee singles specifically. <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_La_%28song%29_b275.html" title="La La (song)">La La (song)</a> had a pretty vehement debate but ended up being kept by a fair margin. I don't see why the battle needs to be fought all over again every time a new single comes out. The issue ought to be settled by now. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:05, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So even if this song were to tank and not sell five copies, by the very fact that it's by Ashlee Simpson, it deserves an article? I'm not saying that that is what's happening, I'm just trying to determine where we draw the line. Or is there a line? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 22:48, September 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The question is academic, but I think the answer is yes: if a song by such a notable artist failed so badly, that would be notable just for so completely confounding expectations. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:13, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, so now I'm clear. We have to keep an article on every song ever recorded by every artist who meets the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> requirements. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 04:29, September 12, 2005 (UTC)

<li>"There is no reason why there shouldn't be a page for every Simpsons character, and even a table listing every episode, all neatly cross-linked and introduced by a shorter central page. Every episode name in the list could link to a separate page for each of those episodes, with links to reviews and trivia.

<li><b>Keep</b> not every song by a notable musician needs its own article, rather some should be redirected to the album in question (or maybe a list of songs by XXX in some cases, especially prior to the album era). But if this one were folded into the album article, it would overbalance it. So, keep. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 08:07, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is an unusual case.</p>
<p>This article (concerning a cast member of the television show <i>Big Brother</i>) was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Janelle_Pierzina_0db9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Janelle Pierzina">originally listed for deletion</a> on 1 September. On 8 September, I closed out a number of AfDs, including the one in question. I interpreted the discussion as a rough consensus to redirect the article to the main <i>Big Brother</i> television series article. Two users <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html#Janelle_Pierzina_vote" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo">took issue with my interpretation of the AfD</a>, so in the interests of total transparency I made a detailed enumeration of my logic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJanelle_Pierzina&amp;diff=22878563&amp;oldid=22876281" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJanelle_Pierzina&amp;diff=22878563&amp;oldid=22876281" rel="nofollow">on the article's talk page</a>. A number of users continued to express concern over my handling of the matter, and have <a href="../../../j/a/n/Talk%7EJanelle_Pierzina_c3e4.html" title="Talk:Janelle Pierzina">called the fairness of my actions into question</a>.</p>
<p>I do not believe that I did anything wrong in the closing of this AfD; I stand by my decision. My action, however, has created sufficient consternation that I feel it is necessary to re-list the article here at AfD and allow an opportunity for a clearer consensus to be reached. I will not be closing this AfD, and my nomination here does not constitute any sort of vote. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 10:35, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

But I've given this a lot of thought myself in the past, and after much reflection I've decided that it's not my business as an AfD closer to go around telling editors that they can't ever make or break a redirect because the outcome of an AfD debate some time in the past supported that redirect. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 15:16, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: To those supporting a merge, any and all BB merger discussion should be in one central spot: <a href="../../../b/i/g/Talk%7EBig_Brother_%28USA_TV_series%29_0621.html#Merge" title="Talk:Big Brother (USA TV series)">Talk:Big Brother (USA TV series)#Merge</a>. So far, any suggestion of merger has been rejected by editors of the main article, partly because the article is already to big. Hence, a vote here for a merge, won't result in a merge, but rather (what amounts to) a page blanking. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 15:42, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment- seeing as my last vote was discounted for not crossing the edit threshold (which I understand, although it's a little irritating), I just want to add that my vote would still be <b>Keep</b>- Janelle has been one of the summer's breakout stars on a show that is consistently rated in the top 15 of the Nielsen ratings. I don't advocate a page for every contestant on the show, but for a person as popular as Janelle a page should be created (at least for the wiki-niche of reality nuts). --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatadyBag_273f.html" title="User:PatadyBag">PatadyBag</a> 18:46, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe this to be yet another minor band vanity page. Go ahead and prove that this band is notable and worth keeping. Google has several hits, but it looks like enough traffic for a small to moderate independant band. They have their own site (which isn't hard to do), they've done some gigs, and they have a CD put out by an independant label. If they get more notable later, I wouldn't mind seeing this article ressurected. <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrae_1e20.html" title="User:Syrae">Syrae Faileas</a> 20:51, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

These articles each consists of the title and label together with a track listing. because the recordings are out of copyright, there's a large number of similar compilations, with significant overlaps of repertoire and actual recordings, and little if anything interesting or encyclopædic to be said about any of them. They belong in a catalogue or possibly in a guide to available recordings, but not in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:19, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Agree with <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> about routinely recording albums by much lesser artists, but I think a dual standard may be appropriate here.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Most of the above votes seem to miss the point. Of course Caruso is notable, and deserves a long and detailed article (I prefer Gigli myself, but that's not the point. I have a couple of these albums myself, and would recommend them — but that's also not the point); the point is that none of these compilation albums is notable. Similarly, the tracks are mostly notable (and often duplicated across articles), but not in terms of these compilations.<br />
I must admit, I didn't expect any opposition to this AfD; the articles are almost speediable, containing virtually no information, and with little or no scope for expansion. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 17:03, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I considered prior to voting. What I thought was this: Wikipedia is a wiki, these articles aren't much now but the albums are still fairly popular and people in possession of them plus the time and patience to do so can augment them. Compilation albums contain particular recordings, sometimes the sleevenotes are not so good but it's possible to track down the particular recordings, and the sessions in which they were made, from external sources. If I view each of these articles as a template upon which can be hung such external information as exists for each track on the particular album, and link it to a master list of Caruso recording sessions, then we've potentially got something that only high price specialist publications could do a few years ago, and we, the public, are going to get it at zero labor cost, and for the cost to Wikipedia of a few kilobytes of disk storage and a minuscule amount of bandwidth. It's going to be 100% neutral and verifiable and there may well be nothing <i>quite</i> like it in the world up to now. In my opinion I would be crazy to reject that potential. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:04, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and possibly rewrite</b> The article was original research in 2001, but this research is my own research.

<li><b>Comment</b> A problem is the testability. It is the large number of traits displayed by autistics that cannot be explained with any other consistent theory that is the best evidences. Somebody claimed above that autism has many causes, but this is not a supported theory at all. This follows more from a lack of a theory that could explain more than one trait at a time than from any supporting evidence. I've added a section with the best of the supportive evidences. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 20:39, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Following up to myself, on closer inspection most of the references seem to be riffing off of the original "rdos" site, so this might just be particularly well-promoted original research. The reference in The Doctors' Lounge has me intrigued, though. I'm going to do a pubmed crawl. If I can't find anything at all, I'll probably change my vote to delete. If Pubmed refers to it, I'll stick with keep. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 01:30, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I can't find any pubmed references to this; I've come around to the point of view that it is original research. That being said, it's clearly a theory that has gained traction in some quarters. Is it worth preserving an article on the subject not of a scientifically supported theory, but of the fact that it has become notable as a theory? Thoughts? Consider that <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a> has an article, and has a similar lack of scholarly credentialing. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 02:33, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">Intelligent design</a> as 50 references. This has basically none. IMO, this present article, being OR is not useful to us and we should hope that someone will create a non-OR article in the future. We shouldn't leave OR lying around "just in case". -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 03:48, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Creationism also has several hits with PublMed, but like intelligent design, none of them gives any support for the ideas. Besides, there are many other things that are well-known in the autistic community that does not show up in PublMed. Try searching for autism+homosexuality or autism+culture. The first gives five hits, but none of them talks about a link between autusm and homosexuality. The second gives no support for autism as a culture.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is a very misleading set of links: some of them are on Neanderthals in general, with no mention of autism or of this "theory"; some of them are on autism and have only a single link to the "theory", most of which are at... rdos.net . Hmph. If this is a "reference list", I am more convinced than ever that this is nonsense promoted by one or two people. Other editors, please take a look at some of these before voting. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 17:24, 14 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Huh? None of these links are at rdos.net. The articles mentioned are written by various people in the autistic community, some which have come up with similar ideas on their own. The article with the psychology talk has not even visited rdos.net, but refers to the other site with a different perspective of this. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 18:32, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b>. The page itself needs to summarize the theory at the beginning and then break it down into more detail. I find this theory very interesting and do not think it should be deleted. However, the page should be brought up to a higher standard that will help it appear more credible. Perhaps one day scientists who can test the theory will take an interest in it and do just that. It will be a shame if the people who are most familiar with this theory don't take the time to improve this page and it does get deleted.</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> This is a bit of a no-brainer. The term 'securitized bond' doesn't exist - as someone already suggested in the discussion page. You can securitize assets by issuing bonds <a href="../../../a/s/s/Asset_backed_security.html" title="Asset backed security">asset backed securities</a>, as described in <a href="../../../s/e/c/Securitization.html" title="Securitization">securitization</a>. A 'securitized bond' would be a bond issued, backed by bonds. These are known as CDO's (Collateralized Debt Obligations). Other experts, please back me up on this. All the information in the entry is also in the 2 entries mentioned, so there's no loss deleting this. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocendoDiscimus_4b33.html" title="User:DocendoDiscimus">DocendoDiscimus</a> 14:45, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. LONDON bus routes are different. Buses, especially of the hop-on, hop-off, double decker Routemaster design, are recognised as a symbol of London worldwide.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I assume that Bus routes in London, as in other cities, are moved around, created or abolished on a fairly steady basis.

<li>Actually that would be a false assumption as far as London routes are concerned. For instance the Number 11 route has been in existence at least since 1949. Precise itinerary may be affected by changes in road priorities, and minor changes do occur, but these routes are remarkably constant over the decades. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 04:06, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's also a false assumption with many other cities. Boston for example has many bus routes that are almost exactly the same as the streetcar routes they replaced.

I remember doing "Lego-Logo" in 6th grade, we made Lego robots do stuff using just our Mac IIe computers. We were standing athwart the future with that stuff. My high school had tons of "notable" stuff going on-Intel competition, "National Recognition" from the Education Department...we were like the mack daddies of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_UN_293e.html" title="Model UN">Model UN</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Perfectly good stub. 267 school article deletion debates have completed this year, but only 37 articles have been deleted as a result of deletion debates.

<ul>
<li>If an article survives the VfD process it means no more that that there was no consensus to delete it. Implying notability is a long stretch, considering there is a vocal minority whose opinion is that "notability is no criterion for inclusion". Also see your own statement further up. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 13:13, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well let me take you through it again, slowly:
<ol>
<li>We don't delete stuff <i>unless</i> there is a consensus to delete.</li>
<li>If there were a consensus that schools are generally not notable, it would follow that there would be a regular consensus to delete school articles, with a few exceptions that were considered notable.</li>
<li>We look at the results--less than 15% of those listed for deletion have been deleted--and we see that this isn't the case.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>My conclusion follows. There is evidently no consensus, at least not over the past eight months, that schools are not generally notable.</li>
<li>I readily agree there is also no consensus that failure to satisfy various ad hoc ideas of notability is a criterion for deletion, but I don't see how that helps your case. It simply deepens the degree of rejection of the futile project to remove schools from Wikipedia on the grounds of non-notability.</li>
<li>And I don't know whether you've considered this yet, but I think I should raise the matter: on any three recent days, more completely new school articles are created on Wikipedia, and are not speedy-deleted, than are listed for deletion or deleted as copyright violations in an average <i>month</i>.</li>
<li>On some days the figure is even higher. Today alone, in just a few hours I have recorded the creation of twenty-two school articles. Twenty-three school articles were listed for deletion during the whole of August, and only four of those were deleted. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:32, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Notability is a sufficient criterion for keeping. Implying notability from the fact that an article is kept is faulty logic.</li>
<li>However, the articles on schools that appear here are not listed because of a lack of notability of the school, they are listed on their own merit (or rather lack of merit) because they typically contain nothing more than basic contact information. I really can't see why the fact that on a sunny day half a dozen such articles are created should prevent anyone from listing them here. There is no counterpart to the "Schoolwatch" project running the "futile project" of expunging school-stubs from Wikipedia, however I can see "Schoolwatch" promoting a degree of very unhealthy factionalism. Wikipedia isn't about fighting a war of attrition. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 17:23, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You say: "Implying notability from the fact that an article is kept is faulty logic." So it would be. Read what I say: "There is evidently no consensus, at least not over the past eight months, that schools are not generally notable."</li>
<li>So please address my point, not the point that you wish I had made instead.</li>
<li>Well it's your <i>opinion</i> that school articles aren't listed on account of non-notability. So let's look at the facts and see if they match. Looking at a randomly chosen lot of deletion listings from August:
<ul>
<li>Notability explicitly mentioned by nominator: Village Preschool of Saratoga, Duveneck School, Palo Alto Montessori School, Netivot Hatorah Day School, York Hill Elementary School, Court Moor School, Jesuit High School (Portland), Widdifield secondary school, North Olmsted High School, Butler school, King Middle School, Sacred Heart School, St. Catherine's School (Twickenham) Charlotte High School</li>
<li>Other:
<ul>
<li>Millburn School, Wadsworth, Illinois. Nominator said it was a duplicate of an item in a list at another article (!) Most delete voters mentioned notability.</li>

<li>You say "on a sunny day half a dozen such articles are created". This is simply false. Today it's 46, more like <b>four dozen</b>. If school articles did indeed pose a serious problem for Wikipedia, then pointlessly listing two dozen per month for deletion, and only getting three or four deleted, wouldn't be the way to solve it.</li>
<li>You say "I can see "Schoolwatch" promoting a degree of very unhealthy factionalism". I think we'll have to differ on that;Schoolwatch lists no school articles for deletion. But I agree completely that "Wikipedia isn't about fighting a war of attrition" which is why I ask all editors engaged in this savage and ultimately losing battle against school articles to consider ceasing it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:43, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Are you seriously suggesting that someone is trying to get deletionists to "shut up"? Oh for heaven's sake, I've handled some weird shit in the five months during which I've engaged in deletion debates, but the idea that the poor deletionists are being intimidated by the nasty inclusionists is frankly incredible.

<li>Tony is absolutely correct. The very idea that it is inclusionists who are the party ceaselessly trying to get the other side to "shut up" is simply beyond the pale. Deletionists <b>chronically</b> insist that inclusionists give up their position that <b>all schools are notable</b> (or variations thereof) in order to reach some deletionist-defined concensus (which does not and will not exist). AfD/VfD is and has been chronically abused by deletionists who nominate school stubs for deletion within days of creation, knowing full well that the article will be re-written, expanded and especially in the case of secondary schools, 99.9% likelihood that it will survive the AfD process. The real question in all of this, is why do deletionists continue to prosecute a war on school articles by nominating them in this way, and then insisting that those who vote to keep the school articles are those who are "not compromising" or "not concensus building"?--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 00:07, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks, Gateman. That's exactly what I was getting at. Telling people to quit nominating articles for deletion is no way of achieving consensus or anything of the sort. I've seen editors on both sides of the fence that have blatantly broken <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> on multiple AfDs for schools; in my original vote, which I admit was not completely civil, I was rephrasing a previous voter's quite uncivil keep vote (<i>"Talk about biting the newbies; the nominator should be reprimanded. Or beaten with a large trout."</i>). I've since struck that part out of my vote to hopefully calm down the controversy. Conlangs and webcomics have had relatively recent polls regarding the inclusion of articles on those topics, and now a good consensus on those has been hammered out by means of polling. Why shouldn't we do that for schools as well? --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 20:41, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> non-notable. Nicodemus, why not create a project page called something like "Schools of the world" in which you and like minded users explain to the rest of us your rationale for wishing (apparently) to create an individual article on every preschool on up in the entire world. What on earth is the rationale? I really can't imagine, but if these articles were part of a project and had a header pointing puzzled readers like me to a place where we can read about the rationale for the project, I might feel better. E.g. like any good citizen of the world, I favor education, and I know that in the U.S. and other places, many teachers feel undervalued. Is your idea that a forum for boosterism can boost teacher or student morale, or even school budgets? Or what? On another such VfD, I see you complained that everyone's opinions are entrenched. Well, <i>mine</i> is not! I just have no idea what this is all about. If you can make a good case for your school project in a project page (maybe put a draft in your user page?), I'll change my vote on all these school VfDs.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 22:54, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can't speak for Nicodemus but in my opinion having articles on schools enables users to better understand the environment in which children grow up and how their lives are shaped. See also <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html#Keep" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments#Keep</a>.

But how the heck is a stub like the one under discussion going to help anyone "better understand the environment in which children grow up and how their lives are shaped"?! C'mon, be serious.

<dd>I can't speak for him either, but I don't think that he or anyone else has suggested that they want to create an article on every preschool, grade school, etc. in the world. Even people who believe that schools are notable also require the school to be notable enough that someone would bother to write an article about it in the first place. However, if the encyclopedia already contains the information, why not keep it, especially if it's verifiable and NPOV? Merge it somewhere else if need be, but personally I don't think it makes sense to delete the information outright. Oh, and <b>keep</b>; private high schools usually end up being interesting enough. If anyone wants to merge that's okay with me too. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 01:57, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the links. Alas, these pages fail to provide a coherent rationale for the school articles. I don't spend much time on VfDs (yesterday's wikiservice was very exceptional for me), but <i>I can see a clear problem here and I can suggest a simple and long over-due solution</i>. Specific comments:
<ol>
<li>There seems to be an ongoing and long-running debate over the suitability of "all the world's schools". JY, I demur: I think it is clear that this <i>is</i> the goal of some editors.</li>
<li>Yuckfoo, don't let the long running debate obscure a <i>more important fact</i>: casual inspection suggests that users like me who are <i>not involved in this debate</i> (except on a temporary basis) regularly nominate these articles for deletion, because to the average users they are likely to appear clearly nn. There is a set of people who watch these VfDs and routinely vote to keep, so the VfDs almost always fail. But <i>the fact that they keep occuring at all is clearly a huge waste of time and wikiresources</i> (at least, of the human CruftPatrol kind).</li>
<li>The solution is for those of you who are creating these articles to band together, reform the Schools Project, write an Explanation For the Rest of Us of the rationale for your project.</li>
<li>Anyone who creates a school article should <i>always</i> add a header to every school article so that casual readers who stumble over one of these will follow the link, find out that you all <i>do</i> have a rationale (actually, right now, it seems that you <i>don't</i>, but if you try I imagine you can come up with something), and on second thought decide <i>not</i> to start a VfD. <i>Failure to do this is the reason for these perennial and proably pointless VfDs</i>.</li>
<li>Rationale: I am saying you should <i>make it easy for casual readers to find out</i> that an apparently nn school article is in fact <i>part of a project which has a well-thought out rationale</i>. Alas, the <i>pro</i> arguments I saw on the page someone cited seem quite incoherent to me. The issue is not whether eduation is important or that teacher/student morale or school budgets and political interference with public education is a serious social concern in many countries. The issue is <i>why the world needs individual Wikipedia articles on every school in the world</i>. So far it seems the best you (plural) can come up with is a vague argument that searching Google for information on your child's school is unlikely to bring up relevant information. That might well be true, but Wikipedia policy specifically states that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. I can't advise you on rationale for your own project, but I would add that you need to cogently counter arguments like the very elementary argument offered by <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_Views_2cf3.html#Schools" title="User:Soltak/Views">User:Soltak/Views#Schools</a> And btw, Soltak, well put! I think you've clearly and concisely expressed the gut reaction of the average user who stumbles over a school stub, decides the subject is clearly nn, and starts the ten millionth school VfD.</li>
<li>I am not trying to stop your project, I am suggesting that <i>by not organizing it properly and explaining yourself coherently to other users you are quite unneccessarily wasting everyone's time</i>. I feel that following my suggestions will not only save your own time (since far fewer VfDs), but will improve the quality of whatever articles you come up with in future.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 22:37, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I suspect re-stating the obvious is probably just a waste of my time in your case, since you have already classified yourself as someone who agrees with Soltak and other deletionists by your "gut reaction" (whatever that means) which you project is shared by the "average user". However, the <i>rationale</i> you are seeking is very simple. Those of us who believe that schools as institutions of learning are inherently notable, believe that as such, they should have their own articles on Wikipedia as more and more human knowledge is accrued here. I and others are interested in reading and researching information about schools, just as I am interested in what are arguably equally "obscure" or "non-notable" (whatever that subjective "canard" means) such as battleships, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, small towns, provincial and county governments, natural histories of parishes, differences between different sub-species of butterflies and beetles, contenders of elected public office, etc., etc. etc. What it all boils down to, is whether or not you believe that being a school inherently establishes "notability", "interest", "subject of interest", "knowledge" or whatever term you wish to place on it. Those of us who do believe as such, enjoy reacding, writing and researching articles about various and sundry schools around the world. Any attempt to re-state or argue beyond this point is really just grist for the mill. If you believe that a school is noteworthy or notable by virtue of it's being a school, you probably want to see it have an article. If you don't believe as such, you likely don't see the need to have such articles. It sounds like you don't agree - fine. There is indeed no concensus right now, as I keep on saying. AfD is the only tool we have to resolve this problem at the moment so vote however you want. All previous attempts to build concensus on this matter have utterly and miserably failed - continuing or re-starting that process is inane and redundant. Fortunately, the deletionists are losing this war of attrition that they are waging against schools and school articles are growing, expanding and will eventually become accepted by general concensus as part of Wikipedia. Even the latest elementary schools have survived the AfD process.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:23, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Nicodemus, thanks for your response, but do you see why it is rather insulting to suggest that I am lying when I said that I am responsive to clear and cogent reasoning? I can see that this is a sore point with you, and I am not trying to reopen old wounds, but to prevent this huge time wastage. I still think the school article authors like yourself should give an improved project page and header template idea a try. Simply informing <i>casual readers</i> that an apparently nn school article they happen to stumble over is <i>part of a project</i> pursued by a small but dedicated band is likely to give many pause before starting a VfD. You guys will be the principal benificiaries, I think: wouldn't you rather spend your time writing another school article pursuant to your goals, rather than arguing in pointless and repetitive VfDs? It's strange that I seem to be arguing with an educator (yes?) about the many virtues of educating others about, let us say, why a buncha people are so dedicated to a seemingly mindless task.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 23:40, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Afterthought: actually, Nicodemus, I think I am arguing that your best argument might indeed be a reformulation of what you said above: you enjoy this so much that others should let you continue even if they don't quite see the point. If you at least had a header template pointing to a project page, at the very least casual readers like me would be alerted to something they would be unlikely to guess without such a hint: you and like minded people spend a lot of time researching and writing articles about obscure grade schools and so forth. I think most users would tend to raise an eyebrow at that, but would probably be inclined to let you alone. I am not unsympathetic to your implicit argument (I think) that while the authors of "all the world's whatever" are certainly pushing the boundaries of what Wikipedia is or should be, perhaps the fact that their activity is so important to <i>them</i> is sufficient to make it acceptable, as long as it does minimal harm to routine use of Wikipedia by others (which I guess is probably true). I am just saying that you could probably avoid 50-75% of these VfDs if you simply had a template header to alert puzzled casual readers to the fact that some school stub is part of an on-going and extremely ambitious project. As I say, even if they don't see the point of this project, I think most causal users are likely to then decide not to complain about said stub. Do you see where I am coming from yet? Anyway, I will have to let this go now, but since I learned something I took the trouble to archive some of my thoughts on all the world's whatever.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 00:35, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am not sure that I implied that you are lying, but rather that the objective in the discussion is most likely futile. Your idea is fine but I seriously doubt that it will make a difference being that the problem isn't whether or not there is a project or a header or anything of the kind. Those who oppose the inclusion of school articles on Wikipedia will undoubtedly see a massive school-writing project as <i>ipso facto</i> illegitimate and "non-notable". I actually think that your suggestion *might* be helpful, but many, many of the AfD nominations (not ALL) for school articles are nominations by the "usual suspects". That is to say, that those who oppose what they consider to be "non-notable" schools generally, intentionally list exeptionally poorly written school articles or school stubs for VfD/AfD hoping to get them deleted (and, I believe, as a way of continuing to try to fight a war of attrition against school articles). They do this with some, minority success (see deletion of Articles for deletion/York Hill Elementary School for a recent example) but generally what occurs, is editors clean up the articles in question and the school survives the AfD process. Templates and Projects are really not the crux of the problem - the problem is whether or not one believes the articles should exist in the first place. Everything else on top of that fundamental question is nothing more than grist for the mill. Now, those who oppose the inclusion of school articles have mounted the mill-grist so high, that they object to being referred to as "deletionist" (those who wish to delete) and have the audacity to co-relate the word to <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Nigger</a>. Tell me that doesn't clearly demonstrate that the acceptance or concensus you are trying to achieve is beyond Templates and Projects! By way of disclosure, we "usual suspects" of the "inclusionist" camp are at the point now, where very little debate such as this is felt to be necessary. How often do I have to repeat <b>schools are inherently notable</b> as my philosophy before it is pointless to just keep repeating it? The sad truth is, that it all boils down to whether or not schools are notable enough to have articles on/in Wikipedia - I believe that they are. More explanation than that, is to a large extent, facile. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 01:58, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Obscure name, possibly offensive 80.213.162.57 21:36, 10 September 2005 (UTC) I started a Afd for this category based on the title, but then I discovered that the title is an actual term, although somewhat an obscure one. Not quite sure what to do about this, but either a rename to something like "government officials killed by mafia / organized crime", or maybe an article explaining what "excellent cadavers" means, and where it came from.</p>
<p>I could of course be totally off point here, but seeing the title without knowing the etymology of the expression seems somewhat morbid.</p>

<li>sorry, I didn't know that the creation of articles about one's self was considered vain.

<li>This mud is based off of the SMAUG code. There are many players that play on MUDs that use similar coding. I'm sure that there will be many players that would be interested in seeing what exactly, this person has done to alter the code and make it their own. I'm also sure that there is an online list of the rules and procedures that must be followed on this site, and it's possible to find; however I hope we don't have to do that as I'm sure we can work this out. There are many other MUDs listed on this site, thus this should be permitted. The same rules need to be followed at all times, meaning this listing should be allowed. It's quite informative and may give others the information they need in order to start a MUD of their own, which could bring much pleasure to many --Tirion 23:47, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We recently expanded to aeonofdarkness.com. Index.php have google pagerank of 4. Not all crawlers have found the new site yet, however the old site url still works: aod.genesismuds.com, which has a pagerank of 5. You might notice that the MOTD has several newer news items above that....and that magically the months flow through a whole year. Wow, August 1st doesn't mean August 1st 2005? How could that be?

Well, as a current player of AOD, I feel that it is necessary to inform the general public as to it's importance in the current gaming community. The creator/s of the game have put much time and effort into the codebase and have made a very enjoyable game for even the newest mudders (opinion based upon simplicity in usage of the interface) and the assistance of the people involved in the game is something I have not seen in a long time on any of the more "popular" MUDs. AOD has been up and running for several years as I understand it and I think that it is wrong for a information site to immediately disclaim a site that they know relatively nothing about. So, as a player, not a coder or builder or person in any wise involved in the creation or upkeep of the game, I feel that it is important for the general populace to know about such sites as these. But then again, maybe some are bigoted against these sites because they have their "favorites" and don't want others to know. Vibe I am getting here is that the uninformed have attempted to make an "informed" decision based upon either personal bias or just general imbecility. Seamus Curragh</p>
<p>Cryptic, I'm so glad that you want to stop this mud from being listed. How do you think muds become popular? How do you think they gain players? They get word out on sites like this. You're being narrowminded and totally ludacris. Go back to your muds and stay there. Bye bye.--Tirion 23:45, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>And to use just a small section from your own deletion guide:</p>
<p>"Please remember that the deletion process is about the appropriateness of the article for inclusion in Wikipedia. A deletion nomination is not a rejection of the author or an attack on his/her value as a member of the Wikipedia community. Over time, the Wikipedians have invested a great deal of thought in the question of what should and should not be included. Please take the time to review those standards. Please do not take a nomination personally."</p>

<p>This article isn't even really a dictdef: '<i>Unkept'. Is it a word or not? Most of us would dissect the word to produce the meaning 'not kept'.

<p>So an information site declines information, now that makes sense. To tell you the truth, if it wasn't for you guys deleting stuff I would have never heard of you. It was because of the owner of our mud that I was made aware you even existed. So maybe you should let him post INFORMATION cause he got you another hit on your site. Anyway, I dont see what the big deal is if we aren't the largest mud out there. He posted info and who is to judge if any information is irrelevant? Maybe since you own/operate this site you can decide, but either way, its information on some really cool things he has done. By the way, I am a builder for this mud among many other things and i'd like for us to be known a little more. Maybe our player rating will go higher if we could post info about ourselves on sites and you can "accept" us....Thanks!</p>

<dd>I understand your concern, but there is no link or connection to any commercial interests as far as I know, which is why I personally got interested in this diet in the first place. The "book" is simply a collection of articles available online and can not be ordered from anywhere I know of. No one owns this diet, which is why it doesn't really have an official name, and it's thus not a "person's diet" as is so common among other diets. That this article needs clean-up, like most of the other diet articles do, is obvious; this was the first version. If diet articles are appropriate to Wikipedia at all is another discussion, and an interesting one I agree. There's certainly a fine boarder between how well-known the subject of an article must be to be published on Wikipedia, but this diet has a large international audience, has appeared in scientific magazines and are being discussed by respected scientists. It's something as unusual as a modern-day diet that is a serious research project, and not a promotion for a product. - <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintran_9423.html" title="User:Wintran">Wintran</a> 00:52, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>For now I'll just <b>comment</b>, because I'm undecided if it's notable or not: Googling the article name turns up nothing because the name is made-up; "Wai Genriiu" gets 800 hits but only 35 unique. If there are neutral scientific magazine articles that have been written, then please cite them. Also, you <a href="http://www.waitalk.com/cgi-bin/bb3/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=7;t=000005" class="external text" title="http://www.waitalk.com/cgi-bin/bb3/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=7;t=000005" rel="nofollow">asked</a> for folks from a message board related to the subject to come here to join the debate--you may want to read about <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html#.22Meatpuppets.22" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">meatpuppets</a>. <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHollyAm_2189.html" title="User:HollyAm">HollyAm</a> 01:34, September 11, 2005 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintran_9423.html" title="User:Wintran">Wintran</a> may be referring to this article: <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/dehmelt/" class="external autonumber" title="http://faculty.washington.edu/dehmelt/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. The thesis basically states that cooked food is bad for you, and people should eat more raw foods. It doesn't say anything about acne, and in fact I think most of us know that an orange is healthier than a Big Mac. The scientific article does not support Wai's claims that cooked food causes acne, or "cause[s] cancer, dementia, constipation, ADHD and overeating"(<a href="http://www.waisays.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.waisays.com/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>). Therefore I would categorize that article in support of <a href="../../../r/a/w/Raw_food_diet.html" title="Raw food diet">Raw food diet</a>. If No More Acne Diet proves notable (and thusfar, according to <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHollyAm_2189.html" title="User:HollyAm">HollyAm</a> it is not), I would suggest giving it a subcategory under <a href="../../../r/a/w/Raw_food_diet.html" title="Raw food diet">Raw food diet</a>, since it seems similar in most respects.

<dd>In response to <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHollyAm_2189.html" title="User:HollyAm">HollyAm</a>: The name is made up together with members of the official forum because there was no official name to be found.

I quote: "WaiSays.com was the result of doing research for a book. Originally we were just doing research about the relation between diet and the skin, but the more scientific studies we read (mostly financed by pharmaceutical companies), the more we discovered that ‘they’ very well know the causes of major diseases, which they publicly pretend not to know."<a href="http://www.waisays.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.waisays.com/" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. From what I've heard it's mainly her theories about <a href="http://www.4.waisays.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.4.waisays.com/" rel="nofollow">excessive calcium</a> that has gained recognition in scientific magazines and among scientists (some brief comments are mentioned <a href="http://www.4.waisays.com/brief.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.4.waisays.com/brief.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>). I might have been hasty in my judgement in believing this diet would be suitable on Wikipedia in its current state. I got the feeling that it was, being completely non-commercial and with its steady group of followers and growing recognition among fellow scientists. I agree that it could probably be included in alternate views in the <a href="../../../a/c/n/Acne.html" title="Acne">acne</a> article and be mentioned in the <a href="../../../r/a/w/Raw_food_diet.html" title="Raw food diet">raw food diet</a>.

<li>I'm not sure if this is a professional club or not. Even if the 'A' stands for amateur (as I suspect it might), the club does claim to have a long history, which could be an argument in favour of inclusion. Unfortunately, the article is a copyvio of <a href="http://www.sportnetwork.net/main/s221/st70173.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sportnetwork.net/main/s221/st70173.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. I will tag and bag it as such. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 02:34, September 11, 2005 (UTC)

<li>A.F.C. nearly always stands for <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_football.html" title="Association football">association football</a> club (as opposed to <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_football.html" title="Rugby football">rugby football</a> club, etc.) - regardless, plenty of amateur football clubs have WP articles. As a club in the second tier of the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_football_league_system.html" title="Welsh football league system">Welsh football league system</a>, and with a long history I would reckon that it is probably notable enough to warrant inclusion (but only just). <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 00:18, September 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>
