<p>Fantasy biography. This one can't decide on a time frame, shifting between centuries. The subject was born in 1986, is a computer engineer, mathematician, scientist and later a political leader - indeed, he is "one of the most controversial figures in Australian political history." Among his accomplishements as Australia's Prime Minister: established diplomatic relations with China and reduced voting age to 12. In 1744 he was briefly married to the queen of a warrior tribe, in 1868 he built a church, in 1688 he was ahead in the polls, etc..... Naturally, there's not a single source for any of this. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 22:30, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. No one has offered any compelling reason for deleting this article. Controversy is good, first of all, because it allows all points of view to be aired, not just the ones that one side likes. On the contrary, this is a perfectly legitimate article with valuable information on a fairly common human behavior. For the reasons above, this article fits very well within the bounds of WikiPedia's mission. The only possible real (and unspoken) "reason" for deletion would have to do with censorship by social conservatives offended by the topic, who use the terrifying concept of controversy (aka "someone must not be allowed to think differently from me"). But if we start down that route then let *me* delete all the articles that offend social liberals - a very dangerous route and a precedent we do not want to set. I see right through the transparent pretext to the real agenda which is to censor information some uptight conservative does not want other people to have.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This once survived a Vfd. I never liked it, so what I did was to move it to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_verbs.html" title="Spanish verbs">Spanish verbs</a> and greatly expand it, adding a lot of info about how Spanish verbs work. That way, this silly list didn't have its own article, but was just tagged onto the end of the good one, where I could keep it under control. However, I made the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_verbs.html" title="Spanish verbs">Spanish verbs</a> article too big, and so someone split the list out again! We're back to where we were: with a list that nobody likes very much. I say let's just delete it. If we ever decide to put some sort of list of common verbs in the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_verbs.html" title="Spanish verbs">Spanish verbs</a> article, this list is preserved in the history, so we can just pull it out at any time. — <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"><i>Chameleon</i></a> 23:38, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

I mean, since this is a <i>very</i> incomplete list of <i>Spanish verbs</i>... and it is impractical for an extensive list to be placed here, I suggest that it should at least be considered that the article is not deleted, but have a section on its article on <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_verbs.html" title="Spanish verbs">Spanish verbs</a>. <a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbraceyrules_85a6.html" title="User:Dbraceyrules">Dbraceyrules</a> 19:55, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

SInce I've already quarantined the vandalism, nothing links to the Telemundo Square page anymore. Basically there's nothing to redirect.

<li>Redirects are handled server-side, link-clicking is client-side. Anchor jumping has to be done client side.

It's the part of the behavior that got <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_03fe.html" title="User:Michael">Michael</a> hard banned two years ago. -- <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrius_3685.html" title="User:Cyrius">Cyrius</a>|<a href="../../../c/y/r/User_talk%7ECyrius_ef50.html" title="User talk:Cyrius">✎</a> 23:41, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I say "period" because the policies say, "Talk about content, not about people". And it's a good rule. Basing your criticim on who wrote an article damages the community atmosphere. Besides, what's the point? Aghost's writing is so incoherent, you don't have to work hard to get people to vote "Delete". (Which is always the case when somebody feels the need to say "another article from...") Indeed, making it personal actually works in his favor: he's able to justify himself as a persecuted, misunderstood individual. Personal attacks just feed that myth. ----<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 23:49, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Having read the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines, I find fault with them. However, I am aware that my concerns are better placed on the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> page itself, I will outline them here at this moment: These guidelines are too strong and only promote the dissemination of information about musicians in the mainstream. Not in an entirely direct response to phil's article, however, the wikipedia should be a source of obscure and less well known information. While the article about phil may seem unnoteable it is incomplete as phil has the noteworthy talent of being able to compose and perform long and complex canons on the fly as improv when cued by an audience member.65.24.57.160 05:54, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think it's definitely going to need a lot more work, but I also think the subject itself is easily notable enough to merit an article precisely because propaganda is such a major part of daily life in China. If it eventually ends up being merged with something else or renamed ("Propaganda in the People's Republic of China", as suggested by Mikkalai above, would be an improvement), I don't have a problem with that. Point is, I certainly wouldn't delete it now. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 23:37, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: why does it matter if the patent nonsense is intentional? As if the sundry vandals and trolls *aren't* intending to write patent nonsense? Wikipedia's patent nonsense policy doesn't have exceptions for postmodernism. Assuming the article is meaningful at least to those versed in "pataphysics", it is impossible for most people to edit and has an insoluble systematic bias. It's impossible to judge if the subject is notable or encyclopedic, if the language conforms to the neutral point of view, if the language is factual, and so forth. This is why we have different language Wikipedias, and given that pataphysical prose is "intended to be absurd and nonsensical" to most people fluent in English, then it's arguably not written in English at all. Prose not written in English doesn't belong on an English language Wikipedia unless it's translated into English. If, on the other hand, it's patent nonsense even to pataphysicists, it doesn't belong on <b>any</b> Wikipedia. The point should be made in the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pataphysics.html" title="Pataphysics">pataphysics</a> article (if it isn't already) that nonsensical prose is a component thereof. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 23:11, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a sports news site.

They are more like fixtures. I would like you to expand on your criticisms. Try to construct your own sports analysis mini-page, based on a sports team you know something about. Use <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_James_7752.html" title="Bill James">Bill James</a> as a 'template' for the work. The reason that I make this request is that I would seriously like to know how the two pages mentioned above in this comment trend so dangerously close to opinion or editorialism. And, I would like to see the voters here actually studying sports as they create their opinions of these two sports pages. It would be important for that to happen. As a note, if all 5 major US leagues (<a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a>, <a href="../../../n/b/a/NBA_52b6.html" title="NBA">NBA</a>, <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_d3e5.html" title="MLB">MLB</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Soccer_7bb1.html" title="Major League Soccer">MLS</a> and <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_5702.html" title="NHL">NHL</a> each have on average 30 teams apiece, and each team generates up to 5 sports analysis pages, let's say, then there would be at least 750 new pages of <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabermetrics.html" title="Sabermetrics">sabermetrics</a> level sports pages on the Wikipedia. This should take up to 10 years to occur. I completely fail to see how this could hurt the Wikipedia. <i>Please</i> tell me how this could hurt the Wikipedia.

<li>No, Sophitus, that wouldn't make sense from a sports Wikipedian's point of view. The <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a> is very easy to set up as it always has only 16 games in 17 weeks.

However, on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Boston_Red_Sox_Season_bcb6.html" title="2005 Boston Red Sox Season">2005 Boston Red Sox Season</a> an obvious solution is reached: that of simply listing each <i>opposing team</i> with the <i>number of games to be played that season</i>. An aggregate won-loss record can be jotted down on each of the 20 or so lines. And again, <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a> is very easy to deal with as far as writing this type of result as there are only 16 entries for each of the 32 teams and either 1, 2, 3 or 4 playoff scores to record for each of the 12 playoff teams.--<a href="../../../m/c/d/User%7EMcDogm_375a.html" title="User:McDogm">McDogm</a> 21:30, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article has now doubled in size. The talk section is also begun. In any event the schedule will be available at <a href="../../../m/c/d/User%7EMcDogm_Pats_Schedule_8147.html" title="User:McDogm/Pats Schedule">User:McDogm/Pats Schedule</a>. In passing, the investment community spends a lot of time with sports. It would behoove the science community to think about putting this potentially popular page on its own computer site in order to provide the basis for talking about money with people who have money to spend on the computer industry. It would puzzle the bank people in general to see a deletion area such as this one, and to then receive criticism for being unresponsive to the needs of the scientific community. Who do you think is voting on all this <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> stuff that keeps getting stalled? Politics is extremely important to getting money for quantum physics research and supercomputer research. Not to mention the internet. It is irritating to see science and sports fighting against each other. I would think that a simple schedule, which would go far towards establishing normal relations between the two camps, and which could be generated by interested sports fan Wikipedians at their leisure as the seasons unwind and repeat down through the years, would be a perfect addition to the body of knowledge here. In light of this present deletion difficulty, as a general trend indicator, it is easy to understand how difficult it is to obtain and give funding for important scientific research. Try instead to support a humble article like this one. Two-way communication is essential for generating massive expenditures in any field, including original science. It would certainly be appreciated. Remember, it takes two to tango. Let's try to set an example here. How can sports guys in congress vote for science when there is so much opposition to sports? They actually need your support in order to pass the necessary legislation! They really are eager to fund the science programs; they just can't receive abuse for doing so! Try not to make it too difficult. Its just common sense. Thanks for reading. --<a href="../../../m/c/d/User%7EMcDogm_375a.html" title="User:McDogm">McDogm</a> 22:34, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. A schedule is simply source material. Any expansion beyond the dates, times, and opponents is at best speculation and editorializing. As the season progresses, the relevant high points can be added to the main article on <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a>. If there is enough information to warrant its own article, then it can be spun off of the main article at that time. Like many of the votes above, I don't see the point of having a single sports team's schedule for a single year in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> 23:08, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

The only thing the main NFL article says about the regular season is a given team's opponent makeup.

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem is that the schedule is ready to be merged to 2005 New England Patriots Season, as suggested above, as part of the preseason section, but the rules of deletion preclude any mergers or move of the article until the matter is resolved. On a seperate tack, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Boston_Red_Sox_Season_bcb6.html" title="2005 Boston Red Sox Season">2005 Boston Red Sox Season</a> is now more or less created, in the same vein as the future 2005 New England Patiots Season presentation. If one is concerned with 164-game lists, worry no more; the article is concise and interesting. I hope anyone concerned with this obvious worry would take a look should they have time. Tx. And as a point of interest, sports are such a huge part of our society, like the church, the military, art and science, that it is a bit odd to hear of it being spoken of as non-encyclopedic or even non-Wikipedic. I mean, it couldn't be more obvious. I think I understand some concerns, though. Although I am sure that there is no problem with sports articles that <i>I</i> write, I am sure that there is some small possibility of other teams' Wikifans not writing conscientious articles, to which I reply that any fan of the team or teams in question would simply have the authority by dint of love of the subject to create a better page. It is as though a free market force would take over bad sports pages, with incredibly proud and loyal fans replacing good with bad, in the case of un-Wikipedlian sports pages. Try to think along the lines of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bad_News_Bears_4f24.html" title="The Bad News Bears">The Bad News Bears</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiddich.html" title="Quiddich">Quiddich</a>, George Plympton and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_DeLillo_9067.html" title="Don DeLillo">Don DeLillo</a>'s End Zone. I could cite film; during the battle scene with the I-Fighters in the first <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> movie, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chewbacca.html" title="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Skywalker_d1fc.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrison_Ford_f221.html" title="Harrison Ford">Harrison Ford</a> obviously has the type of hand-eye coordination associated with participation in sports. Another point I could make is that I have seen pages on this site so unbelievably obscure in nature that it belies any attempt to speak of sports as being unworthy of mention. I mean, really! I would be prepared to argue the case of this page in arbitration on all these grounds should it come down to it. I really think sports are good for society, and will be with us until the sun turns into a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_giant.html" title="Red giant">red giant</a>, and hopefully beyond, if science and science fiction have anything to do with it. And I don't think Wikipedia should be left out of it. Thanks again for reading. --<a href="../../../m/c/d/User%7EMcDogm_375a.html" title="User:McDogm">McDogm</a> 01:33, 29 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>McDogm, I don't think that most of the Delete voters are implying that sports in general don't have a place in Wikipedia. The questions, in my mind at least, are as follows: (1) Does/should a list of team schedules through history fit into the rest of Wikipedia's sports coverage? (2) If such an article can be expanded beyond a simple list, is there any way to meaningfully expand it without suffering from extensive NPOV (neutral point of view) problems? <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> 06:54, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>ESkog, I think that the obvious pro-Sox and pro-Pats nature of those two schedule/analysis articles really reflect the very mild sports sentiment that one could expect from sports, as opposed to food or geography, to give examples. I think it is actually quite comparable to the pro-computer chess feeling one gets from <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Blue_9ae9.html" title="Deep Blue">Deep Blue</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_chess.html" title="Computer chess">computer chess</a> in its nature. I have spent time with the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_James_7752.html" title="Bill James">Bill James</a> Baseball abstract. James invented <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabermetrics.html" title="Sabermetrics">sabermetrics</a>, the term for the science of baseball analysis, and of detailed math analysis of sports in general. It is a very sober yet enjoyable science that takes fan feeling as an obviously inherent part of its written product. What I am getting at here is that these two sports articles, from a sports point of view, have very solid NPOV. I again refer to big science articles, which use the reader's and writer's enthusiasm for science to communicate the facts involved, like in <a href="../../../j/w/s/JWST_c5b8.html" title="JWST">JWST</a> and any <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> article. The happiness of sports should come through in a sports article, much as the solemnity and toil of a saint should come through in a saint article. And as someone who knows sports writing to some degree, each team's analysis would follow in detail with the results of the analytical writing in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_New_England_Patriots_Schedule_e6a0.html" title="2005 New England Patriots Schedule">2005 New England Patriots Schedule</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Boston_Red_Sox_Season_bcb6.html" title="2005 Boston Red Sox Season">2005 Boston Red Sox Season</a>, albeit with differing emphasis. It is a commonplace of sports writing that one doesn't tear down the subject while one is writing it, but it is also a commonplace of sports writing that there is another article right around the corner that is more or less diametrically opposed to it, in a very mild sports manner, like a possible 2005 Indianapolis Colts Season or 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers Season in this case. As different <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabermetrics.html" title="Sabermetrics">sabermetrics</a> level articles get written about differing opposing teams, the discussion begins to resemble a university classroom in its enthusiasm and and free flow of conflicting ideas. As long as sports writers on the Wikipedia are functioning at <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_James_7752.html" title="Bill James">Bill James</a> level there isn't much risk of abuse of the Wikipedia. Is the reference to POV and NPOV due to unfamiliarity with the world of sports? IDK.--<a href="../../../m/c/d/User%7EMcDogm_375a.html" title="User:McDogm">McDogm</a> 19:56, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> Not only is there some fan feeling in any sports article, more importantly, and what I was trying to say, is that fan feeling is obviously a component of a team's success, according to <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabermetrics.html" title="Sabermetrics">sabermetrics</a>. It almost goes without saying. Sox fans have a certain feeling for the Sox, Yanks fans have a very different feeling toward the Yanks. These differences are imnportant and yield easily to analysis.

I will have to ask, do you have any familiarity with sports in general? The reason I ask such a question is that the material in the 2005 Pats Schedule article is just obvious. It is something that every football fan already knows. It is difficult to verify, and it is difficult not to know this, if one had been more or less following any sports page in America. It is just very well expressed here, in a consciously <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabermetrics.html" title="Sabermetrics">sabermetrics</a> level of intellectual discourse. There is nothing in the article that is not as obvious as knowing whether a light is on or off, to someone who has spent some time with the material, and who is willing to spend a lot of time bringing it to the Wikipedia, again in a standardized <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabermetrics.html" title="Sabermetrics">sabermetrics</a> level of writing. --<a href="../../../m/c/d/User%7EMcDogm_375a.html" title="User:McDogm">McDogm</a> 17:39, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The phrase "is expected to" indicates speculation. Speculation is inherently unverifiable. If, in fact, the Patriots barely squeeze out a victory in week 3, then the information may be encyclopedic after the fact. If so many people think that week 3 will be a tough matchup that it is selected as the "Game of the Week" by several media outlets, then that information <i>may</i> be encyclopedid. The content of a prediction is not encyclopedic or verifiable. The means by which predictions are made could be, the effect of a prediction could be, and the actual outcome of the event could be. -- As for the argument that sports fans consider these speculations to be obvious, that does not argue for their inclusion. There is no article on the predicted color of the sky in 2006 for the same reason. To answer your question I do keep up with sports and I am, in fact, familiar with Bill James' work on baseball statistics. The <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabermetrics.html" title="Sabermetrics">sabermetric</a> content of the notes I deleted from the article in question is not the point of objection. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 20:05, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I feel the same way. From my perspective I see everything as the exact opposite of your above synopsis. The material is not objectionable on a point-by-point basis. The <b>class</b> of material (speculation about future events) is inherently non-encyclopedic. The rest of the article is still up for VfD. I removed only the sections which were clearly against WP policies. I am not convinced that the remainder, though not so clearly objectionable, should remain as a separate article. Therefore I voted to merge it with a general account of the team history. I will understand if you do not wish to continue this conversation. I would be a bit relieved myself if it ended here. Perhaps it should be moved to a discussion page instead of Vfd. I am not sure the point of asking which teams I like. (I like the Saints, Titans, and Packers. I cheered for the Patriots in the Superbowl.) <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 02:55, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Despite being against deletion, I agree that such material requires attribution for each of the facts presented, and in its current form is not acceptable. It seems to me this is just based on the records of the opponents from last season, and if this is so, that ought to be made clear. Again, though, the schedule and (AFTER the fact) a discussion of events in the season seems like legitimate material, and given the number of seasons the team has played and will play, putting all that into a single Pats article seems like too much. Having individual articles on each season seems like a good solution. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 17:43, 2005 Jun 2 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As noted earlier, Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base. Furthermore, I'm sure this is information that is very, very easily available elsewhere. I realize that sports fans are likely to be interested in this stuff, but that doesn't mean that Wikipedia is a good place for it -- there are other (and, I would say, better and more obvious) sources for finding game schedules. Bottom line is, I don't think this is encyclopedic information. Wikipedia is not a sports database dedicated to the minutiae of future events. I mean, we might as well start listing the air dates of upcoming episodes of ongoing TV series... -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 23:47, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>"Minutiae", as in "small or trivial detail" -- well, it may not the best choice of words, really, but I do think that in the grand scale of things, it's fitting enough. I don't think this is the kind of information that belongs in an encyclopedia. Like I said, I realize that sports fans are likely to be interested in this stuff and that it's certainly not irrelevant information in itself, but that doesn't mean that it's relevant to Wikipedia. And I'm certainly not opposed to sports in Wikipedia, but it's one thing to write articles about sports and another to create pages for upcoming events. Bottom line: listing the dates and various details of future sports events is not encyclopedic information, and Wikipedia is not a scheduling tool or a repository of general knowledge. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:56, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> It should be noted that I was banned from SDN for trollish behavior, as well as from three other forums where I've trolled in discussions related to religion and politics. I guess in the experience of some posting here, that means I should hold a grudge or something. But even Darkstar has to admit that SDN of the most informative sites related to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a> debate; his site wouldn't be up if it weren't. It continues that rare tradition in fan culture of examining beloved content with an empirical eye. If <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Technical_Commentaries_8152.html" title="Star Wars Technical Commentaries">SWTC</a> has had an impact on the debate noteworthy of its own page, then SDN may deserve its own as well. And the boards likewise lend themselves to rich discussion; there's nothing else out there that comes close in SDN's category. So I have no idea where all this "vendetta" crap is coming from. Still, the entry as stands doesn't even pass the laugh test. It's a vain, self-serving promotion. I've tried to work out the POV issues, but if people keep reverting it to the same old crap rather than expanding the stub then I don't see why it should stay. I don't intend to revert it back; the opening hook I wrote is in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a> now.

<p><s>On second thought, I'm changing my vote to <b>delete</b>.</s> The entry is five paragraphs. The half of the second paragraph is an explanation of the SDN abbreviation, and the other half lists Michael Wong's fanfiction (is it customary to advertise individual fanfics?). The fifth paragraph ends with a sentence (there are, again, only two) that simply restates the third paragraph--which in turn restates a fragment in the opening hook. The fourth paragraph--yet again another two sentence number--is half "Michael Wong likes Star Wars" and "AOTC:ICS supports SW over ST"; the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a> article already discusses this.

<dd>You come here and you exclusivley target SDnet and pages related to it for massive deletions of text, without discussing it in the talk pages of the entries. When people ask you to come to the talk pages you ignore it and continue rampant deletion, and slap a VfD on the page to continue this. When you're reported for vandalism of the page in question you go to the Vandalism in Progress page, and edit the entry (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Vandalism_in_progress&amp;diff=14357364&amp;oldid=14357316" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Vandalism_in_progress&amp;diff=14357364&amp;oldid=14357316" rel="nofollow">seen here</a>), changing it's report from one agaisnt you to one against the person who reported you.

<li><b>Keep</b>. In response to what has been stated above, let me just say that: 1) a scientific question by definition can't be "inherently POV", because it deals with the reality, and in reality the answer is either <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>, 2) the article doesn't claim causation (i.e. that high IQ <i>causes</i> less religiousness), only correlation, and reasonably backs it with references. Still, I must add that I'd rather see it merged someplace... <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorB_c220.html" title="User:GregorB">GregorB</a> 20:14, May 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This brings us to the essence of this dispute: should we have articles solely about <b>correlations</b>, aside from the question wether and how well they are documented? (I think everyone agrees that this article states correlation, and not causation). So, let's ask ourselves if we should have articles on other equally intensively studied, but perhaps not as popular correlations, such as Aggresiveness and obesity, Annual income and emotional quotient, and my personal favorite, Mental illness and time spent online. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarol_Langner_26da.html" title="User:Karol Langner">Karol</a> 20:50, May 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is in fact a very good point... My personal hunch is that religiousness is negatively affected chiefly by <b>education</b>, not intelligence, and that the well-known high correlation between the two obscures that fact. Still, we don't know the answer yet, and the mere correlation is fair game for an article if it's important enough, and I think this one is. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorB_c220.html" title="User:GregorB">GregorB</a> 12:11, May 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Beckwith's article presented 43 studies from this area that supported the correlation. This discussion is not about the degree of the correlation.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>; The subject matter is controversial, perhaps, but I can certify that studies of this nature are common among economists and social scientists. However, most studies concentrate on more objectively quantifiable identifiers, such as education. There may be no link between education and intelligence, and whether or not there is is not the subject of the article, which concentrates on the undisputed statistical fact that there is a correlation between levels of education and overt religiosity. (Theists do not satisfy the 'overt religiosity' thing, I suspect.) The article is not POV as it stands, but the title may be. Unusual situation.

<dd>Still very US-centric, and the term "religiousness" seems to be quite problematic, too - as it could cover everything from a belief in a god or some "higher plane" with not particular effect on a person's life or work, to a reborn bible-thumper.

<dd>The studies clearly define their measurements of religiousness. Races can also be difficult to define, but that doesn't mean researchers should throw up their hands and give up.

<li><b>Keep</b>: it IS notable, actually. See the bottom of the talk page for the Lock Legion article for reasons why, and discuss the issue there before casting any votes. I am fed up with these pages being deleted with insufficient reason why and request an actual debate on the topic before a decision is made. If you refuse to offer debate and delete this article regardless, I am going to assume the reason you are not giving an answer is because you don't <i>have</i> one, and are doing this as a personal attack, in which case I will take appropriate measures.
<ul>
<li>Listing an article for VfD is not a personal attack. I'm simply cleaning up after the deletion of <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clock_Crew_9e19.html" title="Clock Crew">Clock Crew</a>, and this article happens to be related to it. —<a href="../../../x/e/z/User%7EXezbeth_c481.html" title="User:Xezbeth"><font color="red">Xezbeth</font></a> 19:58, May 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>=I'm not referring to you (Xezbeth), but to anyone else coming here to vote, and I didn't say "If you put my article on VfD", I said "If you refuse to offer debate".<br />
I know putting something on VfD is not neccesarily a personal attack, I just want to establish why people keep doing this to my articles so I can improve.<br />
To reiterate: <b>anyone who wishes to vote, please read the talk page and discuss the issue there before voting</b>. If you cannot give a reason, then what business do you have deleting my article unless it's a personal attack?</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> - "Krishnaology" is a notable entry. It is a term used by two prominant Vaishnava theologians and is easily distinguished from the historical, literary, and archaelogical study of the Hindu god Krishna. The most distinguished scholar of Hindu Studies at the University of Cambridge, Dr. Julius Lipner, has vouched for this term. There are two quotes from Dr. Lipner that shed some light on this discussion below. The first references Tamala Krishna Gosvami and his work on the Krishnaology of Prabhupada's teachings. The second references the value of his dissertation, the subject matter of which is Krishnaology.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Neither I nor the Faculty ever had reason to regret our decision. Goswami seemed naturally to slip into the academic groove. Accustomed to giving guidance from a position of authority, he also had the ability to place himself with the right attitude at the receiving end educationally. He accepted guidance with grace and humility, read voraciously, worked with great intensity to deadlines, and wrote with clarity and power. His doctoral topic was the 'Krishnaology' of ISKCON's founder, Swami Prabhupada. His personal knowledge of Prabhupada's teaching was vast, he was extremely well-informed about scholarship on the Society, and he had innovative and penetrating ideas. In my view, he succeeded in researching his subject matter with integrity, the requisite criticality, and much originality."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"It is my intention to seek to publish the thesis in his name after due formalities have been seen to. If this can be accomplished, the thesis, I am sure, will be of great benefit to ISKCON and the scholarly world."</li>
</ul>
<p>These statements were published in an academic journal by Dr. Lipner. Such statements by a prominant scholar of Hindu studies (from the University of Cambridge), carry significant weight. If anyone believes that this article is worthy of deletion, they must be able to conter such statements.</p>

<p>The creator of this article decided that the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a> of <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilt_by_association.html" title="Guilt by association">guilt by association</a> must have an "opposite" called "honor by association". That's not logical -- honor is not the opposite of guilt. In any case, the concept is not one I've seen in works on logic or philosophy, or indeed any place outside Wikipedia. So even if the concept were logical ("innocence by association" perhaps?), it would be original research.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> <i>(copied from Talk:Nytharese):</i></p>
<p>To the creator of Nytharese:<br />
Wikipedia is <b>not</b> the place for grammatical descriptions of conlang projects. Therefore I have to support the deletion proposal. First of all, because this is an encyclopedia, it should contain a description of the language instead of a grammar; and that's exactly what I <b>cannot</b> find in the article: info about the person who created it, the year in which it was started, the purpose of the language, etc. Secondly, we need to restrict ourself to constructed languages that have proven their importance in whatever way. A barely started project IMO does not count like one. And even worse: it gives ammunition to those who think the whole conlang stuff is crap from the beginning and are waiting for a chance to kick it out of the wiki altogether.<br />
Now I suppose you have been adding your conlang to the wiki with the best intentions. And let it be clear that I welcome your efforts to give Nytharese a web presence. But wiki is definitely not the place for it. Let me instead point you to another wiki, specially designed for constructed langages: <a href="http://conlang.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://conlang.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://conlang.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page</a> (on the main page, you will also find links to other conlang wikis). I'm sure your language and all of its grammar will be welcomed and appreciated there much more than here!<br />

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 9 clear "delete" votes to 19 "keep" votes (4 anonymous or probable sockpuppet votes discounted). While that would normally be considered an unambiguous "keep" decision, I find it in direct contradiction to Wikipedia established policy (which was carefully cited below). A few keep voters explicitly expressed that they understood the policy and found reason to request an exception in this case. The majority of keep voters appear from their comments to have voted in ignorance of the policy.</p>
<p>I am going to call this decision as a "no concensus" (which defaults to keep for now). All participants are encouraged to carefully review the relevant policies before voting and certainly before renewing this debate. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:57, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes, WP has many articles about "things that have yet to happen" but it's just too far out to have an article. 2007? Come on. At least let <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire_%28movie%29_a01d.html" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (movie)">the fourth movie</a> come out first. There hasn't even been a big media deal about this yet, which is a possible qualification for future events/releases. Heck, they haven't really even gotten started for the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">sixth book</a> yet, let alone even the <i>fourth</i> movie. Information on the cast can be found on the actor/actress's own page, most of which can be accessed through the articles for the other four movies.

Secondly, I'd like to ask you to make the signature a bit smaller and maybe make it say just "Report admin abuse", so it's shorter and doesn't take as much space while still being quite visible. Keeping it a normal size and changing the color may attract just as much people and is less intrusive on others. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:23, May 29, 2005 (UTC)

While it is true that many users do keep 'evidence' pages in their user space, for example in preparation for possible ArbCom disputes, the way this page is structured ("Report Rogue admins below, and / or contribute specific cites of their policy violations"), and also advertised through the signature, circumvents the established process for dealing with complaints against admins.

<li>Sam, would you be willing to change more text in the intro. <i>Admins have more than job security, they have a mandate to abuse, harass and shame ordinary users and anons.</i> and <i>While they protect one another in the same fashion in which they bully others</i> are generalizations which could well be considered an personal attack against all admins. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:15, May 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was keep.</p>
<p>Having noted that the concensus is "keep", I note that there is far less concensus in what form to keep. Several voters recommended keeping this only as a redirect. Others as a merge and redirect. Several argued to keep it as an idependent article but did not address the original objections raised in the nomination - is this or is this not prohibited original research?</p>
<p>The copyright issues do seem to be adequately addressed. The source, however, is neither peer-reviewed nor independent. The assertions in the article are not easily <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> and, based on the evidence presented below, may be fundamentally unanswerable. Similar analysis in, for example, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a>, would generally be categorized as non-canon or fan fiction. Because of those concerns, I am going to have to add my voice to those calling the content unsuitable for Wikipedia. Acting as an ordinary editor, I am going to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold</a> and turn this into a redirect.

<li><b>Keep</b> unless it really is a copyright violation. This article is a set of technical annotations of an <i>extremely</i> well-known comedy skit.

<ol>
<li>A scientific breakdown of a humorous sketch is simply not encyclopedic. This would be like taking the lines from the Philosophers' Soccer/Football Game, another Python sketch, and comparing them to the philosophers' own writings. Fun to put together? Sure. But it doesn't belong here, IMHO.</li>
<li>It may be a humorous anecdote that someone has actually done this work to calculate the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow (African or European), and this may warrant mention on the movie's main page as others have suggested. Stating the conclusion of this <i>primary source</i> may be worthwhile somewhere herein, but don't just text-dump someone's paper onto WP, with or without permission. <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> 05:53, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. As well as there being no such thing as an African Swallow (a problem dealt with in the article by assuming it's a South African Swallow) there is also no such thing as a European Swallow. None of the five species found in Europe are called that, none of them are endemic to Europe, and the one that is probably refered to is the Barn Swallow, which lives across Asia, North America and Europe and migrates to every other continent on earth (including as a vagrant to Antarctica). Incidentally, here is the Birds of America's (put out by Cornell University) statements on swallow wingspeed <i>Flight speed is not much greater than that of other swallows, but with straighter flight this species covers ground more rapidly (see Blake 1948). Speed estimated at 8.0 m/s ± 2.0 SD (range 5–17), which matches the speed predicted if birds were flying to maximize rate of food delivery to nestlings</i> - quite frankly a more reliable sourse. Why have a page devoted to someone's back of the envelope calculations when science already knows these speeds? (PS sorry if I'm being all bird geeky but I'm drowning in python geekyness at the moment.) <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> 11:39, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)
