<li>You're confusing <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selective_norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor.html" title="Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor">selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serotonin-norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor.html" title="Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor">serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</a>. They share the same acronym, but from what I understand, SNRI is only <b>commonly</b> used to describe the latter, mostly because there are so few examples of the former. Unfortunately, a few have used it to describe drugs like Strattera, creating understandable confusion. It might be a good idea for someone to verify this, though.
<ul>
<li>Let me explain how this whole thing works, and maybe somone can do a web of redirects and disambigs. The key thing is that all these drugs are <b>selective reuptake inhibitors</b> compared to TCA antidepressants/typical antipsychotics which are not selective and have lots of side effects. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 02:58, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

Before the marketing of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strattera.html" title="Strattera">Strattera</a>, which is an SNRI, people used the term to refer to SSNRI drugs like <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effexor.html" title="Effexor">Effexor</a> that affect both serotonin and norepinephrine.

<dd>Also <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serotonin-norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor.html" title="Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor">serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</a> should be moved to Selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, since the selectivity is the major point. <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selective_noradrenaline_reuptake_inhibitor.html" title="Selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor">Selective_noradrenaline_reuptake_inhibitor</a> needs to be merged with <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selective_norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor.html" title="Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor">Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</a>.

<dd>I've done a quick review of the literature, and the result is undecided.</dd>
<dd>1. SNRI is used to refer to both <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selective_norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor.html" title="Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor">selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serotonin-norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor.html" title="Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor">serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors</a>, the latter somewhat more than the former.</dd>
<dd>2. SSNRI always refers to selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors</dd>
<dd>One of the problems is that SSNRI is not a terribly accurate term. <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venlafaxine.html" title="Venlafaxine">Venlafaxine</a>, for instance, is not selective; it also works on dopamine as well. I therefore think we should disambig SNRI, and redirect SSNRI to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serotonin-norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor.html" title="Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor">serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</a>.</dd>

<p>This is a page that tries to list all armed conflicts in the world in an "<i>A vs. B, (1990)</i>" format. I think it's supposed to list only ongoing conflicts. The listings of A and B can be interesting at times: "Somalia vs. Rival Clans (1991)", "Israel vs. Palestinan Authority; Hezbollah; Palestinan Separatists; Arab World (1948)", "USA; UK; Australlia vs. Iraq; France (2003)". (That last one was in a previous edit). I can't see this ever being a useful resource because of three reasons: 1) defining each individual conflict 2) identifying the parties for inclusion on either side 3) determining ongoing/dormant/resolved conflicts. <a href="../../../f/e/c/User%7EFeco_e36a.html" title="User:Feco">Feco</a> 02:22, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Redirect</b> (formerly <i>Keep</i>) It is difficult to imagine how a timeline of armed conflicts would not be a useful resource since timelines of wars long have been. At least I seem to recall it coming up rather often in school. And what with war being such a blurry concept these days shoving a list of fights with weapons under <a href="../../../w/a/r/War.html" title="War">War</a> risks arguments about the inclusion of cancer and drugs and the removal of things like Korea and Vietnam. (prak 06:37, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>Perhaps renaming it would be clearer. Something like Armed conflicts (list) or Armed conflicts (timeline) (prak 06:40, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>We <i>already have</i> many lists of wars and armed conflicts, including <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_operations_and_projects_%28military_and_non-military%29.html" title="List of operations and projects (military and non-military)">List of operations and projects (military and non-military)</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_invasions.html" title="List of invasions">List of invasions</a>, all of the articles at Category:List of wars, all of the articles at Category:Wars by region, and all of the articles at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_battles_0887.html" title="Category:Lists of battles">Category:Lists of battles</a>.

<p>HYPSM is not notable. Since I know that someone voting will surely bring up this issue, the difference between this and <a href="../../../h/y/p/HYP_%28universities%29_ab7c.html" title="HYP (universities)">HYP (universities)</a> is that the term HYP is actually used as the name of sports meets events and can actually be found in printed text.

Well, here's a Google search for comparison:</p>
<ul>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Wikipedia's category functionality is the right way of creating lists. It has the ability of holding an article and it automatically groups and manages related articles. The "articles hold red links" argument is a non-argument. It is extremely easy to create a new article, insert a small portion of information, add it to categories and mark it as stub. By this, wikipedia is better served because:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>a stub article is created, bringing more value to wikipedia and more potential to the information holded in that subject</li>
<li>The listing is automatically managed.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, therefore, every list should be converted to a category and every relevant red link should be converted into a stub category. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Maciel</a> 12:03, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is a well established precedent that lists and categories can exist side-by-side, even when their content is identical. Each has its own advantages - lists are centrally managed, allowing good control over their content, and can have extra commentary on each entry. Categories are automatically generated, which helps to track new articles, and can quickly and easily be navigated by means of the category hierarchy. Leave them both be. <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a> <a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjorford_13fb.html" title="User talk:Sjorford">→•←</a> 16:05, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. First, a list is an extremely useful way to put in redlinks to articles on composers that don't exist yet; indeed it's one of the only ways. Second, the list can contain additional information such as the composer's dates, which a category cannot. Third, it parallels many other existing lists of composers: some lists are by nationality, and some are by some other characteristic. Yes, the list is short, but it's barely begun: stubbiness should be an incentive to expansion, not deletion. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> 23:26, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: If that's what you want to do, then I think that you should vote <i>keep</i> and raise this as a copyvio. Delete means we don't want an article on this at all. IMO neither this proposed redirect nor the more grammatical one we could have from <a href="../../../d/u/p/Duplicity.html" title="Duplicity">duplicity</a> is useful, so no change of vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 17:43, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../g/v/f/WP%7EGVFD_9ddb.html#Votes" title="WP:GVFD">WP:GVFD#Votes</a>. "Delete" in the context of "Delete and re-create as redirect" means that my opinion is that the closing administrator should hit that "delete" tab, but instead of doing all of the other related parts of the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">deletion process</a> (deleting talk pages, deleting redirects, removing redlinks, and so forth) should instead then immediately create a redirect in place of the previous article. Given the lack of links to this article, the redirect isn't all <i>that</i> important. Furthermore: It would be wrong to vote keep with the rationale that something is a copyright violation. Voting keep and then listing on <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> would be self-contradictory, moreover, since the latter is another way of nominating an article for deletion, and one would be pressing to keep and to delete an article simultaneously. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:53, 2005 Apr 27 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: (Sigh) the problem here I think is that we are not entirely consistent with our treatment of copyvios. On the one hand we take a great deal of trouble in handling those that are listed on the copyvio page, so as to leave a clean history, while on the other there is no mechanism for removing old copyvios from histories, nor any demand for one. This is historical. I see no inconsistency in what I suggested, in that <i>delete</i> in the context of VfD has a different meaning to deletion on the copyvio page. But if it worries you, you'll need to find another way. Yours is as good as any I guess, IMO it complicates the procedure needlessly, but I respect your view. All the best. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 19:44, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: So, the purpose of this page is to promote a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> you have invented? See <a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMetaChimp_832d.html#Welcome" title="User talk:MetaChimp">your talk page</a>.

<li>Response: <i>neologism</i>. Thank you; I learned a new word. Webster's second definition for it is <i>"a meaningless word coined by a psychotic"</i>. Not exactly what I was going for, but I understand that it might appear that way. As any concept, yes, it began with one person. I liked the concept so much, I decided to adopt is as an online screen name. This doesn't make it exclusively about me, any more than the concept of a "coolguy" is strictly about <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolGuy_a681.html" title="User:CoolGuy">user:CoolGuy</a>. Though there is no current book or the topic, there very well might be in the next decade. What better place to have its public beginnings, than on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. I have explained the concept to literally hundreds of people, each time a little differently. <b>Why can there not be a single, set meaning, that anyone who is curious can look up on Wikipedia, and then contribute to?</b> I will ask a few others to view this discussion, and hopefully express their opinion. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaChimp_0acc.html" title="User:MetaChimp">MetaChimp</a> 19:54, Apr 28, 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Though there is no current book or the topic, there very well might be in the next decade. What better place to have its public beginnings, than on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</i> When a book comes out on it, it will get its article here.

<li><b>Keep</b> But totally re-write, or merge with surveillance. The current text is almost incoherent. I wrote the encyclopedia entry for "Surveillance Abuse" in the <i>Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment,</i> David Levinson, ed., (Berkshire Reference Works), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2002. It is a legitimate entry title, but the issue is much broader than editing videotapes. However, recent court cases in several cities have shown that videos produced by police as evidence against demonstrators have been "creatively" edited; and other videos showed that the tape selections misrepresented the larger picture, resulting in dismissals of charges. I can create a decent stub with five book cites if folks decide to keep it.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 20:21, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Voting to <b>Keep</b> if only because several well-known (to me, at least, who knows nearly no web-comic producers) web-comic writers are heavily behind this and believe it will take off in a big way.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Hush whiners. Would you rather prefer the term "pet professional" to refer to the veterinarian? And I've yet to see something else as unique in referance to this term. Also, quite an original theme as well as funny. - Gravitron, pet owner (all you slashdot critics-dissers need a good hour in subspace SVS duelbox spanking, damned sony station newbies)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable. Regarding this voting process, on May 01, at 3:42pm (unknown time zone, I'm guessing CDT/-6), the webcomic author added a request to his page that his readers come spam this vote process. Unrelatedly, I doubt Simoncursitor's claim of "several" web-comic writers being behind this; I suspect the list is just Scott Kurtz. --jholman 03:45, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, it was mentioned in 01/05/05's PVP so it's relevant to me. Plus as long as some people feel this is relevant who are the rest of us to delete it?

<li><b>No Vote</b>(already voted - keep). Just a small addendum, allow me to be the first to land a five across the eye of JHolman, not as a reader, not as a voter, but as a person who can't stand stupid people making deceptive remarks, spreading misinformation knowingly and twisting facts to advance their agenda. The author didn't request that his readers will SPAM the place, he asked them to come and vote to keep, adding a joke that if you don't like it still go and vote keep. Now please tell me, what is exactly wrong about someone asking their supporters to show their support by voting in a place publicaly open to votes, whereas people are expected to voice their oppinion regarding something? Get a clue, trencher. - Gravitron

<li>We ignore all votes by brand-new users and votes by unsigned in anonymous users, primarily because there is no other surefire way to make sure that people aren't repeat voting under different names and IPs, and also because we expect Wikipedia users to be a little more familiar with the site before they start participating in policy discussions. So you're just wasting everyone's time without accomplishing anything, because <b>all of your votes will be discarded</b>. If anything, you're hurting your cause, because the more such votes turn up, the more established Wikipedians become convinced that the article should go.

<li><b>No vote</b> How come the page stopped displaying all of the comments? Someone sabotaged it using a wikipedia script exploit? Is there a "page 2" that I missed? Lets see if this edit will fix it. Ah, yes, there we go. I don't like registering, I'm TIRED of registering across a gazillion of sites and forums and blongs and what not. Plus, all it ended up doing was generating a torrent of SPAM towards my email, be that 90% advertisements and 10% of retards emailing me about things I could care less to know, like their family problems, why I like the wrong kind of games or that I should believe in god and he'll save me. It's not like I'm that an unknown in the world, hiding behind proxies and shit, most know me anyway. Do I piss you off? Your problem, weak mind. Go a few rounds on Samurai Spirits II vs Mizuki/cham-cham on hardest difficulty, it'll piss you even more that the PC cheats. The truth hurts, if you can't handle it then enter your pink sphere with&#160;?ignore %tickname on macro. If you rather be a tyrant, then just be a tyrant, have an inner board for judging things if you fear votes so much. Not that I'll despise you any less, but you won't have to be pissed by people with free mind. Oh, and "established wikipedians", was that a joke? It's like calling an established forumer on someone with ten hundred thousand of posts. I'll have more trust in a casual passying-by poster to be genuine and not running multi-accounts to rig-boost numbers than I would in your resident members of "established wikipedians", because in the end, they're a community, with a bandwagon and a single flag, as such, they're far more devoted and capable of mischief than a just-stopped-2-say-my-thing person. It's like mindless goons of something aweful. Try throw a poll there, half of them will deploy 5,000 zombies to do voting for them and use multi-proxies to do the rest of the other half while banning them from access. - Gravitron (forget the article, I'm fired on the principle here...these wiki guys are crooked or decent?)

<dd>Well the original was "The Personal Distribution is a Probability Distribution. It can be varied in many ways. There are a number of types." It's not much, but it's unquestionably a valid stub. This article should not have been nominated. It might have been better to pop a math-stub tag on it--and correct "Personal" to "Pearson", of course. VfD should never be used as a substitute for cleanup. Although it's very tempting because you get these dramatic death-bed cleanups, it's too risky a process and we've lost a lot of reasonable stubs because nobody on VfD that week happened to know the subject well enough to do cleanup or even assess the stub's value. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 08:01, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Your comment delves into the controversial aspects of immediatism vs. eventualism. The question of whether substubs should be kept and expanded, or just deleted until someone cares to make an article with more content is open to debate. My view on it was that "it can be varied in many ways" and "there are many types" didn't really say much, and that the article in that form was not useful. All distribution functions I have seen can be varied in some way or another. The rewrite is a bit better (that's why I voted to keep it), although I still miss a formula defining it. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 08:10, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>My comment delves into nothing else but Wikipedia policy. We do not delete reasonable stubs (and what we see in the history is a reasonable stub) on subjects with encyclopedic potential.

Reasons why I think this page should be deleted: 1) <a href="../../../g/e/n/Category%7EGenocides_7dd0.html" title="Category:Genocides">Category:Genocides</a> already exists. Per the ongoing lists vs. categories discussion, adding <a href="../../../g/e/n/Category%7EGenocides_7dd0.html" title="Category:Genocides">Category:Genocides</a> to the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boer_Wars_11da.html" title="Boer Wars">Boer Wars</a> article itself will attract the attention of the editors who follow that topic. In contrast, adding a <i>link</i> to <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boer_Wars_11da.html" title="Boer Wars">Boer Wars</a> on this page will not. In the first case, the peer review process is likely to be much more robust. 2) The text blurbs on this page detailing why an indicent was genocide will have no hard linkage with the underlying article's content. This weakens the peer review process. 3) In debates over specific events to include/exclude, the list format makes it much easier for editors to say "Well, if X is on the list, Y should be too. Conversely, if Y doesn't count, then I'm going to remove X from the list now." Using categories forces someone using that argument to separately convince all of the X editors <i>and</i> all of the Y editors. Again, a much more robust peer review process. <a href="../../../f/e/c/User%7EFeco_e36a.html" title="User:Feco">Feco</a> 12:46, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, this article needs major NPOVing. I was flabbergasted and alarmed by some of the entries. One such example, the destruction of Persepolis was based on two things - the Greek soldiers in Alexander's army wanting revenge for the Persian destruction of Athens in 480 BCE, and secondly Alexander at that stage of the campaign had not yet become sole ruler of the Persian lands and decided to burn the city in case the remnants of the Persian army was able to retake their capital. Alexander later regretted his actions after the Persian king was murdered. The word Genocide implies that Alexander deliberately set out to kill every Persian yet as we all know he adopted Persian customs and encouraged his soldiers to marry Persians. This to me doesnt sound like a deliberate campaign of genocide. None of this is mentioned in the article. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 04:22, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is a FACTUAL description of a company with relationships with some of the world's largest sports retailers. "Top Sites" is put in parentheses because Sports Internet Destination! describes its search engines as indexing top sports sites, this is descriptive not advertising. If objectionable, would rather remove that term. No basis for deleting entire article (which was not embellished or drawn out, kept matter of fact). Would welcome outside contributors to the article so that it evolves in Wikipedia as it should. Thank you so much for your consideration.

<li>This is a great forum, and we appreciate the feedback. We have the world's top (or close to top) search engines on our sites in 4 separate sports categories, and a diverse offering of top sports retailers, plus about 100 professionally written features, articles, full publications, etc -- we are a resource and information site. We want to be included in the fairest manner and will abide by all rules but are seeking fairness (our site is new but highly regarded). Posters on Wikipedia seem very intelligent, and I'm sure (hopeful) quite reasonable Thank you again very much. It is appreciated. (the above comment by author - moved by <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a>)</li>
<li>Last so as not to be overkill. Sports Internet Destination! is a strong resource site. It includes HSC Publications which has been around since 1996 and has comprehensive articles and full publications at the top or near the very top of comprehensive information for the entire sports collectibles industry, which is not a small industry. The Wikipedia posts citations mentioned below, those are topics for which Sports Internet Destination! has written detailed, comprehensive articles for those very topics, and the link is I believe appropriately maintained in the External Links section. The posts provide resource value to the Wikipedia community on major companies (and CEO's etc.) and the links are to fully developed articles, appropriately referenced, on those same topics. Hope that helps a little. We'll see how turns out. <i>(Moved yet another top-posted comment by the article's author.)</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Didn't post on top this time! Deleting sports shopping is unnecessary. Not only is sports shopping a significant topic area (the sports area is huge and sports gifts are very popular) but comparison shopping sites are a big thing and mention is made of quite a few choices to serve as a reference for the Wikipedia reader. I understand that people do not want advertising. I am new to this community but the criterion I would use is whether the content serves as a value to the Wikipedia reader, whether it provides useful resource infromation, and that is how our posts are written and do contain. I am not jealous of anyone else's contributions or posts, as long as they provide value to the Wikipedia reader that is all I care about!!!!!! (thanks for letting me vent, constructively). Alex</p>

<li>Hi. Even if this page does get deleted (and I hope it doesn't) we're going to continue to work hard in the Wikipedia community. I believe in the concept of community and shared standards, Wikipedia gets 80 million hits per day and has so many dedicated people. HSC, which was incorporated into Sports Internet Destination! has spent 9 years providing the best information available in the sports collectibles industry. We've been dedicated and we've stood the test of time. We need to learn your rules, but please if you agree work with us so that it is valuable for contributors to grow and learn and not just about punishment and deletion. Thanks.

<li><b>Delete</b>, Ariel, I say this with the greatest respect, but unless you can demonstrate that thousands of people *already* know your name, and present a credible case that some number of them would expect to find you in a general topic encyclopedia, you should not have a Wikipedia article under your own name. This is one of the basic Wikipedia policies.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>Thousands of people around the world actualy do know my name.I gave lectures in various places in NY including 770 Eastern Parkway (Chabad Lubavitch headquarters)which was live broadcast worldwide on 770live in English Hebrew and Russian in front of thousands people. Since it was created my website <a href="http://www.bostonchabad.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bostonchabad.com" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> was visited 10s of thousands of times by people from all over the world.It was mentioned on a number of other more popular sites.I was interviewed and profiled by <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Ford_6a4b.html" title="Luke Ford">Luke Ford</a> for example.My picture was in <a href="../../../m/a/a/Maariv.html" title="Maariv">Maariv</a> in the begining of November as well as in the archives of Beis Moshiach. Some of my activities are also mentioned on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad.html" title="Chabad">Chabad</a> Online COL.org.il and Chabad.info.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to my website stats many people look it up by searching for my name. There are articles in Wikipedia about contemporary people less famous than me . (comment left by <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriel_Sokolovsky_3ee1.html" title="User:Ariel Sokolovsky">User:Ariel Sokolovsky</a>)</p>

<li>They overlap, but they're not the same. <i>Dictablanda</i> was coined as a proper name in 1930s Spain w/r/t one administration and the application of the term was subsequently generalised to other similar regimes.

The question is whether it is an English word or it is used in expressions, kind of, quoting: "a nice Spanish neologism 'dictablanda'".<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 16:25, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>It is not used to <i>justify</i> some dictatorships, it is used to <i>describe</i> some dictatorships. The POV is your own. It is not a neologism unless you deny the existence of the quoted sources. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen-w_c1ef.html" title="User:Ben-w">Ben-w</a>

<li>Cool down. I am entitled to my POV, if it is not in the article. I do not deny these sources. I am questioning whether this term is in wide circulation.

<li>the English word is soft dictatorship: 740 english anguage google hits, as opposed to 273 for "dictablanda".

An example is this <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Nokia_products_e980.html" title="List of Nokia products">List of Nokia products</a> including links to Nokia products.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Saying we should delete all products as adverts is like saying we should delete all films as adverts. Or maybe merge all productions of Paramount pictures to one article.

<li>According to the article, it indicates release at the of the year, which is what I based my vote on. If its considered released now, thats a different matter entirely. For the record, I invoked the crystal ball rule,based on "unless they are as predictable as an astronomical event, or unless planning or preparation for the event is already in progress and the preparation itself merits encyclopedic inclusion." Release of a product from a company is not as predictable as an astronimical event, but may or may not be notable. An operating system update used by many, mnay, millions or a movie based on a book read by many, many, millions would certainly be notable. I'm not sure how notible a future release of a cell phone may be... So, since its out, its out. IXNAY on the crystal ball, OBE. <b>KEEP</b></li>
