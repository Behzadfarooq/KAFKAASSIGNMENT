<li><b>Comment</b> the original research lies in the interpretation of the cited source, Zordrac. Silly example: suppose I wanted to write an article about glowing angels in the sky. I could cite many documented examples of stargazing ('angel viewing') and identification of new stars ('angels').

<li>Perhaps you know better than I, Zordrac. Could you please point me to a definition of the term or an identification of the 'advocates' discussed in the article? I've been unable to find anything in any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. So Dan Blackham has found a passing mention of a different term - circumcision evangelism - in a J Med Ethics article, but that's all. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 13:01, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I'm not suggesting that it does, Gazpacho (though I personally disagree with some interpretation). The problem is one of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. How can one verify that circumcision advocacy is how the article describes it, and how can one verify that these persons are advocates? If nobody has made such an interpretation previously, it must be the opinion of the Wikipedia editor(s) -- clearly a novel view, and thus <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 13:01, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Contrary to what Jake alleged above, the dispute was whether the article should give an accurate attribution of where a doctor obtained his information. Dr Jesin's webpage <a href="http://www.drjesin.com/clinicMedicalBen.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.drjesin.com/clinicMedicalBen.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> is a copy of a Circlist webpage <a href="http://www.circlist.com/considering/medicalben.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.circlist.com/considering/medicalben.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. I felt it was essential that this was acknowledged. Jake, a member of Circlist, was determined to remove this evidence. When it appeared that this was faltering he changed ground and began arguing that the article was <i>original research</i>. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 11:30, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>It is a pity that you <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">assume bad faith</a> in your interpretation of events, Michael.

<ul>
<li>I am sorry that Jake has taken my summary of the dispute personally. I respect his right to his views and his right to advocate them. However, in this case there is a clear conflict of interest in being a member of Circlist and making every effort to remove information about this organisation from an article, even when he admitted that this information was correct.

<li><b>Comment</b> A Google search with "circumcision advocacy" in double quotes yielded 127 hits. One was used in an article in the Journal of Medical Ethics <a href="http://jme.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/28/1/10" class="external autonumber" title="http://jme.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/28/1/10" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. One article using this term was republished in Jake Waskett's own website <a href="http://www.circs.org/library/benatar2/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.circs.org/library/benatar2/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. Another group using a very similar term is <i>Advocating Circumcision Today</i> a Jewish group <a href="http://www.act-now.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.act-now.org/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. Usage of the term seemed divided between references to circumcision advocacy and anti-circumcision advocacy. Therefore as other commentators have said, it is a common enough term. As for the claim that no-one addressed the question of original research, this is just not true. <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gazpacho.html" title="Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a>, Zordrac and Squiddy all specifically argued against the notion that this article is original research. If there is something in the words <i>circumcision advocacy</i> that raise concerns, then a term should be sought that people feel more comfortable with. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 11:30, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>These three uses merely use the term in passing. They do not define it, nor do they identify any advocates. These latter are introduced by the article. The remainder of these hits are activist sites, not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and as you note, frequently refer to anti-circumcision advocacy. As for an alternative term, fine - let's use whatever <i>someone else has already used!</i> <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 11:58, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact that people use the term in passing and without defining it is evidence that they are using natural English and not a technical term that needs to be defined. The fact that the same language is used in activist sites is further evidence that it is part of the vocabulary of these groups, something that I would have no problem in noting in the article. However, this usage is not restricted to these groups. One example is in Rachel Gathercole's article on the Medicaid funding of circumcisions. She wrote: "Some circumcision advocates still contend that the surgery results in slightly fewer infant urinary tract infections, a possible decrease in incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, and the prevention of penile cancer." <a href="http://www.cirp.org/news/independentweekly06-12-02/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cirp.org/news/independentweekly06-12-02/" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> The term <i>circumcision advocate</i> is used quite naturally here in a newspape article. A Google search of <i>circumcision advocate</i> yielded about 1260 hits, and this is further evidence that the term is natural English and not some tecchnical term that has to be defined.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 11:55, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You said above that it yielded 127 hits. Now you're claiming ten times that number. Surely there must be a mistake? Anyway, there is a problem here in that you're saying that the term doesn't need to be defined yet the article defines it. How do you propose to remedy this? <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 12:47, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - Addressing the NOR question: it does not appear to me that searching for the specific term "circumcision advocacy" is enough to deny the existence of a large group of people who advocate for circumcision. Circumcision, oddly enough, is one of the most heated and contentious subjects on the internet. I always avoid these arguments because I frankly don't care one way or the other. However, I think that most people here know that there are pro- and anti-circumcisionists. Whatever name is chosen, the collection of information characterizing the views of each side only makes sense. And, honestly, it could be done much worse than this well-references, well-balanced article. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 13:11, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have noted that those arguing for keeping the article have argued the case at some length.

<dd>Use a dictionary definition of <i>advocacy</i> and apply this definition to tthe examples of those who have advocated circumcision. This would be source-based research, and is <b>strongly encouraged</b>, according to the policy.

<dd>As far as I can tell, Michael, it's a slippery slope. If it's okay to use dictionary definitions to create an article, what is to prevent anyone from creating anti-broccoli advocacy, as discussed on the talk page? The answer is nothing. It opens the door to any article coming into existence, just because the central term is an accurate use of language. That's original research, it's junk, and it devalues the rest of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 13:05, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jake, please note the civil tone that Slrubenstein uses. I do not see the subversiveness in using a dictiionary. I do not see that sourced-based research can be deemed to violate the "no original research" policy, or that it is a slippery slope. Please read <a href="../../../i/j/t/Ijtihad.html" title="Ijtihad">ijtihad</a> for an example of what can happen when a society deems certain approaches off-limits. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 19:56, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry if you felt my comments were uncivil, Michael, though I can't see how. I would agree - source-based research is not original by definition. But this article is not source-based. The central theme of the article is that there is such a thing as circumcision advocacy, that is consists of "social and political activity to promote it and ensure access and funding for circumcision" (though the introduction is better now, that's still implied), and that the various individuals listed in the article are advocating circumcision. All of these must be sourced in order to be verifiable. Sure, certain <i>facts</i> are sourced, but the interpretation of them as circumcision advocacy is not. This is the problem.</dd>
<dd>Imagine, if you will, a hypothetical book. Let's call it Bloggs' <i>Circumcision advocacy through the ages</i>. In it, Bloggs discusses advocacy at length, noting Morris, Schoen, and so on. Now when we cite Bloggs, it's a true source, because there is no interpretation. The reader can check Bloggs and readily see that these people are indeed identified as circumcision advocates. As it is, he's just got Wikipedia's word for it. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 21:21, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am troubled by the very nature of an article on "advocacy;" I think the topic itself is a POV. I know that people who have contributed to the article have tried very hard to conform to our NPOV policies, I am not accusing anyone of deliberate policy violation. But all the things that are good about the article, that address multiple points of view and place them within a larger NPOV context — in short, material I think has value — goes so far beyond the specific topic of advocacy, that I think it should all just go in one article on "circumcision." <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 16:55, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your comment. I feel that advocacy can be discussed, just as any other topic can be discussed. If we say that certain topics or even certain approaches are off-limits, this raises concerns about what is being said and what is left unsaid and why. For instance, if some things are left unsaid, whose interests does this serve and whose interests are discounted? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Glass_ccc6.html" title="User:Michael Glass">Michael Glass</a> 19:56, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with your general point; if we disagree it is in its application.

<p>For a start, this article is currently a mess, full of POV and factual errors, and would have to be completely rewritten no matter what.

<li>All of them. The first merely tells us that someone with a pseudonym claims to have played something called "darkwars" and tells us nothing about either. The second is a web directory listing on a self-submission web site (that is even <i>called</i> a "games directory"). The third is a banner advertisement collection that doesn't even mention Darkwars at all. And the fourth is an anonymous web discussion forum posting, a classic example of what is <i>not</i> a reliable source, that tells us to "ask mickey he shud be in first page of world ranks and he wil teach you how to play it".

It seems that the web site in question is guilty of link spam. Nonetheless, I don't think that abuse such as that from Uncle G is really required.

<li><b>Keep.</b> What else are we to do with this information? Any general-interest reference that discusses classical music contains this information -- it is not mere talk page content. It is not suitable for a template. It should not be duplicated in each of the era-specific articles. There is a need to link to it from each of the era-specific articles. And while it could be merged into <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_classical_music.html" title="European classical music">European classical music</a> and linked as a subhead, that article is already lengthy and such an exposition is unlikely to survive there. I would like to note that I have not participated in the aforementioned edit war, but rather I stumbled upon it because I've been watching the affected page for link spam. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 21:05, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>! - I was quite amused when I stumbled across this entry. Being a student of USYD myself, it was interesting to see a wikipedia article on this, shall I say, infamous character and I think I would be one of the better suited people here to comment on the topic. David Perkis caused a lot of controversy with some of his writings and more importantly his reaction to critics &amp; most people on this campus and others in Sydney would actually know who he was if you asked them. That is certainly a notable achievement in my books! I may not agree with his views but the fact that one person could become so well known throughout the university deserves an entry here IMO. If you look at the google australia website you'll see he is mentioned on quite a number of veritable sites (govt, political and educational). I heard that the university actually retracted his articles from their online publication after some of the events covered in his wiki-biography. Anyway, he has become somewhat of an infamous character here in Sydney and I'm sure most people who have heard of him in Sydney would agree that this is a definite keep! <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Grady_0b65.html" title="User:Kevin Grady">Kevin_Grady</a></li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. It seems to be a well-written, reasonably balanced article about somebody who has at least some local notability, according to the last writer here. That's probably still a bit short of normal notability standards, but I hate to see an article of reasonable quality just deleted... it doesn't seem to be the usual vanity junk. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 02:03, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - As the writer of the entry in question, I thought it would contribute to the debate if I presented the relevant information regarding the article's notability. Apologies in advance for the lengh of my post, but I feel that it is necessary in order to explain the notability of the individual written about and as to why it should remain on the site. I actually met David Perkis at a writing seminar held at the University of Sydney campus at the beginning of this year. Needless to say I become reasonably well acquainted with Mr. Perkis because he was certainly an intriguing character - he was definitely intelligent, but more noticeable was his outspoken nature. He openly stated his views to all people he encountered (even those who did not ask about them), and was not afraid to share his beliefs. What was also interesting was the fact that, in spite of his young age, he had already attracted people who I could only classify as serious followers of his unique convictions. I had the chance to get to know Mr. Perkis reasonably well over the period of a month and a half or so and during that time he showed some of his works to me. And it was quite evident that it wasn't just a matter of vanity - he actually seemed to firmly believe that his political views were pivotal for others to consider for the "benefit of society", as he put it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, as I attend <a href="../../../u/n/s/UNSW_d506.html" title="UNSW">UNSW</a>, I lost contact with him afterwards and not subscribing to his set of beliefs, I didn't seek him out any further. Then, about two or three months later, I started hearing about him from all different directions. A large amount of people on the UNSW campus were talking about him on a pretty grand scale, in spite of the fact that he attended USYD (an institution with which UNSW has what would best be described as a heated academic rivalry). Friends of mine, who did not know that I had ever met Mr. Perkis, had asked me if I heard about "that David Perkis guy", based on the controversy he was stirring up. Apart from his writings and the actions I wrote about in the wiki-entry, he had gotten into arguments with several high-level lecturers and actually developed quite a firm following at his university campus (not to mention sympathisers at UNSW). To put this into perspective, USYD has close to 50,000 attendees and UNSW has about 40,000. I have spoken to many people about Mr. Perkis following the events which took place, and it would not be excessive to estimate that an amount of people equal to at least 10% of attendees from both campuses have heard about him and his exploits, and a far higher percentage in the humanities and politics-related faculties relevant to his activities. That in itself would constitute in excess of 10,000 people who would have come to know about Mr. Perkis to a large extent in the past year or so (including those who attend other universities in the area and have heard about him). I completely agree with the USYD poster on this discussion when he said that Mr. Perkis attracted quite a lot of attention from his works, but it was largely a result of his actions that gained him his notoriety.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I took it upon myself to research more information about Mr. Perkis and write what I see as a well-presented and accurate wikipedia entry, due to the fact that some topics relating to Australian academia have been largely neglected on this website. With such a large volume of people having heard about a single person based on his beliefs and actions would alone constitute an entry into wikipedia, and so I definitely think that the David Perkis article merits a "keep" on the website. I hope my explanation above has convinced others that this is true. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorneliuSnrub_3524.html" title="User:CorneliuSnrub">Cornelius S</a> 06:00, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's not a matter of whether we believe you or not. We still need some independant and verifiable evidence of notablity. Where did this controversy happen? Where was it reported? Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenAveling_8f0b.html" title="User:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a></li>
<li>I never claimed it was about whether you "believed" me or not. I simply wrote my side of the story to display more information regarding the notability of the person in question. I only joined a few days ago.. so what? I've been busy with university all year and haven't had the time to do any entries up until now. The fact that I've managed to construct what I see as two good quality entries in a few days is quite a good achievement in my books and shows the amount of entries I intend (or intended) to add to this site - not everyone has a multitude of free time on their hands to write entries all year. I thought that if I started writing now during my holidays that I would gradually be able to build up my level of work because it <i>does</i> take time to research and write wikipedia entries. I thought that the fact that Perkis is mentioned on sources such as an official Australian government website, a leading member of Australian parliament's website, the university itself's website, the old and highly notable school he attended's website and various other official state educational institution sites (not to mention the online version of Perkis's work that I could find in the short space of 2 days) would provde "independant and verifiable evidence of notablity", as you put it. Obviously not it seems and so I am attempting to find more sources... University controversies aren't generally published on the internet. Do you really think the USYD would want that type of publicity?</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that you would also describe a Mathematics PhD. who has had his postdoctoral work published in at least 3 different countries in numerous advanced mathematics and physics journals thus far as "a not clearly notable school teacher" speaks volumes to your ability for discernment, in my opinion. Also, what are you implying by posting the other user's IP address and his date of registration? I emailed my peers the links to the entries I made and asked them for their comments and to pass them onto anyone who knows of these two people as there would surely be a large amount of those in study circles that would. The fact that you are <i>clearly</i> implying something more nefarious again is extremely insulting - perhaps you should consider reading about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" rel="nofollow">not biting the newcomers</a>and to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" rel="nofollow">assuming good faith</a> before you bash a newbie who was just trying to add what he saw as relvant additional entries to wikipedia, and accuse him of all sorts of things. It's disheartening to see the level of attacks you have written and implied in your last posts for something which I thought would be trivial at best. If I had known that I would be personally attacked like you have done then I clearly wouldn't have bothered putting in the hours of work necessary to construct wikipedia entries in the first place.<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorneliuSnrub_3524.html" title="User:CorneliuSnrub">Cornelius S</a></p>

<li>It's a perfectly fine <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> article. This nomination is the result of a slow burning revert war at <a href="../../../d/e/s/DES_80ac.html" title="DES">DES</a> with <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">Matt Crypto</a> on one side, who asserts that this should be a primary topic disambiguation with <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data_Encryption_Standard_9913.html" title="Data Encryption Standard">Data Encryption Standard</a> as the primary topic, and several editors on the other side who believe that this should be an equal weight disambiguation, since when they came to look up <a href="../../../d/e/s/DES_80ac.html" title="DES">DES</a> they were looking for the drug. It has been discussed, but not resolved, on <a href="../../../d/e/s/Talk%7EDES_fe10.html" title="Talk:DES">Talk:DES</a>. Furthermore, the choice between the two forms of disambiguation is a simple matter of whether <a href="../../../d/e/s/DES_80ac.html" title="DES">DES</a> redirects to <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data_Encryption_Standard_9913.html" title="Data Encryption Standard">Data Encryption Standard</a> or to <a href="../../../d/e/s/DES_%28disambiguation%29_b4d7.html" title="DES (disambiguation)">DES (disambiguation)</a>. Deletion is not involved at any stage, and AFD is not the place for deciding this. Please learn how to use <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>. I am strongly tempted to close this discussion, and take measures to encourage both sides to resume the discussion on <a href="../../../d/e/s/Talk%7EDES_fe10.html" title="Talk:DES">Talk:DES</a> that they have abandoned. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:00, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

The disambig is appropriate. Don't assume that just because <i>you</i> wouldn't search for the drug, that everyone else wouldn't either. "Data Encryption Standard" and "Diethylstilbestrol" get about equal hits on google. It's an acronym commonly used to describe both things, and to arbitrarily assign importance of one over the other is probably not <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 16:09, 3 December 2005 (UTC).

<li>First: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">Wikipedia:Requested moves</a> involves deletion, too.

Fourth: Redirecting the undisambiguated title to the "X (disambiguation)" article is a common means of setting up an equal weight disambiguation, and doesn't "waste time and resources".

<p>The title of the article is U.S.-centric. The article describes the <i>Presidential election of the United States in 1828</i>. As I suspect most editors will agree, there were many elections in 1828, and not all of them took place in the U.S. Thus, to have a single article titled "Election of 1828", and to have it speak of the U.S. Presidential Election of 1828 as though it were <b>the</b> election of 1828, is disrepectful to our international brethren and sistren. Aside from which, the contents of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election_of_1828.html" title="Election of 1828">Election of 1828</a> largely duplicate the contents of <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1828_3ab7.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1828">U.S. presidential election, 1828</a>. → <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extreme_Unction_b4bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extreme Unction">blah</a></sub></font>} 16:18, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> ∾ It seems that there are several of these "Election of $YEAR" articles, some of which have been redirected to "U.S. presidential election, $YEAR". I find these redirects to suffer from the same U.S.-centric problems as the articles themselves. So, at the suggestion of <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a>, I'm going to track these rascals down and make disambiguation pages out of them, starting with the page which prompted this AfD in the first place. → <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extreme_Unction_b4bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extreme Unction">blah</a></sub></font>} 16:33, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Disambiguate</b>. If there were other notable elections in 1828 (and I'm sure there were, I just don't know if we have articles on them) then make <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election_of_1828.html" title="Election of 1828">Election of 1828</a> into a disambig page describing and linking these elections. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 16:35, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Does it make sense to create a disambiguation page if there is only a single relevant article? This is not a relevant article since it's about an election which already has an article, so I would say <b>Delete</b>. Kreydon 16:44, 3 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am indeed having difficulty finding comparable articles about other elections in the stated year, and begin to lean more towards your view. There's no point in creating a disambiguation page if there is no ambiguity to disambiguate. → <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extreme_Unction_b4bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extreme Unction">blah</a></sub></font>} 16:50, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> ∾ As a further comment, I have found similar pages at <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election_of_1796.html" title="Election of 1796">Election of 1796</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election_of_1824.html" title="Election of 1824">Election of 1824</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election_of_1860.html" title="Election of 1860">Election of 1860</a>, and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election_of_1948.html" title="Election of 1948">Election of 1948</a>. Of those pages, only <a href="../../../e/l/e/Election_of_1796.html" title="Election of 1796">Election of 1796</a> required minor disambiguation. The other pages have no ambiguity to disambiguate as far as I can discover, and are currently serving as redirects to <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1824_9c39.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1824">U.S. presidential election, 1824</a>, <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1860_5d52.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1860">U.S. presidential election, 1860</a>, and <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1948_432c.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1948">U.S. presidential election, 1948</a>, respectively. → <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extreme_Unction_b4bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extreme Unction">blah</a></sub></font>} 17:42, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Can't that go into <i>US election of $BODY in $YEAR</i>? This is en.wikipedia, not wikipedia.us! 82.26.160.214 18:40, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. In its present form the article can't be kept because this is English-language Wikipedia, not US wikipedia and there is a better duplicate in the proper place. People would search for, say, <i>1828 US Presidential Election</i> or <i>1828 British Parliamentary Election</i>. <i>Election of 1828</i> is a particuliarly clumsy page title. Election of <i>what</i>? <a href="../../../i/f/f/Iff.html" title="Iff">Iff</a> another election of a head of government or parliament took place in 1828 it can always be turned into a disambiguation page. <s>82.26.160.214</s> <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 18:34, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If we have articles on other elections held in that year, it should be moved to Elections of 1828 and used as a disambiguation. If not, it should redirect to the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1828_3ab7.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1828">U.S. presidential election, 1828</a> article until such time as we do have articles. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 19:43, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Comparing the two articles, the non-nominated article is far more advanced. The nominated article should be deleted, but without a redirect due to the US-centric concerns above. Then rename the balce of the articles using the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1824_9c39.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1824">U.S. presidential election, 1824</a> format. <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 20:07, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Disambiguate</b> if there's something to disambiguate between, otherwise delete. Redirecting a general election article to a US presidential one is POV. Redirects should point to what users are looking for and you can't assume the election they're looking for is the US presidential one. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:13, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>.

Jake...P.S. I could have all of you..because I've got Shaan as back up. Im 6ft 4 inches tall and very sexy. I also wrote an incredibly well informed essay on Marvell and Duffy relating to the imagery evoked by these poets. This means that not only am I a very good footballer but I can also speak very good english compared to the rest of America who are incredulously stupid. And by the way...colour is spelt with a U as is favoUr, and no not all Muslims are terrorists you stupid country...and if you would like to read the rest of my essay ( i am aware they may be some words you do not understand if you have been born in America) then you will have to keep my entry so that I send you the rest.

<li>Capitalroadster, though we disagree, you've stated your opinion eloquently and referenced the guidelines. I'm glad to see snottiness is not the culture around here, but isolated to a few souls. I've made a an account for myself. Cheers. SnyGuy

<li>Thanks. I assume that you are the author. Please sign yourself with 4 tildes (~~~~) at the end so that we know who you are. As you have already voted here, you can't vote again. It is unfortunate that a lot of people are suspicious of new users at present. I hope that you continue to contribute, and even if this is deleted, that you are not disheartened, and that you continue to try to have a go. Why not try to add to existing articles? It is a lot safer, and less likely to raise questions about you. Consider following redlinks and create articles that are requested to be created rather than creating your own, at least for a while. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 09:43, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Comment: Is it really necessary to make a separate section to accuse someone of sock puppetry? Sock puppetry is supposed to be when someone is impersonating someone else. I see no evidence of this. This is just someone who has yet to make an account. That's not sock puppetry. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 09:36, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have deleted the header "Sockpuppet votes" since the accusation does not appear to be supported by the facts.

This original, URL based entry was made by someone who is not familiar with Wikipedia articles and I guess I am also at fault as I should have simply changed the name of this article. I would hope not to have caused offence or be thought of as creating link spam, this is certainly not the intention. Last Thursday is a new socio-business network which is growing very rapidly within the UK and Europe. We encourage our users to make use of direct linking to Wikipedia (which we provide a markup tool to allow for simple link creation) when creating their blogs and articles within the site to help promote Wikipedia as a reference tool to many who are not otherwise familiar with it. 10:48 (UTC) 5 December 2005</li>

I believe it's against wikipedia rules, to vote it into deletion just because it's "too short" or wrong language: we want to give it a chance and the current procedure is to allow 2 full weeks for translation. After it's been partially translated and worked upon, it no longer quite fits the description of the nominator, I don't think.

<li><b>Keep</b> and send to <b>Cleanup</b>. Wow, this is really really far from patent nonsense. A quick Google shows that Marv Wiesberg has published several books and appears to referenced in the field. Granted, the article is not <i>about</i> Marv Wiesberg. However, a shorter clearer version of the Wiesberg Model might reasonably be included in a bio of Wiesberg. Also, IMO this is clearly not original research, it is a synopsis of an existing methodology that appears to have at least some notability in the Org Dev field. It reads a little like an essay because it's a bad article, but it's not. It being NOT original research, I challenge to prove lack of notability for Wiesberg (which he may not be, I don't know.) Otherwise, keep and cleanup. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:52, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This article scarcel mentions Marv Weisbord who has written a couple of books on management theory see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787971170/103-9911391-0479000?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787971170/103-9911391-0479000?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>. At the bottom of the article, it states: Written by Tanim Chowdhury, California State University, Northridge. I haven't been able to track this down so the chances are that it is more likely that Tanim Chowdbury is the author. I will vote <b>Delete</b> for this article and request that Marv Weisbord be added to the list of requested articles. I would vote <b>Keep</b> for a decent stub or better of Weisbord. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 08:50, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well if one follows the link to Shaver's blog, one would find plenty of references to a Beltzner, which definitely contradicts the grounds for the deletion nomination, i.e. it's an attack.

<p>This nomination has more to do with verifiability than with notability. <i>If</i> the contents of the article are true, then the subject is (IMHO) notable and worthy of inclusion. The problem is: I can't verify the contents of the article. Googling on "Moshe Dwek" returns only four hits, none related to the article's topic. Googling on the alternate spelling of "Moshe Douek" returns only two hits, neither related to the article's topic. The news link provided within the article directs to a webpage that is written in Hebrew, and to a newscast that is spoken in Hebrew. The Geocities link simply has a picture with some Hebrew script. And the Jewish Virtual Library link mentions the hand-grenade incident, but doesn't name the perpetrator of the incident. I'm hoping that someone with greater google-fu than I — perhaps one of our brethren or sistren interested in Israeli history and politics — might shed further light on this subject. → <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extreme_Unction_b4bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extreme Unction">blah</a></sub></font>} 13:59, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>C</b>onditional delete. The incident probably happened, but there is no support that Dwek was the perpetrator, and the walla.co.il page is not about Dwek - it just blogs all the minuscule parties from Israel's turbulent political history. One chap (whose email address is listed) asks what happened to Dwek (דואק) and his party Tarshish (תרשיש), which means Tyre or Tarsus. I find it hard to believe there is no record available of a convicted felon starting a political party.

<li><b>Keep</b> After looking up the Hebrew word for <i>hand grenade</i> (somehow I missed that one all these years), I read the <a href="http://www.nrg.co.il/online/archive/ART/401/237.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nrg.co.il/online/archive/ART/401/237.html" rel="nofollow">story above</a>, and yes, it does in fact verify that Dwek threw the grenade, started his own party Tarshish, and somehow got 700 votes. (I also found a few other places which confirmed these facts, all of them thogh in Hebrew). I've been trying to find an English language site which mentioned Dwek's name for hours and come up with nothing. Also the Hebrew wikipedia site does mention Dwek and the grenade on <a href="http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%95%D7%90%D7%A7" class="external text" title="http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%95%D7%90%D7%A7" rel="nofollow">his page</a> as well as on the page of <a href="http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90" class="external text" title="http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90" rel="nofollow">one of the ministers who was injured in the attack</a>.

<p>I believe you are all showing your intense bias by choosing to decide that NNK is 'vidgame (sic) slackers'. The cut and paste, by the way, is from their official website.</p>
<p>I'd speculate that online affiliations of reasonable reknown should be afforded the same status as obscure roads in Massachusetts and Tiffany discographies. But perhaps that's my inner slacker speaking out of place.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, go ahead delete it - but I do know that this term has been used in the same context it has been addressed in the article. It has been the topic for debate across conspiracy forums. In any case I can't argue your statement, I was actually expecting this day to come, seeing as I don't have enough online evidence to submit it's notability just yet. However please bear in mind that there are many more articles within the "conspiracy theory" and "secret society" categories that have no links or even elements to source it, not to mention hardly anything written about them. An example of this could be found at Illuminus, just to name one.

<li>Hi, I understand all the above (and below) statements regarding the lack of verification for such a term related tot he existence of this "purported" secret society - however I feel insulted (and this was the purpose for my reason of keeping the article) that some people would simply write the article off as gibberish or ""fabrication" when I have attempted to put into words all that I do know or have read and been told of this secret alliance. I do realise that this article is probably not entirely in keeping with the Wikipedia guidelines, and this is why my initial comment was to delete if everyone thought it was truly not worthy. But again I digress, that there are many more articles related to conspiracy and secret societies with less information and sources than this one. This is what I tried pointing out with my first comment. In any case I will attempt to continue my search on finding further information and possibly sources that will help verify this article, but do remember that this is if anything a secret society - and as far as I know most secret societies like to be kept secret otherwise they defy their purpose. The only reason we know of Freemasonry and the supposed Illuminati (which is still debatable and highly conceptual in my opinion) is because millions of people have discussed them in relation to common problems and events in today's world. If you want to find out more about this article or continue any discussion relating to these areas please don't hesitate to contribute to my talk page. In nay case thanks for your interest <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a>.

<li>You correctly understood that the main issue here is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. "Gibberish" and "fabrication" don't refer to you. There is no reason not to believe that you honestly collected bits and pieces of what you've heard about this. But this does not preclude the fact that you wqere collecting gibberish. In wikipedia, only <b>reputable</b> works are legitimate source of verification. The only reason we have an article about Freemasonry is precisely because millions of people spoke of them and then <b>reputable and trained</b> historians wrote about them.

In this case it is not clear cut, and this debate should be a discussion as to whether his established claims of notoriety are sufficiently notable to warrant encyclopaedic value. This will be up to an individual to decide. In my opinion, being 4 times awarded as the most outstanding teacher, in a period of 12 years, is a notable achievement. I have some knowledge of just how difficult it is to get such awards. Ergo, I encourage voters to vote for a keep.

I have heard of this project, and I believe it is along the lines of writing a novel really quickly. However, as far as I can tell the winner is just someone who manages to write an entire 500 page novel in a month. If its more than that, and she actually managed to win something, then it might be a claim to notoriety.

<li>NaNoWriMo is where people get together once every November and try to write a 50,000 word novel in 30 days. In my opinion it doesn't qualify as a claim to notoriety - the contest is not monitored (it is technically possible to "win" by just pasting your name in a Word doc 50,000 times and submitting it, and some people actually do game the system like this), and you do not "win" anything except the satisfaction and pride of having written a novel in a month. It is a great project and a ton of fun, but in my opinion a NaNo win is not enough to establish notability on its own. -- Saikiri<a href="../../../s/a/i/User_talk%7ESaikiri_eb5a.html" title="User talk:Saikiri">~</a> 12:05, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There aren't 11,500 Google hits, there are "approximately" 11,500 Google hits. In practice this translates to just <b>334</b> unique pages. And the vast majority of <i>those</i>, if you actually look at them, have no meaningful content - they're just nonsense like "Jennifer irvin winnie the pooh bassinet glory foods <b>spongebob squarepants collapse</b> route 5 elisabeth shoe".

<li><b>Comment</b>: I did not research notability, but it clearly states what it's for in the first sentence.

<li><b>Comment</b> It says it's <i>an easy to use framework for ...</i> (with ellipsis) which isn't much help for a non-specialist.

<p>"This latter definition has been adopted in the relevant Wikipedia articles, including this one," says the article, thus taking sides on the controversial question of the definition of "traditionalist Catholic". Such a point-of-view article is inadmissible in Wikipedia, and should be eliminated.</p>
<p>In addition, the article says that "using the 'wrong' term can cause considerable irritation or offence." Thus, by its own admission, this article, which is mainly about the "wrong" or insulting terms, is almost bound to cause considerable irritation and offence, and should be eliminated.</p>

Regardless, the concept of "terminology used in the Traditionalist Catholic debate" doesn't strike me as something that an encyclopedia article can actually be written about, and I don't think anything much more than a redirect begins at a page whose title begins with "terminology". <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 04:57, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Keep" How complete does Wikipedia want to become? This page has a rather detailed account of one episode. The main page has a terse summary of each episode, and links to pages for details on each episode. If you want to delete this, because "It's just a TV show", then you'd have to delete ALL episode detail entries from all TV series information, including all star treks, all MASH, etc. Not that that's wrong, or a bad policy, but if that is to be the policy, then you should make that the policy. (I do not know what the procedure is for determining Wikipedia policy). As long as that is not the policy, I see no reason for this page to be deleted. In other words: If "No episode details" is the policy, then delete this page for not meeting the policy. If that's not the policy, keep this page.
<ul>
<li>This article is more suited for www.tv.com or similar site than Wikipedia because the detail is overwhelming. <b>Trim and merge</b> as <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiaolin_Showdown_9cb1.html" title="Xiaolin Showdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a> is not as notable as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a>, <a href="../../../m/2A/a/M_A_S_H_b852.html" title="M*A*S*H">M*A*S*H</a>, or <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twilight_Zone_34eb.html" title="Twilight Zone">Twilight Zone</a> and even they don't go into all the detail as presented in the article in question. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 08:38, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It should also be noted that when this article was put up for deletion it was a mere sentence long (maybe two) summary of the episode. Even as it stands, I would argue that this has little place in an encyclopedia. How many encyclopedias have you found with detailed descriptions of television programming. The show itself is probably deserving of an entry, but each episode does 'not' need individual entries. The same should go for any television show, with the exception of extraordinarily important or ground-breaking episodes, IMO. Bryanmckay 20:22, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The title of the article starts with "The Fictional..", which I think sort of sums it up. I at first thought these "Fictional" islands must be from the universe of some TV show or movie, but no mention is made or reference given to this effect. I'm at a loss.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This was a hoax perpetrated by User:Influenceuh in edits to several articles concerning Oceania. There's even a map. When I challenged him he wrote "We aren't going to allow your pedestrian geographic expertise to obstruct our legitimate work. This is years of research come to life!" on my talk page. The "Fictional" was added by another editor--there was a little rename war going on there for a bit. (See also Mauristemo and Southern Mauristemo Islands, which now redirect to this article.) There are most definitely no such islands. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 03:28, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - Non-encyclopedic. Barely over the user count minimum, and a poor Alexa rating, spells delete this subsubsubsubstub. The essential problem with pages like is this, there is absolutely nothing to expand because there's nothing encyclopedic to say about the site. There is no suggestion that this site has influenced a wider audience or that it is anything more than a chat page. Beyond the (POV, I will note) "friendly place to chat" - what are you going to say about this site? List all the moderators? All the forums?

<li><b>Delete</b>... not really much point in having articles about web forums unless there's something notable to say about them. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 16:11, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This highlights one of the things that is wrong with the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria: An inclusion criterion of "has M or more members" yields a <i>discussion forum directory</i>, with many entries that can never be more than "X is a discussion forum. Domain name: D. Number of members claimed: N.", not an encyclopaedia. (This is just the same process that yields a <i>business directory</i>, not an encyclopaedia, when inclusion criteria for companies include things like "has N or more employees".)
<p>Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that the forum actually has the number of members stated, any more than Wikipedia actually has the number of editors that <a href="../../../s/t/a/Special%7EStatistics_969e.html" title="Special:Statistics">Special:Statistics</a> states. (Consider people who create one-off vandalism accounts, for example.)</p>
<p>The best criterion to employ is whether anyone else, wholly independent of the subject, has found it notable enough that they have gone to the effort of publishing non-trivial works of their own that are about it. For <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a>, for example, one will find independently written and published FAQs, guides, papers in conference proceedings, and a large number of books. Searching, I find <i>nothing</i> like that for this subject. Indeed, the web site appears not to even have an "about" page <i>of its own</i>. Anything in this article beyond a mere directory entry, of the form described, would be <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>.

This was only meant as a history of a 83 year old company with an intersting history of how it came about. I did not go into the history as much as I should have but I also did not want it to appear as though this was an advertisement. I have read the tutorial and first article pages. Can either of the people who put this up for deletion expound on their thoughts. I could go into how we are a $10 million dollar company which by PIA(Printing Industry of America)standards this is considered a rather large company. Just not sure what is stepping across the line or how to correct what editors don't like about this so to get this reinstated.
<ul>
<li>I was the (single) person who originally nominated this for AfD. It's not been deleted yet; we're still discussing it. If a majority disagree with me, the AfD tag will be removed and it won't get deleted. For what it's worth, I didn't think it was spam or advertisement-like... I just didn't think the company was notable enough to warrant an encyclopedia article. I don't believe that there are any hard-and-fast rules about how large a company has to be to warrant notability on size alone, so this could be open for debate. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 15:23, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you for feedback. I have added some more historical information on the page. That is why I feel that it warrants consideration. It is an 83 year old company that is connected to a 127 year old company(Goes Litho). Historically there are not a lot of companies that are that old that are still under their original name. Especially ones that sold something that is collectible at this point or were the largest legal form publishers in the state of Tx. We also are not just of local interest but have sold regionally with the Goes borders and sell nationally in all 50 states as well as internationally into Mexico and Canada. I just felt like that in this country it is important for us to keep a historical reference of companies that have been through the Depression, all of the World Wars and all the other historical times that businesses have had to withstand and succeed. Let me know if there would be anything else you would like to see on the page.

<li>I think your prior reference to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is well-made, though that is a <i>proposal</i> that many editors have commented on as being too restrictive.

It seems to me that all of the statements in the article <i>can</i> be verified.

<li><b>Comment</b> - And how is anyone supposed to know an article is verifiable without veritying it? I'll just note that the first paragraph of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> says, "editors should cite credible sources so that their edits can be easily verified by readers and other editors." I think it is unfair to put the onus of <b>finding</b> verifying sources on the reader. I think it is lazy and sloppy, and un-Wiki, to write an article without including sources. I'll continue to vote against any article that doesn't cite credible sources. If such sources are added, I'll reconsider my vote. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Dalbury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 23:38, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

As far as the being the largest legal form publisher in Tx it was common knowledge to attorneys in the state in that time period who was the source for federal bankruptcy kits and legal form blanks. I do know the only other legal form publishers in TX were Pound Printing &amp; Martin's Stationery(Will Odee stole their customer list). Neither are in existence any longer. The reason I know about Martin's is my grandfather was robert martin and that is also how I knew the history on Will Odee. We were several times the size of Martin's and Pound Printing and they actually had us print many of their forms due to our equipment being larger. The problem with private old companies is records are not kept that long. Knowledge is passed down by generations and my grandparents are long since gone. My father and mother are still alive and could verify all that I have said but I'm not sure how that applies to the rules. It has been a very important company at times for the legal and financial(stock) community but I'm not sure what verification I can give you beyond what I have offered. Please feel free to tell me if any of these ideas would suffice. Thanks for your consideration.</dd>

<li>Here is a link to a conference I spoke at: www.pinc.org/vault/FallCon_2003.pdf (Printing Industry conference for California printers) I am on there under panelist. This doesn't again give you any historical reference on The Odee Company but establishes me as somewhat industry expert. I could have Joe Polanco President of PIA MIDAmerica(Printing Industries of America)verify that we have been around for many years although he is not old enough to have seen us in 1923. He could tell about us selling legal forms and being the supplier for Goes borders in the 7 state region for as long as he has been associated with the printing business. Any articles that we have been written in would be long gone from years ago. If you have another person from a company that we have been long associated with verify some of this info(Goes Litho) and you have an industry representative from PIA Mid America(Joe Polanco)tell you what he knows and I have shown via this link that I have been sought after to be a panelist for a printers conference does that not suffice to prove that I am what I say I am? Let me know if there is something else I can help with. Thanks, Buzz</li>

<li>For the fourth time: <i>Counting Google hits is not research</i>. For the reasons explained on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Wikipedia:Google test</a>, the Google test is useless as any sort of metric when it comes to people in the Internet pornography industry.

But bear in mind that the purported biographies that accompany the pictures on pornography web sites or in magazines are almost always made up. All that you have cited so far are three advertisements, one of which even explicitly describes itself as an "Advertising Come-On".

<li>Zordrac, I sincerely doubt that Uncle G is making a personal attack against you -- he is only being matter-of-fact. And, unfortunately, he is correct in saying that the Google test is sketchy at best and shouldn't be used as the sole <a href="../../../l/i/t/Litmus_test.html" title="Litmus test">litmus test</a> to determine the notability of pornographic personalities. For the record, Google bombing (or search-enginge bombing in general) is a common phenomenon by producers and distributors of pornography -- unsurprising, given that many technologies such as <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_on_demand.html" title="Video on demand">video on demand</a> are first accepted by the pornographic industry prior to the "mainstream" industries. (Side note: I would wager that if Hollywood were to Google bomb as well, we would have the same problem in determining the notability of actors, actresses and even productions.) Anyway, don't take any comments personally and take them as constructive critism (or new lessons as a Wikipedian). -- <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Beaudoin_Jr._f03b.html" title="User:Joe Beaudoin Jr.">Joe Beaudoin Jr.</a> <sup style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoe_Beaudoin_Jr._eb69.html" title="User talk:Joe Beaudoin Jr.">Think out loud</a></sup> 05:02, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Its not used as the sole test, it is used as a factor. If you'd been following my votes, you'd know that. And the Google test is a legitimate method described in Wikipedia guidelines to determine an article's notoriety. So telling me that I am not allowed to use it is silly and just plain nasty, especially if it is done 4 or 5 times in increasingly nasty ways. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 05:47, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article cites no sources of biographical information that can be used to verify the article.

The widespread advertising and <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlebombing.html" title="Googlebombing">Googlebombing</a> employed by the industry in which this person purportedly works makes it impossible to locate actual sources of biographical information after the fact. If someone has published a magazine feature article, a news article, a book, a documentary, or some other non-trivial work about this person herself that doesn't amount to a simple catalogue entry, it is impossible to find. (Wikipedia is not a simple catalogue of people. It is not a Yellow Pages or a telephone directory.) And there are no audience figures for the works in which this person may have appeared.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have rewritten most of the article, including links, I think I have 10 independent reviews in there, and so forth. Most of the links are pornographic however so I am not sure of the protocol for that. I could find absolutely nothing that suggests that she is not <a href="../../../t/a/w/Tawnee_Stone_39af.html" title="Tawnee Stone">Tawnee Stone</a>'s sister. Every single place said that they were sisters. However, given that there are videos of them having sex with each other, and they are frequently displayed together on web sites, it seems likely that they are not really sisters, and that it is merely being used for the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a> angle. The fact that she charges US $35/mth for a soft porn web site with only herself in there and no bonus extras to me says a lot. Average price for full on porn sites is something in the order of US $15-$25, with 100s of models. For her to charge that much by herself, well, only the very best do that. Ergo, significant claims to notoriety. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 21:17, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. She apparently "entered the business" about May, 2005 (according to the article) and she is "notable" 7 months later? Why? Just because the industry has cranked up the PR machinery and generated a ton of links? Not verifiable!

<li>Sorry, "PR" means public relations (a form of marketing) but the term "marketing" might have been a better choice anyway since marketing would include the website creation and the various search engine optimization (SEO) techniques that they use to blanket the Internet so that someone who, by July 2005 "produced <i>\'15 solo pictorial sets</i>, as well as 10 videos, of <i>combined length approx 30-40 minutes</i>" (per the article) causes editors to fall over themselves in a rush to label her notable. As you can tell from my comments, I am amazed that so many people fall for this. Hype is hype, regardless of the industry, and I can't understand why we lower the notability bar so low. There are certainly notable porn stars but I find it hard to believe that this is one of them. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 23:40, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Tawnee hasn't even done all that much work herself; however, I have seen many photos and videos of her, and only very very few of the two of the them together, and even less of her "sister" alone.

<li><b>Delete</b>, since there's nothing to merge.

<li>Just a comment here (and I know I am asking for trouble by doing this) but why do you say "incapable of expansion"?

<li>Could it be that the recently registered author bought the keyword "wicked laser" from Google and is related to the webshop that prominently advertises <i>532 nm lasers with 100 and 125 mW output power</i> on its top page?

<li><b>Comment</b>: It seems to be the name used by a company in China to market powerful lasers; hence, it is more of a product name (perhaps trademarked?) than a generic name as claimed in the article. Does anybody know what the proper generic name is for portable lasers that are more powerful than the typical laser pointer? Those things come up in the news sometimes, like when an airline pilot is interfered with by the use of one of them, so there must be a name for them? <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 15:48, 4 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't believe there is a generic term for that. Normally people would just say laser, and use adjectives to get close to whatever finer-tuned meaning they want. I don't think there are definitive borders between the external physical forms of a laser anyhow -- there are terms for lasers produced via different means or different strengths of laser, but all these should probably just be covered under laser. I could imagine if we got some really in-depth stuff on the means to produce lasers giving those seperate articles at some point. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 16:45, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> sighs I'd love to back up a newbie who is trying really hard, and offer words of encouragement to Papist. It is very crushing to have an article deleted. Come over to my talk page and have a chat about it, and I'll help you out. But at the same time, I am having to vote delete on this one. Remember that when someone deletes one of your articles it is not an attack on you. We know full well that you did your best in creating this article, and that you did it in good faith. We know full well that you would like to see this created and for it to exist in this encyclopaedia. However, you also know that it would not exist in Brittanica or any other encyclopaedia, and indeed nobody would legitimately use it in a research project. Hence it is being deleted. I am sorry that you are being attacked by people as a newbie.

<p>I appreciate Zordac's understanding. However, I do not understand why one of the few surviving minor Boy Scout organizations in the United States (one that has not been absorbed by the Oder of the Arrow) is coming under attack*. By presenting this article, I hoped to make readers aware of the great tradition that exists within Boy Scout camps across the nation. The Wolfeboro Pioneers is undoubtedly one of the largest of these minor organizations. Every summer, it inducts 90 scouts, which is a pretty good annual induction rate for a "minor organization". These scouts come not only from California, but from around the nation and world. In a way, the Wolfeboro Pioneers promotes Scouts from around the nation and the world to come together and express their common bond.</p>

<li>Hi Haeleth. Just my opinion on this is that new users are often directed to AFDs on articles that they created and have no idea what they've done wrong. Whilst sock puppeting obviously exists, I think that a good section of the people are genuine new people. I took it upon myself to write a welcome message to Papist and to explain why people are so hostile, and I think that it at least helped to make things a bit easier for him. I think that if we could all take the time to do this, rather than all of the immediate defensives of accusing of sock puppetry etc, then perhaps people would be more likely to respond in a nice manner as well?

Please note that WoodenBoat publications did not add this article to Wikipedia. I did. I have no affiliation with this organization, although I do read their magazine and frequent their forum. WoodenBoat emerged as part of the heritage movement of the sixties and early seventies (the same movement that gave us the Whole Earth Review, Foxfire, and the Folk Revival). WoodenBoat also runs an important school at Brooklin, Maine, where the old skills have been disseminated by many notable figures, including Joel White (who has an article in Wikipedia). Bruce Taylor</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Woodenboat and <b>Delete</b> or <b>Redirect</b> Woodenboat Forum. I don't see that we have any clear policy on articles about periodicals, but I don't see this as advertising, per se. The magazine has been published for more than 30 years, and there are books available that are collections of columns and articles from the magazine. I have some interest in this as I have a list of old magazines that I might try to write articles for. If anyone wants to discuss the possibility of working up some recommendations for criteria for periodical publications, contact me at my talk page. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Dalbury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 00:16, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
