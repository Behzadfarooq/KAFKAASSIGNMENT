<li><b>Strong Keep</b> meets the criteria of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> cause Die Mannequin has gone on a national concert tour in Canada, opening for Guns'N'Roses on the eastern leg of their North American tour, which is reported in two newspaper articles stated there, they have released one album and will release another one on EMI, as stated in the EMI bio stated there, they have been featured in many published works, stated in the references. And by the way, Bryanyoumans is on a personal vendetta, trying to destroy many articles that I started cause I questionned his ways on wikipedia. He even states on my talk page that he submitted those two articles indirectly because of the unfriendly message I left on his talk page! <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerveetkadet_a936.html" title="User:Terveetkadet">Terveetkadet</a></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep:</b> Wikipedia has an article by Brianyoumans on Adamu Tesfaw; arguably a much less notable artist than Die Mannequin, as far as the English version of Wikipedia is concerned. So why can we not have the Die Mannequin article? I, for one, found it very useful. Brianyoumans has posed no valid reason to delete this article, other than his own opinion. Wikipedia, would be greatly undermined if the opinions of individual users began to dictate what is relevant content and what is not. Please do not remove this article.

<li>I have in fact considered the notability requirements for bands. The requirements under <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a> as listed: #1, charted hit - no claim for that in article; #2, gold record - ditto; #3 - international or national concert tour - the article claims that they "opened a few dates" for Guns and Roses (which is good, I admit). I haven't seen a reference that this constituted a tour of Canada. #4 - two or more albums released - no; #5 - featured in multiple non-trivial sources - I haven't seen proof of that; the articles referenced in the article are mostly small mentions in articles on the G&amp;R tour; #6 - contains at least one member who is a member of a notable group - no (Jesse Keeler played on the EP, but is not a member of the group); #7 - most notable representative of a style - not claimed in article; #8 - major award - no; #9 - won a competition - no; #10 - performed notable theme music or soundtrack - no; #11 - placed in major network rotation - no claim of such; #12 - subject of at least half hour feature - no. So.... I'm open to withdrawing this nomination if anyone adds references for any of these, but, until then, they are a band with one EP out. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 02:39, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b>. Can you cite any sources showing regular airplay or widescale press coverage (<i>NOT</i> trivial mentions such as being just "mentioned" as an opener, but an article actually written about them?)

<li>I'm not completely impressed with the McGill article - it seems to be based on the interview with Care Failure, and I'm not sure what her idea of "brief Canadian tours" is. But if they did if fact open 4 dates for G&amp;R, I'd probably be down to a "weak delete" myself. The article is looking more notable. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:18, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>You know what? I don't care if you're "impressed" or not! You're a delete-crazy fool and I just want to make sure that this important article is saved from your stubborn self... Will you drop the matter once and for hall? And Die Mannequin DID open ALL THE GUNS AND ROSES DATES IN CANADA THIS FALL. This means 5 or 6 dates now (if you read the articles that you, silly references freaks, thrive on) and counting...<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerveetkadet_a936.html" title="User:Terveetkadet">Terveetkadet</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Terveetkadet - You realize that an administrator is going to look at this AfD page, and they're going to delete your article, right? And not because the band isn't notable, but because you have handled this in an utterly foolish manner. Because you have turned your addition to Wikipedia into a personal assault, no one is going to pay attention to the band's entry, only your sockpuppeting and vitriol. And the result is, Die Mannequin will become a red link. I suggest crossing out (with the &lt;s&gt; and &lt;/s&gt; tags) all of your <i>ad hominem</i> attacks and sock-puppeted votes, as a measure of courtesy. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChubbles1212_4175.html" title="User:Chubbles1212">Chubbles</a> 16:40, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think that administrators are supposed to review these pages on the matter of the subject in question and NOT delete an item just because I argued with a guy who's trying to destroy my work in a way that you don't approve. I respect every person who made a comment here EXCEPT brianyoumans cause he destroyed my work in the past, he wants to destroy it again and he takes pride in the numerous pages he deleted. He even lists them in his user page. So sorry but NO &lt;s&gt; and &lt;/s&gt; tags) for that guy. But I kindly ask you if you could retract your accusations of "sockpuppetry" cause I NEVER made such a thing. Prove it if you can.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerveetkadet_a936.html" title="User:Terveetkadet">Terveetkadet</a></li>

<li><b>Nomination Withdrawn</b> - I was not able to verify the tour dates from any of the references in the article, but after a good bit of research, I found a tour listing on <a href="http://www.gnrdaily.com/tour_history_compact.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.gnrdaily.com/tour_history_compact.asp" rel="nofollow">Guns N Roses Daily</a> that verifies that Die Mannequin did in fact open 5 shows for them in Canada, in Halifax, Toronto, Quebec City, Ottawa, and St. John's. I think that probably constitutes enough of a tour to establish some notability, so I will withdraw this nomination. Kudos to Terveetkadet and others for improving the article quite a bit during this discussion. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 12:28, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
