<li><b>Comments</b> - The article seems, by virtue of its content, to not be subject to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. If this holds true, then it has no place here. However, a few caveats are worth mentioning:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>We have the <a href="../../../o/e/r/Oera_Linda_2220.html" title="Oera Linda">Oera Linda book</a> with its own article at Wikipedia. The Odin Brotherhood and the <a href="../../../o/e/r/Oera_Linda_2220.html" title="Oera Linda">Oera Linda book</a> appear to be equal to each other in terms of factual content (id est, they are both fiction), according to the nature of their sources. I would not mind having The Odin Brotherhood here with its own article if <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> can be satisfied. I doubt that will happen, as Dr. Mirabello's book seems about as verifiable as <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guido_Karl_Anton_List_ebae.html" title="Guido Karl Anton List">Guido Karl Anton List</a>'s personal gnosis concerning the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armanen.html" title="Armanen">Armanen</a> runes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Additionally, I must respectfully disagree with <a href="../../../h/r/o/User%7EHroptR_9ca5.html" title="User:HroptR">HroptR</a>, <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">Dieter</a>, and any other folk who wish to redirect the article in question to any Germanic neopaganism article here at Wikipedia, as that would lend a false credibility to Dr. Mirabello's book which it does not deserve. I base that judgement on having read the book itself, my education in relevant subjects, and finally on the rules governing Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../o/d/i/Odinism.html" title="Odinism">Odinism</a> is, to my POV, a valid variant of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_neopaganism.html" title="Germanic neopaganism">Germanic neopaganism</a> in our time, and to grant The Odin Brotherhood the status of being a valid academic reference, or even a commonly used spiritual source text for that religion would be quite inaccurate.</li>

<p>Tracking all mentions of an entry or link across wikipedia and deleting them before the AfD is even completed is a form of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">harassment</a>.

There seems to be a total lack of <i><a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civility</a></i> by many here, as well as the most severe violations of <i><a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">attacking new comers</a></i> which I have ever seen. The editor has less than 25 edits, and has only been a member of wikipedia for three days. He doesn't even know how to sign his name with four tildes (look at the top of this page). This entry was not even 10 minutes old, before it was submitted for AfD. I think we need to wait and see if he is going to add further content, verifiable sources and clean up the entry - or whether it should be merged into another article. Contrary to what has been stated here, I have heard about this alleged secret society elsewhere in print and even on a radio show. Correct me if I'm wrong, but <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">Dab</a> and myself are in fact the only editors who have voted in this AfD who have edited or contributed content at wikipedia about <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_Neopaganism_ae65.html" title="Germanic Neopaganism">Germanic Neopaganism</a>, <a href="../../../%C3%A1/s/a/%C3%81satr%C3%BA.html" title="Ásatrú">Ásatrú</a>, <a href="../../../o/d/i/Odinism.html" title="Odinism">Odinism</a>, <a href="../../../o/d/i/Odinic_Rite_ba67.html" title="Odinic Rite">Odinic Rite</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polytheistic_reconstructionism.html" title="Polytheistic reconstructionism">Polytheistic Reconstructionsim</a>, etc. and I feel that those who have not contributed to these subjects <i>do not know if it is relevant or not</i> because they don't know the subject matter whatsoever.

<li>Some well made points HroptR and I apologise to Mr Mirabello for biting... Still, as the creator of the page is clearly monitoring the debate one might reasonably expect any changes to happen quickly. We all appreciate very few among us have knowledge of this, perhaps because it is an inherently niche topic. We all want to promote our own interests (and commercial publications) but don't lose sight of whether this is really a topic for WP... It's a promo for a book, and would need to be completely rewritten to become some kind of objective article about the society, a society which you state is "alleged" to exist, and therefore doesn't sound extremely verifiable. ++<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz">Deiz</a> 18:55, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have gone through and done a quick wikification of the article, so it is a book entry and not an advertisement.

<li><b>Comment</b> The cleanup is better, but I still have a few reservations about this article. The excerpt section is overly long, and in my opinion unecessary. See <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jesus_Mysteries_5866.html" title="The Jesus Mysteries">The Jesus Mysteries</a> for a better example of how this article could be done. Also, the controversy section is POV, basically attempting to defend the lack of sources by casting aspersions on the sourcing of unrelated works. Most importantly, I'm still not convinced this book has reached the threshold of notability. There are no set standards for books that I'm aware of like <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, so it's a judgement call.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:58, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am planning to nominate the Mark Mirabello page for deletion this evening as it is <s>an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAuto-biography_0a7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Auto-biography">autobiography</a> of</s> a non-notable person. The book remains non-notable, it claims to be non-fictional, but without any verification and consequently not a usefull contribution to wikipedia. There is no indication that the website is from someone else than Mark Mirabello, or that any of the advertisments, or radio interviews were with anybody else than Mark Mirabello himself (there is documentation of a radio interview with him). Neither have I gotten any verification from within the Asatru or Odinist community that this group exists (some responses still pending). If he, or others provide verification for the non-fictional aspect of the book (or I get word from others within the community), I would reconsider whether there is potential of a seperate article on the brotherhood themselves. If not, it appear to be fictional work sold as non-fiction. Until then, I remain for deletion of the page as nom. --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> 20:13, 8 February 2006 (UTC) Edited error on my site --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> 14:27, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>So you are advocating <i>purging</i> all reference to him on wikipedia? You stated: <i>Neither have I gotten any verification from within the Asatru or Odinist community that this group exists</i> which community would this be? I don't think the argument is whether the group exists or not, but whether mention of <i>a book</i> should be purged because the content is questionable.

<dd>Hey AdelaMae. I don't think any recons would subscribe to the <i>Odin Brotherhood</i> just because of the occult elements and secret society bit. For what it's worth, it is on the reading list of several <i>neo-heathen</i> Asatru /Odinist groups like the <a href="http://www.runestone.org/rdgs.html" class="external text" title="http://www.runestone.org/rdgs.html" rel="nofollow">AFA</a> with a blurb: <i>"a fascinating, poetic, visionary, and many suspect, metaphorical, look at Odinic religion"</i> and is mentioned on several Asatru webistes and forums briefly like <a href="http://users.frii.com/asacat/" class="external text" title="http://users.frii.com/asacat/" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. The radio show from <i>Odin Lives</i> linked in the article goes into the works impact as well as the veracity of the order. I just think it is a poor precedent to delete fringe authors because their works or beliefs aren't seen as valuable to the mainstream. Many subcultures are not highly represented on the internet. <a href="../../../h/r/o/User%7EHroptR_9ca5.html" title="User:HroptR">HroptR</a> 20:14, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There appears to be many editors who have edited anonymously or have created a username solely to vote on this issue. While we appreciate your concern and passion about this issue, unfortunately the input of new users does not have much weight in these matters, because you are not yet a contributing member of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Also, it is expressly against Wikipedia policy to create more than one user account to affect the outcomes of <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">deletion discussion</a> or <i>AfD</i>. This is called <i><a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_sock_puppet.html" title="Internet sock puppet">sock puppetry</a></i>. This practice is highly frowned upon by your fellow Wikipedia editors and is expressly discouraged by <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, every computer on the internet has a unique <a href="../../../i/p/_/IP_address_6ed9.html" title="IP address">IP address</a>, which in most instances, can identify the specific computer and the physical location used to make edits. If numerous editors in a vote all have the same IP address, this is evidence of sock puppetry, and your votes will not be counted. You could also be blocked from editing in the future. <i>You are not completely anonymous!</i></p>

<p><b>COMMENT</b> Wild debate. Note that the book has a sales rank of 9,395 at Buy.com [<a href="http://www.buy.com/prod/The_Odin_Brotherhood/q/loc/106/39726427.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.buy.com/prod/The_Odin_Brotherhood/q/loc/106/39726427.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>] Maybe its rank is lower at amazon because smart people look for deals--it is cheaper at buy.com! --146.85.84.60 01:35, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Different retailers calculate their ranks based on <b>completely different formulae</b>. Amazon.com is an often used standard, so when an Amazon.com sales rank is quoted, it is being compared to other products with Amazon sales ranks, <b>not</b> the same product's sales rank on a completely different site. As you will see if you become a more experienced WP user, Buy.com ranks are not considered any kind of standard measure by Wikipedia editors. Your post also sounds like an advertising jingle. On those two counts you might want to strike that one. <b><font style="verdana" color="#990099">++D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#9900CC">iz</font></b> 02:00, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Apparently a favourable coincidence to you since you have been adding (and been reverted in each case) links to The Odin Brotherhood in numerous articles here at Wikipedia.

<p><b>COMMENT</b>. Here is the link to the FBI Library Collection. Type "Odin Brotherhood" or "Mirabello" to find it. <a href="http://fbilibrary.fbiacademy.edu/webopac/cgi/swebmnu.exe?act=3&amp;ini=splusweb" class="external free" title="http://fbilibrary.fbiacademy.edu/webopac/cgi/swebmnu.exe?act=3&amp;ini=splusweb" rel="nofollow">http://fbilibrary.fbiacademy.edu/webopac/cgi/swebmnu.exe?act=3&amp;ini=splusweb</a> So, if the Odin Brotherhood does not exist, why is the FBI reading about it? Do you think they have titles on the "Fantastic Four"? "The Justice League"? What do you think, Mulder? Scully? --146.85.84.60 20:44, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple reason is that the FBI does research on neonazi and white supremacist groups, some of whom are Odinist oriented. Just remember Nazi germany and the misuse of our symbols by them. So, they want to have the background knowlegde and make a library. Simple enough. --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> 20:52, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I changed the link above to go directly to the FBI library. In a quick search, I cannot find any other Odinist/Asatru titles there.... --146.85.84.60 21:15, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The page is not of an Odinist group.

<li>I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to prove here 146.85.127.124. If you're suggesting that new sources have come to light which will enable you (you're clearly some kind of expert) to write an encyclopedic, verifiable, unbiased and objective article on this topic then maybe you should stop piling stuff onto this AfD page and <b>DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE ARTICLE WHICH HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR DELETION</b>. The majority of editors on this page know nothing and care even less about Odinism. What we do want to see are submissions which belong in Wikipedia. As it stands the article flies in the face of several of WP's criteria for inclusion and if you tot up the opinions of experienced editors (per the warning at the top of the page and the "Notes to new editors" piece by HroptR, several "editors" opinions will be discounted due to the evidence of sockpuppetry) you'll see the article could do with less hot air and more hard work. <b><font style="verdana" color="#990099">++D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#9900CC">iz</font></b> 01:32, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
