<p>This is spam and needs cleanup. It may however, be spam on a notable subject, or just any old random porn mag, but erm I think we need to decide this. If we cut out the crap it becomes, "Score mag is a porn mag founded in 1993 with pictures of women with big breasts in", so I'm leaning towards delete, partiuclarly with the contempt that spammers have shown fo rthe wiki process. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 16:20, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as it is. It's long, but lots of the information is trivial in an encyclopedic context (the dressing room has a jacuzzi? so what?). <b>However</b> a quick look around shows at least four other publications with the same name, maybe an article could be rewritten for one of these: <a href="http://score.fr" class="external free" title="http://score.fr" rel="nofollow">http://score.fr</a> a french printed cinema magazine <a href="http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/</a> online magazine about film &amp; TV scores <a href="http://www.scoregolf.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.scoregolf.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.scoregolf.com/</a> golf magazine, both print and online, and Amazon lists something expensive called Score and published by "Society Of Composers &amp; Lyricists" ... it seems to be their quarterly newsletter, according to <a href="http://www.thescl.com/site/scl/section.php?id=4505" class="external free" title="http://www.thescl.com/site/scl/section.php?id=4505" rel="nofollow">http://www.thescl.com/site/scl/section.php?id=4505</a> <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 23:45, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but major rewrite needed. I don't see a problem with an article on this particular magazine, as it does have some notability on its own merit. Score Group, which publishes it, puts out a whack of other magazines, too. But it needs some major reworking to remove the spammy and POV elements. Plus, I recommend replacing the cover scan with just the logo, as the illustration might cause offense. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 00:54, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but major rewrite needed. Hello everybody. Thank you for bringing up this discussion. I am the person who wrote this article. True. The article is biased. I worked for the Score Group for three years and have come to learn the operation in-depth. I came into contact with all aspects of their business and work very closely with the owners themselves, who I learn to sincerely appreciate. Having had some experience in this industry I came to the realization that what Mr. Fox had done over the years was not only a highly professional, respectful endeavour but also a benchmark to others in this field. Mr. Fox himself spent not less than 12 hours a day at the office and his attention to detail was unbearable to us, employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can call this smut, you can call it self-promotion, but the truth is that I felt I could truly make a contribution in this particular niche and about this particular magazine. I no longer work for them. I quit my job on October 2003 and presently do not maintain contact with anybody at the office so this article could hardly be construed as self-promotional. All this data can be easily verified by calling the company and talking to any of the owners or Human Resources Dpt.</p>
<p>Indeed, the article is biased but because of my personal appreciation of what they had given me over the years. This is why I agree that a rewrite may be needed. As you can see in my profile (contributions) I could not seriously be considered a spammer for this is the only article I wrote. I would specially take note at how hard I worked on this article given all the rewrite that took place. Some of the free samples about the magazine are mine, such as adult-magazine.ws. Other sites had been found on the net.</p>
<p>I am aware there could be conflicts of interest in this area and that some of the opinions voiced here may carry, perhaps, ulterior motives, but I may also be wrong about this and everyone participating here might have a sincere desire to make this article as impartial as possible. My understanding of the essence of wikipedia is that contributors are welcomed as long as they can prove to have some expertise in some areas and be willing to offer an impartial, wholesome view. I failed in the second aim but I invite others to help me rewrite this article in a way that can be accepted. Please bear in mind that I have left open most of the local links so that OTHERS could contribute as well. Further proof that I was not attempting to spam or create a promotional page. The article had been reviewed by others months ago (about 4 months) and was never objected. This makes me think twice about why it has raised concerns now...</p>
<p>Finally, I must apologize because of my language is not english, but spanish. So my effort in writing the article and communicating with you has been and is considerable.</p>
<p>Thank you. Wikirober 11:13, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Added: Regarding the comment 'Plus, I recommend replacing the cover scan with just the logo, as the illustration might cause offense'... I understand some people may prefer not to have breast models (dressed) pictured on wikipedia, even if it does not violate TOS, but if you remove this cover you remove the heart of what SCORE is about. Both showcased models, Julia Miles and Linsey Dawn Mckenzie (under contract) are closest to the true essence of what this organization is about. That cover hasn't been placed randomly but has been carefully selected among hundreds because of what those two ladies represent. There is NO other model that carries The Score Group legacy better than LDM. I believe this particular cover is an honest representation of their mark.</p>
<p>This page is now preserved as an archive of the debate and, like some other VfD subpages, is no longer 'live'. Subsequent comments on the issue, the deletion, or the decision-making process should be placed on the relevant 'live' pages. <b>Please do not edit this page</b>.</p>
