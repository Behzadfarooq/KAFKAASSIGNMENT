<li><b>Keep</b> - I really don't see much advertising/propaganda in the article, and I'd say it passes any notability test. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 06:52, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's notable, but nothing valuable to the article. The article describes mostly how to use the website and how it might be better than the competition. Nothing of social value exists. Hence, delete it. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJessemonroy650_0a9e.html" title="User:Jessemonroy650">meatclerk</a> 06:58, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't quite see what you're getting at here. The article probably goes into a bit more detail about the site than is strictly necessary, but that's hardly grounds to delete - it's grounds to get the article listed for a cleanup. Additionally, I'd defy anyone to write an article on any website <i>without</i> including "how to use the website" and "how it might be better than the competition" (for the record, I'm of the belief that the latter can be done in an NPOV manner). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 09:16, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep and rename</b> to <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epinions.html" title="Epinions">Epinions</a>. 1 reference to the website in San Francisco Chronicle, and another article in the same paper several months later mentions the company behind the website. Needs rewrite to focus on its notability, though. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> 07:29, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> - this is a highly trafficked website, and I agree with BigHaz in not seeing significantly problematic text. While a cleanup may help, listing it for AfD because someone may have inserted some POV material doesn't make sense. Could you be more specific about what you see as "propaganda"? <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b> 07:32, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>, I'm tempted to think this is a joke--the subject is almost certainly notable, being fairly popular and having been featured in several verifiable sources. A re-write wouldn't hurt, I'd agree, but from the Talk page it doesn't look like much discussion or work went into doing so before this nomination. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 07:52, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - If that's the issue, you should suggest or start clean-up then, and work up from there.

<li><b>Cleanup and rename</b> article should be called "Epinions" per WP convention, I think. Cleanup consists of erasing most of the article. Alternatively, delete so someone can start over without prejudice. Epinions is definitely a notable site but this article is mostly advert. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 09:07, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No Vote</b>, because of a conflict of interest. I put this article up for deletion. The website in question is of some note. Definitely better article than the other in the Category:Reward_websites. Even so, a look at the logs shows the article not having a champion.

<dd>Are you asking to close the AfD early? It's not entirely clear what you're saying. AfD's aren't a bargaining process where "if this happens, then I'll change my vote", but rather a discussion to determine if the article belongs on Wikipedia at all. If it's change you're looking for — say, to reword a part that you feel reads like an advert rather than an article — then you'll have better look bringing it up on the article's talk page, using a tag like {{cleanup}}, or another non-deletion process. If you'd like to change your comments, however, just strikeout the old ones (but don't remove them) and voice your new opinions here. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b> 09:34, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The whole idea of deleting an article on a top 20 /50 /100 (whatever) website is ridiculous. This article is plagued by editors with an pro- and anti- epinions agenda, that's all. If that's a big problem, delete all articles on all political parties right now! The formal suggestion to delete is using a nuke to swat a fly, and quite frankly abuse of the power to call for delete. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.84.7.90 (<a href="../../../2/1/3/User_talk%7E213.84.7.90.html" title="User talk:213.84.7.90">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.84.7.90_6d53.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.84.7.90">contribs</a>) 07:04, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li>Calm down, please. It seems to have been a good faith effort to get the article cleaned up or deleted from its apparently advertising-based format, and that's being accomplished.
