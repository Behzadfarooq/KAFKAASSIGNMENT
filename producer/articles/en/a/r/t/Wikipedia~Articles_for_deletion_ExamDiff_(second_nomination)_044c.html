<p>The first deletion nomination was borderline by my count, and I decided to close it with a keep after a good rewrite by the author. This has been disputed and one sysop even peremptorily deleted it. I'm listing this for further discussion. I would like to ask the deleting sysop <i>not</i> to make further attempts to delete this without a proper discussion. It is in no way a candidate for speedy deletion. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:51, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a popular programming tool, given a good editorial review by download.com. The article was written by the author of the software, but in my opinion the article lacks the promotional language and the unjustified superlatives (or inded at the moment <i>any</i> superlatives) that are characteristic of advertising. It is well written and encyclopedic, and is useful. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:51, 22 August 2005 (UTC) <b>addendum</b>: If not kept, <b>redirect to <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diff.html" title="Diff">diff</a></b>. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:34, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. While it seems like a nice program, it is really not very notable -- it's just a windows implement of the unix command "diff". <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 20:35, 22 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>FWIW, of all the diff tools I can find listed on download.com, it has both more downloads total and more downloads last week than all the others put together. It is given the third highest CNet rating after both versions of DiffDog, and the second highest user rating after ExamDiff Pro. It had more downloads last week than the CygWin Unix porting suite. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 20:54, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a verifiable topic.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I actually use this product but am puzzled as to how it could be considered encyclopedic. It is a very ordinary piece of utility software that, though well written, is simiar to many other competing products. I cannot imagine how it would contribute to history in any way, and can't imagine why an encyclopedic project -- even one as broad as Wikipedia in scope -- would be a suitable reference source for such ephemera. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 21:43, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>It's "popular" for a very limited definition of "popular": Linux and MacOSX both come with a very nice "diff" utility, which is far more widely used than ExamDiff. Also, most programming IDEs come with an integrated "diff" utility. That means that this program is popular among programmers who meet all of the following:
<ol>
<li>Have a need for a "diff" utility</li>
<li>Don't use MacOSX or Linux</li>
<li>Don't use either Cygwin or MinGW</li>
<li>Don't like their IDE's "diff", or don't use an IDE</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>It's a very small market. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 22:44, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>You're right, my stated reason was a little flip, but my point was that I think it's <i>inherently</i> a man page, I can't really see how it could ever be properly encyclopedic, without duplicating too much information that would more properly be (and already is) on a central, non-particular-implementation-specific <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diff.html" title="Diff">diff</a> page. <a href="../../../u/m/m/User%7EUmmit_38d5.html" title="User:Ummit">Steve Summit</a> (<a href="../../../u/m/m/User_talk%7EUmmit_97c6.html" title="User talk:Ummit">talk</a>) 02:25, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_ExamDiff_2_5126.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/ExamDiff 2">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/ExamDiff 2</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">User:ESkog</a> commented on the lack of criteria for determining the notability of software. I suggest the answer to the following question as at least a guideline: "Did anyone else care enough about the software to review it?" In cases of software products that would probably be universally considered notable, such as <a href="../../../p/k/z/PKZip_1a6d.html" title="PKZip">PKZip</a> or <a href="../../../p/c/_/PC_Tools_6d1b.html" title="PC Tools">PC Tools</a>, that is the case, as such products have many reviews in computer magazines and the like. However, for this package I haven't yet located anything other than simple reprints of the "blurb on the side of the box" (sometimes thinly disguised, and mostly as product descriptions in on-line catalogues). You <i>might</i> be able to sway editors' opinions, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Nisnevich_abd5.html" title="User:Alex Nisnevich">User:Alex Nisnevich</a>, if you can locate reviews of this package, to show that people have actually considered the software notable enough that they have written and published articles that focus upon it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:55:50, 2005-08-22 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure this can be the sole criterion for determining the notability of software (and I don't think you're suggesting it should be). We have articles on a lot of traditional Unix system software, such as <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diff.html" title="Diff">diff</a>, <a href="../../../d/d/_/Dd.html" title="Dd">dd</a>, <a href="../../../c/m/p/Cmp.html" title="Cmp">cmp</a>, <a href="../../../l/s/_/Ls.html" title="Ls">ls</a>, <a href="../../../m/v/_/Mv.html" title="Mv">mv</a>, <a href="../../../c/p/_/Cp.html" title="Cp">cp</a>, even Unix system calls like <a href="../../../m/m/a/Mmap.html" title="Mmap">mmap</a>. I'd be surprised to find a serious review of <a href="../../../c/p/_/Cp.html" title="Cp">cp</a> somewhere ("All those of you who thought 'cat foo &gt; bar' was great, wait till you try 'cp foo bar'! A++++++"). --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 04:12, 23 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Prepare to be surprised. You might not find a <i>review</i>, in the magazine sense of the term, but you'll find that for those programs, people indeed <i>have</i> "written and published articles that focus upon them". People write "<a href="../../../u/s/e/Useless_use_of_cat.html" title="Useless use of cat">Useless use of cat</a>" articles about <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat_%28Unix%29_14b9.html" title="Cat (Unix)">cat</a>. If you look at the references section for <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diff.html" title="Diff">diff</a> you'll find that there's an <i>entire book</i> on that command. People have actually written <i>teaching courses</i> that focus on on <a href="../../../c/p/_/Cp_%28Unix%29_bcd4.html" title="Cp (Unix)">cp</a>, <a href="../../../m/v/_/Mv.html" title="Mv">mv</a>, and <a href="../../../l/s/_/Ls.html" title="Ls">ls</a> (<a href="http://www.batky-howell.com/courses/datasheets/products/funds_pf.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.batky-howell.com/courses/datasheets/products/funds_pf.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.bluestarlearning.com/linux_training_ln1.aspx?classid=4680" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bluestarlearning.com/linux_training_ln1.aspx?classid=4680" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.linux.org/lessons/beginner/l6/lesson6c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.linux.org/lessons/beginner/l6/lesson6c.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). And, yes, if you look at the references section of <a href="../../../m/m/a/Mmap.html" title="Mmap">mmap</a> you'll see that people <i>have</i> written programming guides that focus upon it, too.
<p>The fundamental point is that people, independent of the original author, have actually considered the software notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works of their own that focus upon it, be those works magazine reviews, teaching courses, books, programming guides, or other commentaries. So, for example, if someone had written a book on <a href="../../../e/x/a/ExamDiff_fdf1.html" title="ExamDiff">ExamDiff</a> for <a href="../../../o/27/r/O%27Reilly_Media_64bd.html" title="O'Reilly Media">O'Reilly Media</a>, or a teaching course that specifically addressed it as a topic, then those would be arguments that could be used to sway editors' opinions towards keeping an article on the subject. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:41:25, 2005-08-23 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article was deleted in violation of process shortly after an earlier VfD nomination. And there is nothing to stop an article listed on VFU being undeleted and listed on VfD, although I have made a personal undertaking to avoid doing so in the case of contested speedy deletions. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:02, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's a ridiculous allegation. The article was deleted because the earlier VFD had consensus to delete. Read up on our deletion policy, would you?

<ul>
<li>Exactly. You wrongly closed it as "no consensus" when it obviously had a consensus to delete. You should follow consensus in the future rather than impose your own point of view.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think we can all agree that <a href="../../../e/x/a/ExamDiff_fdf1.html" title="ExamDiff">ExamDiff</a> is no longer an advert, not after the rewrite. And Tony Sidaway explained about the program's popularity. While it will not make it to the <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Brittanica_8ec0.html" title="Encyclopedia Brittanica">Brittanica</a></i>, it's certainly notable enough to have an article <i><b>in an encyclopedia with nearly 700,000 pages</b></i>!

<li>I agree it's no longer an advert. It is a simple man page. Wikipedia is not a repository of man pages. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> 01:31, 2005 August 24 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmmm... do you really think it's a man page? Well, while I was rewriting it I guess I was so determined for it to not be an advert that I made it go all the way to the other side and become a man page: <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertisement.html" title="Advertisement">advertisement</a>--------<b>neutral</b>------X-<a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_page.html" title="Man page">man page</a>. I think that while we shouldn't leave the article as is, we shouldn't delete it. I'm determined to make a decent article about <a href="../../../e/x/a/ExamDiff_fdf1.html" title="ExamDiff">ExamDiff</a>, even if it's just a stub.

<ul>
<li>The current page looks like an advert to me still, or part of an advert, the "Technical details" section often found in online ads for software. The presnece of a list of 'features" simply screams advertisement to me. But even if rewritten, I see no reason in the article or in anything said here to indicate that this utility is itself notable. The genreal class of diff utilities is of course notabel, and pershps this product could be mentioned in a "popular implementations" section in such an article. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 02:56, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you search for this program on download.com, which is a major distributor of freeware programs such as this one, it shows that it has about 120k downloads. It has also been reviewed by the CNET editors on the same site.
