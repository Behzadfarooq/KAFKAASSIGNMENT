<p>Comments listed here are either by IP address, or by editors whose accounts show fewer than ten edits prior to this vote. A large number of "keep" voters have been attracted by website discussing the outside event discussed in the article; that site has run a "keep vote" campaign, or at least participants on its discussion area have.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I agree, let's see what direction this heads in first, obviously a lot of people will be looking for an article on this in a while, so let's wait a bit.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Let's see where it goes first. If it ends up being overblown, THEN we can delete.

<li><b>Keep.</b> The movie <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondhand_Lions_810e.html" title="Secondhand Lions">Secondhand_Lions</a> has a relevant line in it that goes something to the effect of "Sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things a man needs to believe in the most". “That people are basically good. That honor virtue and courage mean everything; that money and power mean nothing. That good always triumphs over evil. That true love never dies. Doesn’t matter if they’re true or not. A man should believe in those things anyway. Because they are the things worth believing.” Keeping this article doesnt only have to be about how enduring it is, or how rigorously backed up it is. There are sufficient minimums, and there is reasonable argument that they have been met. Mans inhumanity to man is one of the great themes of human history. This article is also about the idea that man should have humanity, and even excellence, toward his fellow man. Engr.student 04:27, 9 June 2006 (UTC) <b>Note</b>: vote is user's second edit.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I did an initial article for this, but it too was put up for fast deletion. It DOES fit the definition of an internet meme, despite it's short lifespan. I quote from the article on Internet meme - "An Internet phenomenon (sometimes called an Internet meme) occurs when something relatively unknown becomes increasingly popular, often quite suddenly, through the mass propagation of media content made feasible by the Internet; however, the popularity of the phenomenon usually wanes as rapidly as it was acquired" <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">Internet phenomenon</a> Smw1983 05:26, 9 June 2006 (UTC) <b>Note</b>: This vote is user's third edit.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I agree with the idea that this is a good example of how quickly internet phenomenon can take off and how much of an effect the virtual world can have on the real one.

<li><b>Keep</b> I continue to see posts from people that have absolutely no involvement with what is happening refer to this as a non-event. Well, of course people that are not involved and don't understand technology will say such things. The fact of the matter is this is not a Slashdot-only event. Sure, it gained widespread coverage as a result of postings on Digg and Slashdot, but this is becoming a worldwide event. People from all over the world are taking part in the fight for someone to get stolen property back to its rightful owners. I would suggest that if you do not understand technology, do not understand the Internet and its potential, that you do not post your opinion here. So many opinions are from people that obviously have no idea what they are talking about.--Thenet411 16:52, 9 June 2006 (UTC) <b>Note</b>: This vote is user's third edit.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The abnormal popularity of this event online (with coverage on Slashdot, Digg, CNET's blog, MSNBC's blog, and countless others) and how it is a great example of internet vigilantism should merit a keep for now, espicially now that the article focuses more on the event rather than the website.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am the original editor of the entry and read the incident on Slashdot. I had included it here as documenting a current event. In fact, compared to other <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">internet phenomenons</a>, this has arisen rather quickly and may be the fastest growing meme.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I was sitting on the fence with this one, as it has recieved coverage in not just Slashdot but Cnet and MSNBC. But what pushed me towards delete was that the subject of the article is the <i>website</i>, not the incident itself. And being an encylopedia, we have to look at what's gonna be noteworthy five or ten years from now. And while the incident <i>might</i> merit a stub or at least a mention in another article in five years, there's no reason to believe that the website will even still be online by then.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Completely non-notable cruft relating to the sort of non-event that some bloggers seem to become obsessed with. Frankly, there are more notable minor shoplifting offences.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Completely non notable. Not of any relevance now, definitely not of any relevance in a week or a month never mind further in the future. So it's all over the internet, so what? Not even remotely encyclopaedic. As Necrothesp has said there are more notable minor shoplifting offenses and other crimes and they're not here.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Firstly, it's way too new, and secondly, it's not terribly original.

<li>Not notable. Every day various little stupid things on the Internet are becoming "popular" - and then everyone forgets about them just as quickly.

<li>Changing to <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_vigilantism.html" title="Internet vigilantism">Internet vigilantism</a> as suggested above.
