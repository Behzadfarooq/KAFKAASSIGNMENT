<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Spooner_6152.html" title="Edit section: Wives/Relationships">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wives/Relationships</span></h2>
<p>Arthur has been married at least three times:</p>
<p>Sophia, his first wife, probably died while they were married. She was the mother of Carrie, but very likely, not Sara, depicted as the younger paternal half-sister of Carrie. Sophia's tombstone had Simone's name (Carrie's true birth name) on it, but no others. Later in her life, Sophia gained a lot of weight.</p>
<p>Lily was his wife when Doug met Arthur for the first time. Arthur literally 'found her on a street corner' where she was waiting for the bus. She and Arthur had an extremely long fight because Arthur wanted a boat. Carrie once said "You were still married to Lily" so they probably got a divorce.</p>
<p>Tessie died in the pilot episode of The King of Queens. She was (currently) Arthur's last wife.</p>
<p>Arthur has dated Doug's aunt Sheila and also dated Doug's mother. Arthur is often involved with Spence Olchin's (Patton Oswalt) mother (Anne Meara), although Arthur is usually very annoyed by her (this is ironic because Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara are married in real-life).</p>
<p><a name="Other_family" id="Other_family"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Spooner_6152.html" title="Edit section: Other family">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other family</span></h2>
<p>Arthur's father was abusive, and him forcing Arthur to change costumes and go to houses that gave money on Halloween several times has made him ban the holiday from the Heffernan home. On an episode of <i>The King of Queens</i>, Arthur's father is played by Jerry Stiller's son, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Stiller_b581.html" title="Ben Stiller">Ben Stiller</a>, and Arthur himself is played by <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erik_Per_Sullivan_5030.html" title="Erik Per Sullivan">Erik Per Sullivan</a> (<i><a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_in_the_Middle_a7e0.html" title="Malcolm in the Middle">Malcolm in the Middle</a></i>). Arthur also once tried to take in, as a son, an Indian food delivery boy, played by Ali Sadduk, in order to pass down his aged old wisdom. Arthur has a half-brother, Skitch, whom he hates.</p>
<p><a name="More" id="More"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Spooner_6152.html" title="Edit section: More">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">More</span></h2>
<p>In the episode Art House, Doug is surprised on Arthur's ability to play the piano, but in the episode Two Thirty, Arthur shows that he has no ability to play the piano.</p>
<p>Arthur is walked by a dog walker named Holly (<a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicole_Sullivan_1365.html" title="Nicole Sullivan">Nicole Sullivan</a>) His best friend is Mickey (<a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Rainey_e085.html" title="Ford Rainey">Ford Rainey</a>). He also enjoys hanging out with Doug's friends (especially Spence). However, both of these characters are now gone. Sullivan left the show in 2005 to star in her own series <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Properties_13dc.html" title="Hot Properties">Hot Properties</a> and Rainey died in 2005.</p>
<p>George Barksdale (Gerry Black), another acquaintance of Arthur's, appears in later episodes of the show. At first, they were bitter rivals, but are now good friends.</p>
<p>Arthur has had a wide variety of jobs, including working at a metal works factory, polishing and engraving bowling balls, and selling string. The places that he has worked in (other than Queens) include <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shreveport%2C_Louisiana_c251.html" title="Shreveport, Louisiana">Shreveport, Louisiana</a> and <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glen_Burnie%2C_Maryland_015c.html" title="Glen Burnie, Maryland">Glen Burnie, Maryland</a>. He even invents a new brand of <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screwdriver.html" title="Screwdriver">screwdriver</a> called the "Arthur's Head," which is basically a Phillips head with an "A" for Arthur. The A on the first Arthur's Head came from an old typewriter key.</p>
<p>Arthur has a tendency to stretch out words ending with s, for example, Douglas would be Douglassss. He refers to himself a "A. Spooner" or "Arty".</p>
<p>Arthur also tends to shout often and unnecessarily, much like <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Costanza_6f81.html" title="Frank Costanza">Frank Costanza</a>, Stiller's character on <i><a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i>.</p>
<p>He is also very eccentric. He often comes up with absolutely absurd, irregular or illogical money-making scams.</p>
<p>He has a problem with authority figures, and often tries to win arguments by acting childish or screaming (except with physically intimidating people.)</p>
<p>He has been notorious in making outrageous remarks like he invented the <a href="../../../m/o/i/Moist_towelette.html" title="Moist towelette">moist towelette</a>, claiming that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Schultz_d148.html" title="Charles Schultz">Charles Schultz</a> based <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Brown_6d8c.html" title="Charlie Brown">Charlie Brown</a> on his life. He also steals change from Doug's nightstand.</p>
<p>He has also picked up on some of Doug's personality traits. In one episode, he wears Doug's IPS uniform and pretends to be a deliveryman, and in a couple of episodes, he repeats one of Doug's most famous <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catchphrase.html" title="Catchphrase">catchphrases</a>. The following is an example of the latter:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Arthur:</b> Tell that to your conscience!</dd>
<dd><b>Doug:</b> My conscience is fine, so shutty!</dd>
<dd><b>Arthur:</b> No, you shutty!</dd>
<dd><b>Doug:</b> <i>You</i> shutty!</dd>
</dl>
<p>Arthur once made a birthday wish to spend more time with Doug, and, with the help of Carrie, gets his chance after Doug won two tickets to the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Four_ffdd.html" title="Final Four">Final Four</a>. Known for being a nervous flyer, Arthur decides to take his pills while awaiting takeoff from New York to <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a>, where the Final Four is being played. But the plane never takes off, due to mechanical problems, so Doug and Arthur must take another flight, and when Arthur finally wakes up, he finds himself in <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania_b3a2.html" title="Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a>. Having never been to Pittsburgh before, Arthur splurges on various city-related souvenirs, including an "I 'Heart' Pittsburgh" button and a replica <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Steelers_bedf.html" title="Pittsburgh Steelers">Steelers</a> jersey with <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Roethlisberger_79ab.html" title="Ben Roethlisberger">Ben Roethlisberger</a>'s number on it. That's also where Doug finally makes his real feelings known, adding that Arthur "ruins everything." Arthur is offended by these comments, and refuses to board the connecting flight that would've taken them to St. Louis. After Doug has a brief talk with him, Arthur changes his mind, and finds a connecting flight eventually. But the plane is full of <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hassidic.html" title="Hassidic">Hassidic</a> Jews, and Arthur creates a disturbance by storming the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockpit.html" title="Cockpit">cockpit</a>. It is discovered that he took all of his pills in New York, and the plane lands in <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayton%2C_Ohio_88d9.html" title="Dayton, Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>, where Doug is forced to watch the game on one of the coin-operated TVs inside the airport. As before, Arthur loads up on some Dayton-related souvenirs, including a snow globe (which Doug smashes in a fit of anger) and a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheeseboard.html" title="Cheeseboard">cheeseboard</a>.</p>
<p>Arthur is a believer in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a>, for example in the episode Steve Moscow he claims the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> to have been a "workers' paradise". In the episode <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_Out_5760.html" title="Strike Out">Strike Out</a>, he said that he once was enrolled at a Socialist summer camp.</p>
<p>Along with the banning of Halloween, Arthur also banned various other items from the Heffernans' house, which included red pens, soft cheese, non-American VCRS (But no DVD Players), mentioning <a href="../../../f/d/r/FDR_9d75.html" title="FDR">FDR</a>'s polio, miniature <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kit_Kat_0e09.html" title="Kit Kat">Kit Kats</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Arthur invents different card games, like "San Diego Scooby Doo", and makes up rules for these nonexistent games. He tries to get Doug's friends involved, but they are not interested.</p>
<p>Arthur once tried to convince Carrie's law firm to file a lawsuit against <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Clark_2b95.html" title="Dick Clark">Dick Clark</a> because he never got the full year's supply of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rice-A-Roni_8a46.html" title="Rice-A-Roni">Rice-A-Roni</a> that he had been promised after an appearance on <i><a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid_%28game_show%29.html" title="Pyramid (game show)">The $10,000 Pyramid</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>. At first, the lawyer refused to take the case (mainly because he never watched <i>The $10,000 Pyramid</i> in 1976 — he was in grade school at the time; and he added that the show has been off the air for years), but in the end, he got enough <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rice-A-Roni_8a46.html" title="Rice-A-Roni">Rice-A-Roni</a> to last 30 years, in addition to the original supply he was promised on the game show.</p>
<p>Arthur Spooner also served in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> in at least the Italian theatre and in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Battle_of_the_Bulge_4a6d.html" title="The Battle of the Bulge">The Battle of the Bulge</a>. While it is unknown what unit he was a part of, it may have been the US <a href="../../../8/2/n/82nd_Airborne_Division_9932.html" title="82nd Airborne Division">82nd Airborne Division</a> since it is one of the few Divisions that served in Italy and The Battle of the Bulge.</p>
<p>Arthur keeps forgetting the name of Doug's friend <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Barone_2c70.html" title="Ray Barone">Ray Barone</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Romano_a5d5.html" title="Ray Romano">Ray Romano</a>, <i><a href="../../../e/v/e/Everybody_Loves_Raymond_2d09.html" title="Everybody Loves Raymond">Everybody Loves Raymond</a></i>), who has scheduled a round of golf with Doug. Arthur calls the sportswriter "Randy", "Rory" and "Petey", but never "Ray" or "Raymond", and when he meets Ray's mother <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Barone_ff41.html" title="Marie Barone">Marie Barone</a> (<a href="../../../d/o/r/Doris_Roberts_9d65.html" title="Doris Roberts">Doris Roberts</a>), he denies ever seeing anyone named Raymond that day. He even flirts with Marie, apparently not knowing that she's already married to <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Barone_d60f.html" title="Frank Barone">Frank Barone</a> (<a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Boyle_a192.html" title="Peter Boyle">Peter Boyle</a>), who had made a cameo in an earlier <i>King of Queens</i> episode featuring Ray.</p>
