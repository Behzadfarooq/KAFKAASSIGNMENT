<p>A vague list with no criteria for inclusion or exclusion. There is no definition of success and the article seems to have an English speaking county / US bias. It's basically uncited and probably unverifiable for the aircraft listed. As a side note, it was prod'd but de-prod'd by an anon user and the initial contributor of the article is now indef blocked. <a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 03:07, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I neglected to mention that the list is very subjective. For example, the Harrier jump jet is listed as successful while the History Channel also includes it in its Modern Marvels: Engineering Disasters 6 episode decrying its design flaws.<a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/~avitv/avcatalog/66901.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfsu.edu/~avitv/avcatalog/66901.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> A user on the talk page also questions inclusion of the C-130 based on its accident history. Additionally, due to the lack of a definable, concrete definition of successful, almost every aircraft could probably be considered successful in one respect or another or the aircraft would not have reached production. --<a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 03:35, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I believe a major problem with the current article is that instead of using a single measure of "success" and clearly defining it, it uses varying criteria that seem to have been arbitrarily chosen. The list would be better if it used a single criterion, such as "List of aircraft with the longest production runs" or something like that. Of course, lists like that run the risk of going against the idea that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, but that's for another time. --<a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETachikoma_4c40.html" title="User:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#8652B9"><i>Kyok</i></font></a><a href="../../../t/a/c/User_talk%7ETachikoma_1ad2.html" title="User talk:Tachikoma"><font face="arial" color="#BA55D3"><i>o</i></font></a> 13:05, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, although weakly. Yes, there is a problem with the criteria for "success"; AFAIAC any aircraft that flies is "successful", since <i>man will never fly</i>. Were it moved to a list of aircraft produced in largest numbers I'd be inclined to keep it. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of TlÃ¶n</a> 15:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup. How is this "mind-bogglingly subjective"? There are perfectly good criteria for "success" (albeit several different ones), and some are used here: <i>most ordered and produced commercial airliner</i> sounds successful to me. Clearly in need of cleanup, but a reasonable list. I see no problem at all with having several different criteria used; for example, "most manufactured", "longest in use", and "most profit" could all reasonably be thought of as criteria for success. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 15:52, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for insurmountable NPOV and OR issues. No objective definition of "successful" is possible. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:03, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>rename</b> because of the above comment suggest that a type of POV may be perceived in the term "most successfull". I suggest the new list be called: "List of sucessfull and poppular aircrafts". Also, remove any information which is not properly sourced. ie.: If "airplane A is very successful/popular" (which means it is in the list) then there should be a quote/reference to who said so. This avoids a violation of <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>. If we say, according to, a survey from ABC inc., Airplane A is very popular, then Keep that information. Prior to any deletion the relevant sourced information should be verified and transfered to the <b>new list</b>. Finally, even though popularity is subjective it is less a contreversial theme than successfullness. Nevertheless, popularity is sometimes harder to evaluate and is subjective. Ironically many wikipedians believe popularity is a reason for inclussion or exclussion. <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_fuel_cell.html" title="Water fuel cell">Water fuel cell</a> is not that popular but it is an article. Also, sucessfullness and popularity can both be measured and hence are <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empirical.html" title="Empirical">empirical</a>. Empirical data is not subjective. It can be measured by a specific amount and devided by a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_denominator.html" title="Common denominator">common denominator</a> to give specific stats. These stats should be utilised if possible in this list. I may be correct to assume that those who vote because they believe the issue is subjectivity that perhaps it was your way of saying "that there is a lack of emperical data or referencing?". --<a href="../../../f/r/_/User%7EFR_Soliloquy_489e.html" title="User:FR Soliloquy">FR Soliloquy</a> 18:12, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b>:Objective criteria for inclusion is cited at wikipedia's rules here at <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>. Properly sourced information should be suficient enough for inclusion. If <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Stern_a7e1.html" title="Howard Stern">Howard Stern</a> says "I cut my pubes last night.

Then I think, considering the good source I provided, it should be included in the appropriate article. Similarly, if the information is well sourced... ie.: Toy's R Us offers or did offer a helicopter and it is <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/sm-thomas-and-friends-harold-the-helicopter--pi-2266630.html" class="external text" title="http://www.toysrus.com/sm-thomas-and-friends-harold-the-helicopter--pi-2266630.html" rel="nofollow">documented</a> (note: this link is not a UH-61 helicopter) then it should be included. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 19:41, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The list doesn't need to be all-inclusive to be valid. Claiming it was all-inclusive would be a POV issue, but simply listing proably successful aircraft against various measures seems quite valid. Providing proper references to substantiate claims would make it acceptable. I do agree the title reads as horribly objective, but the claims made can be substantiated.
