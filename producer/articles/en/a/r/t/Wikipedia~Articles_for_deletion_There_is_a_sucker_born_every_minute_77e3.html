<li><b>comment</b> - I am putting this up near the top, because people aren't reading the whole discussion. <b>There are zero credible sources that claim Barnum ever uttered this phrase.</b></li>

<li><b>keep</b>: Disclaimer, I started this article.
<ul>
<li>When I started the article I did link to <a href="http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxtheres.html" class="external text" title="http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxtheres.html" rel="nofollow">one of my sources</a>, which, unfortunately, subsequent editors seem to have removed. So, the article is not really "based on speculation" as nominator asserts.</li>
<li>Can someone please explain what possible advantage a merge offers?</li>
<li>There are four articles that link to this article. Three of those article <b>already</b> link to PT Barnum. Readers who read those articles, and decide they want to know about Barnum can follow those links. Readers who want to know about the famous phrase, can follow that link.</li>
<li>The phrase is famous, whoever first coined it, famous enough it is part of our cultural short-hand. As such it merits an article of its own. The phrase nets over 50,000 google hits.</li>
<li>If this material, which I consider important, is merged into the PT Barnum article, someone can come along, and make the decision to delete it, without realizing that will damage the value of other articles. If it is left in article of its own, future nominators can check to see if other articles link to it. I will suggest to CLW that this should be part of their checklist if they make future {afd} nominations. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 17:25, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Possibly the strongest argument as to why the phrase merits an article of its own, rather than a redirection to PT Barnum, is the frequency with which the phrase is used, without explanation, or reference to Barnum. Here are a handful of examples:</li>

<li>Because stub-sorting is a pain in the buttocks, because quality of articles is more important than quantity, and because when a new user enters something in the search box or clicks the <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">Random Page</a> link and gets fed an article consisting of only a few sentences, it reflects poorly upon the encyclopedia as a whole.

<dd>LOL! Welcome to the club. May I just take a moment to clarify: when I said that the fact of Geo Swan's having created another Firesign-related article was an unworthy thought, I meant exactly that. His edit history makes it abundantly clear that he is <i>not</i> a single-issue wonder, but an editor with a wide history of interesting added content. I know I am sometimes prone to irony - Geo Swan, please accept my apologies if the comment was misread in any way, I was actually having a go at myself, not at you.

<li>Freak of Nature, thanks for offering your explanation. I don't know what "sub-sorting" is. But, it seems to me that your concern about new users being turned off, when they click on the Random Page link, merely reveals a flaw in the implementation of the Random Page code -- one that could be fixed with a sensibility filter that didn't show pages that fell below a certain threshold of edits or sentences. WRT new users please consider the comment I posted to Dalbury's vote below, where I suggest thought experiment. If you are going to base your vote based on new users I think you have to consider the frustration and inconvenience a merge poses for readers who go to the page because they want to know the background of the phrase, and, instead, are taken to a completely different page, a biography, or someone they may never heard of. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 11:35, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>The fact that the phrase is often used without attribution is pretty irrelevant. "To be or not to be" is often used without attribution, but it still belongs to Shakespeare.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The merge votes, I think, are a little rediculous in this case. Sure, the fact that PT Barnum didn't actually say it would stay on his page, but the other people would be deleted as irrelevent on that page.

<ul>
<li>That is a strawman argument. No one is suggesting that every misattributed quote merits an article of its own. The phrase merits an article because it is widely used, and has long ago entered our cultural shorthand. Most instances of its use don't explain its meaning, or attribute it to Barnum. The wikipedia should have an article devoted to the phrase to help out those unfamiliar with the phrase, or those for whom English is not their native language. Merging to Barnum is a disservice to those who want to use the wikipedia to find out the phrase's background. Here is a thought experiment. Go to one of the articles that links to this one. Pretend you have never heard of Barnum. Now pretend you clicked on the link, because you were interested in the phrase, and you got taken not to an article about the phrase, but to some guy from the 19th Century named Barnum. Let me suggest that, if you were a new user, your first reaction would be, <b>"This wikipedia is not as useful as people claim. WTF would it take me to a biography of this 19th Century guy, when I told it I wanted to know more about that phrase?"</b> -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 11:35, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> and redirect to Barnum. Do we really need articles for <i>every</i> famous quote? Sorry for my language now, I am just making a point: The quote "<a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck_you.html" title="Fuck you">Fuck you</a>" is a much more used quote than the Barnum quote, but it isn't an article of itself, but redirected and a part of the article "<a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a>". By the way, the Barnum quote should be listed as "trivia" in the Barnum article since it is uncertain whether he said it.

<li><b>comment</b> - I want to address those of you who identify yourselves as <b>"mergists"</b>. I understand that some of you feel an aesthetic affinity to merging. I get aesthetic affinities too. I get aesthetic affinities for doing things certain ways, or making things look in certain ways. But, what I have to acknowledge, is that those aesthetic affinities sometimes screw me up.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It seems like most people who want to merge this article into PT Barnum are prompted by an aesthetic sense. The merge feels right to them, because all merge suggestions feel right to them.</dd>
<dd>Some instances of making things look right really are incredibly useful and important. An instance of that here on the wikipedia would be we the see also and external references sections. There is a project to go through all the articles and regularize their usage. Making all our external references appear as regular as possible, makes it easy to find the particular parts we want. With instances like this, once we get used to putting things in a regular format, we internalize that format, so we can recognize it at a glance, and can recognize when it is not in that format, at a glance. And our aesthetic sense kicks in, so we feel dissatisfied when <i><b>it just doesn't look right.</b></i></dd>
<dd>But that aesthetic sense can really betray us too, lead us into bad decisions. There are certain kinds of tasks where I am tempted to use my favourite tools. I want to write a script, make use of some regular expressions, to automatically select some stuff, and make transformations. I think I am good at it. I estimate it won't take very long, and I will feel an aesthetic satisfaction doing the task that I wouldn't feel if I made each change by hand. But it turns out I made some typos, or didn't fully appreciate the special cases, and I have to write several drafts. I find myself reluctant to admit when my aesthetic sense betrayed me -- when brute force manual editing would have saved time and prevented errors.</dd>
<dd>We have to be disciplined about how we allow ourselves to exercise our aesthetic sense. We have to recognize that even the best aesthetic rule, which</dd>
<dd>Merging can break things. It will break things in this particular instance. Three of the four articles that link to this article <b>already</b> link to PT Barnum, right in the same sentence or a neighbouring sentence. So, redirecting this phrase to PT Barnum breaks those articles, by putting a second, deceptive link to PT Barnum near the real link to PT Barnum.</dd>
<dd>That sucks. Its broken. Let me suggest this merge is a misapplication of your aesthetic sense. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 12:20, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Geo, here is how I see it: people will go to the Barnum article and expect to find reference to this comment, due to widespread popular (mis?)attribution. Note that the references are not actually conclusive on that score. Therefore, the Barnum article has to mention this phrase, even if only to say he never said it. It would make sense to cover it twice if (a) there was a substantial likelihood of people entering this phrase as a search term (which I don't think there is, and anyway the search would find the Barnum article), or (b) there was substantial additional encyclopaedic content, which I don't see: beyond Barnum-specific discussion (which again ionvolves redundancy as it has to establish the background of the quarrel, which is properly done in the Barnum article), there isn't much to say. It's an aphorism, people use it. This is not a dictionary of aphorisms. If there is a list of aphorisms it would probably be listed (as it is in my dictionary of aphorisms) as widely but probably erroneously attributed to Barnum. You've seen what Bartleby has to say: <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/cgi-bin/texis/webinator/sitesearch?FILTER=colQuotations&amp;query=there%27s+a+sucker+born+every+minute&amp;x=14&amp;y=10" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/cgi-bin/texis/webinator/sitesearch?FILTER=colQuotations&amp;query=there%27s+a+sucker+born+every+minute&amp;x=14&amp;y=10" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. So, I support a merge for maintainability, avoiding duplication, and ease of use because I can't see what other <i>encyclopaedic</i> relevance it might have, this not being a dictionary of aphorisms and all. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 12:29, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

I was in the process of closing out this AfD when I came to the conclusion that I so strongly disagreed with what appeared to be the majority opinion that I'd rather express my own opinion and let somebody else close it out. Given how popular the phrase is, and how it appears that Barnum did not actually say it (which I've heard before), I think it deserves to stand on its own. The Barnum article should reference this one.
