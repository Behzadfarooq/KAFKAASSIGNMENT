<li><b>Delete</b> This article has no coherent thesis. It contains only abstruse and arbitrary POV selections of undefinedly "successful" automobiles, consisting of one individual's pet makes and models—straight POV, as it seems. It might be marginally appropriate as a "top ten" blog même, but it is most unencyclopædic. An article specifically and narrowly listing longest-running vehicle models <i>or</i> longest-running vehicle model names <i>might</i> be debatably less inappropriate. Either is arguably just as trivial and unworthy of Wikispace as the present article. <b>NOTE TO KARMANN:</b> I agree with you that racial slurs have no place in Wikipedia (except perhaps as illustrative examples in an article about racism), but your unnecessarily strident language is not helping your case or winning you allies. --<a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7EScheinwerfermann_3853.html" title="User:Scheinwerfermann">Scheinwerfermann</a> 02:55, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I do not necessairly agree with the language used by Karrmann, but the article certainly doesn't belong in Wikipedia due to its inherent POV. Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 19:34, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, although not for the reasons given - a badly written article only desrves to be edited, not wiped out. The fundamental, unsurmountable problem with the article is that the only way to measure success without violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is to measure <i>sales</i>, and the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bestselling_vehicle_nameplates.html" title="List of bestselling vehicle nameplates">List of bestselling vehicle nameplates</a> already exists (although it needs tidied as well). Any other measure of success would be a subjective review, not an encyclopedia article, and that's what this is.</li>

<li><i>Comment #1</i> ~ I think the List of automobiles that were commercial failures (aka List of automotive flops) also deserves an AfD. It at least tries to measure failure by the only objective method, but fails to cite a single source or even, in many cases, mention numbers. And while we're at it, the equally subjective Category:Cult Cars deserves to be deleted for the same reasons. <a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">Wiarthurhu</a> routinely exhibits a lack of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> in his writing, but so do you, <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarrmann_9858.html" title="User:Karrmann">Karrmann</a>.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, What constitutes a vehicle as a successful vehicle? It just plain doesn't make sense. Technically any car that sells enough to make the money back for <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research_and_development.html" title="Research and development">R&amp;D</a> can be considered a success. I say this list is a waste of time. <b><a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERen0_d6f5.html" title="User:Ren0"><font color="#0000AA">ren0</font></a></b><a href="../../../r/e/n/User_talk%7ERen0_72a3.html" title="User talk:Ren0"><font color="#000000"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 21:32, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Comment #1</i> ~ Does nobody see what else I see? This list would be impossible to maintain as any car that sells at least enough to cover Research and development can be considered a successful car. I can understand the list of failures (note; Ford Pinto.) But this list would be entirely too hard to maintain and judging what cars are successful from what aren't would be damn near impossible. Hell, i'm sure some of the cars not on this list are considered successful (hence the reason they are still around) by their manufacturer. This list is a waste of time, whether there is Point of View or not. <b><a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERen0_d6f5.html" title="User:Ren0"><font color="#0000AA">ren0</font></a></b><a href="../../../r/e/n/User_talk%7ERen0_72a3.html" title="User talk:Ren0"><font color="#000000"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 03:20, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As creator of this article, this is meant to measure success by longevity of the nameplate or niche, so this makes possible including long lived cars which might have a lower sales volume, such as the Nash/AMC ambassador. Also rather than just being a list, it has a short commentary on how a car might have earned, or paradoxically gotten such a status despite apparent defects. Most of the articles are sourced to citations that also say the automobile in question was notably a sales success. I continue to be apalled by the exclusionary and negative attitude of so many WP editors who have identified themselves above, and practiced the tactics I have highlighted on my user page as being distressing, especially deleting articles entirely. Deleting articles is usually because the article causes some sort of harm against an individual or party, that is certainly not the case here, and most of the entries are sourced. I am especially surprised by Karmann who contributed an especially low-quality article on the Taurus, which I upgraded in terms of facts and reduced POV, but was reverted. Karmann has since contributed only complaint tags, and now this undeserved AFD. I would encourage all involved to participate in refining the writing and adding other cars, not kicking it down. --<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 21:04, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I do not have any interest in the "debate" between the nominator and the article creator. I agree that Mediation is probably the best route. I went through and did some POV rewrite. It's far from perfect but I'm hitting a road block with sources. Another issue that I'm seeing is with the name. How is a "Successful automobile" being defined? The original intro paragraph didn't lay out the definition in an objective, encyclopedic matter. I do think the article's editors need to better establish this parameter or else the article really has no where else to go. As for the AfD, I'm personally abstaining from voting. It's my opinion that the article still needs a lot of work but I do not know how interest the article editors are in going that path. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 01:17, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> It started out as long-lived nameplate, and got changed. The current defintion is that the nameplate, or similar nameplates must last over 20 years, and be cited elsewhere as being conspicuously successful, preferably outside of WP, though an existing WP article will do. I would suggest changing it back to longest running to distinguish it from the similar, but slightly different list of bestselling cars. Might be a good idea to put a very short limit on summaries, the top selling article does have a few one-line comments. --<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 01:22, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
