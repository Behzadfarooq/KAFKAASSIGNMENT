<li><b>Keep</b>. No evidence this is a vanity page; original author has worked on a slew of articles in the general debating field. It's really inappropriate to see the "vanity" label so capriciously thrown around in disputes without even a minimal effort to verify it.

<li><b>Delete</b> - It is not the world championships - It only applies to university students. I wonder what would happen if someone put up bios for everybody who won a gold medal at the University Games (sport). The other thing which concerns me is that it only applies to the English speaking world, eg AUS, USA, UK and CAN (compare to <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Mathematics_Olympiad_4e01.html" title="International Mathematics Olympiad">International Mathematics Olympiad</a>, Physics, etc, where there are many countries, and especially communist countries and some others, where the education dept of the government will separate talented students into separate maths/science academies for years and get professors to train them - are they eligible, maybe I should put their articles also; this is a much higher standard of scrutiny/pressure than a university club). I'm also less inclined to keep because debating is by nature extremely subjective, so that it is harder to extablish credibility (ie. skill). <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> 02:33, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, it looks quite internatinal to me from looking at the page - teams from South Africa, Thailand, Barbados, Israel, and Bosnia have participated. You're disinclined because debating is subjective?! So is figure skating and hundreds of other activities, but that's no reason to not have an article on people who have won notable events. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 04:22, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

I've spent quite a bit of time trying to clean up that article, and was confident that the user was the vandal.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Thank you. Proving that someone uses two different IDs doesn't mean anything if they don't use both of <i>those IDs</i> to vote. If you can <i>prove</i> that User:Master and Commander and User:Wiki4Life are the same, that's another story because they both actually voted. Regardless, it's up to an admin to decide what to do. Personally, I think the self-defense by Master and Commander should be restored as well since it may weigh in on the discussion. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 15:37, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

I am not the Matthew Vassar vandal; all I did was remove twice remove boxes that TrinityC invented, which were not in accordance with wikipedia rules. Syrthiss also advised TrinityC "against placing their own made up vandalism notice" on the article. TrinityC is the only person who has accused me of sockpuppetry and vandalism. Please do not make false accusations about me. Furthermore, I am not User:Wiki4Life, and I do not see how my three word vote is almost identical to Wiki4Life's. There are a number of 3-word votes that are identically worded, but they are not accused of sockpuppetry; the reason for this is that it's standard format for a vote. Again, I ask you TrinityC to stop making accusations against me, especially in light of the warning you already received about this. Thank you. Master and Commander 11:24, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: For the records, I <b>strongly object to the removal of User:Master and Commander's vote and self-defense</b>. The proof is that User:Master and Commander and User:128.12.20.66 are the same but those two IDs have not been voted in this Afd. The secondary accusation is that User:Master and Commander and User:Wiki4Life are the same - and that's the basis for the vote deletion. That secondary accusation has not been proven as far as I can tell. For all I can tell, Wiki4Life could be someone that just recently created a user account.

<dd>He is a sockpuppet with User:128.12.20.66 - that is clear. It is not so clear that he is a sockpuppet with User:Wiki4Life. As far as I can tell, User:Wiki4Life and User:Master and Commander should each be allowed to vote. Where is the duplicate vote? —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 14:07, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My point is that it is a bad faith vote from a bad-faith user and vandal. He is simply objecting to this debater's bio because he is also a debater and his own vanity bio has been rejected from being grafted onto the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Vassar_cad2.html" title="Matthew Vassar">Matthew Vassar</a> article as he has attempted to do many times. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrinityC_f178.html" title="User:TrinityC">TrinityC</a> 18:24, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You claimed sockpuppetry, not bad faith. You don't appear to have proof of either. Even if you're right about both, it's in very bad taste to remove other people's comments/votes. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 18:38, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, it's pretty clear there's proof of both. But sorry for removing the comments/votes; I did not realize the etiquette on Talk pages is different than on article pages, and that we should leave vandal's comments in place and just annotate them with criticisms. Which is why I've fixed it now. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrinityC_f178.html" title="User:TrinityC">TrinityC</a> 18:51, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is no proof that the same person voted twice here. That's what sockpuppetry is. Using two IDs is not sockpuppetry - it's only when they are used for ballot box stuffing. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 19:12, 16 February 2006 (UTC)
