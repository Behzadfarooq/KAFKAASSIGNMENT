	    <p>Excellent! Flonight had kinda already suggested that. It was just a matter of getting the conclusion part some peer review and then wording it properly which if you visit the article you can see I struggle with and have been stating all along. <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 11:48, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As to Zeusnoos please get Ed (as he told me to refer to him) to email me back. I was trying to get more of the article reviewed. One of the reasons it has been slow is cause he appears to have stopped responding after the first review of the article I submitted to him. I have nothing from him for 3 weeks. I am still struggling to articulate the article. As you can see from the edits yesterday on it before I visited and first posted in this discussion. I agree it needs SOME work but to delete the starting point from a diverse book that covers the topic is bad. Also get Ed to validate this to me. I can post his emails here if anyone needs verification on my end. I can only go by what I have. I have been trying to get him to respond and he appears to have fallen off the planet. If Ed has issues then this is the first I have heard of them since no such complaints have been issued from him to me. Besides I think he's pretty cool and from the phone conversations I have had with him I think is it was a gift from the god to speak with such a kind and incredibly intelligent person. PLEASE ZEUSNOOS GET PROFESSOR MOORE BACK IN TOUCH WITH ME. PRETTY PLEASE WITH CHERRIES AND THOUSAND DOLLAR BILLS ON TOP. <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 12:14, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"<i>but that it should not maintain the format of a book review of one source. As close colleague of Dr. Moore, I do not think he actually looked at the article on wikipedia but a section that you sent him through email. He did not understand the structure and purpose of wiki. We personally talked about this two weeks ago and he never visited this site. I came here partly out of curiosity from our conversations, and was disappointed with the structure of the topic."</i>This is almost completely counter to the email Dr Moore sent me. This does not add up. Dr Moore himself is a known contributor to Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. He suggested I use his articles on Plotinus and Neoplatonicism from that Online Encyclopedia for reference. I literally sent him the Neoplatonicism and Gnosticism page I didn't included the table of contents. If he had fault with it why send me in an email that the article was OK? Also why not reprimand and or correct the article then. Or at least after your discussion with him why did he not contact me to let me know something was wrong? <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 14:49, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS Hey Zeus do you know John Dillon? He is the coolest... Hey can you get him on the board? Dear God that would be the coolest ever. For REAL. I am like a total fan of his work and his teacher Armstrong are the most excellent! Hey could you get him to add and or edit some of my articles? Any articles? That would be so bad*&amp;@@, man! I love his work he is a total geniues. Man you have PERSONAL access to neoplatonic scholars. What about Turner do you talk to him? What do you think of Morton? Hey if you met with Professor Moore was it at the university or the theology school? Are you from Pennsylvia? <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 15:24, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PSS If you can ask John Dillon something for me. Ask him what is his favorite beer. And yes I am completely serious. John Dillon is the bomb man! He is the Mick Jagger, Ozzy Obsorne, (almost the Elvis) of the philosophy world. <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 15:29, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>L, see your msg board for my response (sorry, forgot to sign it). Some of your questions are too personal for this forum. Yes, it's people I meet in neoplatonic and other circles that make life interesting and philosophy exciting for me. Keep in mind that people who teach full time and who are constantly asked to write and speak at conferences are busy people! Dillon is funny and witty to a fault - I think of him as the "Denny Crane" (William Shatner character on Boston Legal) of ancient philosophy. When you're that good, there is a danger of enjoying the attention too much, and of not recognizing legitimate counterarguments. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 15:40, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hahaha you disgust me. You have the coolest friends in the WHOLE WORLD. I can totally imagine Professor Dillon that way. Man I wish I could met people of this caliber. But fair enough of an answer. And thank you for your response (Although I am still jealous beyond words). <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 16:09, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>From the bottom of my heart I hope you are being honest because it would so good for wikipedia to have someone even a fingernail clippings content of the quality of some of the people (Professor Moore included mind you) contributing here. I am unworthy to tie their shoes. Compared to them I am a third rate wanna be at best. But let's get to work. <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 16:12, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Zeus I just read your message. You could not have brought worse news. Dear God. I feel like I have just been punched in the stomach. Wiki aside is EM OK? I can call and leave my email. I apologize I have been trying to get your point addressed now I know why. <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 16:27, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey Zeus try emailing me off of wiki now. <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveMonkey_2979.html" title="User:LoveMonkey">LoveMonkey</a> 16:49, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
