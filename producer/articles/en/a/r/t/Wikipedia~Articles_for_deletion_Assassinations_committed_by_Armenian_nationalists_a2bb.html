<dd><b>Delete</b> I totally agree, going around fishing murderers from a particular ethnic group, all more unrelated one from the other, like the example of the 16 years old kid is unencyclopedic. First, many of those murders have nothing to do with nationalists, example, Behbud Han Jevanshir killing was an act of vengence. Also, giving such a precendent, any person can decide that any ethnic groups murderers can be classified and an encyclopedic article could be formed out of it. To have such a classification, such an encyclopedic position should exist in the first place. I do not go around and post the list of the thousands of Turkish nationalists who murdered Armenians during World War I to then form an article out of it. It is unencyclopedic. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 19:04, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> I would like to present my apologies to Gökhan (and to him only) for having drafted such unencyclopedic content. How could I forget (even for a moment) that the angelic Armenian mind and such ghastly acts like politically-motivated assassination could never be associated. I am sorry Gökhan! It was such bizarre points as, some of these murderous political organizations still being active in one way or the other, sometimes under the same name (we can partition the article according to the different organizations, by the way!), some of the assassins having monuments erected to their memory (such as in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, of all places!), an entire industry functioning around propaganda, for what was it again, oh yes! for "vengence", these people killing priests, mayors, diplomats, without mentioning simple folk, for "vengence", the list of victims reads like the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, for "vengence", and during all that time, their country sinking more and more into the mud, no one investing there, except to keep the hate machine alive. And since a hungry chicken will think itself to be in a corn barn, as we say in Turkish, history is built and re-built again to suit present needs. <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krikor_Zohrab_06cf.html" title="Krikor Zohrab">Krikor Zohrab</a>'s books become best-sellers in Turkey, and there are Armenians who don't know who Elisha Tourian is (from what I could see from a peek in a chat-site). For a moment I had the impression that it seemed familiar and that there was a sickly pattern, which prompted me to start the draft. I thought a list would do good. I am sorry again! <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECretanforever_4f45.html" title="User:Cretanforever">Cretanforever</a></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The list you made is inconsistent and incoherent and many of the assassinations range from the 1890s to the latter half of the 20th century. What purpose would that serve to a reader on Wikipedia? to show that Armenians have had a history of assassinating and killing diplomats? What does the <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khojaly_Massacre_2d3e.html" title="Khojaly Massacre">Khojaly Massacre</a> have to do with "Assassinations committed by Armenian nationalists"? Again, to establish the jurisprudence that Armenians have always had a knack for indiscriminately killing including that of civilians? I might as well create a "Turkish assassins" article that picks up on every single assassination of a foreign diplomat, citizen, innocent, civilian up to and including to the deeds of the Grey Wolves and Ali Agca.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 16:07, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Go ahead! Do it! Assassinations committed by the Grey Wolves! (or Turkish nationalists) Some of which already have distinct articles here to which links can be established (<a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A7elievler_Massacre_e6ce.html" title="Bahçelievler Massacre">Bahçelievler Massacre</a>). Include those on foreign diplomats or other foreign nationals or in localities abroad. Including notable ones that have been attempted. You can put a "See also" link to mass-killings of civilians which have occurred in enclaves (or exclaves, regardless:) where they were known to be influent. Ranging from the 1890's. Including non-definite cases for which notable references have been made to them. (like Ahmet Özkan case in <a href="../../../c/h/v/Chveneburi.html" title="Chveneburi">Chveneburi</a> article where, despite that article's wording, their implication could not be fully established...although it is reasonably likely) I certainly won't put your list on deletion, but let you develop it.

<dd>Being cynical or sarcastic isen't an argument at all. No one is telling you to not creat pages about certain individuals. Here the question revolve around the article which you have created. <i>Assassinations committed by Armenian nationalists</i> say it all, it is a list of names, and there is no way that from such a subject there could be an encyclopedic article. I don't appreciate your tone, words like 'angelic Armenian mind' evidence(and I hope not) an ulterior motive in creating such an article, which would justify its existance.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> There is such a concept as ethnic terrorism - there is no question about the veracity of the data, although it is incomplete, many more names can be added. In case of so-called assassinations committed by Armenian nationalists it can be re-phrased as assassinations (inlc. attempted) by Armenian Secret Army of Liberation of Armenia (ASALA, on US State Dept list of terrorist organizations), or Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutsyun party), or Hnchak party, or otherwise "Armenian terrorism". If there can be Islamic terrorists, Irish, Basque or Kurdish terrorists ("nationalists"), Iranian or Syrian state sponsorship of terrorism -- i.e., all pointing to a specific nation or ethnicity -- why can't there be Armenian terrorism or "Assassinations committed by Armenian nationalists"? The latter is actually a less harsh wording. The page should undoubtedly be improved, perhaps rephrase its title -- but removing it completely? It obviously shows a certain pattern, and that pattern has been identified as such by several sources. Also, I've raised a similar question here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ramil_Safarov&amp;oldid=62438842" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ramil_Safarov&amp;oldid=62438842" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> - there is a page about a certain Lt. Ramil Safarov of Azerbaijani army. Whilst more famous than perhaps any other Azerbaijani Army Lt., at the same time there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of Azerbaijani and Armenian (as well as other) junior officers in any given army who kill, or get killed, committ atrocities or are victims of such. Thus, I raise the question, why should Ramil Safarov have a page in Wikipeda -- he is just one of the victims, who has killed himself and saw killings all around himself coming from a refugee family -- and not Armenian Army Lt-Colonel, much more senior in rank, Pargev Abrahamyan, who also used an axe, but to kill his wife, not enemy combatant? Everyday rapes and murders and other grave crimes occur in both Armenia and Azerbaijan - whilst unfortunate, still, why should they be written about in an encyclopedia? --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 13:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> As I stated above, it would be fairly easy to put separate headings for <a href="../../../a/s/a/ASALA_768c.html" title="ASALA">ASALA</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/s/Dashnak.html" title="Dashnak">Dashnak</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunchak.html" title="Hunchak">Hunchak</a> actions within the article to make it look more like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ETA_attacks_32f0.html" title="List of ETA attacks">List of ETA attacks</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronology_of_Provisional_IRA_actions_cbf4.html" title="Chronology of Provisional IRA actions">Chronology of Provisional IRA actions</a>, and I also agree that its main flaw is (and perhaps will always be) incompleteness. I object the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> relevance here though: Articles may not contain any previously unpublished theories, data, statements, concepts, arguments, or ideas; or any new analysis or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, arguments, or ideas that serves to advance a position. All info here has been collected from previously published sources, to which I put direct links. There is no analysis or synthesis, it's a list of events. A killed (or attempted to kill) B at this place and at this date and in this manner.

<dd>Yes, I think they are worth copying in style, tone and nomenclature. However, it may be better to have an article for each of the ASALA/anything else you want to add. Chronology of PIRA actions does not include OIRA, RIRA or INLA ones, nor should it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 12:05, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'll do that Angus. I changed my vote in that understanding. <a href="../../../a/s/a/ASALA_768c.html" title="ASALA">ASALA</a> acts are already on the article for that organization. They just need to be wikified a bit. Therefore, I will draft something like Acts of assassination by Dashnakists etc. And Elisha Tourian and Moscow Metro Bombing, among others, certainly deserve articles on their own. <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECretanforever_4f45.html" title="User:Cretanforever">Cretanforever</a></dd>
