<li><b>Save</b> Encyclopedia- a reference work offering comprehensive information on all or specialized areas of knowledge. As long as the data is appropriate for all ages, it should be fine. After looking through your “deletion policies,” I have found nothing on “Mandarin Tigers” that has violated these rules. If you could be so kind to try and point them out. So far the only thing I have seen on this deletion entry is: “Wikipedia is not for things thought up in class.” Shows how well you examine things before deletion. Show me a quote where you thought that this creature was “made up in class.” Also, how do you think most scientific theories were created? Didn’t Einstein create his 4 theories while working at a patent office? And the very internet that this site depends on? Some person even went so far as to call it a hoax. I’ll just speculate that none of you have even seen Bergen, so I will rest my case that you have no idea what you are talking about.</li>
</ul>
<p>1. <b>Primary (original) research-</b> The Tiger wasn’t my idea, but I did research it. 2. <b>Original inventions-</b> Its not my invention. 3. <b>Critical reviews-</b> The entry is kept strictly unbiased. <b>4. 5. and 6.</b> have nothing to do with the Mandarin Tiger entry <b>One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they should refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by reputable publishers-</b> It is a fact that tigers appear at Bergen Catholic, and many people are interested in the subject. Who is a more reputable publisher then an eyewitness to every single event? <b>A fact is an actual state of affairs, which can be an historical event, or a social or natural phenomenon-</b> Mandarin Tiger spawning are not only a piece of history for Bergen Catholic, but is a social and natural phenomenon as well. <b>One common temptation for young editors is the urge to share new phrases, fashions, or ideas that they or their friends have invented. Writing an article on Wikipedia might seem like a great way to do this -- after all, if you enjoy this new fad, won't other people appreciate it too?-</b> Mandarin tigers are not a fad. The entry on them does not explain how to create one in great detail, and only is listed in order to give some background. We are not encouraging people to create them, just explaining the history.</p>

It is more than debateable that if a unicorn no matter of its fame, being a mystical creature conjured in the imagination of another...a "original idea" if you will which falls under the policy of deletion as do all the topics that i gave the links to, that a mandarin tiger is a myth just the same which becasue of all in favors of deletions opinion of the topic it is in violation of the deletion policy. I propose that though this (mandarin tiger) is a myth,, your unicorns and leprechauns are just the same, and so in since the only difference between them is that you wish to delete our myth and keep another, and that ours is not as widespread in fame but then again the only way for the Mandarin Tiger to gain the reputation of the unicorn it must be spread to the public through sites such as this as a historical myth of a real place: Bergen Catholic High School case closed -Peter Coyne <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.81.99.10 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.81.99.10.html" title="User talk:67.81.99.10">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.81.99.10_a397.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.81.99.10">contribs</a>) 02:57, 9 May 2006.</small></p>

<p><b>Save</b> "Pathetic little inside jokes?" You know what's a joke? You and your argument with no facts to back it up. How would you seriously expect anyone to believe your little "study" on Wikipedia? Other encyclopedias don't need you volunteers because they can't be changed. "Volunteer Fact-checkers?" Did you think of that clever title all by yourself? I hope you do realize that anyone with the mentality of a five-year-old could run this site. My "prank" wastes their time? Anyone who thinks being a "volunteer fact-checker" is something cool to do, they obviously have way too much time already. As for it being a prank, everyone has still failed to prove it so. Its interesting how you all leave a comment and then run away from the computer so that you don't see how much you are ripped apart in these entries. <i><b>WHY DON'T YOU CHECK THE WHOLE PAGE, AND THEN COMMENT.</b></i> Or is even that out of your aptitude for reading? And if you think one organized tiger page is too much for Wiki to handle, try a thousand angry students with all the time they want during school to paste little Mandarins into every single Wiki article. Your blocks are too easy to skirt anyway, so don't think you are protected. AA Savage 17:56, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually, the study that showed that Wikipedia is legitimate is a real study. It was in a lot of magazines, for example: <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/online-encyclopedias-put-to-the-test/2005/12/14/1134500913345.html" class="external free" title="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/online-encyclopedias-put-to-the-test/2005/12/14/1134500913345.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/online-encyclopedias-put-to-the-test/2005/12/14/1134500913345.html</a>. The "Mandarin Tiger" is not an actual creature. I am basing this assertion on the fact that there is no record of it existing anywhere. By nothing I mean no scientific studies, no captured specimins, no published papers, etc. It is your job to prove that this creature is real, not the job of the fact checkers to prove that it isn't. I am willing to believe that the Mandarin Tiger is an idea that is important to your high school. But this is too small a group to support its inclusion as an entry on Wikipedia. Also, saying that being a fact-checker is a waste of time is very judgmental of you. What do you do with your free time that is so important? <a href="../../../c/c/l/User%7ECClio333_c8a1.html" title="User:CClio333">CClio333</a> 20:03, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>See, now you go and waste my time. If you read the above, then you would realize that the "Mandarin tigers aren't real argument" has already been tried by you Wiki people, and destroyed. Once you delete all the other mystical creatures entries, then you can come back. Again, it is not a hoax, as we all have said before, it is a historical document, that is updated as required.

<li>It isn't that they are fictional. As I said, it is because it is not a fictional creature believed in by a large enough group. Dragons, unicorns, etc., have been a part of world cultures for thousands of years. Even the Flying Spagetti Monster has thousands of people who use it as a cultural reference. Look at that website if you want something to model yours on - they do not claim that the FSM is real, only that it has relevance to a large segment of society. They explain exactly what the idea behind it is and link to a <i>large</i> amount of outside sources that have referred to it. But the Mandarin Tiger still doesn't qualify because is only relevant to a handful of people and therefore not important enough to merit an entry. I agree with the person above who suggested it as a <b>subcategory</b> on your high school page. But your argument that because there are other fictional creatures on the site you can make up whatever you want is not a valid argument.<a href="../../../c/c/l/User%7ECClio333_c8a1.html" title="User:CClio333">CClio333</a> 21:02, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tsk Tsk Tsk. How many contradictions can one man possible make? "The "Mandarin Tiger" is not an actual creature. I am basing this assertion on the fact that there is no record of it existing anywhere. By nothing I mean no scientific studies, no captured specimins, no published papers, etc. It is your job to prove that this creature is real, not the job of the fact checkers to prove that it isn't." Well then you can prove the unicorns are real. "As I said, it is because it is not a fictional creature believed in by a large enough group." Stop changing your mind, it doesn't help your argument. How is it not important enough? Last time I checked, there wasn't a restriction on how many people had to know about it. Don't make up rules. Also, if you don't consider an entire school, then how many people should have to know about this. And as for your website, all I found was some statistics that did not prove your argument, and some jokes aimed at Wiki. "almost as accurate as the online Encyclopaedia Britannica, at least when it comes to science." First of all, wasn't your statement "And they did a study that showed that Wikipedia is more accurate that Encyclopedia Britannica." Not more, but less. And take a look at that last part of the Magazine quote: "at least when it comes to science." Why would it be science? Whats wrong with histo. . . . Oh Yeah! that's right . . . . Wikipedia doesn't like Mr. Seigenthaler. Where were your "Volunteer Fact-checkers" then? My counter-point, not argument, was that you can't exclude certain animals, because they are more recent. Once again, the Mandarin Tiger is a historcal entry, not a fictional hoax. Everything on that entry is true. And adding things to the Bergen Catholic entry never worked, everything tried has been deleted. Believe me when I say that one Mandarin Tiger page isn't a problem, compared to thousands all over the entire site. Scroll up BJAODN. I have already told you why my entry doesn't break these rules. How do you all edit pages, if you don't know the first thing about reading. Here's a tip: start from the top and go down.

<li>I was wondering if you would actually read the article. You are absolutely right, the article only deals with the scientific articles of Wikipedia. But the goal of the people who treat Wikipedia seriously is to make it as accurate as possible in ALL areas. That is not an unreasonable goal because there are sites like Urban Dictionary for people who just want to have fun. It is unreasonable and immature for you to argue that because other people vandalize (and get caught) your site should be allowed to stay. Also, I don't think you understand the difference between the mythical creatures articles on Wikipedia and the mandarin tiger article. Regarding the unicorn article as an example - the unicorn article does not refer to it as a real creature. It refers to it as a "legendary creature" and does not use the definate language that is used in the mandarin tiger article. Unicorn horns are "said to" have healing powers, but your mandarin tigers "can" fly and become invisible. It seems like a minor thing but changes the whole tone from one of scientific skepticism to baseless assertions. Maybe if you phrased things that way on the school article people would stop taking them down, but I looked through the page's history and didn't see the attempts that you were talking about. <a href="../../../c/c/l/User%7ECClio333_c8a1.html" title="User:CClio333">CClio333</a> 23:24, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If I say so myself, I persoanlly think that Wikipedia is extremly corrupt and bias towards what they allow on their website. You guys are very hypocritical when you allow unicorns and such to be on the site yet you exclude the Mandarin Tigers. Also, i would like to ask a few questions: Are livestrong bands a school carze, fad, and a fashion? Yes they in fact are considering I walk around the halls at school and about one in three kids has one. On this note, has there been scientific reaserch, a book, or an academic paper published on a livestrong bad? No, there has not. So why should it be allowed on Wikipedia. Oh and... if anyone thinks that livestrong bands are legitimatly on this site because Nike has written numerous magazine articles on it, then whats stopping Nike from writing any old article to be posted on Wikipedia. What I am saying is: Wikipedia says that it wants to obtain the sum of all human knowledge when in fact a "Mandarin Tiger" is part of the sum of all human knowledge. I think you should change that to "the sum of only a select few 'Fact-checkers' knowledge", which in my opinion, is not much at all.&#160;;) 24.56.143.101 00:26, 10 May 2006 (UTC)Chris, Thaureaux (Long live the Mandarin Tigers!)</p>

<li>Check and Mate. "But the goal of the people who treat Wikipedia seriously is to make it as accurate as possible in ALL areas." Thanks, I believe that Mandarin Tigers fall under the category of "ALL areas." Here is something for you: www.reading-tutors.com Try that for a month or two then come back here. How and where did you find anything remotely close to "It is unreasonable and immature for you to argue that because other people vandalize (and get caught) your site should be allowed to stay." in my statements? The only thing I ever said about vandalism, was that in the magazine article you gave me, there were jokes played on Wiki. Anything else you get from that sentence means that you have some sort of hallucinatory disorder. I see what you mean with the sentence structure, which I fixed, however, many people edit that page, so I lose track of what the original entry was like. That's what you fact-checkers are for right? You should make sure it stays in the proper context, and if it isn't then change it. As for the school article, it has been tried to add a <b>Culture</b> section, but to no avail. In conclusion, quit pointedly skipping over some of my points, and only answering the ones you can. It doesn't say much for your comprehensive skills. And for you "Grandmaster" what material were livestrong bands published in? A shopping catalogue? "does little towards that end." but it does do something. "as many people here refuse to be convinced no matter what reason we provide." HA-HA Reason? you mean you and your Wiki buddies going "l00k t3h WP:NFT!!! t3h 5k00l cr4z3!!!" Meanwhile we actually respond to this, and then you skip right merrily over it, and put up warnings for people not to enter their thoughts, because YOU ARE BEING SHREDDED!!

<p><b>Save</b> - Everyone opposed to this article keeps dodging the fact that there are other made up characters that are on Wiki. And you claim that they are there because they have a lot more people that believe in them. BIG DEAL, more people will catch on to the Mandarin Tiger, just like they did for the first "warlock" or whatever. The warlock had to start somewhere, and the Mandarin Tiger has to start here. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanBC08_e4a7.html" title="User:DanBC08">DanBC08</a> 13:06, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Right! Warlock started as an idea; so does Mandarin Tiger. But Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought, so Mandarin Tiger can't start here. Seriously, though, if Mandarin Tiger <i>does</i> get published in a reputable publication, Wikipedians will gather to make an article about the glory that it is. But until then, we just can't have it. <a href="../../../h/y/e/User%7EHyenaste_70a2.html" title="User:Hyenaste">Hyenaste</a>&#160;<sup>[<i><a href="../../../h/y/e/User_talk%7EHyenaste_720f.html" title="User talk:Hyenaste">citation</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hyenaste_5b75.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hyenaste">needed</a></i>]</sup> 13:12, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i><b>Save'</b></i>: The mandarin tiger is not a hoax. You cannot say that simply because you've never heard of it before. True it is a made up creature but there is a myth of a mandarin tiger Bergen Catholic. Let me just say this. How do you think we know about the cultures of the few still uncivilized groups of natives and tribes left in the world? (and by uncivilized i just mean they are untouched by modern society) People go out and study them. And that is just what we are doing with the myth of the mandarin tiger. Maybe it isnt real but all we are doing is studying the myth and recording it for posterity. You say that not enough people belive in it, well how about a school of almost a thousand, when those tribes i said earlier only had 1 or 2 people studying them? The only way more people will know about those tribes or the mandarin tiger is if it is allowed to be recorded where people see it.

<li><b>Delete</b>. My 6 year old German cousin knows what dragons, leprechauns and unicorns are. No one in Texas has heard of a Mandarin Tiger. It has no place on Wikipedia.
