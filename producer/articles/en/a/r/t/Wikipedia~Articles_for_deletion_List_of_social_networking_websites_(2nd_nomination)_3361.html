Rather than having a 50 long bullet list at the end of every article on this list for similar sites, its spun off in one link to a list. Spinning off long sections to new articles is long practice on wikipedia. This article is well watched to remove any spam. These links do not link (at least they shouldn't maybe they need checked) directly to the websites and instead link to their wikipedia articles. As for it being a directory, its not. its not different than a see also section of any other article on any other subject. The subject has simply become so large and encompassing so many articles that it is better served as a single article.

This is a neutral message, identical to the one which was posted last summer when this was up for deletion. Many people watch those articles, but don't watch this article, even though its deletion would effect the article. They would have to work some kind of lengthy see also list into their article were it to be deleted, or then work on a policy for which sites should be listed as see also, because if they try to artificially limit it, you're going to have people constantly trying to add to it. It would be very different if I were to say go about targeting individuals who I know always make keep statements or who I know shared my opinion. The message is neutral, bipartisan and open.

<dd>Your assumption that I was being dishonest when I left a neutral message on a few article talk pages which I openly disclosed here when I did it is you assuming bad faith. I didn't attempt to hide the messages or leave messages which would indicated I wanted people to leave comments indicating it should be kept or deleted. Consensus is built on input. The more input, the better the consensus. If you have some evidence that I made a statement or attempted to influence the way people commented here, feel free to show it.

<dd>Thats right and my intent was rather clear from the accompanying edit you left out which is above, where I was honest and forthcoming about the neutral and non-partisan messages I left on the talk pages of articles which would be effected by the outcome of this discussion. You cannot selectively pick edits out of a group and claim you know my intent while ignoring the one edit which did explain my intent. You can continue to assume bad faith if you like, but I was quite clear on my intent and you still haven't show even the slightest hint of anything I did that could be seen as attempting to sway the AfD in a particular direction, because there isn't anything. And as pointed out above, question doesn't mean subjected to personal attacks, which your own definition that you've given twice clearly indicates.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 05:07, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hence your assumption of bad faith. Perhaps you cannot remain neutral in asking for input after taking a stance on an issue, but I have no such trouble and you made a bad assumption. And again you continue to make insults. You assume I wasn't being neutral, but I've challenged you several times to indicate where in the messages I left there was any degree of partisanship. As you've failed yet again, and only continue to hurl baseless insults and accusations I believe we're done here. My edits and behaviour stands on their merit. There wasn't a remote hint of partisanship in the messages I left, there was unchallenged precedent for those messages being left on related talk pages, they were completely neutral in tone, and honestly, this AfD isn't remotely contentious as not a single person has shown up to agree with you that it should be removed. In fact I'm surprised an administrator hasn't closed it on the basis of speedy keep or WP:SNOW at this point. I was also forth-right and honest in the fact that those messages asking for input per those reasons would be left, as soon as they were challenged, I ceased leaving them. You've been asked to stop assuming bad faith and to stop making personal attacks, as you've failed to do so the discussion on my part is done here.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 07:20, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Crossmr. Unlike most lists, this one is actually well-referenced and appears to follow <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> guidelines. The Talk page seems to be patrolled fairly well, keeping random blogs and forums out. Could probably still use a trim, but a useful resource. For once. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 04:57, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> The most notable social networking sites have articles, "social networking websites" has better relevance as a (self-maintaining) category, instead of an external link directory/repository. --<a href="../../../h/u/1/User%7EHu12_d0ca.html" title="User:Hu12">Hu12</a> 05:17, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It only contains notable social networking sites (sites which already have articles here). Good for a quick comparison of the sites for determining relative notability. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 07:43, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, all of the articles in this list have their own wikipedia page, so the list is a perfect way of creating easy navigation for those articles. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 09:44, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, these are all valid subjects with their own Wiki pages, as already mentioned. The external links are there to help verify their existence, not ostensibly to generate traffic to those sites. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefsworldlee_b298.html" title="User:Refsworldlee">Refsworldlee</a><sup><a href="../../../r/e/f/User_talk%7ERefsworldlee_0ef0.html" title="User talk:Refsworldlee">(chew-fat)</a></sup> 14:04, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, such lists are encyclopedic and are appropriate. The list is linked only to Wikipedia pages of the site which are notable. And the list is often maintained, so there shouldn't be a big problem removing non-notable sites from the list. It is for information purposes, not for advertising. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">Terence Ong</a> 14:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I often use wikipedia to get generic information about terms, definitions, example etc. But sometime, I need to get real life examples and this list work great for this for Social Networking. --195.115.78.114 14:36, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as a central "see also" list for all of these sites. It's not a mere "repository of links" - it's a list of Wikipedia articles, giving some information about the differences between the sites (which has should be considered notable per our guidelines to have had an article created about them in the first place). What harm is it doing? <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 18:36, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">User:Crossmr</a>. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 19:27, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, any article I actively search for has got to be useful. Found this today, and it gave me the data I needed. --163.1.165.116 20:29, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- this is not just a list of links, it is a taxonomy of of an important and rapidly growing field <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.143.164.192 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.143.164.192_81ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.143.164.192">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, again, per all above, per <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>, and also for the following reasons: This list serves more detailed information than a category could, and allows users to compare various social networking services. The article is well-sourced. Finally, it includes only to social networking sites whose articles survive on Wikipedia, and links to the Wikipedia articles about them -- this is not an external link haven. --<a href="../../../c/z/j/User%7ECzj_f490.html" title="User:Czj">Czj</a> 07:25, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, this is one of the most useful pages when I was researching social network services. Unless this list gets merged with one of the social network/network-service articles, I think it should be kept as it's valuable information. 90.192.79.203 08:55, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> A legitimate and sourced list. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHonbicot_fd59.html" title="User:Honbicot">Honbicot</a> 22:43, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per all above. --<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReal_decimic_bdc9.html" title="User:Real decimic">real</a><a href="../../../r/e/a/User_talk%7EReal_decimic_00c7.html" title="User talk:Real decimic"><font color="#FFB903">_</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReal_decimic_bdc9.html" title="User:Real decimic">decimic</a> 03:56, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This article is extremely useful to Wikipedia; it provides a summary of verifiable information about notable articles which many people are interested in. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 05:32, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Extremely useful; provides an up-to-date list of projects in a very important industry. JiriDonat (tock) 9:00, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per reasons above. Great resource for research. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilchama_b61a.html" title="User:Milchama">Milchama</a> 16:37, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Withdrawal of deletion nomination</b> consensus on Keep was established quickly, appears to have a fairly Good layout, better than most lists. I still believe this would be better served as a (self-maintaining) category, however, by watching edits to the article during this Afd, it apears to be maintaied well from the recent spam attempts. I believe that to be the most important aspect, and main reason for withdraw. keep it up!--<a href="../../../h/u/1/User%7EHu12_d0ca.html" title="User:Hu12">Hu12</a> 17:11, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
