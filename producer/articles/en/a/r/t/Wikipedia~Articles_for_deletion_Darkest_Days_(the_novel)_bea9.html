<li><b>Delete</b> Article is ad copy, <s>book has been pushed back to next year</s> (withdrawn, vote remains delete). The creator has not contributed anything that doesn't relate to this book or its author, so I expect they are either the author under a pseudonym or a paid publicist. The creator has already created a category for this author's books. I'm putting them all to Afd and CfD.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. &amp; previous comment--except to note that publication hasn't been "pushed back". According to the article, the publisher <i>just purchased the rights two months ago</i>, and it typically takes 6 months to a year (if not longer) for a book to go from manuscript to publication. And it sometimes happens that publication rights are purchased but not exercised, so this novel might not ever make it to print. This is a book that doesn't exist--not even, as far as I can tell, as an item on the publisher's list of forthcoming titles. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShelfSkewed_60bf.html" title="User:ShelfSkewed"><font style="background:LightSalmon"><b>ShelfSkewed</b></font></a> <a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShelfSkewed_da15.html" title="User talk:ShelfSkewed">[Talk]</a> 18:05, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>DO NOT DELETE</s></b> (duplicate vote) This article is completely verifiable. Pan Macmillan is a major publisher. The comment herein stating that the novel's release has been delayed is unfounded and false. I confirmed with the publisher that the release date has not and will not be delayed. In fact there are indications that he novel's release will in fact be accelerated. All of the factual information on the author was aquired via an interview with said author and may be confirmed by contacting him directly via the posted website links. The comments above rely heavily on unfounded opinions and do not constitute valid support for deletion. The creation of catagories is meant to facilitate finding information useful to those researching this author. As a new contributor there has not been time to contribute information to other areas. Wikipedia is an incomplete informational source if it is not including information on all authors published or soon to be published by a major publisher. This is not a vanity novelist that is self published by a vanity press. The attacks upon this article sound in personal attacks, by individuals apparently uncomfortable with the subject matter of the novel itself. Rather than making the effort to research their assertions they have chosen to engage in speculation that disregards the factual support behind the infomation posted. If their assertions are based in fact then provide the factual support for the claims made. Deletion of this article on the basis of the arguments made by the other posts in this forum would constitute a viloation of Wikipedia's deletion policy and could perhaps appear to be discriminatory in nature.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Edwin Roik (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwin_Roik_872d.html" title="User talk:Edwin Roik">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Edwin_Roik_ec44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Edwin Roik">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wow, somebody has a vested interest in this article. This has nothing to do with the subject matter, and how the book is published makes no difference.

If and when the book is published and makes a public impact, consider putting the article back. Until then, wait. Also, considering the fact that you're talking to a guy that shows anti-Bush documentaries on the sides of walls in bad neighborhoods: <a href="http://iraqforsale.bravenewtheaters.com/screening/show/5687" class="external autonumber" title="http://iraqforsale.bravenewtheaters.com/screening/show/5687" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, your assumption that I'm disturbed by the content of the book is laughable. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 19:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> When the book is published, we may judge its notability. Even major publisher release books that end up remaindered within a month.

<li><b>Comment</b> "Noted author"? Do you have some evidence of notability that nobody else has discovered? If so, please share. The funny thing is, I have some genuine respect for Mr. Gallon--for having the discipline &amp; patience to sit down and write a novel, for finding a publisher, and for not sitting on his behind and waiting for the book to sell itself. And maybe he'll turn out to be the next <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Brown_5a02.html" title="Dan Brown">Dan Brown</a>, and this entire discussion will become moot. But right now, he's just another writer with a book coming out, and there are thousands of those every year, and very few of them will rise to the level where they deserve Wikipedic notice.--<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShelfSkewed_60bf.html" title="User:ShelfSkewed"><font style="background:LightSalmon"><b>ShelfSkewed</b></font></a> <a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShelfSkewed_da15.html" title="User talk:ShelfSkewed">[Talk]</a> 14:05, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
