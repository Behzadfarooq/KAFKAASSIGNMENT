<li><i>Comment:</i> I BEG your pardon! You are the guys who force me to write it: if they hadn't put the article up for deletion, I wouldn't have had to write the stuff below. YOU CAN'T DELETE AN ARTICLE BECAUSE YOU HATE THE AUTHOR. JUST THE FACT THAT YOU PLACED THAT PARTICULAR COMMENT MAKES YOUR OPINION BIASED AND MEANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO DISCUS THE ISSUE FURTHER. And if I do say so, the above reason is the biggest BS I've seen in my life. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Rubin_a08c.html" title="User:Ian Rubin">Ian Rubin</a> 02:10, 16 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, I've seen a dozen webcomics, many of which I would have considered more notable than this, go up for VfD in the last week, all of which were unanimously deleted. And two, I don't particularly like how you reply to every comment on this VfD, and at least I'm being honest about it (unlike the multitude of trolls who would vote <i>Strong Delete</i> on a website they dislike without comment). (I know, I know, I shouldn't feed/bait the trolls, but it's just so fun!) <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 02:32, 16 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All right, so I'll stop replying to everything here. Just watch what you say: the only reason I reply to everything is that I want this article to stay, and I'm trying to tell people who don't like that why. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Rubin_a08c.html" title="User:Ian Rubin">Ian Rubin</a> 02:43, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. So? How many articles have you written?! I've encouraged people to edit this <i>MANY</i> times, and anyone who feels it should be changed can do so by editing it. Why didn't either of you do so? The comic has a large following, and even though on hiatus, still attracts people. Now, would you delete the <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabrina_Online_4e48.html" title="Sabrina Online">Sabrina Online</a> article if it didn't have enough Google hits?! How many hits would I get if I typed in "Gwalla"? <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Rubin_a08c.html" title="User:Ian Rubin">Ian Rubin</a> 11:38, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment:</i> You can check my contributions list if you want to know what I've done. Incidentaly, Googling "gwalla" gets about 265 hits, but it hardly matters because there is no wikipedia article about me, and I have never claimed to merit one. My nomination has nothing to do with how well the article is written, but whether the <i>subject</i> merits an article. The paucity of google hits (particularly for something that is entirely Internet-based) and complete lack of Alexa data suggests that any following it has is not large. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 01:19, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment:</i> Well, more people will know about it and create a larger following if they know about it. And this is definitly the place for them to find out about it. Have you even read it Gwalla? I wouldn't have created an article on it if I didn't feel it deserved an article. I even put this up to a vote: I only went with what the people wanted. If they didn't want an article on this site, I wouldn't have taken the time and effort to make the article. I have re-editted the article so that more information is available. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Rubin_a08c.html" title="User:Ian Rubin">Ian Rubin</a> 02:54, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Suggestion to Mr. Rubin:</i> Try to keep replies to comments directly under the message they are intended to reply to, not with votes in between. That having been said, I have never even heard of the comic in question until I saw it on VfD. That having been said, if comics were excluded just because they were defunct, we should nail Absurd Notions, <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalon_%28web_comic%29.html" title="Avalon (web comic)">Avalon</a> ?, and several others. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 03:22, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Comment:</i> "Well, more people will know about it and create a larger following if they know about it. And this is definitly the place for them to find out about it." may actually argue against inclusion, as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a medium for promotion. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 06:16, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Comment:</i> I'm not trying to advertise Brent Bowser's work. (He can do that on his own if he'd like.) Carried by the Wind has as much a right to be here as any other web comic. You wouldn't delete Tales of the Questor, would you? Have you even read Carried by the Wind? It meets a majority of the requirements for web comics. REPEAT: I AM NOT TRYING TO ADVERTISE THE COMIC!!!! I am only giving people the oppourtunity to find out about it. Every article on this site attempts to acheive this purpose. If they have never read the web comic, and want to know what it's about, they can find out. I wouldn't recommend any of your articles for deletion because of low search engine hits, and neither should you. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Rubin_a08c.html" title="User:Ian Rubin">Ian Rubin</a>
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i> I'm going to have to play Devil's Advocate here and point out that "giving people the opportunity to find out about" something <i>is</i> advertising. Having said that, one of my own webcomic articles (<i>By The Saints</i>) has also been nominated for deletion...by the same User, I might add...leading me to suggest that the deletion policy for webcomics may be overzealous. <s>Unfortunately I'm not sufficiently familiar with CbtW to vote for inclusion on merit, so I must <b>Abstain</b></s>. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_M_8833.html" title="User:Lee M">Lee M</a> 19:45, 15 July 2005 (UTC) Change to <b>Weak Keep</b>, having read the Archive. Sketchy artwork and incomplete storyline, also confusing use of flashbacks. OTOH, interesting concept, story and characterization. Now if only he'd finish it... <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_M_8833.html" title="User:Lee M">Lee M</a> 15:35, 17 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment:</i> Okay, I could have phrased that better. A LOT better. You all know what I'm trying to say. Say for example, you see a referance to CbtW somewhere and you don't know what it is. Where do you go? Wikipedia. This site has articles so that people can find information on a subject. Don't you think that CbtW is a subject? <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Rubin_a08c.html" title="User:Ian Rubin">Ian Rubin</a> 21:53, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i> I think the point here is that webcomics are considered for deletion on the grounds of obscurity. There must be thousands of articles on obscure towns, movies, songs, politicians, buildings, TV shows, books, mathematical formulae and subatomic particles. None of those articles ever seem to get deleted on the grounds that nobody's ever heard of them, and yet that is precisely the policy that is being followed in the case of webcomics. I definitely think the Alexa rule on webcomics should be rethought. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_M_8833.html" title="User:Lee M">Lee M</a> 01:09, 16 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i> Songs (as well as albums and bands) have to pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> first, which is about one order of magnitude more stringent than most webcomic inclusion proposals. While I do agree that the Alexa test should definitely not be the be-all and end-all concerning webcomics, there are few ways to determine the notability of a webcomic (the other is longevity, which is what the second proposal covers). <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 02:28, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
