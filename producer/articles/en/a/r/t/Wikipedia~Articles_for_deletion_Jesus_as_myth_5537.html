<p>This entire page smacks of original (albeit well-referenced) research. Yes, there are plenty of citations, often lacking in the most flagrant OR violators, but the article is rife with assertions like "If Christianity had originally evolved as a localised mystery religion, then not only should there be parallels between the scriptural narratives of Christianity and myths from the mystery religions, but there should also be parallels with more outwardly things such as religious rituals, and imagery." and "Aside from potential parallels with Gnosticism, which can be investigated more directly, other significant features of Pythagoreanism might have entered into early Christianity, and their presence would add support to a position advocating that significant parts of early Christianity, or all of it, derived from mystery religion." Again, it's an interesting read, and is even persuasive in its thesis, but <i>that's the problem.</i> It's an essay, not an encyclopedia article, and is irrevocably so. <b>Delete</b> as original research. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 19:35, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> From the third paragraph, "The question of whether Jesus derives to some extent from myth (including 100% from it) requires academic analysis of the available evidence from times near-contemporary with the dates for Jesus' life, and on analysis of how reliable such evidence is, and what their biases are." The article then goes on to perform such an academic analysis. Again, yeah, it's well-written, but it's pure OR. I don't know how salvageable it is, given that "academic analysis" is in this article's DNA. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 23:59, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If Wikipedia can have an article on <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a>, it can certainly have an article on the historical authenticity of a potentially mythological religious figure.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. It needs a POV tag for the meantime, but sources on the topic are certainly available in abundance (I can think of the <i>Testimonium Flavium</i> off the top of my head). There is no reason to delete this article, because it is not irredeemably condemned to being original research. Whoever wrote it, I can guarantee, would not be the first person to have written about the possibility that the Jesus figure is a myth. If just needs a bit of fixing, that's all. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 08:35, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems that many of the unverified assumptions and "original research" in this article are actually from people <i>opposing</i> the subject. For example, "there is no formally peer-reviewed work advocating this extreme limit of the Jesus-Myth theory". That is absolute nonsense, there has been much scholarly work on the subject: for example, <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Nietzsche_159c.html" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> wrote about the subject extensively. Simply because the subject of an article is uncomfortable to some people does <i>not</i> mean it should be deleted. The entire concept of a "Jesus-Myth" is just not one person's original research. The article should, perhaps, be renamed, though. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 08:47, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Another Comment</b> After reading this article carefully, it should be clear that <i>this is not original research at all! It is, on the contrary, one of the more scholarly and well-written articles on Wikipedia.</i> Statements like those offered in the nomination do not contravene original research policies. Here is a relevant quote: "However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia". I am beginning to wonder if this AfD is not the result of an ideological objection to the article, not the nature of the article itself. The idea that what is written there constitutes OR is preposterous. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 08:59, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It has citations, but it editorializes and theorizes, and does not cover facts (such as Josephus) without being immediately deleted. The article is too abrasive to e npov for both sides and it should be deleted, started anew, and made much shorter to limit those using wiki to editorialize.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Wikilagata (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikilagata_ff5b.html" title="User talk:Wikilagata">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikilagata_b305.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikilagata">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> First of all, this is not OR. Yes, it says that "academic analysis" is necessary, but then it <b>summarizes</b> the analysis which has been performed by others, who are identified in the text, in notes, or in the reference section. I agree that the sources for some sections need to be identified more prominently, but that's no reason to delete the article. Second, it doesn't matter if any of us think the "Jesus as myth" theory is questionable, bogus, or even offensive. It's an idea that has had quite a few supporters for over a century. It has influenced books from <i>The Golden Bough</i> to <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>. It is encyclopedic and noteworthy. Third, the article does have some POV problems and probably always will, because the subject matter stirs up strong feelings in some people. But that's a reason to work on improving it and covering all points of view as fairly as possible. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaestlin_04d4.html" title="User:Maestlin">Maestlin</a> 20:00, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a> - I do not see any bigger difference between the themes of the two articles, and <i>Historicity of Jesus</i> is definitely better, because it does not give us an answer to the Jesus puzzle in advance.--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 20:34, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> And what is their substantial difference? I see mostly similarities and still do not believe that it is reasonable to split the single theme into two articles.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> As I understand it, <i>Historicity of Jesus</i> is about the question of whether Jesus existed, and what evidence is available to answer the question. <i>Jesus as myth</i> is about using the tools of mythologists to analyze accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus, which may or may not lead to the conclusion that Jesus never existed. Such analyses are often carried out by people who want to show that Jesus is totally fictional, but some have reached the conclusion that he was a real person, or possibly real person, whose life was mythicized. I acknowledge that the last viewpoint is not well reflected in the article as it currently exists, but that's a POV problem. The article title has been changed a few times recently; the current incarnation is not great, I agree. Do you have a recommended name? <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaestlin_04d4.html" title="User:Maestlin">Maestlin</a> 21:51, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_Jesus_f6e4.html" title="Historical Jesus">Historical Jesus</a> - A reconstruction of Jesus' life using all available information.

<li><a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a> - An examination of all available texts which mention Jesus (and text from that period which do <i>not</i> mention Jesus)</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Myth_0ae6.html" title="Jesus Myth">Jesus Myth</a> - A theory which states that Jesus is most likely a mythical character since all of the elements of Jesus' story can be found in prior myths.

</dd>
<dd>The difference between the last two articles is that the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a> focuses on ancient texts, while the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Myth_0ae6.html" title="Jesus Myth">Jesus Myth</a> focuses on ancient myths.

<ul>
<li>Article is not entirely written from a neutral point of view and suffers from multiple undue weight issues. For example, much of the "Parallels with non-Christian myths from the first century" subsection gives undue weight to material rejected by serious Egyptologists. For another example, the article as a whole does not adequately explain why the theory has been generally rejected by the academic community, thus giving the article as a whole a NPOV failure. However, I do not believe the article is inherently a violation of the NPOV policy, so am not now prepared to suggest deletion. <b>Keep and clean-up</b> is thus my recommendation. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 21:05, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or seriosly overhaul. This is no encyclopedia article but an essay arguing a point (probably very persuasive to those unacquainted with historiography).

<p>- The tone of the article has a clear 'agenda'. The agenda is to discount the historicity of Jesus. As such it should be re-written and merged with <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_jesus.html" title="Historicity of jesus">Historicity_of_jesus</a>. The additional misuse of the title of this article amounts to a type of vandalism when cited in other Wikipedia articles dealing with (for example) Christianity (See also, Jesus as Myth], Christ (See also, Jesus as Myth] and other similar materials. The article is not balanced, but is rather an essay that attempts to debunk christianity. Is the information important? Yes. However, the title is inflamatory and biased as is the overall tone of the article. Would we permit articles entitled "General Relativity as Myth", History as Myth", Israel as Myth, Moses as Myth, Exodus as Archaeological Myth? I don't think so. This article, as titled, sets a dangerous precedent. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Charles_Webb_5c27.html" title="User:John Charles Webb">John Charles Webb</a> 10:33, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The reason to include "myth" in the title is to differentiate it from the main article on <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, since that article seems to take the POV that Jesus was a real person despite evidence to the contrary. It is only inflammatory to people who believe this myth is represents a real historical figure. If billions of people believed that Zeus was a real person, Wikipedia would probably have a page titled Zeus Myth. But since everybody agrees that Zeus is a mythological character, there is no need to specify that an article with the POV that Zeus is myth takes that position. If there was a theory that Zeus <i>was</i> a real person, there would probably be an article titled "Zeus as an historical figure". But, since most people think that Jesus was a real person, an article which discusses the mythological origins of Jesus' myth necessarily has to specify this in the title. And the reason that this article is different from the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_jesus.html" title="Historicity of jesus">Historicity_of_jesus</a> article is that the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Myth_0ae6.html" title="Jesus Myth">Jesus Myth</a> article focuses on the mythic origins of Jesus, whereas the other focus on ancient texts which mention Jesus (and the texts which <i>should</i> have mentioned Jesus but do not). The <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Myth_0ae6.html" title="Jesus Myth">Jesus Myth</a> theory certainly is a logical extension of the facts mentioned in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_jesus.html" title="Historicity of jesus">Historicity_of_jesus</a> article, but the latter discusses history whereas the former discusses a particular theory concerning origins of the Jesus myth. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Brother_1984_991e.html" title="User:Big Brother 1984">Big Brother 1984</a> 12:00, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> The use of the word "myth", in this instance, reveals a bias. A balanced presentation would provide enough information to allow the reader to determine whether or not Jesus is a myth. The title implies that the matter has already been decided. The Jesus Myth essay, standing alone, implies an endorsement of a particular point-of-view. If I drafted an article entitled "The Democracy Myth" then the title alone implies the tone of the content. The Wikipedia articles are designed to present un-biased verifiable information. If someone wishes to propose a new naming convention, they can do so on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions</a> while also publicising the proposal at Requests for comment and the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_Pump_1a2c.html" title="Wikipedia:Village Pump">Wikipedia:Village Pump</a>, as well as at any related pages. Once a strong consensus has formed, it can be adopted as a naming convention. (portions of text quoted from Wikipedia Naming Guidelines) Also, part of the definition of the word 'myth' is: A fiction or half-truth, especially one that forms part of an ideology. A fictitious story, person, or thing. As such the article's title (as well as its content) is biased and in violation of Wikipedia Policy. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Charles_Webb_5c27.html" title="User:John Charles Webb">John Charles Webb</a> 18:47, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply to the Reply</b> By that same logic, the page on <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_Denial_7a44.html" title="Holocaust Denial">Holocaust Denial</a> should be renamed since it is implying that "Holocaust Deniers" are denying that a real event occurred, assumedly in order to push some sort of anti-Semitic agenda. The article is called "Holocaust Denial" not to indicate a POV, but rather to identify a fringe theory and separate it from mainstream views on the Holocaust. It is a page about the theory. And while it is true that the proponents of the theory certainly have a POV, the article need not necessarily have a POV. All it need do is describe the theory, and cite some of the claims which support it (with accompanying criticism of the theory where justified). This is what the Jesus Myth article does ... it describes the theory, and explains some of the key components that make up the theory. Any page which describes a theory has to explain that theory's POV. You couldn’t write an article an evolutionary theory without explaining that POV any more than you could write an article on Creationism without explaining <i>that</i> POV. Does that mean that neither of these articles should exist? Are we really prepared to remove all articles which describe a theory from Wikipedia simply because they explain a POV? And concerning the name, do you have a better suggestion? Would you prefer "Jesus Denial"? To me, <i>that</i> would be a POV. However, the title “Jesus Myth” seems to be a fitting name for what the article describes – the theory that just about every element of Jesus’ life story has roots in prior myths. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Brother_1984_991e.html" title="User:Big Brother 1984">Big Brother 1984</a> 11:11, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>"'Reply to Replies'" The article does cover a scholarly postion, Jesus as a myth. There is nothing wrong the the title. However, the issue is with how often the article transcends and ignores scholarly viewpoints and just throws in random parallels and assertions.

<li>Very strong <b>keep</b>, minor edit and expand. I would add in discussion of comparisons with Hercules, Jesus as a hero, and are the gospels novels or plays, as well as discussion of fish and Christ. I am coming to the view that xianity has always understood christ to be mythical - fully god fully man - and historicism is a post enlightenment invention. I am sure there are many earlier commentators on this issue than listed here. If you check Catholic dogma I understand they state the idea of a historic jesus is a heresy. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.12.187.227 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.12.187.227_f75b.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.12.187.227">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<p>A Critical Analysis of the opening words of the "Jesus Myth" Wikipedia Article</p>
<p>- The article begins with (text) "The idea that" which presupposes the article's unstated premise. (Who's idea?) (Quote) "The idea that elements of beliefs about Jesus, and the Jesus narrative in the New Testament, are actually syncretisms from myths of his era is a theory usually associated with a skeptical position on the historicity of Jesus." (end quote). - The second sentence (quote) "When taken to its extreme - the idea of Jesus as myth rather than having any genuine historic existence - its advocates often refer to beliefs about Jesus as the Jesus-Myth." (end quote) The sentence is a fragment and has grammar issues. Is Wikipedia going to contain articles discussing 'ideas"? (again who's idea?). - The third sentence which is the beginning of the second paragraph elevates "idea" to "theory" (quote) "The theory is based on apparent similarities between early Christian accounts of Jesus and pre-existing mystery religions, and at the more extreme limit of the theory (that Jesus is 100% myth) is also based in part on the lack of extant evidence about his life outside the Gospels. The extreme limit of the theory has not found widespread acceptance among Bible scholars and historians." (end quote). (How did we get from "idea" to "theory" - is this unsupported original research?). - The third paragraph begins (quote) "The study of whether or not Jesus might be a purely mythological requires academic analysis of the available evidence from times near-contemporary with the dates for Jesus' life, and on analysis of how reliable such evidence is, and what their biases are." (end quote) (What "study"? and another grammar syntax nightmare). - Continuing (quote) "The purpose of this article is not (sic) provide said (sic) academic analysis, but rather to provide an account of research that has been performed into the subject thus far." (end quote). (A total account NO, a biased account, yes! Affirming sources <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus.html" title="Josephus">Josephus</a> are glanced over or summarily dismissed without analysis).</p>
<p>These errors in logic, grammar, sytax and bias are (opinion) pervasive. Clearly the article is not neutral, it has an 'agenda' and the agenda is the debunking of Christianity. It makes statements that are unsupported by reliable sources and forces 'conclusions' upon the reader that are unsupported by the logical (?) flow of the article or available materials. I also strongly suggest that the author(s) familarize themselves with the term <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midrash.html" title="Midrash">Midrash</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Charles_Webb_5c27.html" title="User:John Charles Webb">John Charles Webb</a> 03:35, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Who's idea?</i>
<ul>
<li>As with most theories, it has been contributed to by many proponents. If you read the entire article, you will discover who some of those advocates are and what they contributed. It is not the job of the introduction to list them, just as (for example) the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a> article introduction does not list any particular people who believe in it. On the talk page it has been suggested that since some sources such as John Mackinnon Robertson are absent, a list of notable proponents be created</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>The third sentence elevates "idea" to "theory"</i>
<ul>
<li>A theory is a subset of an idea. If you read the first sentance more carefully, you will note that it is stated that this particular idea <b>is</b> a theory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>What "study"</i>
<ul>
<li>Study as in "consider in detail and subject to analysis"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Affirming sources <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus.html" title="Josephus">Josephus</a> are glanced over or summarily dismissed without analysis</i>
<ul>
<li>A more detailed analysis of the authenticity of Josephus can be found here: <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus_on_Jesus_9e8f.html" title="Josephus on Jesus">Josephus on Jesus</a>. This article is linked to twice.</li>
