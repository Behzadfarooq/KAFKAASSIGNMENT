<p>Band with no actual releases, a link to their Encyclopaedia Dramatica entry and such beautiful lines as "Popular references include... killing your mom and putting her in a van and burning her, and then writing about that shit in their livejournals."<a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 07:24, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A full-length album has been released in mp3 format. The band passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> as a prominent representative of the <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nerdcore.html" title="Nerdcore">Nerdcore</a> genre.

<li>If a "prominent representative of the Nerdcore genre" gets <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Futuristic+Sex+Robotz%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Futuristic+Sex+Robotz%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">344 total Google hits</a>, I would posit that Nerdcore fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. I certainly expect a band that bases its entire music/notability/whatever on the Internet to have more than that. Anyone can release full-length albums on mp3. Shit, I could do a "full-length mp3 album" with <a href="../../../g/a/r/GarageBand_026a.html" title="GarageBand">GarageBand</a>.

<li>Futuristic Sex Robotz passes all conditions for performers outside of mass media tradition. (Note the Daily Tar Heel article.) Your reasoning against the validity of a self released album in MP3 format is lacking; I'm sure you could release a full-length MP3 album using GarageBand, but the fact remains that it's entirely irrelevent. FSR has a large fan base that is primarily propagating the band via word of mouth and on web forums that are *not* being spidered by Google. The music video on FSR's web site has been downloaded 500,000+ times that can be verified (not counting an unknown number of mirrors) and the band has been in the Nerdcore_hip_hop article for months without question. The authors of this article have verified references to establish significant notoriety. Additionally, your original complaint is heavily biased. "Um... yeah, great." While we're at it, let's delete everything else you find personally offensive, shall we? Cellophane 08:20, 23 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Biased? Well, gee, why would I be biased against something I'd never heard of until I stumbled across it on the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> listing? <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 08:31, 23 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>I think the fact that you've never heard of it is completely irrelevant. Clearly this page meets the criteria for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> under "performers outside of mass media tradition", so why don't we settle this one out?

<dd>And a search for "futuristicsexrobotz" (no spaces) yeilds 878 results. A search for song lyric "Yo Coaxke, what's killtacular mean?" -Robotz yields 114, meaning that there are that many people citing lyrics as a pop culture reference who aren't bothering to name the band directly. -Schrodinger82
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Umm...Google compresses most of those results, as many of them are from quoted forum posts. So it looks like eight different forums have lyrics posted to them. 878 results are unimpressive; that clearly is not all nerdcore has to offer, viz. MC Hawking.

Consider the possibility that Google hasn't spidered a significant amount of coverage as of yet. Also, FSR's views about intellectual property combined with the fact that the album is free and not printed on a physical medium make it incredibly unlikely that the band will be recognized by the music industry at large, especially on sites such as allmusic.com.

<li><b>Keep</b> Band has gone beyond simply "making a few MP3s in GarageBand" by creating a music video that has gone on earn fame and even an award for best music video within the Halo community -- a gamne that grossed $125 million US in its first 24 hours. The game itself has several articles written on Wikipedia specifically on fan videos (e.g., red vs blue, the codex series), making it a valid genre to achieve notability in. The video went on to become so popular that it even inspired a group of impersonators who tried to capitalize on their name by calling themselves "Clan FSR," starting their own website, recruiting members, and even creating crossover videos of their own with other groups under false pretenses. (The impersonators were since revealed and most references were removed in embarassment, although you can still find hints of some -- though not all -- of this in google caching.). Google searches are unreliable, for a number of reasons. First, because the name is long, and people may "mispell" the word "Robotz," abbreviate the group, or most likely, simply link to the files directly. Aside from Halo blogs (which are low in number but feature high readership), the main means of promotion for this genre has been livejournal and instant message, which google either doesn't store, or doesn't store longterm. Unfortunately, there's no way to measure that. However, download counts should speak for themselves. Yes, the band has not sold millions of copies, nor has it signed on with a major label. However, the band has managed a strong following for itself within its own (admittingly niche) genre. -Schrodinger82</li>

<li>I cleaned the article up significantly to meet Wikipedia's standards, or at least the standards by which other articles have remained consistently undisputed while documenting subjects of equal or lesser notoriety. Not to rationalize, but does seem to be a common theme. In regards to sock-puppetry, I honestly think this article has attracted an audience that is simply not generally active on Wikipedia as opposed to just throw-away accounts in order to troll/avoid accountability. I am still suspicious that there is a bias against the article based on the subject matter as opposed to whether it actually meets the requirements of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. I would even go so far as to recommend that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> should be improved in such a way that notable acts that are simply not "press friendly" can be gauged in terms of notoriety using a far more consistent and reliable means than the vague suggestion of Google hits. If Wikipedia is not documenting phenomenon, including something as simple as a DIY, underground musical act, that major media outlets *don't* necessarily want the public to know about or are not in a position to cover, that seems to be arguably contradictory to the goals of the project. In many cases, the requirements outlined in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> strike me as absurdly arbitrary. Cellophane 14:46, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

In any case, whether it satisfies it or not, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> needs work. It doesn't specify how notability relates to the varying scope of a genre/style. For example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Dawn_and_Drew_Show" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Dawn_and_Drew_Show" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Dawn_and_Drew_Show</a> There's a precedent right there that if Futuristic Sex Robotz distributed all of its music via a Podcast, this article could in the Podcast category. This 66mb album has burned through 300gigs of bandwidth in 3 days via HTTP alone. That's very arguably no less than the output of a very popular Podcast, relatively speaking.

<dd>You're totally missing my point, though, and that isn't even close to being related to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Podcasts and music are essentially the same medium, not to mention that video is exponentially larger in data than audio. The point is, the album would be considered more than sufficiently notable for an article if it were a wrapped in a 5 line XML document first. Cellophane 15:39, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think I missed your point-- you're arguing that its notable because so many people downloaded it.

<dd>I'm not making the point that an arbitrary number of x downloads automatically equals notability, I'm making the point that relatively speaking, the group is more notable than many other articles that remain undesputed, and Podcasts are the most similar example. Tourette's guy doesn't have an article because it's 1 out of a billion ridiculous videos on the internet. Futuristic Sex Robotz should have an article because it's 1 out of 8 or so notable acts in a notable genre. If you think this article "clearly" doesn't meet music notability, then you're one of the many others looking at this discussion and thinking "group releases album on own with no record deal, it can't possibly be notable," without giving any consideration to the fact that it's been recognized by verifiable sources as a significant member of a genre that is recognized by Wikipedia. It makes absolutely no sense to me as to how this group can be in the artist list of Nerdcore Hip Hop without any doubt whatsoever, but can't have an article of its own. Authorities on that specific genre as opposed to just hip-hop or music as a whole recognize it as meeting the requirements of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nerdcore_hip_hop" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nerdcore_hip_hop" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nerdcore_hip_hop</a> Do you see any argument over whether or not Futuristic Sex Robotz belongs in that article? None. And there's nothing that distinguishes Futuristic Sex Robotz from the others that means that it has to be an external link while everything else has an article. --Cellophane 16:10, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you're wrong, then we aren't ignoring policy. Unfortunately, you're so convinced that you're right, any attempts to reason with you are pointless. Maybe the majority of experienced Wikipedia editors would agree with you, but just because we *don't* agree with you, our opinion must just be a symptom of ineptitude? That's logically false. You need to consider that the standards upon which notoriety is established, however specific they are, are still a matter of personal interpretation.

<dd>Fine, I'll try and convince you. Their only claim to notability is that not many people make nerdcore hip hop. Where do we draw the line? Can anyone make a nerd-rap album and get an article? To this, you might answer that they've been mentioned in a college newspaper and a gaming website. In reply to that, I suggest you read WP:MUSIC which says "Has been prominently featured in any major music media." Neither a gaming website nor a college paper is a major medium or a music medium. Thus, the basis for keeping this is simply that its nerdcore hip hop alone-- a precedent its important we don't allow to be set.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 16:01, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In his defense, from what I can tell: (a) he didn't start the article, and (b) the changes he made appear to be factual clarifications, some of which were more modest than the original wording (e.g., “The Futuristic Sex Robotz are the world’s first ‘Gangster Nerd Rap’ group” to “Futuristic Sex Robotz is a self-described ‘Gangster Nerd Rap’ group”). I do agree, though, that this probably still violates Wikipedia policy (I don‘t, however, agree that it‘s as cut-and-dry as a character judgement).

<dd>How many of your countless edits every day are just pointing out other people's regdates and number of comments? My guess is a lot. Also, if you refer back to WP:MUSIC, you'll see that the criteria for inclusion and proof of notability has been changed, completely nullifying this entire argument. You yourself even quoted the line that was changed earlier in this AFD page, finishing off with something along the lines of "Not only are they not Major media, theyre not music media". Oh well, because major music media is no longer a requirement. So your BASE argument of notability is rendered moot by the changes to WP:MUSIC. But my guess is you're going to stick around until you see this article deleted. Penmoid 18:30, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
