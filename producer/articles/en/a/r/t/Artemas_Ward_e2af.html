<p>Artemas was born at <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrewsbury%2C_Massachusetts_9506.html" title="Shrewsbury, Massachusetts">Shrewsbury, Massachusetts</a>, in 1727 to Nahum (<a href="../../../1/6/8/1684.html" title="1684">1684</a>-<a href="../../../1/7/5/1754.html" title="1754">1754</a>) and Martha Ward. He was the sixth of seven children. His father had broad and successful career interests as a sea captain, merchant, land developer, farmer, lawyer and jurist. As a child he attended the common schools and shared a tutor with his brothers and sisters. He graduated from <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard</a> in 1748 and taught there briefly.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_31.html" title="July 31">July 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/5/1750.html" title="1750">1750</a>, he married Sarah Trowbridge (<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">December 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/2/1724.html" title="1724">1724</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_13.html" title="December 13">December 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/8/1788.html" title="1788">1788</a>), the daughter of Reverend <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caleb.html" title="Caleb">Caleb Trowbridge</a> and Hannah Trowbridge of <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groton%2C_Massachusetts_2ea0.html" title="Groton, Massachusetts">Groton, Massachusetts</a>. The young couple returned to Shrewsbury where Artemas opened a <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_store.html" title="General store">general store</a>. In the next fifteen years they would have eight children: Ithamar in 1752, Nahum (1754), Sara (1756), Thomas (1758), <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artemas_Ward%2C_Jr._0820.html" title="Artemas Ward, Jr.">Artemas Jr.</a> (1762), Henry Dana (1768), Martha (1760) and Maria (1764).</p>
<p>The next year, 1751, he was named a township assessor for <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcester_County%2C_Massachusetts_2429.html" title="Worcester County, Massachusetts">Worcester, County</a>. This was the first of many public offices he was to fill. Artemas was elected a <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_of_the_Peace_ad6e.html" title="Justice of the Peace">justice of the peace</a> in 1752 and also served the first of his many terms in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony_d976.html" title="Massachusetts Bay Colony">colony's</a> assembly, or "general court."</p>

<p>In 1755 the militia was restructured for the war, and Artemas Ward was made a <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">Major</a> in the 3rd <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regiment.html" title="Regiment">Regiment</a> which mainly came from <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcester_County%2C_Massachusetts_2429.html" title="Worcester County, Massachusetts">Worcester County</a>. They served as garrison forces along the frontier in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Massachusetts_dfa8.html" title="Western Massachusetts">western Massachusetts</a>. This duty called him at intervals between 1755 and 1757, and alternated with his attendance at the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_General_Court_a5e9.html" title="Massachusetts General Court">General Court</a>. In 1757 he was made the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> of the 3rd Regiment or the militia of <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesex_County%2C_Massachusetts_9af6.html" title="Middlesex County, Massachusetts">Middlesex</a> and "<a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcester_County%2C_Massachusetts_2429.html" title="Worcester County, Massachusetts">Worchester</a>" Counties. In 1758 the regiment marched with <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Abercrombie_%28general%29_a57a.html" title="James Abercrombie (general)">Abercrombie's</a> force to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Ticonderoga_2308.html" title="Fort Ticonderoga">Fort Ticonderoga</a>.

<p>By 1762 Ward had completely returned to Shrewsbury and was named to the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_of_Common_Pleas_acad.html" title="Court of Common Pleas">Court of Common Pleas</a>. In the General Court he was placed on the <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxation.html" title="Taxation">taxation</a> committee along with <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Adams_5b99.html" title="Samuel Adams">Samuel Adams</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hancock_064b.html" title="John Hancock">John Hancock</a>. On the floor, he was second only to <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Otis_3359.html" title="James Otis">James Otis</a> in speaking out against the acts of parliament. His prominence in these debates prompted the Royal Governor <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Bernard_f56f.html" title="Francis Bernard">Bernard</a> to revoke his military commission in 1767. At the next election in 1768, Bernard voided the election results for Worcester and banned Ward from the assembly, but this didn't silence him.</p>
<p>In the growing sentiment favoring <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebellion.html" title="Rebellion">rebellion</a>, the 3rd Regiment resigned <i>en masse</i> from <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">British</a> service on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_3.html" title="October 3">October 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/7/1774.html" title="1774">1774</a>. They then marched on Shrewsbury to inform Colonel Ward that they had unanimously elected him their leader. Later that month the governor abolished the assembly. The towns of Massachusetts responded by setting up a colony-wide <i>Committee of Safety</i>. One of the first actions of the Committee was to name Ward as <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">General</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander-in-chief.html" title="Commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the colony's <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militia</a>.</p>

Soon, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hampshire_86db.html" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> provisional governments both named him head of their forces participating in the siege. Most of his efforts during this time were devoted to organization and supply problems.</p>
<p>Additional British forces arrived in May, and in June Ward learned of their plan to attack <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunker_Hill_ba2b.html" title="Bunker Hill">Bunker Hill</a>. He gave orders to fortify the point, setting the stage for the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bunker_Hill_ab19.html" title="Battle of Bunker Hill">Battle of Bunker Hill</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_17.html" title="June 17">June 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/7/1775.html" title="1775">1775</a>.

<p>Even during his military service, Artemas served as a state court justice in 1776 and 1777.

The circle contains a statue of Artemas Ward.</p>
<p>Evidently, the great-grandson of Artemas Ward gave over a million dollars to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> on the condition that they erect a statue in honor of Ward. Harvard’s initial offer in 1927 of $50,000 toward the statue was enough for a statute, but inadequate to provide the general with a horse.</p>
<p>The statue was completed in 1938. Although there is no pedestrian access to the circle, the base of the statue bears this inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
