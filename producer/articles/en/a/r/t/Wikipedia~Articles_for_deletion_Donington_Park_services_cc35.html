<li><b>Delete all</b>. These are all individual articles for motorway service stations (<a href="../../../r/e/s/Rest_area.html" title="Rest area">rest areas</a>) on motorways of the United Kingdom. There are a few dozen of these, as listed above; most are genetic and have very little that makes them notable, even apart from one another let alone in their own right. Few of these comprise anything more than a description of where they are and who runs them; some have lacking content warnings, linkless warnings, cleanup warnings. None of the nominated articles is sufficiently notable for inclusion in Wikipedia in my opinion. Many of these articles have been attempted to be deleted before (at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Knutsford_services_599d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Knutsford services">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Knutsford services</a>) but no consensus was reached.

<li>Can I second <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>'s proposal. I don't think this AfD is going to go anywhere for the reasons I wrote below: mass nominations like this never do, in my experience. Let's have a centralized discussion to hash out whether service stations are notable as a class or individually or not at all, then we'll know what to do with the individual articles. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 10:34, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>Redirect</b> to several omnibus articles. Could be grouped by motorway, or by region. Some service stations are, in my judgment, clearly notable - think <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watford_Gap_services_5ca1.html" title="Watford Gap services">Watford Gap services</a>, the first of them, which has a nice long article. An <i>obiter dicta</i> remark: any AfD nomination which includes so many articles is almost bound not to end in a clear-cut result, because there are so many articles that AfD contributors will never bother to read them all, and are unlikely to support deletion just in case there's useful information in the bits they didn't see. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 21:16, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b> Agreed with above. Most of these are stubs and just need expanding. I have fixed the missing links one and propose to go through and expand them.

<li>You guys have to be kidding. Do we <i>really</i> want an article on every rest area in the world? (If you include Britain's I can see no reason why, say, South Africa's rest areas shouldn't also have articles). These things are just not notable, they contain little <i>sourced</i> information (and is therefore <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>)... <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkerpikker_c3cf.html" title="User:Mikkerpikker">Mi<font color="darkred">kk</font>er</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkerpikker_77de.html" title="User talk:Mikkerpikker"><sup>(...)</sup></a> 01:40, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No one is suggesting the same for every part of the world. Service stations are large and prominent facilities on UK motorways. Surely we can look at this issue on a country, by country basis? <a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegan123_9441.html" title="User:Regan123">Regan123</a> 01:58, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. No, unsourced material is not necessarily "original research". This term has started to be bandied around a little too freely in recent months, usually by people trying to support their desire to delete something. It's a good idea to read <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> to see what actually constitutes original research on Wikipedia - it's summarised in the little box at the top. This clearly states the position - stating a fact (e.g. "Donington Park services is a motorway service station off the M1 motorway and A42 interchange near Derby, England") is not original research; advancing a theory which has not been published by a reputable source is. Yes, it's always better to source articles, but don't just dismiss articles as OR because they're unsourced. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 02:09, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ummm... getting on high horses about policy/guidelines is not called for. Please remind yourself of <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> &amp; <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVILITY_dc24.html" title="WP:CIVILITY">WP:CIVILITY</a>, condescending remarks like "it's summarised in the little box at the top" is not cricket. In any case, my OR comment was ancillary, my main point is that these articles are nn. And, Regan123, there are prominent service stations in every country I've visited or lived in. In <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">SA</a> they seem to serve exactly the same functions as in the UK, so if the latter is notable enough, so is the former. I see no reason whatsoever, however, why Wikipedia should have articles like these. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkerpikker_c3cf.html" title="User:Mikkerpikker">Mi<font color="darkred">kk</font>er</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkerpikker_77de.html" title="User talk:Mikkerpikker"><sup>(...)</sup></a> 02:32, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry if you took my remark as a breach of either guideline. It certainly wasn't meant to be and it doesn't read as being to me. I was merely pointing out a misinterpretation of the OR rule, which, as I said, seems to be getting incresingly common. Were you not getting on your high horse in the first place by claiming the articles were OR? -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 10:59, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: There doesn't seem to be any parent article for these at the moment. For starters I suggest creating Motorway service areas in the United Kingdom or similar, which can have a list of them and any other generic information. Then I'd vote to <b>delete</b> any of these articles that doesn't pass the <a href="../../../h/o/l/WP%7EHOLE_7127.html" title="WP:HOLE">WP:HOLE</a> test, retaining any that are particularly noteable (eg <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westmorland_services.html" title="Westmorland services">Westmorland services</a> - which should be called "Tebay services" while we're at it - which is the only one in England not owned by the big chains); trouble is, there's probably something vaguely notable about all of them if you look hard enough. --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 19:01, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> all without particular notability either into one or several list-type articles or into articles on the motorways they serve. (I'm not sure that UK railway stations deserve automatic inclusion, either, but most have a much longer history and a less generic feel.) Agree with Blisco that Tebay/Westmorland may deserve an article. <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspresso_Addict_7f98.html" title="User:Espresso Addict">Espresso Addict</a> 09:57, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> (and don't merge). Each is a multimillion pound business in its own right, most long established, and certainly as or more notable that the high schools and shopping centres which, an apparent consensus asserts, are sufficiently notable. Secondly they form a component of our overall UK trunk roads article collection, which is getting pretty complete - omitting the service stations on Motorways seems like a willful omission. Southwaite services, a lamentable heckhole though it surely is, is certaily more notable (and with much more to say about it) than <a href="../../../m/8/7/M876_motorway.html" title="M876 motorway">M876 motorway</a> and its myriad ilk. That said, motorway services are a special case (they're large, the exist because of specific government action, and there aren't that many of them). A-road services, on the other hand, are far less special and far more numerous, and exist merely because someone got planning permission from Upper Scratching Parish Council, so I think motorway services is the line below which we shouldn't (barring special cases with more to say for themselves) we shouldn't go. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 15:48, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b>. This isn't a paper encyclopaedia, and these are all notable locations in the UK (I know I've been to many on that list personally). Motorway service stations are a necessary part of tranport life in the UK and frequented by perhaps a million people on a daily basis. If some old building that no one lives in and few people visit is allowed an article because someone once owned it or lived there, then why shouldn't these services? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 06:12, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Expand or die</b>. If all Wikipedians can think to write on a topic is <i>"Swansea services is a motorway service station on the M4 motorway near Swansea, Wales. It is owned by Moto."</i>, then that's pretty much proof that it doesn't meet notability requirements, and that the article should be <b>deleted</b> (which is my current vote for all of them).

<li><b>Comment</b>. There is no reason to delete stubs because they're stubs (and it's not policy to do so). Just because not much has been written about something doesn't mean that a reasonable article <i>can't</i> be written about it, just that nobody has got round to it yet.
