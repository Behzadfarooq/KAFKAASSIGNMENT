<p>This article is a crime. First it has four long paragraphs saying the golden mean is something in mathematics that is much celebrated, <b>without the slightest attempt to even hint at what it is</b>, even getting into a poet's view of the matter without having attempted to inform the reader of what it is, which would be very easy. A different article, <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a>, already gives a very clear account of this concept. Then it goes on to a section on the Pythagorean theory of music, which is not even tangentially relevant, but looks (very) superficially related only because it deals with ratios in esthetics. The rest of the article doesn't look as if it informs the reader of what the golden ratio is either. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 23:54, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> (not actually a vote, since I expressed myself above): Looking at which pages link to this execrable article, I find two entirely distinct topics, both sometimes called the golden mean. Maybe this should become a disambiguation page. Or redirect to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_mean.html" title="Golden mean">golden mean</a> with a lower-case <i>m</i>, now a redirect page to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a>, and make <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_mean.html" title="Golden mean">golden mean</a> a disambiguation page? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 00:07, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>So I take it you don't like the article? I'm voting <b>Conditional Keep</b> on the basis that this has been flagged for attention for 1 day (by the AfD nominator) and now is being AfD nom'd. I agree that the article is a complete mess of random topics and is in need of some serious editing, but you cannot expect that to happen in 1 day. If after 30 days this article doesn't get updated into a coherent article with a point, I agree it should be deleted, but for now I'd say let the article have on last chance to be cleaned up.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:08, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><s>*Well, <b>keep</b> the article title, if only as a redirect, and perhaps after moving it to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_mean.html" title="Golden mean">Golden mean</a>? AFAIK "golden mean" is a legitimate synonym or near-synonym for "golden ratio" and a plausible entry term. The <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a> article is heavy on math and light on aesthetics, philosophy, etc. The <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_mean.html" title="Golden mean">golden mean</a> article is, uh, completely free from math and heavy on rather soft aesthetics and philosophy. I'm not enough of a classicist to judge its quality. And I haven't combed through the rest of Wikipedia to see how much of the material here is adequately treated elsewhere. <a href="../../../p/h/y/Phyllotaxis.html" title="Phyllotaxis">Phyllotaxis</a> is just a stub! But I don't see deleting all the content in this article. There needs to be some kind of refactoring and redistribution of its content, quite possibly deleting some of it, merging some of it elsewhere, and quite possibly leaving nothing but a redirect. The Pythagorean stuff needs to go elsewhere or just go. What sort of musical interval is 1.618? A minor sixth and change? Mmmm, mmmm, not good. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:08, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</s>Try to clarify, see below</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a>. This will require quite a bit of cleanup but I think there is some salvageable information in this article which is not covered in the other. <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> 20:16, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a>. This article is one of <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELERs</a> leftovers, and doesn't contain much worth merging. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 21:27, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree that the Golden Ratio article is much more concise. I vote to move the few unique bits from the Golden Ratio article to the Golden Mean article. Because the word <b>ratio</b> is more descriptive of its definition, it seems that Golden Ratio should be the title and the alternate names Golden Mean, Divine Proportion, and Golden Section should appear in the first few lines of the article.

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a> per SimonP and Dpbsmith. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 22:47, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b>. <b>Do not redirect</b> Besides the mathematical definition, there's <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horace.html" title="Horace">Horace</a>, the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> poet, and his use of this term philosophically. This is the sort of thing even Brittanica would have as disamb. for. Kill the current content as you wish, but this needs to be kept for clarification and probable disamb. -- or maybe expansion, since ratio is more precisely mathematically, but mean is exclusive philosophically. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 05:43, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Please don't merge or redirect</b>: I agree that this article needs substantial improvement. However, most of it deals with the philosophical meaning of <i>golden mean</i> (essentially not too much, not too little), which has <b>nothing</b> to do with the mathematical subject of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a> article; therefore, it should not be merged with that article. The confusion, which is not of our making, is that the outside world uses <i>golden mean</i> ambiguously: sometimes in its philosophical sense (above); other times as a synonym for the <i>golden ratio</i>. <i>Golden ratio</i>, on the other hand, is unambibuous: it refers only to the subject of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a> article, which is another reason that the articles <b>should not be merged</b>. The Wikified solution for dealing an ambiguous term is <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disambiguation.html" title="Disambiguation">disambiguation</a>, and that is <b>part</b> of the solution for this article. Indeed <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a>, who made the first post on this page (does that mean he is the one who nominated the article for deletion?) raised much the same point in a comment following his original post. The <b>rest</b> of the solution is (1) to delete from this article all discussion of material that is treated in the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a> article (and treated much better there), with an appropriate cross-reference on this page to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">golden ratio</a> as another meaning of <i>golden mean</i>; and (2) to edit what is left of this article, dealing solely with the philosophical meaning, to improve its quality. <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinell_cdfb.html" title="User:Finell">Finell</a> 10:49, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, then redirect to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_mean.html" title="Golden mean">Golden mean</a> and make that into a disambiguation page. -- <a href="../../../e/g/i/User%7EEgil_938c.html" title="User:Egil">Egil</a> 13:18, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>OK, let me see if I can be coherent. Basically: concur with <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinell_cdfb.html" title="User:Finell">Finell</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:20, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> the article title itself, since I think the term really is frequently used with that capitalization.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the article <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_mean.html" title="Golden mean">Golden mean</a>, which currently happens to be a redirect to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">Golden ratio</a>.</li>
<li>Hope for a <b>quick edit</b> of the article to remove anything obviously erroneous or less useful than <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">Golden ratio</a>, and clarify whatever relationships there are between the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Mean_6c87.html" title="Golden Mean">Golden Mean</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">Golden ratio</a> articles. Basically, separate them into a philosophy <i>article</i> and a math <i>article</i> even if there is really some overlap in the respective <i>concepts.</i></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> a cleanup tag on the article.</li>
<li><b>Copy</b> <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinell_cdfb.html" title="User:Finell">Finell</a>'s comment above to the Talk page as a reasonable program for what needs to be done.</li>
<li>Hope for <b>editing</b> of the page by people knowledgable in classics and philosophy</li>
<li><b>Defer</b> all the issues of which pages should be redirects, which should be dabs, etc. as normal editing issues. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:20, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge (if necessary) and Redirect</b> Golden Ratio is a good article, but I call it the golden mean (or the <b>Golden Section</b> at times. The entry is perfectly valid, but the concept isn't really different from <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Ratio_1514.html" title="Golden Ratio">Golden Ratio</a> <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 17:49, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As per Finell. It also needs to be moved to "Golden section" a more correct title, IMO . <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi fresco ≈</a> 02:03, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: In addition to the above, I know that Aristotle uses the idea of the "golden mean" as the point of virute in his <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicomachean_Ethics_1419.html#The_Golden_Mean" title="Nicomachean Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a>. One example: He describes courage as the virtue being at golden mean between cowardice and fool-hardiness. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbergan_0309.html" title="User:Dbergan">David Bergan</a> 04:15, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There needs to be better disambiguation between this article and Golden Ratio/golden mean. A new introductory paragraph should be put in to make clear the different uses of 'golden mean' (not just mathematical term), and its relationship with 'golden ratio' and perhaps difference from 'golden rule'. I agree with the above comment that more work on the philosophical section needs to be done too. Perhaps some of the sections should be merged with appropriate articles--golden ratio seems a good target for this--but in general, the article still needs work but should be kept. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiteC_f18a.html" title="User:WhiteC">WhiteC</a> 14:59, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Doesn't sound like a serious complication. It can all be dealt with as normal editing. But we might as well start tabulating just how many pages should be involved. I just checked and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Section_4d75.html" title="Golden Section">Golden Section</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_section.html" title="Golden section">Golden section</a> both redirect to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">Golden ratio</a>. Good. And <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phi.html" title="Phi">Phi</a> is a dab with <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">Golden ratio</a> as the first alternative. Also good.</dd>
<dd>I think we need about two separate articles, with math in one and philosophy/classics in the other. Not sure which one aesthetics best belongs in. I don't think it much matters whether there's a "central" disambiguation page, or whether each of the two articles has a short, pithy cross-reference to the other. What matters is that a reader searching for any of this stuff should be able to type in any of these terms and find what they're looking for. And that the articles be good.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../p/h/y/Phyllotaxis.html" title="Phyllotaxis">Phyllotaxis</a> should be woven into this web, too.</dd>
<dd>Do we have an article on the Goldena medina? Apparently not... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:59, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
