<p><br /></p>
<p>Phenothrin is a synthetic pyrethroid that kills adult fleas and ticks. Methoprene is an insect growth regulator that interrupts the insect's life cycle by killing the eggs.<br />
Chemical Name: 3-phenoxybenzyl (1RS,3RS;1RS,3SR)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methylprop-1-enyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate<br />
Chemical Formula: C23H26O3<br />
CAS Number: 26002-80-2<br />
Caswell Number: 652B<br />
Other Names: Phenothrine, Anvil, Duet, Multicide 2154, Pibutin, PT 515, S-2539, Sumithrin</p>
<p>At EPA’s insistence, Hartz Mountain Corporation has agreed to cancel uses of several flea and tick products that may be associated with a range of adverse reactions, including hair loss, salivation, tremors, and numerous deaths in cats and kittens. In the short term, the agreement calls for new labeling of the products. The new labeling will state that the products of concern are not to be used on the most vulnerable animals, including cats and kittens that weigh less than 6 pounds, cats older than 13 years, or kittens less than 5 months old.</p>
<p>Through this agreement, Hartz will voluntarily stop all new production of these products by September 30, 2005 and will not sell or distribute any affected product after December 31, 2005. The company has agreed to a prohibition on sales down to the retail level by March 31, 2006.</p>
<p>The products affected by this action include:</p>
<p>EPA Reg No 2596-148<br />
Hartz® Advanced Care™ 4 in 1® Flea &amp; Tick Drops Plus+ for Cats and Kittens<br />
Hartz® Advanced Care™ Brand Flea and Tick Drops Plus+ for Cats and Kittens<br /></p>
<p>EPA Reg. No. 2596-151 Hartz®<br />
Advanced Care™ 3 in 1® Flea &amp; Tick Drops for Cats and Kittens Hartz®<br />
Advanced Care™ Once-A-Month® Flea and Tick Drops for Cats and Kittens<br />
(note: this registration number also includes products for use on dogs, which will remain available)</p>
<p>Products with EPA Reg. No. 2596-148 contain 85.7% phenothrin, 2.9% methoprene. Products with EPA Reg. No. 2596-151 contain 85.7% phenothrin.</p>
<p>The label directions consumers should follow include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use on cats less than 5 months of age.</li>
<li>Do not use on cats or kittens weighing 6 lbs or less.</li>
<li>Do not use this product on debilitated, aged, medicated, pregnant or nursing animals or on animals known to be sensitive to pesticide products without first consulting a veterinarian.</li>
<li>Do not use this product if your pet has an existing health condition or is over 13 years of age without first consulting a veterinarian.</li>
<li>Signs of individual animal sensitivity which may occur after use of this product include skin irritation or hair loss at the application site, salivation, tremors (twitching of muscles), and in some circumstances, severe full body tremors. If this persists please contact your veterinarian and notify Hartz at 1-800-275-1414.</li>
<li>Animals should be observed after application for any sign of sensitivity. If signs of sensitivity occur, bathe your pet with mild soap, rinse with large amounts of water, and consult a veterinarian immediately.</li>
<li>Do not apply more than once every 30 days.</li>
<li>Do not allow your cat to lick the product.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your cat or kitten experiences symptoms that you think might be associated with application of a pesticide product, contact your veterinarian for treatment advice. In addition, you can report the incident by contacting the National Pesticide Information Center at 1-800-858-7378. NPIC can also offer advice and assistance with questions related to pesticide issues.</p>
<p>Phenothrin also is used to kill head lice in humans.</p>

<p>J.R. Moehringer (pronounced Mo-ringer), is a national correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, and a former Nieman Fellow at Harvard University. He was the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for feature writing in 2000 for his portrait of Gee’s Bend, Alabama, an isolated river town where many descendants of slaves live and where a proposed ferry to the mainland threatened to change the community.

<p>Kurbani is the reamke of the 1980's big hit Qurbani directed and produced by Firoz Khan. Fardeen Khan will be stepping in his dad's shoes as Rajesh. Saif Ali Khan was supposed to play the role of Vinod Khanna, but stepped out due to dates problems. The character of Amar played by Vinod Khanna hasn't been finalised yet. Priyanka Chopra is most likely to play the sexy, spicy and hot Sheela, played by the lovely Zeenat Aman. The films slick direction, urban setting, catchy music and foreign locales as well as upmarket image made it stand out when it was released. It was one of the biggest hit of the 80's</p>

<p><a href="http://icu2-productions.com/vladimirbellevue.jpg" class="external text" title="http://icu2-productions.com/vladimirbellevue.jpg" rel="nofollow">PICTURE</a> Vladimir Bellevue, born on November 7th, 1972 in Jersey City, NJ lived most of his life in the same city. During grammer school was taught art in excellerated classes. During his 8th grade year,was allowed to attend a vocational school, where he took classes in cooking and electrical sciences. In high school he attended collage art and painting classes at a collage for half of the school day. On several occasions was able to have gallery shows to exibit his paintings, were dignitaries and councelmen attended. One exibit was in Jersey City's City Hall. His name was known more by newpaper articles and festival shows. In a county contest came in 3rd in 1992, now his last year in highschool, was commitioned by the city to draw and write a comic book on anti-graffiti. He attended Parsons School of Design, majoring in Illustration. He was given the oportunity to "sit in" on an Art Director at a large advertising firm in New York City. There he learned more about the design aspects of graphic design, and the business side of professionalism. After several months Vladimir took extra computer graphics classes and progressed in them. In 2002 he was able to buy his first Macintosh Computer, Power PC, with a 604e processor. He began his freelance career. During his run, was able to create designs for magazines, posters and different venues and subject matters. They range from corporate work for large companies to abstract logo designs. His hobby of creating websites, also was added to his skill, and created his company, <a href="http://www.icu2-PRODUCTIONS.com" class="external text" title="http://www.icu2-PRODUCTIONS.com" rel="nofollow">icu2 PRODUCTIONS</a>. He upgraded his computer, still using Macintosh he utilises a dual g4 1.2ghz desktop computer which he put together, and a new intel dual core processor laptop. He took a hiatus and traveled to Chaina, Spain and around the United States. On his return from traveling the states, he became spiritual, and began to study the bible and became a ordained minister on January, 19th, 2002. One year later his mother Maria Christina Bellevue was operated with cancer. Vladimir took care of his mother for three years. On March 18th, 2005 his grandmother passed away. This shock affected his mother very much, she passed away on May 18th of the same year. During his mothers battle with lung cancer, he corresponded with ministers from the Philippines whom he met while they were vacationing in the United States. On loosing contact with them, Vladimir sought out to find people that might know them, and who were in his world-wide brotherhood of <a href="http://www.watchtower.org" class="external text" title="http://www.watchtower.org" rel="nofollow">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>. Using Yahoo, he searched for any Witnesses who might live close to his friends in that far country. several people responded, but they lived far from the city of Manila. One woman wrote, she lived in Manila and did get in touch with his friends. During the course of a year the two of them wrote to each other nearly everyday, and eventually wished to start a relationship. After Vladimir's mother passed away, he had no other obilgations to hold him from going to see his new found love. They were engaged, and currently have placed in paperwork for a fiance visa. Vladimir continues to work secularly as a Senior Graphic Designer, and as a Minister, giving free bible courses to people. His currrent hobbies are designing "skins", digital painting for a 3d game online and tinkering with electronic devices.</p>

<p>Crayfish Creek is listed as a protected forest reserve in North West Tasmania. It is home to the giant freshwater lobster (Astacopsis gouldi), listed as a vulnerable species and - theoretically, rather than in practice - subject to protection under the Australian Federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.</p>
<p>Since about 1999 Crayfish Creek has been subject to heavy industrial logging in the upper catchment with local residents attributing this as a cause for a significant loss of water volume. A prominent geohydrologist in the State, Dr David Leaman, noted that it was difficult to see whether a buffer zone ever existed upstream from Crayfish Creek, observing that this could be a significant contributor to the drying up of the water body further downstream. This view was made in the context of the fact that the overwhelming majority scientists who have provided input on the need for adequate stream reserves under the Tasmanian Forest Practices Code have been clear that at least a 30 metre buffer zone around Class two, three and four streams should be implemented.</p>

<p>Born on 29 December 1992, Cillian seemed to be just a normal boy. He was unusually large when he was born and it was feared he had some sort of illness. After years of tests it was found he had a mutation in the Myostatin protein producing gene. It was one of the first cases of this to be found in humans and the doctors did not know how to treat it and he was given a 50/50 chance of surviving. His life was left on the line until he was 10 years old when the Swiss doctor Nestor Sanchez gave them an unexpected call. He said he hd been working on a case similar to Cillian's and there was no need to treat it. He said Cillian would have unusually large muscles for his life, but nothing life threatening.</p>

<p>Opera Soft has been one of the most prolific Spanish game developers of all time. It released many games for the Spectrum computers in the mid-1980s, but its games were not as popular on the PC. Founded in 1987, this company obtained success in its premiere with its first title, <i>Livingstone I presume (Livingstone Supongo).</i> Nevertheless, the most important video game of the company is probably <i>The abbey of crime</i> <i>(La abadía del crimen)</i>. As other many Spanish companies, Opera Soft did not adapt to the generational change and it went out of business sometime in the early 1990s with the appearance and expansion of the 16 bits video games.</p>

<p>Jari Kaarela is a former Finnish hockey goaltender (born 8 August 1958 in Tampere, Finland) who played for two seasons in the North American hockey leagues, including five games in the Colorado Rockies (now New Jersey Devils). He was traded to the New York Islanders organization in early 1981, but only saw ice time in the minors. A knee injury put an end to his career in North America, after which he played a few seasons in the Finnish Elite League. He has since worked as a goalie coach, paving way for upcoming Finnish goalies such as Hannu Toivonen of the Boston Bruins.</p>

<p>Born 5th July 1985, Ricoh Gill was raised in Hounslow in West London. At school he met musical collaborators Paul Fulda and Sam Mackertich, who collectively went on to form Sonic Death, or as they were first known, Orion. They later changed the band name to Onslaught, but this was short-lived as they were threatened with legal action by a representative of a no-longer existant British metal band of the same name. They soon announced that they had changed name yet again at a show at The Garage in London, September 2004. Sonic Death list, amongst others, influences such as Slayer, Exodus, pre-Bob Rock Metallica, Sepultura, Destruction and Morbid Angel.</p>
<p>Ricoh later went on to form Orifice with Ben Heeney and Rob Clark in Brighton in 2005. Having drafted in several bassists, the band have yet to appoint a long-term musician for the position. The newer band entails a slight change in direction for the guitarist but not a colossal one; being the only full-time guitarist in the band prevents him from the dual guitar harmonies that Sonic Death and their fans alike enjoyed but simeltaneously allows more interaction with prominent basslines.</p>
<p>Ricoh is a long-time user of Jackson Guitars (flying v and warrior models) and Randall Amplifiers.</p>

<p>One of New York's leading mixtape purveyors, DJ Envy climbed up the ranks quickly and, by the early 2000s, was peddling the latest exclusives and freestyles by big-name rappers like Jay-Z, 50 Cent, and the L.O.X. In fact, his reputation was so esteemed that Sony signed him and his affiliate label, Desert Storm Records, and in early 2003 released his commercial debut, The Desert Storm Mixtape: DJ Envy - Blok Party, Vol. 1. ~ Jason Birchmeier, All Music Guide</p>
