<dd>(In response to the clarification requested on my talk page by <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a>) Well, in my opinion high schools are of borderline notability. Usually high schools have tens of thousands of graduates, each one spending hours and hours there for a four year period with countless memories during a time of transition in their lives. Some have more students than say <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryn_Mawr_College_8219.html" title="Bryn Mawr College">Bryn Mawr College</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Secondary schools (and the schools that incorporate them) are kept virtually <i>ab initio</i> and by virtue of their existence; notability in essence only helps and an absence of it really does not stop them. Whether this is good or bad is not for me to say, but I try to be pragmatic. Thus, because in spite of the cogent arguments for and against, very few AfDed schools are ever deleted, I will go with the majority.
