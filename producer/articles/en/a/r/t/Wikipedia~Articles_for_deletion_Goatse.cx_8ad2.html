<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Goatse.cx is well-known throughout the Internet as a prank site, and I couldn't imagine an encyclopedia aspiring to be "complete" not having an entry on this. In addition, the article already exists, and with quite a bit of detail. I certainly don't object to the so-called "link farms" being removed, but surley that doesn't justify deletion of the entire article? —<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELantoka_28a7.html" title="User:Lantoka">Lantoka</a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELantoka_f8aa.html" title="User talk:Lantoka">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lantoka_9349.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lantoka">contrib</a>)</small></sup> 01:15, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It's one of the two best known Internet shock sites (along with <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotten.com.html" title="Rotten.com">Rotten.com</a>), a very well known Internet meme and also one of the best known ongoing domain name disputes/sagas. <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 01:20, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b>. It's one of the best-known shock sites and has reached a prominence comparable to other web memes out there.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: It's a well known site.

Notability is in this case, established by the same principle.

I could almost support a redirect to <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_site.html" title="Shock site">shock site</a> but it seems people don't want even that much, thus in this case I'm going to have to err in favor of being overprotective and go with a keep. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:19, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> What is all this talk of unreliable sources? So what if the sources suck... that doesn't make it any less significant. It is unarguable that Goatse.cx is a huge Internet phenomenon, so why all of these attacks on the so-called "sources"? Yes they are absolute crap and just point at like 20 million different goatse sites, but for god's sake, please stop basing your reasons for deleting the article on "unverifiable sources". Is it that surprising that Time Magazine hasn't written an article about some guy holding his asshole open? If you want evidence that this is an important Internet phenomenon do two things: 1) look at <i>the majority</i> of people that voted keep on this page, despite the article being about disgusting material and at first glance appearing "unencyclopedic", and 2) do a google search for goatse and take note of the <i>1.7 million hits</i> that it generates.

<dd>So basically, if enough people have heard of it, we should throw Wikipedia guidelines to the wind and not care that there's no reliable citation available?

<dd><b>Frankly</b>, guidelines are just that - guidelines. And if they're not yet perfect, there's probably room for improvement.

<li>I see your point, but I still think deleting the entire article may not be the best thing to do here. Forgive me for my naive newbie question: the popularity of the phenomenon should be easy to establish through primary sources - wouldn't it be possible to build an article around this? Of course I absolutely agree that pure speculations about persons etc are highly inappropriate, and need to be removed, but I somehow thought the popularity of the phenomenon itself is verifiable without a lot of academic or established print media secondary sources? I also thought some verifiable trivia may be worth mentioning, such as that goatse.cx was one of the earlier <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domain_hack.html" title="Domain hack">domain hacks</a>? <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReidarM_33a8.html" title="User:ReidarM">ReidarM</a> 04:08, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The problem with primary sources is that several uses of them can violate <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Wikipedia policy regarding original research</a>. Generally, primary sources should only be used if <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> have introduced a concept, but the primary source is necessary for proper clarification and/or illustration, or something to that degree. To be specific for this article - look at the entire section about parodies, tributes, and trivia. Not only are trivia sections generally discouraged, but there is not a single reliable source that introduced the idea of parodies or tributes, so that all of these are left without real reference and violate the original research policy. Now look at the Geographic Location section. While the place to which a ".cx" would be easy to verify with a reliable source, the rest of this section appears to be original research. While it may even be possible to have decent sourcing of the date when the site went offline (for section The Site Goes Offline), the reporting on the rest of the content appears to use either primary sources or message board postings - the former aren't recommended, the later aren't reliable. Origin section - completely original research. Etymology - speculation in its entirety. This sort of thing is usually removed straightaway from articles about, say, radio and TV call letters when editors offer etymological possibilities. While I can't argue that the proposed etymology makes sense, there is no sources to document the claim, which goes again WP policy. The lead appears to be relatively harmless, as a brief description of the content is a permissible illustration in my opinion, although it is still a borderline inclusion without proper sourcing. Still, as it is a description of the content rather than any sort of synthesis of it, it may be acceptable. The thing is, if you were to pull most of the information that truly can't be sourced reliably, you're left with just a little bit of information that could easily be housed in the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_site.html" title="Shock site">shock site</a> article, with this redirecting there.

<li>I too am concerned about the lack of secondary sources, but I don't think that should stop us from having an article on this (in)famous domain. At some point, some sociology major will write a doctoral dissertation on Internet <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_sites.html" title="Shock sites">shock sites</a> and get it published in a journal. In the meantime, we can do our best based on the popular knowledge of the site and the primary sources we do have. Between me and Konstable, considerable changes have already been made to the article, improving it infintesimally from the version we had before. I can't imagine too many people objecting to keeping the article as it is in its current state... it is much better now and can definitely be improved. —<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELantoka_28a7.html" title="User:Lantoka">Lantoka</a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELantoka_f8aa.html" title="User talk:Lantoka">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lantoka_9349.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lantoka">contrib</a>)</small></sup> 05:17, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Generally, if something is lacking sources, that's a cleanup problem. If something can't be sourced, that justifies the removal of the content. It troubles me that we should keep unsourceable information or "popular knowledge" and assume that it will eventually be reliably sourced because a source will eventually exist. That, to me, is no better than "this band will eventually be notable" or "this person will eventually do something" or "my pet goldfish will eventually star in its own television series." If a source doesn't exist for the information, then it really should be purged from the article. GassyGuy 05:37, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The examples you cite all involve speculation about insignificant things becoming significant. I contend again that this article is significant (pretty unarguably, and Google works as a great source for that)... Our problem, however, is an almost complete lack of secondary sources. I would speculate that this is due to 1) the site's content, 2) its lack of publicity in academia (it's popular on the Internet), and 3) it's very "newness". You don't see history books that could properly be called "secondary sources" and referenced in an encyclopedia published about our decade until many many years after it. So again, I argue that the sources are a problem, but that we can make do in the meantime. —<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELantoka_28a7.html" title="User:Lantoka">Lantoka</a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELantoka_f8aa.html" title="User talk:Lantoka">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lantoka_9349.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lantoka">contrib</a>)</small></sup> 05:49, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'll certainly do my best to look for sources. Has anyone done a real, ie scientific, literature search (as opposed to popular search engines such as google)? Would it be of any help if the goatse.cx site has been cited in scholarly works, such as 䐀Spiegel, Dana Sean; Coterie: A visualization of the conversational dynamics within IRC; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1999)⠀<a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~spiegel/thesis/Thesis.pdf" class="external free" title="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~spiegel/thesis/Thesis.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~spiegel/thesis/Thesis.pdf</a> <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReidarM_33a8.html" title="User:ReidarM">ReidarM</a> 08:00, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It would help if this paper actually did cite it. Unfortunately, it doesn't. It's included in the raw data, which, in this case, consists of logged IRC chats, in Appendix B. There's no mention of goatse in the actual paper, nor does the chat even discuss what the site is, just has the word appear twice. GassyGuy 08:21, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

The "goatse" (short for "goatsex") is an image circulated on the internet that is a favorite of the Pen community. It shows a highly pixilated image of a man holding his anus open, magnified to revolting proportions. Many threats like this surface when someone posts off topic, or tries to change the subject of talk within a thread. The image of "goatse" is used both as a "topic nazi" threat and as a form of thread derailment, both context dependent.</i> <a href="http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04072005-145922/unrestricted/thesis.pdf" class="external free" title="http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04072005-145922/unrestricted/thesis.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04072005-145922/unrestricted/thesis.pdf</a> [Note - I never seem to get the wiki markup right, forgive me for my lack of skills.

<li><b>Reply</b> These two certainly seem like better sources. I <i>think</i> they count as reliable under policy, though I'm not actually well-versed enough with theses to give a definitive. Can someone who knows for certain chime in? Anyway, they do look like good sources. Personally, I'd accept them. The problem remains, however, is that here is what these sources confirm: 1) Goatse exists. 2) This one can be used to source some of the ways in which goatse is used, and even now there is a reference for etymology (e.g., "According to blah blah blah, "goatse" is used as a short form of "goat sex" blah blah blah). Nice research. What these two sources do not do, however, is verify the majority of the rest of the content, including the discussion of the origins, the tributes and parodies, and the rest. I'm not changing my vote only because the verifiable content produced by these papers is still the same content housed at the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_site.html" title="Shock site">shock site</a> article, but I do think these two papers are certainly better than the current sourcing and should be used in both articles.
