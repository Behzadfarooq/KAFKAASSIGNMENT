<p>Proposed deletion is absolutely bloody useless for internet stuffs, being that some fan will inevitably remove it. Not a notable video logger, the only notability that the article comes up with is that he's been mentioned on other blogs. Woop-ti-do! Google gives <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Jonathan+Harchick%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Jonathan+Harchick%22" rel="nofollow">50 links</a> for his name, Google news gives nothing. The only reason I found this was because I saw his sketch on Google Video, and thought, "I bet some webfan thought he should be on Wikipedia, and if so they're entirely wrong." We should just speedy this rubbish. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:08, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone had posted a <b>{{dated Prod}}</b> tag on this page. I felt that it should not simply be expunged without discusaion.</p>
<p>Apparently, Citizens Area Transit is a <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas%2C_Nevada_aec8.html" title="Las Vegas, Nevada">Las Vegas, Nevada</a> Regional transit provider, and this page, obviously, is a list of routes of that system. I think I can agree that this, perhaps, is too limited in interest to be something that should generally be included in Wikipedia, however there is plenty of stuff that is of extremely limited interest, such as <a href="../../../s/t/r/Category%7EStreets_in_Washington%2C_D.C._fceb.html" title="Category:Streets in Washington, D.C.">Category:Streets in Washington, D.C.</a> I felt, however, that mere uncontested expungement was not the answer.</p>

Is Carson Daly Productions' share price used to calculate stock market indices? Is Carson Daly Productions so well-known that its trademark has suffered from genericization?

<li>If nothing separates them, as you seem to be implying, then the two articles could be profitably merged. That might have been a better initial approach, than a PROD/AFD nomination, and also looks to be a likely outcome of this debate. WP:Corp is also a guideline. There is no need to reiterate all its points when you have already provided a link with your initial nom. Please show some respect for other opinions.

<li><b>Rewrite</b> The rise in popularity of MMORPG's is a very notable topic and this game is a part of it, providing one of only a small handfull of MMORPG's safe for younger (pre-teen) kids. That said, this article is written more like an ad for the game. If it were rewritten with some of the same content but also clear and upfront explanation of how this game fits with the cultural phenomenon that is MMORPG, links to related articles on other popular MMORPG games, etc., it would be worthwhile. I was researching this game in particular and found this article useful. ~Kelly 14:56, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article has improved greatly, and I firmly believe it is contributive, helpful, and informative - a great overall help to players of the game, and people simply wanting to learn a little more about Club Penguin. Deleting this would be a great loss to all those interested in the game. More work has yet to be done, and the article is still to improve even more. So I give a firm request for this article to be kept on Wikipedia. Tetsumonchi 15:26, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> per above. This requires some care because this article has serious POV problems. It should be confined to the present Republic of Turkey and not include the record of the Ottoman Empire. Next thing we'll put the problems of the Roman Empire in an article on Italian Human Rights. Not all allegations are covered by the cited sources, and not all sources are exactly what you can call neutral. For example, the reference numbered 4, &lt;<a href="http://www.kypros.org/Cyprus_Problem/human_rights.html" class="external free" title="http://www.kypros.org/Cyprus_Problem/human_rights.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kypros.org/Cyprus_Problem/human_rights.html</a>&gt;, suggests in the title that we have "Findings of the European Commission of Human Rights", but it is actually a report issued by the (Cypriot Greek) Cyprus Bar Association. While all violations of human rights are deplorable, <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/eng/Press/1999/Sept/reference%20Cyprus%20v%20Turkey%20epress.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.echr.coe.int/eng/Press/1999/Sept/reference%20Cyprus%20v%20Turkey%20epress.htm" rel="nofollow">those found by the European Court of Human Rights</a> are not nearly as serious as those claimed in the article. If it has been "suggested to some" (a new weasel-wordy formula) that it was only through strong international pressure that <a href="../../../o/r/h/Orhan_Pamuk_7deb.html" title="Orhan Pamuk">Orhan Pamuk</a> was released, then these some may have been wrongly suggested so. He was actually not released at all because he was never arrested. There are serious issues, but they are treated in a much better way in <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Turkey_da3b.html" title="Human rights in Turkey">Human rights in Turkey</a>. It is misleading to list "Turkish treatment of the disabled" as a human rights issue. There are problems with the treatment of elderly in American homes for the elderly all the time, which is scandalous but should only be regarded as impacting upon the "American Human Rights Record" if this is condoned by responsible officials. In the case mentioned, the situation was promptly addressed as soon as it had been brought to the attention of vthe authorities. And so on. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:19, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> My weasel words above, I'm afraid; previous edit was <i>The arrest and trial of the Turkish author <a href="../../../o/r/h/Orhan_Pamuk_7deb.html" title="Orhan Pamuk">Orhan Pamuk</a> has been criticized by many as proving that human rights and freedom of speech are not valued by the present Turkish government and it was only through strong international pressure that Pamuk was released.</i>, which I changed to <i>The arrest and trial of the Turkish author <a href="../../../o/r/h/Orhan_Pamuk_7deb.html" title="Orhan Pamuk">Orhan Pamuk</a> have suggested to some that human rights and freedom of speech are not valued by the present Turkish government, and ...</i> .

<p>This album has been rumored and "confirmed" since January 2005 but nothing has happened with it at all. It seems to have enough buzz about it to be somewhat notable, but it's too speculative.

<dd>I think there's a differance between unreleased albums and this though, as it seems to be purely conjecture at this point. I mean, the only current sources are over a year old, and one of them, I read, cites Brian Welch - who hasn't been in the band since Feb. 2005. If it ever was on, I'd say it's off now, not only because the band hasn't said anything in the space between now and when the sources were posted, but because Brian Welch left on top of that. A mention along the lines of 'In 2004 the band were planning a cover album, but no information has been release since' in the Korn article would suffice, in my opinion. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadSeraphim_8b00.html" title="User:DeadSeraphim">Dead</a> 10:40, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> some of these are quite good articles, some may need to be deleted, but you grouped them in one bunch, so I have to vote keep for all of the bunch. In particular, <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almalexia.html" title="Almalexia">Almalexia</a> shouldn't be deleted, because it's rather major character, and there are probably others that shouldn't be deleted. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 06:24, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you (or anyone else) has a good knowledge of these games, it'd be helpful if you could list any of these noms which could be considered major characters or themes, as it may be helpful to break a couple off into their own AfDs.

<li><b>Delete</b> Agreed, this is game guide info not for an encyclopaedia. I don't think there is cause for a 'creatures of TES' page, or for much (if any) of this info to be merged.

<li><b>Merge</b> - I agree with <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Chittleborough_4a64.html" title="User:Chris Chittleborough">CWC</a> for the most part. There are numerous articles that, taken for themselves, are candidates for deletion and/or mergers. I'd volunteer to take over some of the work that'll have to be done on that front.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>However, I argue strongly against outright deleting most of the content contained therein, with the only argument that WP is "not a game guide". WP is supposed to be a contemporary encyclopedia and content about one of the most widely-acclaimed RPG video game series surely is not out of place there. For comparison, just look at the lots of content for all the numberless TV series, comics or anime/manga series. It's part of contemporary "culture" (or sub-culture), for want of a better term, and it deserves its place inside WP.</dd>
<dd>However, I also agree that there are way to many articles just containing single-paragraph content; many of them are stubs. Therefore, mergering them should be the method of choice here. As I've said, I'm prepared to do some of the work that's necessary.

<li><b>Comment</b> I also want to remind everyone about the widely accepted guideline <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. In a nutshell it says that minor characters and concepts should be merged into lists, not deleted. So, it seems like CWC's proposal is the most sensible way to close this discussion. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 15:21, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. I'm also in favour of moving all the smaller and spoiler-free articles to the corresponding lists rather than deleting them outright. However, I strongly advice against Daedric Princes being merged with Daedra, for the latter describes the Daedric race and its subraces, while the former is about the pesonalities of the various Princes. To put it simpler, Daedra belongs to the races category, while Princes - to the characters cat. --<a href="../../../k/o/v/User%7EKoveras_be46.html" title="User:Koveras">Koveras</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Russia.svg_211b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg/25px-Flag_of_Russia.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Russia.svg_211b.html" /></a> 16:31, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> The content is good on a few of them. Deleting some of the more notable (Amulet of Kings, for example) would be bad, but it definetly shouldn't have it's own article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - This AFD will not conclude with a delete because so many articles have been grouped together, surely the nominator knew this. I have only played Morrowind (pretty comprehensively) and have some suggestions below:
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - All the creatures of Morrowind. Things like <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alit.html" title="Alit">Alit</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/x/Nix_Hound_a596.html" title="Nix Hound">Nix Hound</a> and Shalks were just generic enemies in Morrowind. Like Goombas but without the popularity, recognisability and lasting impact of Mario enemies.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - <a href="../../../d/a/e/Daedric_Crescent_9095.html" title="Daedric Crescent">Daedric Crescent</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staff_of_Chaos_a092.html" title="Staff of Chaos">Staff of Chaos</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/b/Wabbajack.html" title="Wabbajack">Wabbajack</a>. Although these are not generic items in the game, they are just one of many top tier items you can get. I can think of many such items in Morrowind alone.

<li><b>Keep&amp;Merge</b> - Several of the articles should probably be merged, especially many of the animals and the more minor characters.

<p>Does being a participant on a network "reality show" constitute sufficient basis for being "notable"? There are some very frivilous entries in Wikipedia, many of which are game show participants, few of whom will be remembered-Charles Van Doren exempted. In my opinion, Lillian Parker has a record, albeit a short one, of notable accomplishment. She has produced a feature film, as well as working with Wes Anderson. Let's look at someone like Cindy Sheehan, who in reality is no more than a figurehead used by moveon.org, and really has no notable accomplishments of her own. Why is she notable? Solely because she is on the news? Why not just start notablepedia? Cindy Sheehan, Spuds MacKenzie, and the man in the question mark suit from the late night infomercials can all have extensive entries! Is notability by itself enough of a criteria for entry? Even though I authored the original entry, I will admit that Lillian may not have sufficient notability for entry if notability is a central criteria. I do think it is unfortunate that many totally undistiguished individuals are included on Wikipedia, while those who have succeeded in their creative quests, are exmpted from inclusion because they were not on MTV's 'Beach Party Real Life Survivor Apprentice 2006'. Perhaps pop culture needs it's own Wikipedia. If you've read this far, thank you for considering my viewpoint. I will use more discretion on future entries. <a href="../../../y/a/k/User%7EYakofujimato_536a.html" title="User:Yakofujimato"><font color="">Yakofujimato</font></a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - article does not establish notability. Perhaps if the previous poster would add to the article some information that would indicate more notability for Ms. Parker's work (and include references)... For the record, Yakofujimato, notability is a necessary condition for inclusion, but not necessarily a sufficient one. Please take a look at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and see if you can show how Lillian Parker fits it. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 02:43, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Individual articles for each year of the U.K.'s (or any other country's) entries in the Eurovision Song Contest are duplicative and certainly not necessarily notable.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>edit</b>I would also like to note merging every national final onto one country page would be a right mess! 50 years of national semi-\finals would be far far far too large and would have to be split up anyway. The information is out there (altough for early years it is missing some). -(extra edit) it seems that the other eurovision afd on the same type of article has the concensus of keep this should be kept also as just keeping the 2006 entry is daft as you would expect to find every other year as well.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (with apologies to some fine people I see voting the other way).

<li>50 lines??? there is far more information than a 50 line table. 1957 had 3 semi-finals and 1 main minal, thats just 1 year. some other years in the 70s had 10 entries for just 1 "final". all together that is more than 50 lines,</li>

<dd><b>Questions</b> Is that extra data memorable? Is it notable? Does it belong in the Wikipedia? If so why? What changes an ephermeral event, however <i>big</i> into something notable? Many of these singers would not be noted at all if they didn't appear in the tables, see, for example from 1957, <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_Johnson_%28singer%29_1e3d.html" title="Bryan Johnson (singer)">Bryan Johnson (singer)</a>.<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 17:10, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is not paper,it can go into far more detail with every topic, national contests are a big deal watch\listened by millions of people, data is memorable (in some ways), data is avalible (altough a couple of early years do have lost data. 2006 entries were allowed so I repeat therefor older years are allowed too.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Usually when Wikipedians look for notability, they look for things like <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa_Internet_43d9.html" title="Alexa Internet">Alexa Internet</a> rankings (DjDTM.com isn't even ranked), <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_testing.html" title="Google testing">Google testing</a> hits (DjDTM.com comes out at a little over 700), and sometimes forum accounts (DjDTM.com has 34).

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Here's my understanding of the story; the student-run station at UCSD (SRTV) included a program called "Koala TV" that made the news multiple times for pushing the free speech envelope and more or less getting the whole station banned (though now I think Koala TV has split from The Koala, the student-run newspaper, and is being broadcast again). I added a few external links to the story; additionally, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:8oqPRGzjM7QJ:as.ucsd.edu/council/minute/Minute_regular_12.pdf+%22Live+hot+puppet+chat%22+ucsd&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:8oqPRGzjM7QJ:as.ucsd.edu/council/minute/Minute_regular_12.pdf+%22Live+hot+puppet+chat%22+ucsd&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">these minutes</a> from a meeting at UCSD include mention of Live Hot Puppet Chat in the context of Koala TV.

<p>Individual articles for each year of France's (or any other country's) entries in the Eurovision Song Contest are duplicative and certainly not necessarily notable.

Poland participated 11 times so far, so you would have at least 11 times this (plus other information) in Poland's article, which would make the article big and cumbersome, and therefore we would probably have requests for splitting into individual articles...

<li>It is not whether the information is verifiable, it is whether it is notable, and whether, if notable, it belongs in this structure, or in the biographical structure. A media circus in one year does not make something notable, see all of the UK years 1957-2000, for what they are worth now.

<li><b>Keep all</b>, I must say despite voting delete for the previous Eurovision-related AFD due to lack of information. This year's contest is a current event and is expected to have more coverage on Wikipedia than before and will be updated quickly.

<li><b>Keep all</b> This is a huge event in Europe, at least as notable as most of the pop culture stuff that is retained without challenge. There is too much to merge into one place, and it couldn't be properly categorised if it was merged. There is a template to link the individual articles, which is a far more user friendly way of connecting the material than converting it into one article - which would be likely to breach the article size limit in any case. <a href="../../../o/s/o/User%7EOsomec_c7d4.html" title="User:Osomec">Osomec</a> 18:45, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Okay this is a bit of an unusual one. The <i>current text</i> I prodded and it was removed without comment. Based on text, it is a "2006 feature film" but no listing at IMDB. If unreleased: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. If released, imdb omission seems telling. Delete unless verified and notable based on that verification. However, in another article by this author, (Steve Aaron Misiura), he refers to a <i>2005</i> film also called The Basement. This film is listed on imdb, and is a short. Google returns only results to IMDB for the film and writer in quotes. IMDB lists <i>everything</i>. Thus if this is the film referred to, despite the explicit text stating it is a 2006 film, it appears, nevertheless, not-notable unless wider notability is verified (Misiura himself appears notable for another film, mentioned in the New York Times <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=462145" class="external text" title="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=462145" rel="nofollow">here</a>, so I am not nominating that article).</p>
<p>The author has also added a related article which I am nominating as well: Sperimenta, an apparently not-notable actor/film maker ensemble ({{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">db-bio</a>}} tag is placed so this may become moot). Note that a related third article by this author, SEFF, was speedily deleted, and has been reposted and tagged by another editor with {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-repost_a444.html" title="Template:Db-repost">db-repost</a>}}. <i>Update: Speedy tag on Sperimenta removed by ip editing all the same articles as author.</i></p>
<p>One more wrinkle in this saga: if you look at the The Basement's revision history, you'll see that it was originally an article about a vegan cafe in Manchester England that is a "key resource for activism". Putting aside the impropriety of usurping that article because it had the name this author wanted, I am nominating that previous revision for deletion as well, as a non notable restaurant, so there is no call for just reverting to prior text.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 07:05, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I AM STEVE AARON MISIURA AND I MADE THIS FILM, I'M NEW TO WIKIPEDIA AND CLEARLY BUGGERED UP THE ENTRY. BESIDES ACCIDENTLY ERASING THE ORIGINAL ARTCLE I TRIED TO USE AS A TEMPLATE. I THOUGHT WIKIPEDIA MIGHT BE A GREAT WAY TO GET SOME INFO OF THE FILM OUT THERE, CLEARLY I WAS WRONG. I WOULD LIKE EVERYTHING TO BE DELETED. I NO LONGER HAVE ANY DESIRE FOR MY FILM, MY COMPANY OR MY NAME TO APPEAR IN WIKIPEDIA. THE OTHER CONTRIBUTORS SEEM TO BE SMALL MINDED PHILISTINES AND I'D PREFER NO ASSOCIATIONS. FOR THE RECORD THE FILM WAS STARTED IN 2005 AND COMPLETED IN 2006, HENCE CONFUSION OVER THE DETAILS. IT WAS EDITED TO THE FIBONACCI SEQUENCE AND IS NOT NONSENSE, A HOAX OR OTHERWISE. IT IS HOWEVER A SADLY BEAUTIFUL FILM THAT DEALS WITH THE DEVASTATION OF TERRORISM. IT IS ALSO LISTED (INCORRECTLY) ON IMDB - THAT ISSUE IS BEING ADDRESSED. I DO HOPE YOU ENJOY THE FILM ON ITS (YET TO BE CONFIRMED) RELEASE.

<li><b>Keep</b>. How about the fact that VNNTU is one of the two biggest Vietnamese bodies in Singapore?</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the premier role of the organisation is to help Vietnamese students in NTU to get used and adapt better to the environment, it also plays an important role in bringing the Vietnamese people, which has been shut out for many years, towards the rest of the world. I have seen many good activities of VNNTU aiming toward fostering awareness about the Vietnamese culture and Vietnamese people.</p>
<p>4 years ago, it is surprised that although the two countries (Singapore and Vietnam) are not far away (only 1 hours 45 minutes flight), most of the Singaporeans had very little or no idea about how their neighbour country is like. When asked many mistook that the Vietnamese people are Chinese ethnic and speak Chinese; whereas many others think that Vietnam is still in war (the last war was ended in 1979)... Nowadays, I think that the image of the Vietnamese people has been more well-established in Singapore, thanks to VNNTU and its sister organisation, VNCNUS.</p>
<p>As for the claim that VNNTU is one of the biggest Vietnamese organisation in the world by the author, I would like to correct it as "one of the biggest Vietnamsese organisation in a single university in the world". Hopefully I can find some proof to back up this claim soon..</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I speak Vietnamese if that means anything. I doubt that a uni student group can be influential in "bring the Vietnamese people .... towards the rest of the world" - can you provide sources that show many people identify their knowledge of Vietnam with VNNTU? Probably awareness between Singapore and Vietnam is due to things like ASEAN, APEC, SEAGames, etc, trading and tourism. Also - "bright and talented" is not particularly relevant unless they have won lots of academic competitions, etc, which does not appear to be the case. As to being "one of the biggest Vietnamsese organisation in a single university in the world", I'm sure this is wrong, the biggest would all be in Vietnam by a long, long way.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 01:28, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It cannot be found on Google (what CAN be found on Google, besides Wikipedia, is a lot of links to a page about an event-management firm for corporations, with this name). No papers with this word on ArXiv, one paper on MathSciNet, and not by Vorob'ov. Vorob'ov himself does not appear on either of these. Since I can't find any of the cited papers, and presumably couldn't read them if I did find them (since they're in Russian) I can't verify any of the content of the eventology pages. The pages themselves don't say anything besides a bunch of recurring buzzwords, the phrase "new direction in probability theory", and a few unexplained mathematical expressions. Nothing on any of the pages tells me what eventology is, what its results are, what it's used for (barring the grandiose generalities in the introduction to this page). I suggest in addition we delete all the articles in only Category:Eventology, since they appear to be nothing more than vanity pages for Vorob'ov. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 13:59, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete, except</b> possibly <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_element.html" title="Random element">random element</a> which looks like it almost might make sense if I spent more time thinking about it. The definition of <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_element.html" title="Random element">random element</a> is claimed to be due to <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Frechet_0da0.html" title="Maurice Frechet">Maurice Frechet</a>, but I can't tell how popular it might be.

<li><b>Do not delete <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_element.html" title="Random element">random element</a></b>, as it is a real term and topic. The Frechet paper is available <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item?id=AIHP_1948__10_4_215_0" class="external text" title="http://www.numdam.org/item?id=AIHP_1948__10_4_215_0" rel="nofollow">here</a> (institution subscription maybe necessary). My mathematical French is not so good that I can read this very quickly, but it's basically about random variables with values in metric spaces. In it, he uses the term "random element", and it looks like he's using the term basically as in the <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_element.html" title="Random element">random element</a> article. However that is just defining what I believe most people would nowadays just call a <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_variable.html" title="Random variable">random variable</a> (or measurable function with respect to the appropriate algebras). The modern use of "random element" is apparently not quite the same as what Frechet would call it, for example, see <a href="http://eom.springer.de/R/r077280.htm" class="external text" title="http://eom.springer.de/R/r077280.htm" rel="nofollow">the Springer encyclopedia entry</a>. That entry makes it clear that there is indeed something new here, e.g., random element with value in a Banach space is not the same definition as random variable, but involves the dual space. So <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_element.html" title="Random element">random element</a> should be rewritten to reflect correct usage, history of the term, and the relevant math content. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 23:05, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think the dual space is what the Set of events and random set of events is about, it describes a form of duality between two ways of interpereting the phenomena. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 20:54, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Whats your opinion on the last two, are they similarly salvagable, at first glance the mathematics seems sound.

<ul>
<li>I don't think they have anything really going for them (or it, since they are both the same). Basically some definitions are given, and they appear ok, although it's not clear what the applications are (note: it appears there is at least one typo in the last half, but it's hard to tell, since I don't understand what's happening in the later half of the article). Also, the definitions are basically standard - special cases of the notion of random variable. So I suspect the mathematics is already essentially in the body of Wikipedia, whereas the terminology is non-standard. <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_element.html" title="Random element">Random element</a> has a couple of things going for it: 1) it's a real term with some history behind it 2) Usage seems predominantly for random variables taking values in Banach spaces, with a good amount of literature on this topic and using the term "random element". --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 06:15, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You guys can delete it or whatever you want to do. I tried to research the counting sort after Black said that's what it was just as I did when someone claimed it was a bucket sort about ten years ago. I have no doubt that someone else has discovered it long before me but I haven’t been able to find that out either. As for it being original research as the basis for its deletion go ahead I can't prove that it is not and in fact I worked on it for a very long time before it became the sort you now see. This raises another question. I thought that no original research applied only to a situation in which the claim about the research was invalid or could not be verified versus simply the person who did the work or made the discovery not publishing it on the Wiki. I mean if something is verifiably correct then what's the problem? Oh well bottom line for me is that the Rapid sort is what I ended up with when I tried to improve another sort after many, many, many days and nights and weeks and month trying to make that other sort better. Okay so do whatever you guys want it truely makes no difference to me. <small>...IMHO (Talk)</small> 18:25, 28 May 2006 (UTC) PS By the way I just through that part in there about it being a variation of the Pigeonhole sort but honestly I have no idea. I was just in a hurry to get it posted so I could go on to something else. My guess is that you guys will figure out what to do without any further help from me. <small>...IMHO (Talk)</small> 18:49, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Pce3. I realize it's disappointing, but regardless of its veracity it really does still qualify as original research, because it's a publication of your own ideas that have never before been exposed in any other forum to public scrutiny. Also, I'm pretty much certain it is exactly counting sort, which is an O(n) time sort, and is often the best choice of sort for elements with a very small range like your 1..4 numbers. It's not used in place of sorts like quicksort because it doesn't work well for elements that take on a very large range of values, such as arbitrary 32-bit integers - the array would have to have 2<sup>32</sup> entries. I agree that the counting sort article could definitely use some work. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 18:51, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again if you guys want to deprive others of the knowledge of this sort then go ahead. It does not matter to me. As for previous publication I published it on the Internet in at least 1996 and the only response I got was an email suggesting it was a bucket sort and I have never heard of a counting sort prior to hearing about it here. So as tight lipped as the ACM and IEEE and other such organizations are it could very well have been created and filed away long before my efforts resulted in its creation back in 1972. so have at it. If you don't want others to know that it exists fine with me. Hide it, burry it, paint it do whatever you want I can still enjoy the very elegant result of my hard labors without any further ado. Whatever you decide will only make a difference to others and will not make any difference to me. 19:08, 28 May 2006 (UTC) And PS again... As for being a memory hog that it is but then imagine an Internet protocol (why they didn't think of this one back then is a stretch for me) like a the echo of time or quote for sorting on the basis of the Rapid sort such that you simply enumerate you data like converting an "A" to ascii 65 and then using that enumeration as an Internet address which when done returns a count. Doing it that way would allow you to avoid incrementing through all of the addresses that had zero count values. Call it the Sort Port!

<p>Hi Pce3. Just to emphasize that I harbour you no ill will, I've scanned <a href="http://moonflare.com/misc/CountingSort.zip" class="external text" title="http://moonflare.com/misc/CountingSort.zip" rel="nofollow">a description of Counting Sort</a> from the seminal textbook <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>. They don't cite a particular researcher who came up with it, but the book was first published in 1990 and mostly describes classical results from the 1970s. I think if you take a little time to read it you'll realize that what it describes is very much the same idea that you describe. Bucket sort and pigeonhole sort are variations on these ideas. If you'd like to incorporate some of your ideas or implementations into the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counting_sort.html" title="Counting sort">counting sort</a> article, that would be great. Please keep editing, and keep thinking about algorithms too! <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 19:48, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your research efforts on my behalf but I have already decided to reclassify the Rapid sort as an address sort. Thanks anyway. I will however read your material. Thanks. <small>...IMHO (Talk)</small> 19:52, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Okay I've looked at the material and here is my conclusion. My work on the rapid sort began with an effort to improve the Shell-Metzner sort. I wrote this up when I published it on the Internet in 1996. I may even have a record of each step that was taken but they led me to this idea of simply using the data to address memory. Although there is a similarity with the counting sort in that the data in one array is used as an index in another array which is incremented the difference is that my goal was to both maximize speed and to achieve ultimate simplicity since at that time my favorite endeavor was logical equation reduction. Since I had already started from a sort that compared data I was enthused when it turned out that what I was working with did not require a comparison at all. Furthermore since my goal was to eliminate excessive baggage I in fact recall abandoning the idea of using more than one array or even a multi-dimensional array to accomplish the sort. My goal was to reach an end point which this sort represented rather than to then expand upon this idea and add multi-dimensions or other arrays, etc. Why you ask? Again my goal was to find the ultimate sort which the Rapid sort represents. <small>...IMHO (Talk)</small> 20:15, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are some implementation differences - namely, you directly use the input list as it is generated instead of an input array, you print your output instead of storing it in an output array, and you don't perform the intermediate loop on the array which the book is just showing for exposition (most implementations I've seen don't have it). But these are not big differences. As you can see, they also don't use comparisons or multidimensional arrays either. I understand that you're very attached to this algorithm that you've committed a lot of time to thinking about, but it's really nothing new and it's not appropriate for sorting elements that take on a large number of values, not only because of the memory required for the array but because of the time required for the final loop. There is no simple way to "remove the zeros" without increasing the complexity. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 20:23, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well you have not read my further reply to this argument on the Rapid sort deletion talk page so I will repeat it here. Assuming that even though there may not be a client computer or server with a Sort port (similar to an echo or quote port) such capability can be provided by even the router that is home for a particular range of addresses. The idea being that the router or server or client computer returns a count that corresponds with each [identical] address that was sent. The trick then becomes how to get the counts back in sequential order. This can be accomplished simply by implementing return of the count on the basis of a schedule derived from the address [(converted data)] that was sent with a sufficient interval to overcome all types of potential delay. The same scheme could be [implemented] locally and even within the same computer that sent the data as an address with far more certainty [and precision] of the interval being long enough. Instead of an address sort you could call this a time delay sort. Also did I mention that I implemented this sort using random access memory and that an integrated chip that would do test for none zero memory and do the incrimination as well would probably beat any other method that can be implemented in hardware or software? <small>...IMHO (Talk)</small> 20:57, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you'd prefer to discuss it here that's okay. First I'll say that even if this "port sort" idea were novel research, it still counts as original research - we describe things that are well-known (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>), not things that we come up with on our own. For sort algorithms, this usually means they have to be published in a reputable, peer-reviewed journal or conference.</dd>
<dd>As for the idea itself, it's a fun idea, but unfortunately does not yield a speed improvement - the key problem is that the nodes are unaware of one another. Just think of the case where there's two values, one the smallest and one the largest. The largest could not send its count as soon as the smallest has finished, because it doesn't know that the nodes for the intervening values don't have counts to send. To be correct, they'd each have to be allocated a time slot, requiring the same time as counting sort. Besides the fact that overhead makes it entirely impractical. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 22:02, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is just a special case of counting sort and has no interesting features.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Just for clarification's sake, I'm not sure what you mean by "All google hits seem to be produced by the organization itself as part of a campaign to inflate the number of google hits." When I look at the results of a search in Google for the organization, I see 360,000 results for a search of the organization's name (SEMPO), the vast majority appear to be from sites that are not affiliated with SEMPO. It sounds like you are saying that the organization is responsible for many, if not most of those. But I don't think that they are. Maybe I am misunderstanding what you are saying.<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Slawski_cc0b.html" title="User:Bill Slawski">Bill Slawski</a> 03:33, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There seems to be some controversy within the wikipedia on the notability deletion policy. I created the entry for the Search Engine Marketing Professional Organization and added to it once. Rather than others building upon the entry, I'm seeling threats to delete it. I am not a member of the organization, but I'm growing a little disgusted by deletion policy based upon notibility. Would you care to define the notibility policy for me in the context of this organization? Have you even bothered to research the topic, or is there a bias in your approach here? I couldn't care less about the amount of Google hits the organization receives, but I had an interest in trying to help improve the wikipedia. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

<p>You've included <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_Engine_Marketing_Professional_Organization_4fb1.html" title="Search Engine Marketing Professional Organization">SEMPO</a> in this discussion for deletion, too. Is there personal bias in this action to delete? Would you delete the SEO article, too? I'm asking because I've been trying to add to that article in a positive manner, and from what I've seen here, it may just be a wasted effort.<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Slawski_cc0b.html" title="User:Bill Slawski">Bill Slawski</a> 05:06, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I've no idea what you're talking about. This the AfD entry for the SEMPO article, as you can see by the title above. In any case, if you want this article to stay you should point out the reason that the company is deserving of an article in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> spells out the notability stuff around corporations pretty well. As is often said: the Wikipedia does not and can not have an article on every single thing under the sun (I've been using the example of the nonexistant Consumed Crustacean's Left Foot article), hence the notability deletions. You just need to prove why the company is notable, using non-primary (unaffiliated) sources. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 05:11, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The confusion is due to the fact that someone added an additional organization and wikipedia entry to this one (Organization of Search Engine Optimization Professionals), discussing both as if they were the same organization.

<dd>Also, the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> notability requirements don't seem like a very good fit for non profits. You're unlikely to find a nonprofit on the Forbes or Fortune 500, nor product or service reviews for an industry trade group, and stock market indices don't exist for non stock corporations. Perhaps a better measuring stick for a nonprofit, consumer and industry educational group is whether or not the information they share is widely cited. The list of external resouces I created below is only a small listing of many of the places where SEMPO's information has been disseminated by non-affiliated organizations. Hopefully the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, Business Week, Red Herring, and the others I listed are non trivial enough.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Your sources are misleading. The first article I clicked, for example, the CNN article (Google: Biting the Hand that Feeds It?) not only failed to establish SEMPO's notability, but also consisted only of the president of SEMPO talking about a notable company. Additionally, note that <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> requires the company itself to be the subject of the multiple nontrivial publications, not that the publications contain material quoted from said company. <a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a> 13:22, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response to Comment</b>: It's not my intent to mislead, and I don't believe those resources are misleading. CNN wouldn't choose a non-notable organization as a subject matter expert in instances like that, nor would the New York Times, the New York Post, Business Week, the Register, Red Herring, and so on. The surveys that SEMPO has released over the past couple of years have been covered as newsworthy material from notable sources, on topics such as click fraud, online advertising spending, and developing trends in online use and advertising. A number of the sources I listed above include information about those.</dd>

<dd>They are a nonprofit, and a large part of what they do involves the creation and dissemination of information like that, and in providing a voice for people active in internet advertising. It's the equivalent of being a member of the Fortune 500 for an organization like them to be included in places like CNN, speaking on topics like that. I am not a member of SEMPO, and I likely won't become one. I have no bias, and if you decide to delete this article, it's more your loss than mine. Cheers.</dd>

<dd>Two thirds of the criteria for the three pronged test for notability under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> are not appropriate, and do not apply to a nonprofit organization.

<dd>One sad fact about this process of pointing to printed resources that are available on the web is that those resources often have gated walls where material is hidden behind subscription based archives. So, for instance, I didn't look at the full text of the article from the New York Times, nor did I include a couple of other articles from Business Week or other resources where one would have to pay to access that information. Perhaps this comment is more appropriate as a comment on the notability requirements at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, but it's still a valid criticism here, too.<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Slawski_cc0b.html" title="User:Bill Slawski">Bill Slawski</a> 14:38, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As indicated by my comment below, I am "on the fence." Are there any independent articles which have SEMPO as its subject instead of "on background"? You mention the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Business Week</i>, but if there such an article in those (or <i>Washington Post</i>, etc.), the name of the organization would appear in the summary. Find one or more of these and it's very likely that I wouldn't be the only one convinced that the article should stay. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 16:30, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b>:I did an extensive post for SEMPO (Search Engine Marketing Professional Organization) over 2 months ago - which was subsequently removed. It was about the history and impact the organization has made in the timely world of search advertising (ie Google and Yahoo and MSN PPC). This non-profit organization has helped make marketers understand that the world of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine_marketing.html" title="Search engine marketing">search engine marketing</a> a visible and viable method of advertising. The term SEMPO has entered into the lexicon for 'what Google sells'. It is a classic non-profit industry or trade (if you will) association that deserves an entry into Wikipedia. The research conducted by the organization alone is reason for entry.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure enough on this subject to vote a "keep", but the fact that SEMPO's studies are being picked up by various independent news websites (and IIRC one made it through Slashdot and the like) does seem to indicate some notability under WP:CORP.

This should remain on Wikipedia, as it is educational for other schools, and in order to inform those who do not know about or what a //Muck-up Day// is. Please do not delete this as it represents a memorable and historic year for Highgate School and it's history.The event is clearly true, and can be further proven by the photographs. why is this a non-notable event or an article that falls under "Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense"? Having read both articles for both notability and BJAODN, it clearly doesn't fall into either category! within our school, and most other public schools in the country, a muck up day is common for every final year on the last day. The day consisted of fun, no vandalism and pure enjoyment between teachers and students.

<li><b>Do not delete</b>Surely the number of comments on this page demonstrates the 'importance of the subject matter'. It was not only an important day in the history of one of the oldest educational institutions in Britain, in the history of the tradition of muck-up day, but also hugely important to all those who witnessed the day and were involved in it.b</li>
<li><b>Do not delete</b> -- I am a keen wikipedian and one who was a witness of the event. In my, humble, opinion, it has a right to be on wikipedia as it was the most successful muck up day for a long time and the culmination of 13 years of highgate for many students. However, perhaps what makes it stand out most is that it marked the first completion of a co-educational 6th form- something which defied hundreds of years of highgate's history and made this day so monumental. This is certainly a notable event. Seb. SebM 14:27, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do not delete</b>-- An important memory for all those involved. The actions that took place on the day were in no way insulting or demeaning to any party and the spirit of the day was enacted in a manner which was light-hearted and regarded well by both teachers and students alike. Given the significant amount of time and effort put into the events of the day, i do not see why the event should not be recorded on this website. It offends no one and those wishing for it to be deleted need to understand that the memory of the day is important for the students, for the teachers, and for the future Highgate School pupils. This article is not promoting or advertising an act of vandalism, but an act of celebration and unity amongst the pupils. 86.142.25.244 12:26, 30 May 2006 (UTC)Dean M</li>
<li><b>Do not delete</b> -- I cannot see any good and justifiable reason for deleting this page - it is far better constructed and referenced than many other so-called "legitimate" events pages on wikipedia.

This is certainly a most notable event!! Luc</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I see no reason as to why this article is up for deletion. Wikipedia, in essence, is exactly what its slogan says it is i.e. "the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit". Encyclopedia's are a source of information and tend to be useful resources. However, Wikipedia, as highlighted by Payneo, has limited information on Muck-up days in general and I see absolutely no reason why this article cannot be used as a prime example of what muck-up days should be about: having fun, having a laugh and making it one of the most memorable days of the school calender. This particular muck-up day is a milestone in Highgate School's history, as it is the first time that girls have participated in the tradition and this surely makes it a notable event, as not only does it mark the start of the evolution within Highgate but also shows how far Highgate has come not only as a school but as a community. I beg to differ and would like to ask <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">User:Starblind</a> where and in what form the "vandalism" actually took place? Also, <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">User:Starblind</a> goes on to say that Muck-up day is an "unofficial event at a single school". However, this statement is false as A) it is a traditional event at Independant Schools in the UK and so B) occurs at schools nationwide and internationally as <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">User:Capitalistroadster</a> points out that they had on at Mulwaree High School in Australia.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>While this article may seem to be of limited importance I would argue that this is not the case. From reading what is frankly a very well written and witty account I have a number of observations. Firstly with over 100 people involved in the proceedings it seems that this page is not without a solid base of interested viewers. Secondly, coming from England I am well aware of the tradition of muck-up days and it is in this light that I believe this page is of great use. Many pupils take the opportunity of leaving school to cause violence to the local community, run riot and generally create unberable havoc. However the ideas used by the Highgate pupils were neither destructive nor troublesome to locals or staff. Therefore if in future years pupils searched wikipedia for inspiration for their own muck-up days then Highgate school seems like an exemplary example to follow. A final point I would add is the standard of written English in the article would no doubt also act as something which more unruly pupils (who would have already been disuaded from dangerous actions) could learn something from. Well written and commendable, i hope this is not deleted.86.138.120.15 14:46, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The concept of a muck up day is a historic and traditional one that has very few articles written on it.

<li>"Votes" was a bad choice of words. What I meant to say was that I agree with all the comments made above in support of deletion. Wikipedia cannot have articles on every annual "muck-up day" in every school around the world – and nothing in this article suggest that this muck-up day was more significant than the many thousands of others. <a href="../../../z/a/x/User%7EZaxem_8e49.html" title="User:Zaxem">Zaxem</a> 09:32, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This article provides a prime example of a successful muck up day. Other than this article Wikipedia has less than 100 words about muck up days - events that are part of a tradition for many secondary schools in the UK and across the world (in particular Australia). There is very little published information anywhere for those wanting to find out more about muck up days; this supplys those interested with a great illustration of one. Payneo 15:12, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This would be a good argument for expanding the <a href="../../../m/u/c/Muck-up_day.html" title="Muck-up day">Muck-up day</a> article on Wikipedia to include more general information about the type of things that commonly happen at muck-up days around the world. But it's not a reasonable argument to justify why Wikipedia should have an article about one specific muck-up day at one individual school whose muck-up days are not any more significant than those at any other school around the world which has them. <a href="../../../z/a/x/User%7EZaxem_8e49.html" title="User:Zaxem">Zaxem</a> 10:20, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Cannot be verified"??? 500 pictures will not have been faked 'Molerat'...your argument seems to revolve around the fact that other, more significant events do not have wikis - this is a non sequitur. The article itself also points out that it is of interest to both the many thousands of Old Cholmelians and much of the North London community. It is time to remove the chip from your shoulder and get rid of your prejudices against private schools and their 'traditions'. It is only by working from the bottom-up that Wikipedia serves its purpose. This is my vision of the Wikipedia of the future.<b>Keep</b>129.67.43.240 23:39, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have neither particular historical knowledge of, nor interest in, the Armenian-Turk, Greco-Turk, Bulgarian-Turk etc. conflicts, and the associated historical grievances. This article, though, is a mess of propagandistic and of course blatantly <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a> invective regarding alleged massacres in the course of these conflicts. The sources cited are either not online or clearly partisan, and are at any rate not specific to the individual allegations. I realise AfD is not a content dispute forum, but I think that this sort of text cannot be usefully NPOVed (or merged), and that the article itself is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">POV fork</a> of the existing articles on the history of these conflicts. An article on "Turkish Massacres" (or rather, "Massacres of Turks", which is what is meant) during many very different conflicts has no systematic value to the encyclopedian, only to the propagandist.

<p>I was going to speedy this as OR, but then I noticed that the page creator has previously been involved in a dispute on the main <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_%28TV_series%29_e301.html" title="House (TV series)">House</a> article about this exact section: namely, whether or not it counts as OR. After all, he says on the talk page, it's observable fact - you can get this information just by watching episodes of the show.</p>
<p>But it really doesn't feel right. What say you, o brethren? And as importantly, what are your reasons? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 13:55, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hmmmm. As an avid fan of this superb show (and I spend less than 3 hours a week watching television....) I would have to say that it appears to be true but the article's main problem is that it lacks citation; to be "typical", 50% or more of the shows would have to follow this pattern exactly and the article would have to show this. That could make it very, very long indeed. I don't know either actually - I agree that it feels unencyclopedic but I find it hard to grudge. Meh, a <b>weak keep</b> with citation required but I'll get back to you.

I find it difficult to call it 'Original Research' when all that has been done is highlight specific details of the show.

<li><b>Delete</b> -- no real point in merging: it's an unlikely search term. The obviously OR-ness of this article aside, I'm torn over the question of whether the original article could contain somewhat of information about the typical plot. I'm not that familiar with <i>House</i> but it seems like, for example, elemements that are common to each episode can be notable and verifiable. For example, each Simpson's episode starting with Bart drawing on the chalk board.

<p>Frankly, this article seems nonsensical to me. However, I think that there may be wikipedians who want this kept (at least one, as it was written, with some effort expended), so rather than speedy nom, I ask you, my fellow wikipedians, to accept (or otherwise) this article.

<p>I'm not sure why you found the article I wrote on reception to be nonsense, except that (reading it over) it is rather technical, and I imagine it might seem obscure. If the problem is that it's written in a way that someone with little background in astrology might understand, fair enough. I'll try to make it more accessible. But it's not as if it's some wiggy idea that I dreamt up. The concept has been around for two millennia, and it's always been called "reception." I'm assuming there is no bias against astrology involved in flagging it. NaySay 15:25, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Trouble is that large parts of the article seem to be verbatim copies from just that review. Plus, the book it talks about is just a doctoral dissertation - even if it was a very good one and seminal within her narrow field of specialisation, I guess that alone would hardly make her a notable academic for our purposes here. I vote for <b>delete</b> in the present form, not least because of the apparent copyvio, but without prejudice - if someone can produce a better article with some more data on her career and importance for her field, that'll be fine. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 15:15, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The term may exist as a grouping of individuals, yes. Nazi hunters however are not an established/institutionalized entity. They are, rather, a concept. This usage of Nazi hunters aims to portray them as if in an established organizational entity which is borderline NEO because it is not a common use of the term. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 18:44, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How exactly does listing [all of] the above respond to another blackletter listing on <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> that "An academic who has published a book of general interest, a widely-used textbook, or non-academic articles in periodicals with significant readership is notable as an author, <i>regardless of their academic achievements</i> (emphasis supplied). The problem, of course, is how to define "general interest." That appears to speak to subject matter, i.e., not a textbook or treatment of arcane matters, but listing all the criteria in the first section there, and not treating the one I am obviously citing, is not responsive. I am always willing to consider new information. In this case I am changing my vote, but for a different reason, having checked other sources I see that the above section I have cited is poorly drafted (and needs to be reformed). In the main precedents section it is stated that: "Published authors are notable if they have received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work." That criteria she appears to fail and I agree with to an extent, though I do think the criteria for academics is out of balance with the too liberal standards which allow the keeping of all manner of cruft.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 17:38, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

And now it's under the gun again for reasons that are not entirely clear to me. It has a poor Alexa score, but Alexa is an unofficial indicator at best. It meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> unambiguously. And I quote: "Web specific-content is notable if it meets <i>any</i> one of the following criteria:" (emphasis <i>not</i> mine). One of those criteria is: "2. The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation.[6]" The footnote for this item is: "Examples of such awards: Eisner Awards, Bloggies, Webby Awards or <i>Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards</i>" (emphasis mine). Elf Only Inn won a Web Cartoonist's Choice award, as specifically described in the article. Thus, assertion of notability is met. That really should be the end of the debate. I'm sorry if this seems testy, but were this any other comic, I would have speedy kept it as a trivial nomination. The only reason I didn't was because I have a history with the article, making it a conflict of interest. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 19:54, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you're selling the WCCA short. I understand the temptation to compare it to the Pia Zadora era People's Choice Awards, but the last time the New York Times paid any attention to webcomics, it was through analysis of last year's WCCA.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/17/books/17comi.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/17/books/17comi.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> (registration required - yadda yadda yadda) Yes, they're controversial, but I think the decision to include them as a qualifying factor for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> was a good one. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 04:20, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Being completed has everything to do with the poor Alexa rank that has been cited as a reason for deletion by the nom.

<li>So you're saying it should have a lower standard set for it because it's completed? That doesn't make sense. If it were truly notable, it would have an acceptable Alexa rank even after it was completed. As it is, people are just forgetting about it, and who wants an article in an encyclopedia about a site that everybody has forgotten about? --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory096_e5c4.html" title="User:Rory096">Rory096</a> 20:53, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Alexa is not part of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and there's a good reason for that. The Internet as a whole has a very short attention span. Wikipedia doesn't. It is the rule, not the exception, that Alexa ratings drop for comics - and other sites - when they've completed their run. It doesn't matter how wildly popular they were, they <i>always</i> fade. Does that mean we then delete them? No. There's plenty of precedence in AfD for that, and it's why <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> reads like it does. Alexa and Google hits are sometimes good indicators, but their numbers don't trump much of anything. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 21:06, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>True, Alexa is not the most reliable source for data on websites (though 1.1 million is invariably rather bad), and it's not part of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, but who will remember this site in a year? 5 years? 10 years?

<li>I respect your right to have that opinion, but it's not the prevailing sentiment on AfD as a whole. Don't believe me, take a look at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mirsky%27s_Worst_of_the_Web_9dd8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mirsky's Worst of the Web">this</a> AfD. Mirsky faded from view ten years ago. Its Alexa score is now over 6 million. Or how about <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tristan_A._Farnon_e266.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tristan A. Farnon">Tristan A. Farnon's</a> AfD; his webcomic has an Alexa score in the same range as EOI despite appearing on Salon and CNN. We kept it, and that was the correct decision. In Wikipedia, once notable, always notable. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 21:17, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Indeed things that are notable once are notable later. However, I dispute that anything that will barely be remembered 5 years after it ceases to exist is notable at all. --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory096_e5c4.html" title="User:Rory096">Rory096</a> 21:41, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You do have a point there. There are a few webcomics that have vanished entirely off the net and I am very ambivalent about whether we should keep articles for them or not. Some of them were popular when they were around, but having gone totally dark, it's hard to verify anything about them. EOI is on Keenspot, though, so that isn't likely to be a problem. Unless the author pulls the material from the site, then it will stay there indefinitely. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 21:45, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

"Poor Alexa rating" seems a thin excuse at best to attempt to delete it, especially considering its retired status.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Rise Records (the record label fro Drop Dead, Gorgeous)is not a vanity label, but a notable indie that has signed many bands who have gone on to bigger labels, such as Ever We Fall (Hopeless Records) and Fear Before The March Of Flames (Equal Vision). Those who submit opinions into this section should really do their research before they randomly ad their thoughts. The band Drop Dead, Gorgeous is well known throughout the country, and has been receiving favorable writeups in the music press. Whether you like this style of music or not, Drop Dead, Gorgeous is a notable force of the indie music scene and deserve a page on Wikipedia. I vote to <b>KEEP</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - the incident that prompted a large proportion of the discussion about her only happened at the end of last week. I think that's too recently for any offline sources that are likely to be interested (e.g. publishing trade or free speech related publications) to have had a chance to discuss her yet. I'm pretty sure we'll see some, and a number of important online sources have featured articles about her. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 08:36, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>: I wrote some of what was deleted, trying to explain context of why this is here without it being an attack. If Bauer was merely one of twenty agents on this rather important, widely-disseminated list, I would agree that she's non-notable. What distinguishes her from the rest of the 20 is that she has allegedly tried to have an editor fired, successfully campaigned to get a web community with thousands of members (Absolute Write) shut down on an hour's notice, and generally threatened many of those who initially disseminated the list with spurious claims of illegality, specifically that publishing her email address (which she has publicly posted elsewhere) constitutes copyright infringement and spamming. This is well documented on Making Light and probably elsewhere, from several sources (check the comment thread in ML). I expect this will spill over into print media eventually. It was this campaign of intimidation that caused many, many writers and bloggers to write on their blogs about her, and to Googlebomb her in retaliation. So basically, she's notable for having allegedly a) overcharged for services without producing producing professional sales, b) caused inconvenience and in one case economic harm to her perceived enemies in her attempts to suppress the list, without any legal basis to do so, and c) for being the victim of retaliatory Googlebombing. I suspect this article was originally written on this basis, but I think there is an element of notability, especially if an actual lawsuit arises as a result of the Absolute Write debacle. That has, by the way, a much larger story than just the Bauer part in it.<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> 02:27, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and clean up, probably by <b>undeleting</b> the original, since it was better sourced and better written than the current incarnation at the time it was unceremoniously dumped. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 08:37, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, at least in the short term. There's been credible evidence presented else-net of unscrupulous behaviour by this person, and we probably have two opposed factions here. Delete the article, and one side wins. Keep the article, and its history, and keep the content verifiable, and maybe everybody wins. I'd agree that being on that 20 Worst Agents list isn't enough to make Barbara Bauer notable. Her apparent involvement with the <b>Absolute Write</b> shutdown, which raises issues of free speech, the security of user data on websites, and possibly much more, tips the balance. I think this page could be a part of a little thicket of linked pages, as the situation develops, and all of them may need guarding against biased and unscrupulous changes.

<li><b>Comment</b>: This is rather the point. There appears to be no documented evidence that a single client has been paid for his or her writing as a direct result of Ms. Bauer's activities. If such a person does exist and can be discovered, the article should include that information. Also on the positive/neutral side, and not yet present, is Ms. Bauer's PhD, which has been researched and found to be legitimate, and any other biographical information of note.
<ul>
<li>There's a list of clients on her website. Unfortunately, as you might expect, none appear to be notable, the same sort of problem you'd run into if you listed the "Notable alumni" of diploma mills or the "Notable authors" of vanity publishers. I agree that stronger documentary evidence is called for to bring this up to snuff. BY the way, where <i>is</i> her Ph.d from?

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm sure if you used that self prescribed "test" you could probably delete 75% of the bands on Wikipedia, given the gaping ambiguity of the term "main online home" as a result of the majority of mainstream bands also having Myspace pages, which many people can attain tour info, listen to music, buy merchandise, and do so exclusively. OXES have a page on their label, in addition to their official page, so I'm not exactly sure what the point of this arbitrary test was, and why it was put here.</li>

<p>Ok, let's put this clear. This article <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Gutt%C3%A6ne_FC_ba4c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Guttæne FC">survived a first nomination</a> some months ago. The club was said to be notable because it was "probably the worst team in Norway" (finishing last in the 9th tier of Norwegian football the 2005 season). No chance in hell that is a reason for notability. There is a new "worst club in Norway" each year (actually a lot of them every year since there is several "lowest divisions" spread over the country, and there have been loads of them over the decades. Being "probably the worst" in something is <b>not</b> notable (in 99% of the cases, including this) and thus this should be deleted. – <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Elisson</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">•</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Talk</font></a> 20:08, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I take a wide view of notability for football clubs and players. Remember, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a> and as such should not be restricted by the volume of its collection: if a topic is real and genuine, meets the requirements of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> and is in general well written, I do not see any reason for us to delete it, or even to draw a line as to which topics falls within the boundary and which topics do not, simply because such boundary needs not exist at the first place. Also remember that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is an <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">official policy</a> while <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is only an <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_essays_5501.html" title="Category:Wikipedia essays">essay</a>. --<a href="../../../p/k/c/User%7EPkchan_0b01.html" title="User:Pkchan">Pkchan</a> 16:19, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But also remember that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. As Eivind says below, by going with your view, the only thing needed for an entry in Wikipedia is 11 people and 11 shirts of the same colour. Then any store or coffee shop or restaurant or school or almost anything is more notable because it takes much more work to create something like that, and a random coffee shop in for example <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothenburg.html" title="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a> would be much more notable to the general Gothenburger than an 8th division team...

<dd>My reading of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> is that Wikipedia is not for a senseless dump of <i>information</i> which does not add to <i>knowledge</i> -- eg how-tos, telephone directories, quotations, that sort of thing. Here, however, we are talking about a football club in existence, which has history (participation in a known league) and achievements (well, perhaps not the most glorious one in this case). It adds to our knowledge of the lower level of club football in Norway. Indeed, most football clubs do.</dd>
<dd>As for the coffee shop in Gothenburg: indeed, I do not mind its inclusion here as long as it is written in an encyclopedic manner and offer more knowledge than the senseless dump of information. --<a href="../../../p/k/c/User%7EPkchan_0b01.html" title="User:Pkchan">Pkchan</a> 18:10, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Rebuttal:</b> As I have pointed out to Delkart in the past, GameSpot has already spoken publically about weighing the options between someday re-releasing the complete <i>Time Trotters:</i> Season One set on <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blu-Ray_76a8.html" title="Blu-Ray">Blu-Ray</a> and/or <a href="../../../h/d/-/HD-DVD_11e6.html" title="HD-DVD">HD-DVD</a>.

<dd>Delkart, as someone who thoroughly enjoyed all the conversations on internet message boards that were spurred by the release of the latest episode of <i>Time Trotters</i> every week, I know a lot about this series. Anything concrete I have to share has been researched and posted in the Wikipedia article you're lobbying to have deleted. If there's something more you'd like know, please feel free to suggest improvements to the article in the "Discussion" page, or to go straight to the source by posting something on the GameSpot community message boards. Either way, I'd encourage you to find a more constructive way of expressing yourself than posting personal insults in my <a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPattonPending_d396.html" title="User talk:PattonPending">User Talk page</a>.

<dd>"Why yes, Time Trotters is the name of a video feature produced by GameSpot's video group that stars such GameSpot staff members as Jeff Gerstmann, Ryan Davis, and Rich Gallup." which refers to the only episode that there ever was.

<dd>Besides, why are there no relevant results when I search in Google for Time Trotters. 0 relevant results. 0, ZERO, do you understand this??

<p><b>Submitted for Wikipedian Consideration:</b> When films, television, and videogames first appeared as forms of entertainment, they were dismissed by "mainstream society" as frivolous short lived fads which did not measure up to existing forms of entertainment. In retrospect, information on those earliest fledgling steps into what would grow into tremendously popular new cultural expressions is widely respected as a part of our historical record. Original internet programming may seem like a hobby or a pipe dream to some, but it <i>is</i> a fresh form of entertainment premiering on the world's #1 fastest growing new medium. A successful web series like <i>Time Trotters</i> -- one of the first of its kind! -- which is produced and distributed by an international web company like GameSpot deserves a place in the encylopedic record.

<dd>Patton, you didn't address my question. Why are there 0 results when I try to find anything related to Time Trotters in Google? If Time Trotters was a REAL series, there would be at least some discussions going on in blogs, forums etc, and it would show up in google. But there are no results on google!! Why are you not addressing this issue? You talk all kinds of stuff, but don't address the issues that are the reason this article is considered for deletion.</dd>

<dd><b>Strong Keep</b> World of Warcraft is a game with 5 million players and this is a very notable group of players. No single guild caused as much debate and contaversy as Giant Communist Robots. I do agree that guilds or clubs usually don't deserve an Wikipedia article, but this is an exception. I was actually suprised when I found out Wikipedia didn't have this article. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitwatcher_4ed2.html" title="User:Titwatcher">Titwatcher</a> 21:13, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Did it cause any influence or significance outside the gaming community?

<dd><b>Comment</b> Even if it did not... the controversy is understandable by those outside of the gaming community, and opens an important debate that transends the gaming community. Again, I am not a member of this guild, and don't personally know it's members. I came to Wikipedia to FIND information about this issue for a paper on Video games and censorship.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> i totally disagree -- the concept is pretty useful in sociology (explaining political campaign success, business performance, success in finding jobs) and also to explain the logic and varying performance of social networks (LinkedIn tried to be a strong tie network, but it is a network of weak ties, therein lies its success)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I disagree as well. The concept of a weak social tie seems logical and tangible to me. The article on the weak social tie should be expanded instead of deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have no interest in World of Warcraft or in fact any game but I do find this page fasinating. I also have a great feeling it will become far more relevent some time in the future, possibly the reaction to pandemics and other world catastrophies will be tested on these MMORPGs and computor simulation and this particular event could be cited as one of the idea's main origins.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - this is an in-game storyline, and, while it may have a significant effect in WoW, it won't anywhere else. It is also my no means innovative or notable in CRPG terms - so a big MMOPRG decides to give its players the plague; many MUDs have done this before, and it wasn't worthy of an article. Ideally, the content would be moved to a WoW-specific place, although I fear the fanwikis will have already covered it in greater depth. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Pointon_24f4.html" title="User:Sam Pointon">Sam Pointon</a> 22:16, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>The nomination's claim that "only assertion of significance is a 47-word blip on NPR" is nonsense. Noting the mainstream media coverage that Jacoplane mentions, and the huge impact this has had on the <i>World of Warcraft</i> community, this does not appear to be a well researched nomination, and indeed looks to be a trademark use of "cruft" to mean "I've never heard about it, so <b>delete</b>". All in all, looks to be a major keeper. <a href="../../../i/f/f/Iff.html" title="Iff">Iff</a> that fails, I'd suggest splitting off the "Hakkar the Soulflayer" entry from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Warcraft_characters_df5f.html" title="List of Warcraft characters">List of Warcraft characters</a> and merging this, producing a nice solid, if rather confused article at <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakkar.html" title="Hakkar">Hakkar the Soulflayer</a>.

Though attempts to explain definition of independence of events by means of “knowledge” and “information” are widely widespread in the probability literature but while I did not manage to find publications on the theme of these delusion.

<dd>The point of the example is that the events <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are independent in the sense of probability theory, if p = 1/2. However, they are not independent in the usual sense of the word, as both depend on the throws of the coin. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 14:34, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As I understood it when I did the rewrite, the phrase "it is shown, that except for probability nothing operates independence of events" was intended to mean that in a mathematical (as opposed to physical) probabilistic experiment, events are "shallow": the only pieces of information are the descriptions of the events and the probabilities of each outcome, which are independent of the events themselves. This is the (or one of the) sentence which led me to believe that <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelgus_b293.html" title="User:Helgus">Helgus</a> was talking about lack of causality and hidden information. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 14:42, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article states that the terminology "independent events" has the unfortunate side effect of implying that "non-independent events appear to embody some kind of <b>information</b> one about the other", and this is then presumably a form of the misconception of the title. I tried to show by a very simple example that this is not a misconception but that indeed they do. The article also states as another form of the "misconception": "both [independent events] are constrained by a third, underlying variable". In the example of the article, both A and B <i>are</i> constrained by the same triple of outcomes of other events. It is almost as if the example was produced to illustrate that the presumed misconception is in fact not a misconception. The article was originally written with the purpose of showing that the lead paragraph of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistical_independence.html" title="Statistical independence">Statistical independence</a> was based on a delusion. This was later reiterated by the author on the talk page of Statistical independence. I assume the example given is indeed from Stoyanov's book. If it is not a counterexample to the "misconception" identified in the article, then what is it a counterexample to? I can only guess, but my best guess is that it is a counterexample to the following false claim, which is <i>precisely the converse</i> of the alleged misconception: "If two events are statistically independent, they are also independent in the sense that they are not constrained by a third, underlying variable". That this claim is indeed false is shown by Stoyanov's example for the case <i>p</i> = 1/2. I don't know if this is a common misconception, and I don't know whether Stoyanov claims it is one, but in any case it is not the misconception from the article. If the example is merged into Statistical independence purely as an example of showing how you can compute for this case whether the events A and B are independent, that's fine (although as an example for that it is needlessly complicated and not particularly appealing). If it is incoporated as a counterexample, we'd better find out from Stolyanov's book (which I don't have) what it is a counterexample to. The "misconception" from the article is unverifiable "original research" as far as I'm concerned. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:25, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't agree that the concept is original research, just as any example in mathematics, appropriately accompanying the theory it's a part of, is not original research (up to a point). It is not unencyclopedic to give examples of what something is <i>not</i> as part of describing what it <i>is</i>. This content should go in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistical_independence.html" title="Statistical independence">statistical independence</a> in this capacity. The example is not worthless either, as it illustrates <i>part</i> of the irrelevance of causality to statistical independence. Would it be original research to provide one or two more as illustrations of the rest? <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 20:14, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The above sentence contains a switcheroo from "concept" to "example". The example is not OR. The concept is. The concept is not the example. You write: "appropriately accompanying the theory it's a part of" — but that's at least a big part of what is at issue. The example is <b>not</b> an example of what is described in the lead paragraph. What is described in the lead paragraph is <b>not</b> illustrated by an example contained in this article. But even if it were an appropriate example, is the theory it is supposed to accompany and be a part of (presumably that which is described in the lead paragraph, or else what) a notable concept in probability theory, or is it just someone's misguided pet peeve? How do we know without reliable source? I can write an article about the common pitfall of making a copying error, replacing a "2" for a "z" in a formula, and illustrate with a valid example how that leads to an incorrect result. Is that then not original research because there is an example accompanying it, even though it cannot be properly sourced as per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>? --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 01:07, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is a huge difference between swapping 2 and z, and swapping causal and statistical independence: the first one has nothing to do with anything more general, but the second one is an important part of understanding probability. To be clear: I think the "concept" is that of statistical independence, and I think that the allegedly original idea in this article is a clarification, similar to a statement like "In number theory, (<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>) refers to the greatest common divisor of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> rather than their inner product or their ordered pair". It's a necessary clarification because when people conceptualize dependent events they think of causality, just as in the previous sentence, it would be necessary to clarify for an analyst that a commonly used symbol does not have the accustomed meaning. Before we enter another round of this, please indicate whether you think that such a clarification is necessarily OR. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 03:14, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personally I don't think it is necessary to state that statistical independence is not implied by causal independence. I'm not even sure what that means and if it is true.

<li><b>Comment</b> I added the notion of self-independence to both this article and the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistical_independence.html" title="Statistical independence">statistical independence</a> article, since this notion more briefly illustrates the difference between statistical independence and vernacular notions of independence. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 19:52, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Isn't it misleading to write, just like that, "an event is independent of itself"? Here is a less dry everyday (literally) example. The event of the sun rising today has no bearing on the probability of it rising tomorrow (assuming that probability to be 1), so these events are statistically independent, even though having a common underlying mechanism. I hope this example is illuminating (pun intended). --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:01, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That example is not as paradoxical in my opinion, since it does not address actual events of probability zero nor does it address the odder notion that something can be statistically independent of itself. I think the notion that an event can be independent of itself is powerful due to the seeming paradox; it gets to the heart of what the original author was saying, that independence is only statistical not philosophical or absolute. I have the example of picking 0.5 out of the unit interval in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistical_independence.html" title="Statistical independence">statistical independence</a> entry (to which I could add the Durrett reference if needed). Unfortunately, nontrivial real-world examples are hard to come by, since possible but zero measure events imply infinite divisibility or infinite time, either of which is arguably not a given in the current universe. Even the sun rise example need not be an <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almost_sure.html" title="Almost sure">almost sure</a> event (e.g., what if the earth is destroyed by a comet, etc.). (Perhaps a physicist could come up with a simple-to-understand real-world example where zero measure does come into play, one that both expert and layman can understand and agree upon, but I'm no physicist.) <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 03:52, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> in its entirety. I have been rowing for 31 years. The statistics contained in the article, for the most part, are verifiable, but not particularly meaningful. Rowing is similar to most other sports where men enjoy a physical advantage: Men are on average faster. But so what. Men and women compete in separate categories. The premise of the article, that women's rowing is inferior to men's, and that there is a "substantial difference in standards and technique" is false. (On an elite level, women's crews row at the same cadence as men's crews, and they employ the same technique. There is no fitness deficit). The article is likely a joke. At the same time the author created this article, he created a second article entitled "Assisted Drifting" which is just a redirect to "Women's Rowing." The author thereby infers that Women's Rowing = Assisted Drifting. <a href="../../../s/w/l/User%7ESwlenz_fd2e.html" title="User:Swlenz">Swlenz</a> 22:55, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I certainly understand that, and I don't doubt that Strothra nominated it in good faith. It looks like any other knot of conspiracist cruft, this one just happens to have been discussed by some reputable people. The page as it was didn't demonstrate that - I added a cite to David Corn's article.

<dd>Finally, thank you. Apparently my standards for inclusion are a little too high for some in the community and I will admit that.

<li>You treat Alexa rank as though it is a statistically-representative sampling of the population at large, where the % of WRH readers who have Alexa installed is approximately the same as the % of the general population on the WWW who has Alexa installed. Alexa counts page rank only via those people who install the Alexa toolbar. The Alexa toolbar is spyware (as fully described in the <a href="http://pages.alexa.com/help/terms.html" class="external text" title="http://pages.alexa.com/help/terms.html" rel="nofollow">terms of use</a>: "COLLECTS AND STORES INFORMATION ABOUT THE WEB PAGES YOU VIEW, THE DATA YOU ENTER IN ONLINE FORMS AND SEARCH FIELDS, AND, WITH VERSIONS 5.0 AND HIGHER, THE PRODUCTS YOU PURCHASE ONLINE WHILE USING THE TOOLBAR SERVICE" [capitalization due to Alexa, not me]). WRH is a website whose primary purpose is to disseminate evidence of how various powerbases are acting in ways that are contrary to the individual liberties that were supposedly protected by the founding fathers via the U.S. Constitution. The typical WRH reader is a person who (I claim) is inclined to entertain the possibility that some government agencies and some corporations are acting badly. Wouldn't such a person be concerned about an Alexa terms-of-use agreement that in plain language announces that the Alexa toolbar collects information about their every activity on the Internet, where a (possibly foreign) government could tap into that collected information? I claim that the typical WRH reader would not install Alexa because the East-German-STASI-like possibility of current or near-future abuse of that collected information by FBI, by NSA, by the military, by foreign governments, and by corporations with which Alexa has contractual relationships far outweighs any perceived benefit of Alexa to the individual. Thus, Michael Rivero considers the Alexa page rankings for WRH to be skewed to under-representing how many hits that WRH has per unit time.<a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/FAQ/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://whatreallyhappened.com/FAQ/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>. Think about it. If a person were to believe the news-reports published every day on WRH of abuses of power, then wouldn't that person be fearful of abuse of the vast collection of personal information that Alexa harvests to the point that the Alexa toolbar would not be installed on that person's computer at all? Alexa page rank for WRH would be counting only A) those careless regular WRH readers who did not read the Draconian Alexa terms of use and B) those casual interlopers who are not the regular WRH readers and C) those who became regular WRH readers after their first several visits with the Alexa toolbar installed and then decided to de-install Alexa for abuse-of-power concerns. —<a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptikos_6dff.html" title="User:Optikos">optikos</a> 14:51, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and <b>Clean up</b> User:Twinpinesmall This article is in dire need of constant policing by Wikipedia members, so as to ensure a <b>neutral</b> point of view, and no political leanings. If this article were to be deleted, just because a few immature people cannot stand to see any information on those they disagree with; it would COMPLETELY defeat Wikipedia's entire purpose and raison d'etre.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> One of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>'s criteria is awards garnered. Here are the awards that WRH has earned over the years: <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/FAQ/awards.htm" class="external free" title="http://whatreallyhappened.com/FAQ/awards.htm" rel="nofollow">http://whatreallyhappened.com/FAQ/awards.htm</a> with links to awarding organizations. Also if WRH is an article that becomes deleted, then perhaps <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">slashdot</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthout.html" title="Truthout">truthout</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drudge_Report_b304.html" title="Drudge Report">Drudge Report</a> should be deleted as well. Which awards has Slashdot or Truthout or DrudgeReport earned that are more substantial than WRH? (Please do list them below. Nobel? Pulitzer?) As a daily reader of both WRH and DrudgeReport, I find that the view supported by WRH is one of fact-finding by commonfolk American citizens trying to practice democracy the best that they know how, whereas I consider DrudgeReport a propaganda machine that serves well to figure out which emotional froth <i>du jour</i> that we sheeple are to be worked up to. Thus I find it offensive to hear labels of "conspiracy theorist" lobbed against WRH, when what WRH is attempting to do is expose facts and evidence that do not fit with the prevailing conventional wisdom. I hold WRH up (as do the awards) as brave patriotic activist democracy in action by the little guy. I hold up Wikipedia as much the same. Also WRH is congruent to Michael Rivero as much as Drudge Report is congruent to Matt Drudge. Without their mouthpiece blog, Rivero or Drudge is a nobody. The only reason that Alex Jones interviews Michael Rivero is because of the WRH blog. Alex Jones doesn't interview Rivero for Rivero's technical business conducted in Hawaii. Furthermore, Rivero's WRH-centered interviews by Alex Jones syndication itself qualifies as "multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself". This AfD fits with my overall sense that a growing number of Wikipedians are interested in destroying Wikipedia content more than they are interested in writing new content. Rather than debating how to write a good WRH article, we are debating how best to destroy it. I find it very telling that <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisonplanet.com.html" title="Prisonplanet.com">Prisonplanet.com</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Rense_351f.html" title="Jeff Rense">Jeff Rense</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infowars.com.html" title="Infowars.com">Infowars.com</a>, and What Really Happened are all the same political movement and all up for deletion at the same time.

<dd>Regarding other AfDs of the same ilk, it is obvious to me that there is a campaign afoot to censor on Wikipedia the political movement and nonMSM journalism that WRH &amp; Michael Rivero, Rense.com &amp; Jeff Rense, and PrisonPlant.com &amp; Alex Jones represent. A multiple-AfD campaign of sweeping censorship of an entire political movement and of an entire branch of nonMSM journalism is very much worth exposing and very much is a matter worthy of debate on <i>each</i> of that political movement's AfDs. Re:"Oh please." So where is the list of awards the DrudgeReport has earned that I requested? Any Nobel or Pulitzer or Peabody in Drudge's list? So far WRH has entered numerous awards into this discussion whereas DrudgeReport has a big fat zero awards presented here for comparison. —<a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptikos_6dff.html" title="User:Optikos">optikos</a> 05:08, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - there's something wrong with that newsmax article which claims to be from 1997. Even according to Rivero's site archive <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>, whatreallyhappened.com was not formed until early 1999. It previously was his personal site, "Rancho Runamukka", which evolved from prior personal ISP websites. My assumption is that the 1997 newsmax article linked to Rivero's personal site, and then someone edited the newsmax article to replace the dead link with the newer whatreallyhappened.com. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 17:18, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Wow! What an excellent tool for censorship of whole articles, especially for topics that are popular with Wikipedia-outsiders! Now all Wikipedians know how best to rig up an automatic deletion outcome for nearly any AfD: just make sure that Wikipedia-outsiders are aware of the AfD of their popular topic so that many defenders with edit-total less than, say, 100 can all be declared meatpuppets that in itself precipitates automatic deletion. Hmmmm, sort of like a hypothetical "justice" system where if too many general citizens show up in the audience of the courtroom, the defendant is automatically guilty of a capital-punishment crime.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Does it really matter that they posted a story about this "challenge" of a wiki article written by a WRH reader, not Rivero himself? This challenge on the osama video article re-write is baseless. Look at the articles being used to verify the Osama video piece. 95% of them are BBC Telegraph or Guardian articles. There are two articles from informationclearinghouse, which is nothing more than an RSS feed site anyway. Look through the data in the links given and let it speak for itself. Whoever wrote the original article did a shoddy job to say the least. Mabey on hotly contested issues, that are heavily debated you should allow dueling articles on them and let the readers decide which proves their case better based on the evidence presented? Have headers on "hot issues" that link to the opposing article that way until somthing is laid to rest in the majority of wiki users minds the debate is preserved. I think thats the true beauty you guys have as an online encyclopedia that is open source to the public it could allow an up-to-date preservation of current debates. Do what you know is right in the intrest of free exchange of information.</li>

<li><b>REMOVE</b>: It is clear that WhatReallyHappened.com doesn't belong on Wikipedia and that its content does conflict with the editorial policy of Wikipedia. If Wikipedia is to maintain consistency then references to substantial resources presenting alternative *conspiracy* versions of history should be banned. If you keep the article on WhatReallyHappened then you are inviting an edit war as people try to edit out the necessary bias from the official article that equates criticism of Israel with anti-semitism. It is better for all that Wikipedia stand firm on its principles. REMOVE the site!</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs to be improved, but 1) the subject doesn't seem to be any less WP:WEB than <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Best_Page_in_the_Universe_9fcb.html" title="The Best Page in the Universe">The Best Page in the Universe</a> or other similar pages and 2) if WP is whittled to just popular, common subjects, it becomes much less useful. 67.20.67.252 06:24, 1 June 2006 (UTC)proberts</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> To my mind, deleting WRH from WP smacks of censorship. I'm not a newbie to WP or Wikia and I'm worried by the attitude of some of those writing above. WRH is a very popular site among all sorts of people, its shortcomings notwithstanding. Although Rivero has strong opinions, some of which sail close to the wind, he's far from being a nutter and he provides one of the best news digests out there. But that's not really relevant, is it.

[If you really want to ward off anti-semitism, spend your time making sure the US does not attack Iran and cause WWIII. That will produce anti-semitism at the Joe Six-Pack level the likes of which we will have never seen in this country. Abdicating our judgment, foreign policy, and treasury for the express nationalistic needs of a foreign nation to the detriment of our own is constitutional slaughter, and when that produces the senseless death of American soldiers as a result, as it most assuredly will, American citizens will react in their own interest. You aint seen xenophobia yet. And there is no fundamentalist Christian fantasy that could possibly override it...and while you're at it working to stop WWIII, why dont you ask the US govt to give the $6 BILLION oil reserve for Israel -- $3 BILLION in 2002 prices -- back to the US taxpayers who paid for it.

I mean, for real, I live in Brooklyn with a plenty of orthodox Jews, I could line up a thousand of them who are anti-zionist. Does that mean these orthodox Jews are anti-semite? I don't think so. Afterall, these orthodox Jews heed and worship G*d and gain inspiration and insight from the Torah.

<li><b>Keep, Improve</b>: As a longtime newsreader with no personal connection to WRH organisation, my view is that WRH is a diverse, eye-opening and sensible link page to ALTERNATIVE NEWS MEDIA OPINIONS that would otherwise not be found. The site is an enormous resourse that I am gratefull for. Over the last 2 YEARS (that I've been reading WRH), the Editor has been true to an unwritten editorial ethos of fairness, exposure and education. The site is obviously and consistently guided by these principles. There is an often colourful "introductory comment" aside many of the link pages. While these comments are often passionate, I while have never seen any tainted by unreasoned vitriol, bitterness, blind promotion, etc. I salute this fine resource and recommend it - especially to those who are only familiar with the standard, sanitized press that so typifies the media. I cannot imagine any reason why Wiki should delete the reference, short of arbitratry censorship or possibly even pressure from quarters that may not like exposure of many unpretty things....

<li><b>Keep this entry and Improve.</b>; If this entry is deleted, then many readers, like myself, will understand that censorship is driving this. I have no connection to the WRH website. I'm a long-time reader of Wikipedia and What Really Happened. I believe What Really Happened is an excellent alternative news source and not some "conspiracy theory" site as some obviously non-readers of the site have claimed here. And even if one considers it as a conspiracy-theory site as their reason for removal, then that isn't a good enough excuse. THE SOLE PURPOSE OF WIKIPEDIA IS TO BE INFORMATIVE. Entry deletions should not be based on whether an entry is "important," "relevant," or "notable" because those categorizations are subjectively and arbitrarily determined by the person who's searching for information at any given moment. If you're going to have superfluous entries on cartoons, anime and local politicians that I wouldn't necessarily include in ANY wiki, let alone encyclopedia, then there should be no problem with keeping WRH's entry. Nor does the WP:WEB notability does apply, because even USER's PERSONAL INFO are included as Wiki. Nor should Wikipedia acquiesce to those who want to press for censorship of an entry based on reasons of political, religious, or governmental affiliation. If you disagree with info posted on the entry -- isn't that what the edit function for? Those who press for WRH's deletion are doing so based on censorship reasons -- just as what happend with Rachel Corrie's play in New York City. If someone doesn't like WRH, then don't read it - and that goes for the site's entry on Wikipedia too. All voices and sources of news need to be heard and maintained -- not just those "sanctioned" by the elitists. And in addition, WRH's entry does not violate Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View, No Original Research or Veribility policies. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah_smiling_again_dfad.html" title="User:Sarah smiling again">Sarah smiling again</a> 13:43, 31 May 2006 (UTC)USA 10:32, 30 May 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah_smiling_again_dfad.html" title="User:Sarah smiling again">Sarah smiling again</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarah_smiling_again_f05e.html" title="User talk:Sarah smiling again">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sarah_smiling_again_a119.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sarah smiling again">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> WRH is a popular, active, and controversial website. Just by virtue of that, it is worth being included. For all the people that consider the site to be anti-semitic, they should especially want to keep the article, since people who get referred to WRH can look it up on Wikipedia and at least be aware of the allegations and controversy surrounding it. I don't think there's anything wrong with the article the way it is - whether or not Rivero is anti-semitic is a matter of opinion, but that the allegations have been made is a matter of fact. It just needs to be clearly stated that they are allegations. With the explosion in alternative news websites, It would seem that it would be important for Wikipedia to have information on them of this nature, so people can at least be aware of what biases the website may have, especially when the sites have a large audience. For instance, I have read WRH occasionally for a while, and I never knew that Rivero was a Republican, or that the site was that old. That said, I don't see the point for a second article about Rivero, since he is only notable for WRH. <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenatorpjt_9c7d.html" title="User:Senatorpjt">Senatorpjt</a> 14:15, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>KEEP. WRH has been a minor phenomena in the web sphere. A good resource for daily news of the the evil empire's activities. I don't see any bias accept towards logically correct moral positions, hence Israel's inclusion based on their own stated goal of a race-based society and the effects it causes. From a wiki point of view, even if one disagrees with MR's viewpoints (he does not editorialise all that much), WRH has been pivotal in forming one of the sources for anti-war, anti-neo-con movement.

<li><b>Keep</b>, This site exposed "extraordinary rendition" long before the mainstream media even knew it was happening. In fact, WRH is often months ahead of stories which eventually get accepted by the main stream media. Rivero is an intelligent man who does a good job separating wide eyed conspiracy nonsense from legitimate matters of public concern. I do, indeed, have concerns about the stridency of his anti-Israel stance. Rivero states that being against the policies of Isreal is not the same as anti-semitism. I think he is correct about that. However, the site attracts anti-semites and that does indeed bother me. Nonetheless if Wikipedia supports freedom of speech they shouldn't even consider deleting WRH. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.84.0.183 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.84.0.183_0f5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.84.0.183">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The Wikipedia editors are really pathetic. Why is anti-semitism or anti-Israelism such a big deal to them? What about anti-Catholicism? How come they don't throw out entries that are anti-Catholic? Why are the Jews so sacrosanct? What makes them more special than everybody else? I read WhatReallyHappened.com every day to get the pure unadulterated no-holds barred no-punches-pulled truth and honest realistic commentary. Now I am a traditional Roman Catholic of the Mel Gibson type, and Mike Rivero being an atheist he is also anti-Catholic. Nevertheless, I would believe Mike Rivero in the area of politics and economics and military etc. (everything except religion) before I would believe in anything John Paul II said or Benedict Ratzinger says or any of the crooked child-molesting cardinals, bishops and priests. And furthermore, the fact is that WhatReallyHappened exists and does not depend on Wikipedia for its existence, so whether or not Wikipedia deletes the entry on WhatReallyHappened is nothing more than pure childishness on the part of Wikipedia editors. Since Wikipedia purports to be an online encyclopeia, it should contain information about everything that exists. I am Catholic and I despise Jews and I am anti-semitic (so there! put that in yer pipe and smoke it!) but I wouldn't think of using that as a justification for calling for the deletion of all Wikipedia entries on the ADL or B'nai B'rith or Kabala or Chabad or Israel et al. In fact, I am anti- a lot of things and pro- a lot of other things as well. None of that though should be used as justification to trample on my right to speak freely, nor on the right of the people to be able to obtain information on those subjects. Wikipedia editors should drop political correctness as a guideline for what is contained in Wikipedia and simply write about what is there from an unslanted unbiased viewpoint. Perhaps the entry on Wikipedia itself should say "Wikipedia is an anti-anti-semitic discriminatory encyclopedia that seeks to further the Jewish and/or pro-Jewish agenda and censor any information which is not flattering to Jews or in keeping with that agenda. You can see that in trying to defend and promote one particular special interest group, you are not only setting yourself against everyone else, but you are doing a diservice to all the people (including Jews) who have a right to information and seek that information in Wikipedia, and finally you are doing a disservice to yourself by besmirching your name with the sins of censorship and bigotry masquerading as justice.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The reason this entry is up for deletion is that WRH has dared to feature articles critical of Israel. The reputation of wikipedia is increasingly under threat here.<br />
While WRH and others are being attacked Islamaphobic hate sites listed on wikipedia get promoted and protected - see the resurrection of the Harry's Place entry to see proof of that. There is blog that routinely demonises Islam and Muslims yet it gets reposted after it was rightly deleted. Why the hypocrisy wikipedia?<br />
But you know what after reading some of the arrogance frorm your registered users above towards those who come here to support WRH I think I am changing my mind.<br />
Who cares what wikipedia lists.<br />
Go ahead allow yourself to become a zionist approved reference site - then watch yourself disappear into irrelevance. best thing for you after reading the contempt many of you have for your readers. 88.101.187.61 09:37, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The usual 'non-notability' fig leaf that the bunch of Zionist agents who have infiltrated Wikipedia normally uses to hide their blatant censureship doesn't do the trick here. WhatReallyHappened.com has a Google Page Rank of 7/10 and an Alexa Page Rank of the site is 9504. Its readership goes into the thousands every day. On Google alone, 5110 pages are linking to the site, a search for the string 'whatreallyhappened' returns 307000. Tough luck, guys. -- Andrewwinkler 12:01, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Keep</i> Some have argued that their reason for WRH's deletion is that Wikipedia IS NOT a compendium for pop culture. But, this argument is a flawed one -- especially since there are plenty of pop culture-related references that Wikipedia already includes, and there have been no calls for the removal of these entries. I'll cite several examples. For example, Wikipedia has an entry for Cartoon Network's &lt;a href="<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grim_Adventures_of_Billy_and_Mandy" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grim_Adventures_of_Billy_and_Mandy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grim_Adventures_of_Billy_and_Mandy</a>"&gt;The Grim Adventures of Bill and Mandy&lt;/a&gt; and Nickolodeon's &lt;a href=""&gt;Fairly Odd Parents&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not against ANY pop culture reference being included in Wikipedia, since it's helpful in finding out more about certain shows I enjoy. My argument is that if you're going to include those seemingly superfluous entries, then I can't really see how you can use that a substantive argument for the deletion of WRH's entry. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah_smiling_again_dfad.html" title="User:Sarah smiling again">Sarah smiling again</a> 13:43, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>DELETE* I thought this was an encyclopedia? What is WRH doing in an online encyclopedia anyway? WRH is simply a website. It's not a historical event or movement. I go there pretty much daily to skim through the posted articles, but it's nothing extraordinary. WRH in itself is not significant. I don't think Rivero creates content, he simply "mines" it from others. I am somewhat disturbed by the worldwide Jewish conspiracy nonsense. I don't support Israel myself, but some of the postings are not simply anti-Israel they ARE anti-semitic. Also WRH has a strong racist anti-immigrant taint. Some of the stuff is good investigative journalism, however, much of it veers off into loony tunes conspiracy theorist fantasy land. Kind of like Alex Jones - ignorant redneck anti-guvmint, anti-Jewish, anti-immigrant crap. Where were all of you WRH fanatics when people like me were protesting against US involvement in Central America in the early 80's? Where were you during the anti-apartheid protests of the mid and late 80's? What were you doing during the protests against the first Gulf War? No wonder you're freaked out! If you were semi-literate and politically conscious you would have read years ago about the shadowy and immoral acts of our government and military. WRH and its adherents seem more interested in foaming at the mouth than engaging in creative positive non-violent change. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.83.205.174 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.83.205.174_9452.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.83.205.174">contribs</a>) 21:39, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> WRH is a fantastic resource of LINKS to numerous information sources, international and alternative news organizations. Sure, some may link to or hold views that are cautionary, however, there is no agenda, nor any sort of push of a belief system. WRH is no more slanted than the Drudge Report. I personally have not read any stories in regards to content that would justify removal of WRH from wikipedia. The whole concept of wikipedia is to let EVERYONE have an editorial voice, it is up to the reader to weigh the information, and then make up their own mind regarding it's merit. Please do not allow a handful of editors to make this decision for millions of potential readers. I value wikipedia and WRH equally, and if forced to make a choice between them, would side with WRH, since they DO NOT discriminate thought content. I feel that some wikipedia editors and/or readers should not have deletion powers, but that a warning or recommendation of impartiality may be more appropriate in this case. WRH falls into the same category, and is surfed just as often by myself as the Drudge Report, David Icke, Rense, yahoo, google and MSN news. Sure, I'm a liberal, but I'll learn. Just let me have ALL available information. I'm a grown man, and it would pain me to lose the OPTION of seeing different points of view. Perhaps we should ban the works of Mark Twain, I hear he has a character named N****r Jim. He sounds like someone we should ban from libraries entirely. (insert sarcastic laugh here). Deletion of content is the same as book burning in my opinion.</li>

By the present process, it seems that there is no penalty for tagging things for deletion without substantiation, and is in itself questionable. With regard to this page, I retain my opinion of keeping it - in fact, I reinforce it. We don't allow arbitrary people with lit matches into libraries, and I take issue with the equivalent happening with the Wikipedia. Sure, we have stuff that needs to be deleted in the Wikipedia, but the appropriate process was not followed for this and deleting it out of turn demonstrates that the process itself is unimportant.

If He's guilty of it, then you should also consider deletion of Neturei Karta. Rivero's site is sourced at every turn.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and <b>Clean Up</b> The What Really Happened article describes a very well-known website with many hits. If there are problems with the article itself they can be fixed -- and I agree that the article needs some work. However, what exactly will deleting the article from Wikipedia accomplish? Just because some people don't like WRH for one reason or another -- whatever the reason -- does not justify VfD's. Although WRH has some original work, it mostly contains citations and links to topics in the mainstream and alternative media that are of interest to a great many people. There are 1000s and 1000s of worse-written articles in Wikipedia, which raises the question, "Why this particular VfD at this time?" <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarpol_de4c.html" title="User:Earpol">Earpol</a> 07:42, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I listed many articles for deletion today and not all of them may be found on his userpage. As I stated earlier in another discussion, I go with what the article gives me. If it violates, WP:NN, WP:NOR, WP:CITE, I nominate it. I don't rely on outside resources, just what's in the article. If it's not encyclopedic and if that fact isn't supported by references, citations, and firm research then it's junk. I'm sorry if that upsets you but there's nothing I can do about that. It's not against Wikipedia's standards to have high standards for an encyclopedia.

Ways that don't disrupt the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Exopedianism" class="extiw" title="meta:Exopedianism">exopedians</a>' routines quite as much. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 13:35, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please note that this is <b>not a vote</b> but a discussion. I'm sorry but I don't see an article that large with only one citation, a link to the individual's website, and a link to a blog as establishing notability. Where do <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a> factor into your discussion? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 14:21, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The line between vote and discussion here is opaque. Those two guidelines weigh in with regards to standards that all articles should strive to adhere to, if necessary by incremental improvements, or preferably by sweeping clean-ups. Deleting substandard articles wantonly however I find discouraging and demoralizing and a poor excuse for not finding better methods to influence the quality of the project. Proposing deletion likewise, however to a lesser degree. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 14:37, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I will note the idea of proposing deletion to a lesser degree although it's not like I commonly put of so many AfD's at once. They are typically spaced out over a greater period. I will also consider any demoralizing impact that AfD's may have although I believe that they serve to create impetus for the initial designing of better articles. Wikipedia is a majorly used source for the common public and poorly researched articles on Wikipedia for any amount of time risks severely contributing to disinformation. Articles should be created after research while being improved upon and expanded over time. Anyway, if you wish to continue discussion about the nature of AfD's we should do so on my user talk page and not in the AfD discussion about this article. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 14:49, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Could the proposed removal of the Jeff Rense article be linked with the proposal to remove the "What Really Happened" entry? Both are conspiracy web pages. This proposal stinks and does infact give more credence to Rivero and Renses web sites.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 194.200.29.108 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_194.200.29.108_e4b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/194.200.29.108">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Rense is certainly one of the foremost conspiracy/UFO people in the world and that alone should warrant this article to escape deletion. Also, Rense is a very controversial individual and there is no doubt that this has won him much fame/notoriety.</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Jeff Rense is a talk-show host distributed by <a href="http://www.gcnlive.com" class="external free" title="http://www.gcnlive.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gcnlive.com</a> including archives. This meets the following test: "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person". I consider Jeff Rense passing this alternative test as well: "Google Test -- Does the subject get lots of distinguishable hits on Google or another well known search mechanism?" This AfD fits with my overall sense that a growing number of Wikipedians are interested in destroying Wikipedia content more than they are interested in writing new content. Rather than debating how to write a good Jeff Rense article, we are debating how best to destroy it. I find it very telling that <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisonplanet.com.html" title="Prisonplanet.com">Prisonplanet.com</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Rense_351f.html" title="Jeff Rense">Jeff Rense</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infowars.com.html" title="Infowars.com">Infowars.com</a>, and What Really Happened are all the same political movement and all up for deletion at the same time.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> have to agree with Strotha on this one. Article has inaccuracies (eg. Rense doesn't live in Santa Barbara and he has two brothers not one), also contains non-neutral POV (eg. "popular", "famous"). I read through <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and he does not fit any of the main criteria for inclusion in Wiki. Nor does the article contain "a good deal of verifiable information". Where are the sources? And I would have to disagree that he passes the Google Test. The Google hits he gets are NOT about RENSE. Can anyone give some links where we may read information about Rense himself? Or perhaps an interview in which HE is the subject of the interview? DanHSmith</li>
