<p>I discovered my 8-year old daughter reading this page and giggling this afternoon. This article is both unencyclopediac and obscene, and is completely unsuitable for a reference library. Wikipedia was one of the few sites that I allow my children to visit, but with articles like this it will soon be added to the blocked list as well. Please remove this disgusting content at once so that my family may again make use of your valuable resource.

<li><b>Delete.</b> This so-called "notable sex act" by your own admission does not even exist; it is nothing but a lascivious and pornographic fantasy. Also the article is obscene and violates community standards. Therefore it has no place in any sort of encyclopedia and should be deleted.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>- and KEEP your 8 year old off of the internet, if you are worried. Culturally relevant.</li>

From <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, "Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors." This is a case of inadequate parental monitoring. I recommend to Mr. Thompson that he check the official policies of all sites he allows his children to visit. Wikipedia posts this prominently as official policy. There are many articles on this site that I personally find disgusting. This is one. I exercise my right to avoid them. My personal standards of decency are not universal. Near the top of today's debate is another topic some people find indecent: <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_rights_in_Iraq_b200.html" title="Gay rights in Iraq">Gay rights in Iraq</a>. I am glad such articles exist. If I knew a gay person who planned to travel to one of these countries, these references might make the difference between a pleasant trip and criminal prosecution. It's a slippery slope.

<li><s><b>Strong delete</b></s> Some content is simply inappropriate for this forum and detracts from the usefulness of the site. This page and many of the others cited fall into this category and should be purged. If any of you perverts are ever fortunate enough to find an adult female who is willing to sleep with you and bear your children (doubtful), you'll understand why it is so important that the internet's key resources remain free of obscene content and graphic depictions of sexual and bodily functions. <b>Bruce176</b>

<li><b>Keep</b>. What no one has asked here is how an 8-year-old would be aware of the term "Cleveland steamer".

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> A simple search for the word "Cleveland" will find this page, as will "recent changes", "random page", etc. Randomly flipping to the middle of an encyclopedia, as a curious child may do, should NOT produce a prurient article with no redeeming value such as this one. <b>Bruce176</b>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Censorship based on a desire to let one's eight-year old run wild and free on a free-edit site on the internet does not hold water. This entry is useful though perhaps revolting (as are most medical journals) and there is absolutely no reason to remove it. Attempting to impose your personal moral standards on the content of Wikipedia is in direct conflict with any sort of impartiality. As an aside, it is noteworthy that Wikipedia's ability to include even lowbrow slang terms amongst its entries may be an asset rather than a liability in its competition against more restricted encyclopediae (Britannica was mentioned).Epicurus13 20:48, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

You may not believe this, but the mental wellbeing of children and young Wikipedia editors is one of the key factors that guides my voting. One glance at this excretory ode told me that delete was the only sensible response. Could I sleep at night knowing I was contributing to the future psychological trauma of legions of 8 year olds across the English speaking world? I think not.

<li><b>Stong Keep</b> Article is very much a piece of our culture, and if you don't want your kids seeing it, then, BE A PARENT AND CENSOR YOUR CHILD - not everyone else. 12:28, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The act is obscene, the article is not. The original poster might be advised to have his censoring software block articles in the Sexual Acts category until his daughter matures. Of course, the existance of this term and others like it suggest to me that no one ever really grows up. —<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenFrantzDale_c7e5.html" title="User:BenFrantzDale">BenFrantzDale</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Verifiable as a widespread rumored sexual practice, if not necessarily a real one. Notable as a cultural meme or uban legend. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 22:43, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
