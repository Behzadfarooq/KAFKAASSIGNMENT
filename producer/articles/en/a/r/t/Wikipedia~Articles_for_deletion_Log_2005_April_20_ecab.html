While I can understand Deletionist's reasoning (although, I do suspect his motives too, considering his username) for wanting to delete the article, I think there's still potential for this article. Outer Heaven is an integral place in the <i>Metal Gear</i> games which is referred alot in the later games for it to be simply merged with the <i>Metal Gear (video game)</i> article.

<li><b>Keep and expand</b>. Can't see why delete it. It's a good complement for the <i>Metal Gear</i> article, but I don't think it should be merged, as the majority of the other units referred on the article (Cobra Unit, Dead Cell, Foxhound, etc) have their own page.</li>

<li>Definitely <b>keep</b>. Main roads in major cities are always notable and should always be included. If necessary, disambiguate. The policy on streets should be that in a <b>major</b> metropolitan area, any arterial road, or (at least nationally) renowned collector or local road, would be notable. Major metropolitan area should be at least 1-2 million people, or a national capital, or a world-famous city.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There seems to be a consensus that most transportation structures, even train and subway stations, are notable, even if there's nothing interesting to be said about them. That actually makes sense, because they serve as cross-references for geographic data. Hopefully somebody writing an article about something that happens to be near Merrick Boulevard will think stop and crosslink the two articles. That way the article will gradually accumulate cross references that will help people browse geographically-related entries. ¶ I do draw the line at minor streets though, and maybe we need some clear definition of "minor". But Merrick Boulevard clearly is a major artery. ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 23:40, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've modified the article to remove all material that is unverifiable, irrelevant, POV, or original research. The BMJ article you mentioned doesn't seem to be relevant -- it's for a fairly conventional diagnostic technique, while cardioretinometry seems to be about measuring pixel-level differences in digital images of the retina.

<p>AUTHOR'S NOTE: This research IS completely new and original: I would like to delete the entry CardioRetinometry (with a Capital 'R')as it was submitted prematurely. I am happy with the other entry 'Cardioretinometry' (small r ). I am a practising Optometrist with many articles published in our optometric journals over the last 50 years. This new technique is one which scares the Global PharMafia. The GOOGLE search went up to over 2,200 before they regained control and deleted most of the malicious websites. This 'snowstorming' of Cardioretinometry so that it could not be found in the blizzard of 'results' must be significant? I had no control once my Press Release "Cardioretinometry Attacked" was issued to tell the world what was happening and to warn people not to 'CLICK' on to .ru Russian malicious websites. I am now being criticise for this? Cardioretinometry was featured at the top of the Bolen Report for 3 days twice! Prof Hickey and Dr Roberts mention it or me by name 14 times in Ridiculous Dietary Allowance.: with 100 scientific objections to the RDA. See also their "Ascorbate - the Science of Vitamin C" The new definitive textbook. They say "the RDA is not science - it is politics." Around half the USA adults take either beta-blockers or statins. This market is seriously threatened if optometrists measure people's vessels, prescribe harmless antioxidants and monitor them to keep them in good health. My medical colleagues are split. I have some on my medical panel. One was threatened and had to leave. I was subject to a scurrilous attack via the General Optical Council alleging I had published his name without permission. This gives the measure of Medical and Pharmaceutical dirty tricks of which I was warned by the vitamincfoundation website. They are not frightened of the Global PharMafia. I find no words to describe people who would suppress the truth and harm tens of millions of people than risk offending the PharMafia or Western Palliative Allopathic Medicine. Have these people consciences? If they have links with medicine or pharmacy they should declare themselves incompetent. Naturally, I wish to claim credit for the discovery following £80,000 worth of unfunded private investment on parallel glaucoma research leading accidentally to this discovery. I am currently preparing a paper for submission to "Medical Hypotheses." The BMJ challenge by Wong came before I was ready. my replies are to be found in Replies to Wong in the Rapid Responses July 23rd, Nov 26th. 04. There are so many links to the BMJ Rapid Responses that the critics compromise their own image who insist they cannot find them. Positive criticism please? Sydney J Bush</p>
<p>By positive criticism, do you mean meaningful criticism aimed at content, or do you just want encouraging comments? My immediate reaction was negative, based on the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The topic suggests this is a new diagnostic procedure by which cardiovascular health can be assessed by visualizaton of the retinal vessels. Appropriate coverage of a new diagnostic test is to compare its sensitivity and specificity to established techniques for assessing the same thing. If something this basic has not been done and published, then this procedure is not ready for prime time so to speak. It is certainly simple, but I see no references to proof of value.</li>
<li>The discussion of this new diagnostic procedure is mixed up with advocacy of extra vitamin C for vascular health. It is simply a separate topic, and both the diagnostic value of cardioretinometry and the therapeutic value of vitamin C need to be proven independently of this tangled mess.</li>
<li>Credibility is lowered to near zero by preposterous and overblown claims: that this is a "new science", that it is under attack by the Pharma Mafia, that it will put cardiologists out of work, etc. No cardiologist is worried. The medical literature is full of reports of relatively simple measures of health (e.g., finger contractures as a subtle sign of prolonged poor glucose control), and no one is suppressing the "secrets" of healthy living. Vegetables, vitamins, and exercise don't put anyone out of business and no one suppresses them. Why is this different?</li>
<li>Anything that Tim Bolen is touting is likely quackery, like Hulda Clark. You really don't want to be associated with him.</li>
<li>Your website doesn't seem to understand that Medical Hypotheses is a journal that publishes pure unproven speculation (for a page charge too?). When you cite it in a way as to suggest it enhances the credibility of the technique, you make me think you are either extremely naive or downright dishonest.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not quite positively sure this is quackery, but I'm pretty close. Is that positive enough for you? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 02:50, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>AUTHOR'S FURTHER REPLY: Thank you for your considered comments: 30,000 NLM papers mentioning vitamin C since 1950! FIVE PAPERS! on 'CHD and ascorbate.' I should rest my case for a conspiracy against vitamin C? Optometrists in N. America, an eye doctor in Los Angeles (met at a dinner given in my honour) and optometrists in the UK are now starting Cardioretinometry. They understand the 'before' and 'after' images (some of medical patients) there for everyone to study. My paper in 'Medical Hypotheses' (if they publish it, for no major medical journal will be allowed by the Global PharMafia to publish it) will mention a virtual forty year absence from the literature of coronary heart disease (CHD) papers (5 YES FIVE PAPERS! if you search for 'CHD and ascorbate' and the five since 1995!)There have been over 30,000 papers mentioning vitamin C in this time but trivial and trivia on CHD. It is as if the literature has been swept clean! All CHD and ascorbate papers vacuumed out! I estimate that between 5,000 and 10,000 papers on heart disease and vitamin C are missing. Are you aware of anybody benefiting from the research mentioning vitamin C in the 30,000 papers? How many receive advice to take more vitamin C from physicians? Yet when I was a medical student we were trained in it to know better! That vitamin C impacts on the cardiovascular system and scurvy kills this way needs no further proofs. There has been a serious distortion of the literature. Prof Hickey and Dr Roberts mention the word 'genocide' in their works. Dr Mark Levine (RDA committee) no longer answers correspondence. Cardioretinometry, by direct observation of impacts on retinal arteries reveals this and will expose the fraud. My friend Prof Denham Harman, Emeritus prof. of cardiovascular research, Nebraska, brought antioxidants and arteries to our notice in Nov 57 with the Free radical Theory of ageing and Disease. That was another new science. My closest medical contacts admit the suppression privately and also agree that Western Medicine is run like the Nazi Party. The half life of vitamin C in the plasma is 30 mins! Pharmacologically indefensible 'Milligram once/day medical madness' is killing the majority before their time who do not have a good vitamin C 6th gene. View the images yourselves. The best images, showing hypertension reversed are saved for my coming textbook and lecture to the Univ. of California Berkeley Campus Macula Group when I return to the USA. Spend some time please, looking at the 'before' and 'after' images and begin to understand their significance. They cannot be faked. I have hundreds like them but to Prof Elliott, Head of Dept at Bradford, it is not worth the bus fare to come to Hull to see them. (Sorry David but you know it is true) It is not easy at first sight, even for some optometrists to immediately realise what they are looking at. But the better Ophthalmologists do! Go see an optometrist and study your own arteries before and after four months of 1 gram qds pure asocbate powder. Look for cholesterol disappearing from the arterial bifurcations. Ask the optometrist to send the images to me if you wish on cardioretinometry@hotmail.co.uk (2Gb to handle them so practical to consult me anywhere in the world) and e-mail me on sydneybush@hotmail.com Thank you. Sydney Bush</p>

<dd>Dr. Bush, whether cardioretinometry is quackery, or whether it's a jaw-dropping medical breakthrough that isn't being published in any major medical journal because "Western Medicine" and the "Global PharMafia" are controlling all the major medical journals, doesn't really change the answer we have for you: Wikipedia is here to <i>reflect</i> notability, not to create it. Arguing to us about how great and wonderful cardioretinometry is won't change that; our policies prohibit <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">unpublished research</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:57, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>REFUTATION NOT ABUSE An account of Cardioretinometry was published as a BMJ rapid response on July 23, 2004. The response can be found here: <a href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/329/7457/79" class="external free" title="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/329/7457/79" rel="nofollow">http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/329/7457/79</a> The term Cardioretinometry describes a series of observations on the vasculature of the eye and its response to high doses of ascorbate (vitamin C). These observations, if independently replicated, could have substantive implications for the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease and other conditions.</p>
<p>Currently, Cardioretinometry refers to a hypothesis with some supporting clinical observations. Like any new observation, it requires replication. Moreover, the reported observations can easily be replicated. The experiments necessary are extremely low cost, take only a week or two and can be conducted by any competent optometrist.</p>
<p>Dr Hilary Roberts and I included a description of Cardioretinometry in our recent book "Ridiculous Dietary Allowance" (see www.amazon.com). Notably, the book issued an open scientific challenge to the RDA for vitamin C and other recommendations for low doses. The RDA book was reviewed before publication by a scientific representative of the UK Institute for Optimum Nutrition. It was then submitted in draft form to both the NIH and the US Institute of Medicine who were asked to provide a rebuttal. Finally, over two thousand copies of the RDA book were made available as a free internet download for open review. Readers were asked to reply providing details of any significant errors in the text. No such errors were reported. Since this was a most exacting "peer review" process, I suggest Cardioretinometry should remain until refuted scientifically. Dr Steve Hickey</p>
<p>Sorry, but the conspiracy theory is silly and as soon as you start comparing your opponents to Nazis, (see <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_law.html" title="Godwin's law">Godwin's law</a>) you have further reduced your credibility. Now if I ignore the preposterous, you are making 2 separate rational, testable, scientific claims:</p>
<ol>
<li>That your retinal photographs are a valid assessment tool for cardiovascular health (i.e., risk of stroke or heart attack I assume), and that changes in the retinal vessels reflect real change in risk of these events. It sounds very much like a technique that one might compare to carotid doppler ultrasound. Look at the studies that established carotid doppler ultrasound or some similar techniques for assessing risk short of coronary angiograms. How did they get proven or rejected? The same way every other diagnostic test gets confirmed useful or rejected-- by demonstrating its actual predictive association with cardiovascular events, or by demonstrating a close correlation with an accepted and proven test that predicts such event. Why not simply do that instead of crying conspiracy and suppression? This technique might be a valid method of testing vascular health even if the vitamin c claim is not.</li>
<li>The assertion that extra vitamin C will lower risk of cardiovascular events should be provable or refutable by other techniques besides cardioretinometry. Why can't it be independently true or false? It shouldn't make any difference which valid measure of blood vessel health or cardiovascular risk you use, if the benefit is that striking, it should be demonstrable. I am not a cardiologist or an expert in the relationship between diet and heart disease, but I suspect there have already been some studies attempting to demonstrate a relationship between cardiovascular health and vitamin C use. What have they shown? The vitamin C claim might be true even if the retinometry technique proves worthless.</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, the road to establishing your claims is clear, if not easy. You have offered no proof of this <i>hypothesis</i> and it should not be presented as established fact in an encyclopedia. If you are quick to bring in nazis, claims of suppression and conspiracy, and claims to other people to disprove it, our decision heuristics will categorize you as someone who is too illogical to take seriously. Sorry, these are just the rules that we all play by. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 01:08, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>AUTHORS REPLY. I most certainly have offered proof. Enough proof to convince many optometrists and one ophthalmologist; enough proof to worry Official Western Medicine. The proof is first time ever demonstrated reversal of arterial disease (and that means heart disease) by an adequate number of fundus images published on the Internet.</p>
<p>I have not offered proof that the arterial improvements are due to vitamin C. That is my hypothesis. But seventy years of literature is strongly supportive of arterial benefits with no refutation to be found whatever, of mmegadose vitamin C (over 10 grams/day) failing to produce benefits, except my own comments on a single patient. Not a single article claims it is harmful to arteries. Apart from these basic, elemntary considerations Cardioretinometry was the new technique that revealed these microscopic improvements and as such the technique cannot legitimately be excluded from the encylopaedia. I hypothesise that had my practice not been the only one in the UK to dispense vitamin C in 200 gram pots of pure powder, I would not have had the opportunity to discover them. CardioRetinometry, starting as a diagnostic technique for glaucoma, happened to be the right tool in the right place at the right time to reveal changes never before demonstrated.</p>
<p>CardioRetinometry is a here to stay fact of life seen by hundreds of my patients who return for it.</p>
<p>How can the images be denied as proof? I am grateful for Prof Hickey's comment. I have a duty to report evidence as I find it in my clinical work. The evidence for conspiracy against vitamin C is a second issue. It is building. If I am able with the help of other optometrists to prove conclusively that vitamin C redverses retinal atheroma, and this after 70 yrs of Official Medicine, will it not finally prove the physicians to be charlatans?</p>
<p>(1) Allegations against me by Official Medicine rejected by the General Optical Council. (2) direct atacks on Cardioretinometry by Global PharMafia - (the title sounds right for the Internet Attacks) Why should they spend so much except to protect beta blockers and statins a $50Bn&#160;? (my guess) market. (3) MRSA provides more evidence: My first eBMJ letter drew no reply to the challenge. My second letter stopped the correspondence. (4) The 'skewed' entirely disproportionate resarch 30,000 vitamin C papers on relative trivia. Below is an analysis to prove the point: (5) The RDA book with 100 valid scientific objections to the fictitious RDA and not contested by Official Medicine is damning evidence. This is not the place for a review of this subject, It is a pity that it is being used to criticise CardioRetinometry. CardioRetinometry is a new tool to assess ther impact on arteries of diverse nutrients like, magnesium lecithin, Vitamin B6, GLA and a vast range of others for their relevance to individual arterial health, in a totally direct and non-invasive manner with microscopic accuracy, never before possible.</p>
<p>CardioRetinometry will save millions from early death whether by identifying a vitamin C deficiency or any of a dozen other factors positive or negative.</p>

<p>No BMJ copyright can be claimed for reproducing my own letters below. Since I am accused of "silly" support for my allegation of a vitamin C conspiracy I add this to the mass of suppressive material e.g. the "CardioRetinometry Attacked" evidence. How does one offer evidence other than a statistical analysis of literature pointing to the distortions due to omissions? One has to be more perceptive to see something that is NOT there especially if one trusts the medical profession and is not looking for fraud. That is the problem.</p>
<p>My Letters to e-BMJ 29th Nov. 2004 Re Reducing MRSA on orthopaedic wards are now reproduced below. Make up your own minds as to whether or not vitamin C is being suppressed at the cost of lives to presereve medical incomes. Even Dr John Reid's own mother died of an MRSA infection. Klenner WROTE "Physicians would rather the patient die than adnmit the power of vitamin C beyond the range of a vitamion!" He was not the first.</p>

<p>Sir "I am unable to understand why, after publication of the evidence I submitted on 30th July quoting the two papers on the efficacy of ascorbate in killing MRSA in Japanese research by Nakanishi T. and available on Entrez PubMed, no interest at all has been shown.</p>
<p>Could it not be the case that non-toxic IV ascorbate would provide an instant solution to these infections and many others, and may one ask why it has not been done? There is not even a negative paper to be found in the literature on the subject of multigram doses of ascorbate IV - only many successes and positively beneficial sequelae. The prompt resolution of many bacterial and viral infections by ascorbate IV have been reported by Klenner F and others from 1949 onwards.</p>

<p>OK, you have convinced me. This is nonsense and <b>I vote for deletion</b> as well. Do you really not understand the difference between proving your point as I described above (items 1 &amp; 2) and your approach which is making bold claims with little evidence and then claiming conspiracy and suppression when no one is convinced? You could be dooming the best treatment idea anyone has had in decades by this approach. If your method and treatment are valid it will have to wait for someone else willing to do the work to prove it and get the credit for it.

<p>CARDIORETINOMETRY IS ONLY A HYPOTHESIS Sydney Bush may be doing himself no favours in his replies. However, his observations and hypothesis are interesting and potentially important. Alteripse (above) rightly points out that the danger is we could loose a beneficial treatment. Perhaps someone could rewrite the entry in a more acceptable format. That is, resubmit "Cardioretinometry" as a hypothesis, with case study support, awaiting replication. This is the current scientific position of these observations. Steve Hickey</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as copyvio. Professor of chemistry, but it doesn't bother to say where. If you google, you find the Southwest Missouri State University and a very familiar looking block of text (basically, this article is cut and paste from his website, pictures and all). Googling suggests the university may arguably not be in the top 50 universities in the US midwest, let alone the world, so my arbitrary rule of thumb I came up with a couple of days ago doesn't get him in either. The publication list isn't that impressive (five journal papers and two patents, and getting a US patent is notoriously easy). So would appear to be a teaching professor at a mid ranking state university, which doesn't really impress me that much to argue for an original article to be written. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 10:45, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hmmm we seem to be making some progress on the reasons for deletion. Actually I dispute Korath's interpretation of the Jimbo thing, but I don't particularly mind deleting substubs if they've had a chance. I will still vote <b>Keep</b> and give it more time, because even average secondary school have important and interesting things to be said about them, like how they raised the sponsorship needed to become a specialist college, why they specialized in that field, if that choice was influenced by the sponsors, and how the specialization changed the nature and level of examination achievements. We should be able to keep quality articles on average schools, because they <i>are</i> quality articles on verifiable subjects which significant numbers of people might want to read about. It doesn't mean we have to accept permanent substubs on every school. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 18:36, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Specialist x colleges have nothing to do with sponsorship, all the extra money comes from the Government. There are a few UK schools that have been taken over by private organsiations, but that is completely different, and they have all been failing schools - which this clearly isn't.</dd>
<dd>Any information on whether the specialist x status has had any effect on examination results would be apropriate at <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_the_United_Kingdom_7510.html" title="Education in the United Kingdom">Education in the United Kingdom</a> or <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_England_c7c5.html" title="Education in England">Education in England</a> if its not a UK-wide policy (I don't know off the top of my head) where it can be contrasted with those schools that aren't specialist x colleges, but at the level of a single school it isn't anywhere near statistically significant. The only way that it being a specialist sports college could have any impact on its notability is if it was the first or last (and it certainly isn't the latter) to become one. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 19:38, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>FOLLOWUP: I saw the anon user might have been a legit person. Thats fine and Im sorry for taking it out. If so, the tag should go back in. We just have SO many problems with anons going through adding VFD tags and Dispute notices that they are often taken as vandalism. My statements about this man stand on why he should ahve his article, with the situation with <b><a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html#Hitler.27s_family" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler's relatives</a></b> a perfect example.

<li>Gene Poole is just being argumentative. The deletion policy is not all-inclusive, and as long as your nomination was made in good faith, it is valid. While I'm sure there are good arguments for keeping this article, "invalid nomination" is not one of them. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 07:35, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Once more, for the dummies: There is <b>no</b> Wikipedia policy that explicitly names "non-notability" as a valid criterion for article deletion - let alone even defining what the term is supposed to mean. Nominations for deletion made on the basis on "non-notability" are therefore completely, totally and unquestionably invalid.

<ul>
<li>Once more, for the intellectually dishonest Wikilawyers, there's nothing in Wikipedia policy that explicitly <i>prohibits</i> nomination of articles under any criteria other than bad faith. That's why it's a <i>vote</i> (with discussion) for deletion. There is, though, an explicit prohibtion against double voting through sockpuppets, which I'm glad to see has stopped for certain editors. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:42, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the lesson in misrepresentation; to my knowledge nobody here has claimed that nominations unsupported by established policy are explicitly forbidden. However, the monotonous regularity with which such nominations are concluded as keepers should serve to illustrate the futility of perpetuating such resource-wasting exercises by nominators seeking to promote as consensus eccentric opinions at variance with precedent and prevailing community attitudes. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 04:19, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep but Modify.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>As the writer of this 'personal essay' - I'd like to throw in my two cents - this is my first addition to Wikipedia - and admittedly it isn't very 'encyclopedia like'...my hope in posting it was that someone else would step in and make it 'encyclopedia like', since this is something I know about first hand but I do not know about writing encyclopedia entrys. I adapted this 'artice' from a posting I made to a Pagan Clergy Webgroup. We were talking about it on said webgroup because it came up that there is very little information 'out there' on the subject. Thus, I think that is is beneficial for Wikipedia to have such an article - though it clearly needs some 'help'. ~ Lady Ament-Drake (gypsy_curiosa@yahoo.co.uk). (no Wiki sign-off, written by 70.28.63.182)</p>
<p>Personal essay. Maybe it is salvagable if someone wants to spend some time on it, but I think it's probably best to delete it and let someone re-create it later if they want to write a proper article. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Johnson_b532.html" title="User:David Johnson">David Johnson</a> [<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Johnson_8ad9.html" title="User talk:David Johnson"><b>T</b></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Johnson_662a.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Johnson"><b>C</b></a>] 20:37, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I should add, though, that you should re-vote to keep. As it is one person voted to delete, I changed mine to keep, and the anon user voted to keep but anon votes aren't as important as those of logged-in users. Therefore, this will end in a stalemate. Might as well make it end happily ever after! <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 11:45, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. When I was a wee lad, I remember our swamp water was a mix of root beer and orange soda. I get the impression that there isn't a single Swamp Water, but rather that is a concept that is regularly invented independently by creative, thirsty young people. I think we might be able to say something about that concept.
