<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Lindsay Ashford is <i>very</i> notable--among <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girllover.html" title="Girllover">girllovers</a>. He returns few google hits, but in this case the google test is inaccurate; two pages define virtually half his "encyclopedic" importance. The first is his own site, <a href="http://www.puellula.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.puellula.org/" rel="nofollow"><i>puellula: a celebration of the splendor of little girls</i></a> (and its central section <a href="http://hfp.puellula.org/" class="external text" title="http://hfp.puellula.org/" rel="nofollow"><i>The Human Face of Pedophilia</i></a>). This page was the first of its kind, and remains the most important by far. It made him the first girllover to leverage the power of the internet to spread the moral girllove movement. The second is the online hub of the online English-speaking girllove world, <a href="http://www.annabelleigh.net" class="external text" title="http://www.annabelleigh.net" rel="nofollow"><i>Girl Chat</i></a>, on which he was a former moderator and frequent contributor (under the psudeonym <i>Amator Puellularum</i>). The online girllove community is, by necessity, small, tight-knit, and heavily defended. There are only half a dozen serious English pro-girllove sites on the internet, and for obvious reasons they have few outside linkers to boost their google ratings. In addition, much of the girllove community's ineractions are invisible to google, consisting of emails, etc. To delete this article would be an act of bigotry or ignorance, and I hope I've removed any chance of the latter. 24.17.5.50 18:43, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So being important to a small, tightnit group of pedophiles makes someone notable?--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 02:13, 18 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No. Being (very) <i>notable</i> to a "small, tight[k]nit group" which is itself very notable gives him <i>encyclopedic importance</i>.

<dl>
<dd>I really don't think that's what it means to be notable. I'm not suggesting a person has to be known all over the world, but if he's only signifincant within a small movement like "childlove" then perhaps he warrants a mention on that page, but not his own article.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 02:54, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Abstain from processing</b>. I was about to process this, but we have to look at consensus, not mere numbers. I count 20 delete votes plus nominator, eight keep votes, and four abstentions. Disgusting is not a criteria for deletion, far from it - however, being disgusting does not make you notable by default. Also, even if his website is notable - which has not been shown - that does not make the creator of the website notable. If the notability of the subject is only due to his pedophilia, and if his website is not similarly notable, then delete is the only option. However, he may be notable <i>within the movement</i> - and since we have articles on the movement, then the movement is sufficiently notable. I do not know, and the vote was not unanimous, though it was obviously tilted towards delete. So I abstain from picking an outcome to this debate. Too close to call between "err towards keep" and "consensus to delete". <b>I suggest the debate be extended.</b> --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 18:06, May 18, 2005 (UTC)

<li>If your concern is that editors are voting to delete out of disgust rather than for valid reasons, I think it is misplaced; IMHO, only two delete votes focus more on "disgusting" than "not notable" or "self-promotion" (that is, the original nominator's vote, and perhaps Doc Glasgow's). Also, I submit that, even though 24.17.5.50 suggests that the subject is notable, the subject is not <i>verifiably</i> so through the private emails, etc., that he cites. The Google Test, for what it's worth, points to "not notable," and I don't feel the lone newspaper interview is an indication of significant notability. The self-promotion aspect concerns me greatly, as well. I don't have a problem with an extended debate, but I think the correct course of action is pretty clear in this case. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 22:20, May 18, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see how it can be said there is not a consensus with the vote being 20 to 8 in favor of deletion. Also it is unfair in my opinon, to discount a vote because the voter expressed disgust. Yes it's possible that their opinion was tainted by their disgust, but it's also possible that their disgust did not influence their vote. Some people expressed disgust and voted "keep". Do we assume that their disgust influenced their vote? Can we therefore automatically assume that those who voted "delete" where influenced by their own disgust?--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 02:50, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm the creator of this quiz. I understand your objections. I published this quiz-experiment in Wikipedia, as there is no other wiki-project harboring quizzes up to now. My main objective of this publication was to try to start some creative exchange of ideas on adding quizzes to Wikipedia and creating a quiz template. By the way, could somebody explain to me what is meant by "userfication" and "userfy"? <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFortinbras_adc2.html" title="User:Fortinbras">Fortinbras</a> 18:46, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sure. First, to see what's happened, click the above pagelink now (post-userfying) and then click the redirected link. The info in this article has been moved to a sub-page of your User page. (It would be a little clearer if you had something written on your User page.) This has been done as a polite way of saying, "Interesting idea, but not Wikipedia material." <a href="../../../t/u/t/Wikipedia%7ETutorial_f7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Tutorial">Wikipedia is an encyclopedia</a>, not just a community, so quizzes aren't really appropriate here, but should a wiki-project about quizzes be created, this would be a good addition. Moving the info to part of your User area allows you to keep it and work on it until you find someplace more appropriate to put it. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoundguy99_5970.html" title="User:Soundguy99">Soundguy99</a> 19:12, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article makes some rude, ignorant, and subjective observations about technophiles, with a strong suggestion that they suffer from a form of mental illness.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Not necessarily biased; your definition may be of someone who explores technology as a hobby, whereas this definition defines it as an obsession that interferes with daily life.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Nobody's trying to bite you, Patrick0101, (or at least not very hard); the issue is that the general consensus is that Wikipedia is not interested in slang that doesn't have much of a history. You said you had to do some "digging" to find out what it meant - where did you dig? What did you find? If you could add some of this info to the article and convince editors that this phrase has been used pretty extensively (somewhere besides one movie), the article might be kept. If you do expand the article, you should mention it here, and it helps if you add "<b>Rewrite</b>" to your comment. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoundguy99_5970.html" title="User:Soundguy99">Soundguy99</a> 19:32, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>No article should exist with this title, especially not this article. An article related to the example you cited would only share the name of the article we are talking about VFDing if it were named inappropriately... which is why this article isn't about that subject, and which is why your example isn't a reason to keep the article. Plato was discussing the solipist notion that 'only my mind exists', it's an interesting concept but it's only an interesting concept in the context of discussing solipist reasoning, since it's so throughly disconnected with the rest of the world.--<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 05:14, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep It</b> I think its educational, it looks a lot like a rant because it is written in first person but as someone who works in a call center it is 100% true. The average person thinks that if they assert that they are in charge, we will do whatever they ask, if people read this and actually thought about it, this is what customer care really is. This is the psychology of it, its instructional. I think its great. Plus, lets face it, theres how-to instructions for microbiology, isnt this more useful?Mislah 15:44, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Keep it! Speaking as someone who works in the customer care industry, I can tell you for certain it is quite factual. Plus it is educational for the average consumer calling into a customer care department, screaming at some poor rep who is only there to make ends meat and had nothing to do with what happenned to the customer.

<li><b>Keep</b> but mark as not-NPOV. This is a classic example of why Customer Care reps get a bad rep -- they assume that they are always correct and that, because they have the power to screw up someone's life, they're entitled to use that power vindictively (in other words, whenever the customer won't bend over and take it up the bodily orifice). <b>Keep</b> and corral the author off into a Wiki-Zoo where s/he can have buns and other inappropriate food-articles thrown at him/er --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 07:08, 13 May 2005 (UTC) &lt;?rant&gt;</li>

They are consistent with highly popular conspiracy theories and with available evidence. I shall endeavour to present these in a better way next time. My apologies. I am new to this.</p>
<p>Oh and feel free to delete these pages. Please do. I'd rather get some help with presenting them properly than be branded as a "troll" or some nonsense just because I'm trying to help with factual evidence.</p>
<p>By the way, your <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Bryant_da7e.html" title="Martin Bryant">Martin Bryant</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Arthur_massacre_bdeb.html" title="Port Arthur massacre">Port Arthur massacre</a> articles are highly inconsistent with available evidence, especially with regards to such things as him pleading guilty - which he never did. Your own sources as quoted on the pages prove that you've got it wrong there. You also should include that he was diagnosed with <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schizophrenia.html" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> and before the trial was diagnosed with <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger%27s_Syndrome_18a6.html" title="Asperger's Syndrome">Asperger's Syndrome</a>, both diagnoses which were later changed. <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger%27s_Syndrome_18a6.html" title="Asperger's Syndrome">Asperger's Syndrome</a> as you know, is one which would see someone be fit to stand trial, and hence it is very relevant that he was suddenly diagnosed with it, when in fact he never had it in the first place.</p>

<p>see: "The major historical texts of early Hittite history" by Trevor Bryce</p>
<p>I'm going to have to agree with James on the <b>delete</b>, although I won't deny that there seems to be information that bears in light for the OP. For example, there's <a href="http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/cc013002.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/cc013002.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, which lists an asteroid named after Krok, (Asteroid 3102Krok) a scheme usually used for minor deities. However, I just spent some time on Google and came up with nothing aside from that. Additionally, the <i>Encyclopedia Mythica</i> turns up nothing (no surprise there, since that's not the best kept database, IMHO). This is going to need a lot more evidence to be a keeper. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 13:36, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> this has the whiff of a hoax, for reasons several of which will be spotted by some people. I will add one, that the Hittite archaeological remains are in modern Turkey, a slab found in Hebron seems fishy, a vague echo of the Hebrew Bible mentioning the patriarchs buying some land in Hebron from the Hittites, but I'm not aware of any archaeological evidence that the Hittites were in Hebron. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 14:33, 2005 May 12 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>. I did a quick scan of the indices to 3 books I own about the Hittites (Harry A. Hoffner, <i>Hittite Myths</i>; Gary Beckman, <i>Hittite Diplomatic Texts</i>; &amp; Trevor Bryce, <i>The Kingdom of the Hittites</i>), &amp; not one refers to such a deity. (At this point, it's not worth it to me to go downstairs &amp; also check my copy of ANET.) BTW, I took a class on the Hittite language in college, &amp; based on my memory of that class alone, I'd attest that "Krok" is <b>not</b> close to being a Hittite name, divine or otherwise. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 00:40, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I've been here more than a year and I can still be amazed at this place. I listed this article for deletion because it seemed a little off and I couldn't verify it. That simple listing prompted this incredible amount of research and comment by people who've studied the Hittites, who have relevant texts ready to hand, and find suspicious points based on the nature of the word, the stated location of the find, etc. I had no clue as to any of this. It's too bad that some jerk's casual hoax article wasted so much of the time of sincere editors, but there's a silver lining: We see another example of Wikipower. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 08:58, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hopefully this is a no-brainer not deserving the space and attention needed to present my complex evidence on the, arguably, bad faith I think the article was created in. I present several reasons why this page does not deserve its Wikipedia space:</p>
<p>(1) Accuracy dispute. I could not find a source that specifies the existence of the school (at least under the name "Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary"). The burden of proving the existence of such a school should be on the article's creator, not me, though. Online searches show no results under this name...which merits the suspicion, that even if such a school did exist under this name, it was so non-notable that it isn't cited in any documents by anyone these days.</p>
<p>(2) To begin with, there is no source that specifies Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary as the actual name of a school in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware%2C_Ohio_93b3.html" title="Delaware, Ohio">Delaware, Ohio</a> at that time! This violates the rationale for pages not to be "too secret" (i.e. "Secret societies are unverifiable and often non-notable". Wikipedia articles must be verifiable. Almost by definition, the world cannot verify things about secret societies). This is not a "secret society" per se, but the existence of the school should be verifiable through paper or online sources.</p>
<p>(3) The article was created by a user <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStude62_1ae3.html" title="User:Stude62">user:Stude62</a> who had created several other articles that violate, or are on the border of vilaoting, the vanity policy of Wikipedia ("vanity" is a shorthand for "This page is about a person, institution, or organization who Wikipedia's guidelines suggest does not merit an article"). On his user page he states <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Stude62" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Stude62" rel="nofollow">of recent times find myself up to my eyeballs in Methodist Episcopal Church history (my gr gr gr great grandfather was an M.E. circuit preacher in central Ohio) and defending it from those who should know better, but are too wrapped up in their own feelings and perceptions to know any different.</a></p>
<p>Several other article created by the same user are Monnett Weekend, <a href="../../../o/r/r/Orra_E._Monnette_1f5e.html" title="Orra E. Monnette">Orra E. Monnette</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Monnett_Bain_da3f.html" title="Mary Monnett Bain">Mary Monnett Bain</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monnett_Hall_4446.html" title="Monnett Hall">Monnett Hall</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monnett_Bain_Davis_4965.html" title="Monnett Bain Davis">Monnett Bain Davis</a>. All of them debatably non-notable and written with the sole purpose to "defending it from those who should know better". The Monnett Weekend page was recently listed on VfD and removed. The article listed on here honor the exact same topic and should be removed as well.</p>
<p>(4) There is a separate page about the real name of the institution at the time: <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Wesleyan_Female_College_2014.html" title="Ohio Wesleyan Female College">Ohio Wesleyan Female College</a> which no longer exists but is nevertheless legit. I suggest that some of the information be moved to that page as it was the official name of the female college.</p>
<p>(5) This is a "POV fork". Debatably the most notable part of the article is about <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Monnett_Bain_da3f.html" title="Mary Monnett Bain">Mary Monnett Bain</a>. That article already presents the arguably "notable" part on there.</p>
<p>(6) Several Wesleyan alumni have agreed that such a name <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Womens_Methodist_Seminary_3891.html" title="Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary">Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary</a> is not notable even among the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Wesleyan_University_7bf4.html" title="Ohio Wesleyan University">Ohio Wesleyan University</a> "family".</p>
<p>(7) Finally, one can argue that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Monnett_Bain_da3f.html" title="Mary Monnett Bain">Mary Monnett Bain</a> is arguably worthy an article herself vilating notability ("non-notable" or "nn" are shorthands for "Something that (the voter thinks) is unimportant due to its obscurity or lack of differentiation from others of its type"). There was a separate VfD on that article but it is not the objec of this VfD.</p>
<p>If the article is related to something more common or well-known like the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Wesleyan_Female_College_2014.html" title="Ohio Wesleyan Female College">Ohio Wesleyan Female College</a>, consider merging it with that.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> to confirm details. Monnett Hall, Monnett Weekend and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Monnett_Bain_da3f.html" title="Mary Monnett Bain">Mary Monnett Bain</a> all check out in external sources. The entry on Leroy A. Belt on the official history page of Ohio Northern University, <a href="http://www.onu.edu/onuhistory/" class="external text" title="http://www.onu.edu/onuhistory/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, says he "served as financial agent for Monnett Hall, an independent women's academy, which merged with Ohio Wesleyan in 1877." So you're alleging this article that centrally claims <i>the quickly provable</i> fact that Monnett Hall, an independent women's institution, merged into Ohio Wesleyan University is "bad faith?" The only things that would need further research are whether Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary <i>was a name or the formal name</i> of Monett Hall. There's no comprehensive information about historical schools on the web, but this obviously could be referenced with printed sources in libraries and maybe even an historical plaque onsite. Patnaik, what is your "complex evidence" of bad faith?

<li>Isn't it entirely possible and believable Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary either co-existed with <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Wesleyan_Female_College_2014.html" title="Ohio Wesleyan Female College">Ohio Wesleyan Female College</a> or was an original or alternate name name of OWFC? (For anyone else wondering about the Wesleyan/Methodist distinction, <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Wesleyan_University_7bf4.html" title="Ohio Wesleyan University">Ohio Wesleyan University</a>, per its article Patnaik was the last to edit, was founded by <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodists</a> in 1841; the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_Church_3704.html" title="Wesleyan Church">Wesleyan Methodist</a> church formally split from the Methodists in 1843.) Comparing a rural 19th century women's college to a "secret society" because Google provides no hits overstates and assumes bad faith.

<p>I've dropped back in for a moment and would like to thank all for voted to keep the article, as well as those who voted against it as an <i>impartial</i> act. I have kept out of this debate because I had become very disilluioned about Wikipedia and group of user. This vote has redeemed that faith.</p>
<p>I would like to thank those who have called others on their bad faith action against me and this article.</p>
<p>This matter could have been settled from the very beginning had certain Wikipedian's allowed primary, factual information held in the OWU archives to stand. They did not. I also suspect that a number of users whose only activity exists to manipulate the information regarding OWU have chimed in on this VFD; their trails can be viewed through their account history.</p>
<p>I also call to question any Wikipedian claiming to have attended OWU who has not heard of Mary Monnett Bain, Monnett Hall or the Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary. To think that they could have spent meaningful time on the OWU campus and have no historical background on the University seems very strange. To any uninvolved party who is a legitimate Wikipedian, not a shill or sock puppet, - this information may be verified through the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archives_of_Ohio_United_Methodism_06ca.html" title="Archives of Ohio United Methodism">Archives of Ohio United Methodism</a> which are held at OWU.</p>
<p>Wikipedia should be about correct information, not something that is simply a validation of Google, or other web sites. Wikipedians who think that Google, Yahoo and other high level web sites are the only acceptible sources for information will undermine not only the sharing and growth of information, but will also doom Wikipedia to nothing greater than a parrot for web based knowledge.

We've got four or five votes for saving the article by cleaning it up -- but no suggestions for a cleanup strategy. The real problem is not that the article's a mess.

<li>Dudes, this article is totally on key. I definately know like 15 people like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The.html" title="The">the</a> emo kid pictured. Good article</li>
<li>I think he <b>may</b> have somethings right, my best friend is TOTALLY like that! We always cut him up for listening to Yellowcard.</li>
<li>This seems like a total witch hunt. This a biased audience. There is nothing fair or balanced about several of these comments. Damn emo kids getting all emotional. Get a life.</li>

<li>It's almost certainly an attack page against the subject of Image:Emokid1.jpg, uploaded by article creator User:Gplefka solely for this article as "example of an emo kid". This is in no way whatsoever the start to an article on emo kids, to which I'd vote either keep or m/r to <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emo.html" title="Emo">emo</a>.

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The arguments are about equally split between "delete" (with the dominant argument being that it's already in Wiktionary) and "keep" - that it is expandable. Noting that the article was not expanded during the discussion period nor since and that the current version remains a mere dictionary definition (something explicitly listed on What Wikipedia is not), I am going to exercise my discretion to override the strict vote count and delete this version. This decision should not be considered precedent if the article is recreated as a substantial and encyclopedic article on the topic. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:17, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hola, Yes, I perfectly understand. I still should be listed regardless.

For example, I know Yusuf Estes who is listed and he knows me but how many non-Muslims know of us? He hasn't written a book nor intends to do so. He is not a 'public figure' nor a journalist. There are several Muslims on that list who haven't written a book, etc. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_Estes" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_Estes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_Estes</a></p>

Most Muslims would argue whether these two people are Muslims. Believing or saying crazy things doesn't give a person credentials. So most Muslims would argue that they should not be listed. Most well-known, accomplished Muslims are simply not listed, because they aren't very vocal or crazy. Radical groups such as the Nation of Islam and Taliban are listed but mainstream Muslim organizations, such as ISNA or ICNA, are not. I plan to help in that regard. And as for those who included in the<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslims_773b.html" title="List of Muslims">List_of_Muslims</a>, you simply cannot judge by your own standards because most Muslims who are listed are unrecognized by non-Muslims.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It isn't point of view, it's a church doctrine. I know because I was raised Catholic, in a Catholic school, with years of Catholic religion classes. It was taught extensively. I don't intend to further expand this article because that's a part of my own life I've decided to leave behind, and I have no interest in researching and documenting this further. Given that this was subject of a vandalistic start, I see why it was nominated, but I think I've done the basic research to show that the topic itself clearly belongs.

<li><b>Keep</b> if it can be established that a "spiritual marriage" means something more than a marriage that is spiritual (i.e. one that includes being religious).
