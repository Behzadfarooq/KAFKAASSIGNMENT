<p>This article currently makes the statement:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Congress may grant letters of marque and reprisal; such letters are now obsolete.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>According to <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letter_of_marque.html" title="Letter of marque">Letter of marque</a>, the United States is not a signatory to the 1856 Declaration of Paris, which banned the "issuance of letters of marque and reprisal to private parties". This suggests that such letters are still issuable by Congress, however diplomatically untenable they may be. Is there a more recent treaty, binding on the U.S., or a U.S. law that makes these letters obsolete? — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 14:46, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letter_of_marque.html" title="Letter of marque">letter of marque</a> notes, "The United States was not a signatory and is not bound by that Declaration, but did issue statements during the 1861-65 American Civil War, and during the 1898 Spanish-American War, that it would abide by the principles of the Declaration of Paris..." Letters of marque are obsolete in the U.S. simply because they have not been issued by Congress in a long time. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Emsworth</a> 15:16, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Statements issued that cover a wartime policy are hardly binding on future governments outside that war period. Even treaties signed by nations may be unilaterally abrogated (as has been recently demonstrated by many nations, including the U.S.). Nations often dredge up old practices when they're in a bind, justifying the action by arguing that they never agreed to stop. I don't think the word "obsolete" can be used unless the U.S. has made a formal, unqualified commitment not to issue such letters. "Archaic" may be more accurate, though that sounds a bit odd when applied to a political practice. Perhaps "no longer practiced" is the most accurate description. — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 02:11, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The simple answer to the first two questions is in Section 9 itself:
<dl>
<dd><i>The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight…</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The "why" is only hinted at in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_United_States_Constitution_3737.html" title="History of the United States Constitution">History of the United States Constitution</a>, in which we observe that there were heated regional arguments. An obvious one was whether the U.S. should use the guideline of the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declaration_of_Independence_%28United_States%29_3642.html" title="Declaration of Independence (United States)">Declaration of Independence</a> that "all men are created equal" to bolster the case to end slavery. As the main (unstated) goal of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_United_States_Constitution_3737.html#Constitutional_Convention" title="History of the United States Constitution">Constitutional Convention</a> was to replace the ineffectual <a href="../../../a/r/t/Articles_of_Confederation_3ff7.html" title="Articles of Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a> with a strong document to shore up the chaotic new nation, this was apparently the best compromise they could reach between the pro- and anti-slavery factions. I should think that this topic would deserve an article all by itself. — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 03:01, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S. Actually, my citation of the 1st clause only covers itself; the broader coverage of both 1st and 4th clauses can be found in Article V:

<p>JW, I don't know what you mean by "clarify, provide example." What exactly do you have a problem with? You know that I don't edit on a whim. I've spent hours researching the authoritative sources on this, but nothing speaks louder or more clearly than the Constitution itself. It is incorrect to say that those who take issue with delegation of legislative power do so because some "principle of separation of powers implies" something. No implication is used or needed. The wording of the Constitution could not be more clear. The Constitution specifically enumerates that no federal power can be derived from any source other than the Constitution. It also enumerates that all legislative powers granted by the Constitution shall be vested in a Congress. No authoritative source disputes this. Wording the article to make it seem that the Constitution possibly grants Congress the power to delegate legislative responsibilities is wholly your opinion. The Supreme Court doesn't argue that the Constitution grants delegation power and neither does any other source. The Supreme Court only argues the issue on the <i>need</i> for Congress to <i>have</i> that power. The court's decision should be noted, but it doesn't change the wording or the meaning of the Constitution. The Constitution stands by itself. It means exactly what it says it means. An article on the Constitution must be about the Constitution. Anything you want to add about court decisions is secondary. I'm sorry if I'm mentioning truisms, but I don't know what else to say. What is wrong with talking about the precise wording of the Constitution in an article about the Constitution? Regardless of what Supreme Court said later, Article One still reads, "All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress," and the Tenth Amendment still reads, "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." The words didn't change. --<a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZephram_Stark_ae5d.html" title="User:Zephram Stark">Zephram Stark</a> 05:10, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is not the forum for you to "prove" that much of what Congress currently does is against the founder's original intent. We have the text, the court's interpretation , and mention that some people don't agree with it. You should also check out the notion of "implied powers", which are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution, but are logical extensions of one or more enumerated power. --<a href="../../../j/w/1/User%7EJW1805_0d7f.html" title="User:JW1805">JW1805</a> 16:03, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>"<i>We have the text, the court's interpretation , and mention that some people don't agree with it.</i>" One of those three things is the focus of this article.
