<li><b>Keep</b> Actually the physicist who is proposing MDT is quite accomplished. Above an editor claims that MDT "smells a lot like bollocks." This is a highly qualitative opinion. MDT should be judged by its merits with arguments for or against based in logic and reason. I find no fault with MDT--in fact it succeeds where ST &amp; LQG have failed. It presents an underlying physical model for QM &amp; SR, based in logic and reason, verified experimentally. String theory has been shown to be a complete hoax, and yet it fills wikipedia with pages upon pages. ST should be deleted before MDT. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.14.242.50 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.14.242.50.html" title="User talk:66.14.242.50">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.14.242.50_7b84.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.14.242.50">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is not a place to judge anything. It is a place to summarize information on subjects based on <i>references to reliable 3rd party sources</i>. WP is <i>not</i> a place for advancing original research or arguments for one theory or another. The 2 main problems with this article is 1) it does not cite its sources in an academically accepted manner 2) it is not written in an encyclopedic fashion. Theories, when not cited properly, can smell a lot like Bollocks, hence the need for careful citation!! <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 17:21, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> Who did Einstein cite in his original paper on Relativity? String Theory has thousands of citations, and yet it is "not even wrong." Mobs and group-think does not a theory make. Truth and Beauty make a theory, and that is what MDT has. Although ST is funded by billions upon billions, MDT rocks the world with its simple postulate. Having said this, I understand that MDT may yet be deleted. But understand this has nothing to do with the integrity of the theory.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.14.242.50 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.14.242.50.html" title="User talk:66.14.242.50">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.14.242.50_7b84.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.14.242.50">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Moving Dimensions Theory, like wikipedia, happened because of the internet. It has been read by thousands over the past ten years, and the record will show that never once has its logic nor beauty been refuted. It was born upon the internet, and unlike the cloistered, well-funded, secret-society hoax that is string theory, it stands on its own. Sure, we could delete this article on MDT because string theorists don't want to share their massive funding, but then perhaps we should delete all of wikipedia and stick with professional encyclopedias such as Britanica and Encarta. I say let logic, reason, free thought, the internet and physics triumph over cloistered, antiquated, postmodern hoaxes. Let wikipedia reach its heights in helping to disseminate truth and beauty, while deconstructing intellectual debauchery.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 137.159.188.139 (<a href="../../../1/3/7/User_talk%7E137.159.188.139.html" title="User talk:137.159.188.139">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.159.188.139_9722.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.159.188.139">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>I say we offer the author a chance to link to sources--I have seens several and I will help. String Theory, although it is now shown to be a postmodern hoax, has plenty of "sources," and yet it is a hoax. String Theory is original research, and not only that, but it is a proven lie as new books this fall and articles in Time, Scientific American, and Discover are attesting. Again, ultimately we must judge a theory on its truth and beauty, not on how hip tax and tuition funded pomo hipsters think it is, or we will be forever sentencing Socrates to death. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 137.159.188.139 (<a href="../../../1/3/7/User_talk%7E137.159.188.139.html" title="User talk:137.159.188.139">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.159.188.139_9722.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.159.188.139">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>I just helped the author out by listing some references and sources. There are thousands of them. The author should be given the chance to post more resources too, as without the vast amouts of NSF funding that String Theorists use to hire grad students and postdocs to pen fake papers, it seems the author has to rely on logic and reason instead of tax-and-tuition-funded hype. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 137.159.188.139 (<a href="../../../1/3/7/User_talk%7E137.159.188.139.html" title="User talk:137.159.188.139">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.159.188.139_9722.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.159.188.139">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>I don't believe you quite understand what we mean by "sources". We're not looking for general websites that might mention MDT (or sell T-shirts). We're looking for reliable <i>references</i> and citations regarding the tenents of the theory. This isn't the place to propound the theory itself, it's the place to write <i>about</i> the theory, describe who developed it, the history, and a brief overview. All of these <i>must</i> reference external sources that are reliable, preferrably mainstream sources of the information that you include here. It is preferred, too, that you document these sources by useing the &lt;ref&gt;text&lt;/ref&gt; footnote format within the body of the text, so that a reader who wants to verify the legitimacy of a statement within the text can jump to that statement's source. That's what an encyclopedia entry should look like. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 15:46, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>KEEP</b></s> as MDT is rooted in logic, truth and bauty. The wikipedia page on string theory is filled with lies--it should be deleted first, otherwise wikipedia will come to be known as a place that values lies over truth. Just because a lot of people believe a lie, or the government has written checks to fund it, does not make the lie true. Wikipedia has a chance here to stand on the right side of time, to live up to its potential. By killing this article, you are killing the spirit of wikipedia, and the spirit of truth. String theory not only has failed, but it is now failing to fail. Once it lied, but now it doesn't even think it has to lie anymore. By killing MDT and keeping string theory, wikipedia will shout out to the universe that it prefers lies over truth. Go ahead.
