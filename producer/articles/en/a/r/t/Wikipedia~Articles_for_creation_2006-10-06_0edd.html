<p>sandy vagitosis</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Sandy vagitosis is a common disorder affecting men. Similar to sandgina and pussyitus. The disease is termed because a man with this condition resembles a woman who has gotten sand in her vagina. Typically the disease presents itself after the man displays tendencies to skip out on male bonding activities such as drinking beer or playing sports. Sandy vagitosis is potentially dangerous as the man begins to lose all respect of his fellow comrades. As the condition worsens he soon begins to feel alone and no longer included in the ritualistic male bonding activities.</p>

<p>Online content providers seek commercial returns from investment in online marketing communications and marketing channel activities. Deans and McKinney (1997) were among early researchers examining the objectives, strategies and techniques used by commercial websites. A 1998 study conducted for the Australian Department of Industry, Science and Tourism (DIST) also provides some clarity in this matter, as does the aforementioned KPMG study (1999). However, a more open and comprehensive picture is needed of integrated marketing communications strategy using new media as well as use of the Internet as a marketing channel is needed coupled with the reasoning behind such use, and identification of the measures of success these organisations use. The current study in Australia and New Zealand is an extension of the Deans and McKinney (1997) study. It is intended that in the near future, collaborators in Asia, the Americas and Europe will extend this audithereafter referred to as the WebQUAL Audit (WebQUAL). The Antecedent New Zealand Longitudinal Study: Background and outcomes</p>
<p>Early in 1997 Deans and McKinney conducted a three phase investigation which aimed to examine the rationale behind a web presence and how such a presence was evaluated. To achieve this, 300 commercial sites were systematically selected from 12,000 registered domain names. The content of these sites was analysed under various headings:</p>
<pre>
       * Ease with which site could be found,
       * Content,
       * Layout,
       * Graphic elements,
       * Menu systems,
       * Feedback forms,
       * Number of links,
       * Presence of search tags,
       * Date last modified.
</pre>
<p>This led to three broad categories: undeveloped, developed and well developed. The second phase entailed making contact with each site manager and administering a short questionnaire addressing issues similar to those detailed above. Finally, a series of in-depth interviews was conducted to add a qualitative dimension.</p>
<p>Their study in 1997 showed few companies had strategic intent behind their online activities, and showed that many did not integrate their online marketing communications with other aspects of their promotional programs. Often, the reason organisations gave for maintaining a website was because immediate competitors did so. The researchers have now revisited these sites as an ongoing longitudinal study.</p>
<p>Of the 300 sites originally analysed, 87% still had a web presence in 1999. To retain the original number (300) It was decided to add and review 40 new sites randomly selected from the 17,888 available in New Zealand. After all the analyses have been carried out these 40 will be compared to the original 260 to determine if any significant differences exist. Several criteria were added to the content analysis measures to take account of:</p>
<pre>
       * the changes in the underlying website technology (Java, web authoring packages etc.)
       * the accessibility to the technology
       * improved website design skills.
</pre>
<p>Initial results indicate that significantly more companies have based their electronic communications strategy closely to the guidelines set for more 'traditional' promotional activity and communication strategy. Previously the two were independent and often inefficiently in conflict. Also, whilst sites are generally more sophisticated, they are also easier to locate and easier to navigate. Of great interest to the researchers was the considerable increase in the number of transaction based parts of sites (as distinct from entirely sales based sites)</p>
<p>The trends determined from this study have provided great insight and improved the quality and effectiveness of the survey instrument and methodology used in this study, the WebQUAL Audit. WebQUAL: Objectives and Methodology</p>
<p>As previously stated, it is hypothesised that a perspective of the Internet as occupying three roles in commercial use impacts on return on investment calculations thereby necessitating a study of company intentions, strategies and expenditure concerning Internet usage. WebQUAL Objectives</p>
<p>The WebQUAL study aims to establish the following:</p>
<pre>
       * Why business and government maintain Internet websites as well as Intranet and Extranet infrastructure.
       * The budgets expended on this technology.
       * How the technology is used. (E.g. From transactions to maintaining and enhancing the scope of relationships).
       * Criteria used to measure return on investment and the 'success' of this technology.
       * Business and government ratings of their own websites compared with content analysis by the researchers and subsequent independent panels.
       * Organisational responsibility for this technology
       * The interconnectedness of Internet technology and other aspects of marketing such as marketing communications via other media.
       * Perceived return on investment.
</pre>
<p>WebQUAL Methodology</p>
<p>WebQUAL entails auditing the way in which Australian and New Zealand business and government use the Internet including expenditure and expected returns from the use of Intranets and Extranets. The audit entails ascertaining objectives, budgets, success criteria, and undertaking content analysis of websites from a sample frame of respondent domain names. The intended study utilises Web browser form technology and email to survey the February, 1999 population of 81,563 Australian (See Table 1) and 17,888 New Zealand (See Table 2) domain names. While studies such as those by DIST (1998) and by Keig &amp; Co [HREF 8] report on the growth and 'viewing' habits of Internet users, it is difficult to identify non-commercial studies concentrating on the experiences of business and government conducting business using Internet technologies. This particular academic research aims to ensure that business planning is less likely to occur in a vacuum, with a concomitant wastage of shareholder and other funds. There is a knowledge gap concerning whether or not there is integration between marketing communications using such traditional media as television, radio, print (mass media) as well as direct marketing techniques such as database marketing with use of the Internet. Furthermore there remains a gap in the scientists' and practitioners' minds as to the measures of effectiveness and efficiency used when communicating via 'new media'. Likewise the nature of transactions and the means of maintaining relationships is poorly understood. Neither the DIST nor KPMG studies provide this information. The KPMG study reports that less than half of companies they define as 'leaders' and some 30 percent of 'followers' are undertaking some form of cost-benefit analysis on integrating e-commerce into business activities (1999, p.10). This is too nebulous a result given the amount of money spent on marketing communication in general and on Websites in particular.</p>
<p>Publication of the findings from the 1999 study and subsequent extension of the study into North America, Asia and Europe should provide greater understanding of the opportunities for business and provide continuing links between university researchers and organisations involved. 139.132.1.1 03:01, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The ææ½®ã(Asashio) "First Class" of Destroyers were created after Japanese abrogation of the London Naval Treaty of 1930. These ships were meant to take advantage of the Japanese advantages in Torpedo firepower, and were designed to screen larger ships and engage in hit and run attacks against enemy vessels. The Asashio class completed 10 ships before being replaced by the "Second Class" of large fast Destroyers. No Japanese ships of this class survived the war.</p>
<p>The ships displacement was 1961 tons with for a standard mission profile with 3 boilers powering 2 geared turbine shafts with a power output of 50000 HP at the screws giving it a top speed of 35 knots and a range of 5700 nautical miles at 10 knots or 960 nautical miles at 34 knots.</p>
<p>The Asashio class DD's were armed with: 6 5" guns arranged in 3 turrets with two guns per turret. 4 25mm Anti-Aircraft guns. 8 24" Long Lance torpedoes arranged in two launchers on pivoting mounts 16 Depth Charges in rear racks.</p>

<p>Trombones with F attachements formerly used only one type of valve. The rotory valve, as it is known, has the considerable downfalls of constricting air around very tight bends in the bore of the instrument. This dramatically changes the tone and timbre of the instrument, and can make playing more difficult. Recent advances in trombone valves, the first being the Thayer Valve, have lead to a competition to find the most "free flowing" valve. From this, the Hagmann Valve was invented.</p>

<p>The Hagmann Valve works similarly to any other open-wrapped trombone valve configuration. Pulling the "Trigger" causes the spindle to turn, guiding the air through a different set of tubes. It is different from the rotory valve in that the angles at which the air flows (60%, or 66% in bass trombones) is dramatically less, and preserves tone. While the Hagmann Valve does not achieve as low an angle as the Thayer (which can be as low as 20%), it is much easier to maintain, and tone differences are nearly inaudible.</p>

<p>Dan Kelley has a massive afro. For years, engineers have been stuggling to find a metal polymer strong enough to chop his resilient curly locks. Then, in the spring of 2003, a man by the name of Jeff Titus developed a pair of hedge clippers that he thought would get the job done. He strapped Dan down. His hair was so strong, than upon Jeff's first attempt, the clippers recoiled out of his hands, hit him in the head, and he unfortunately was killed. In the summer of 2005, Jeff's journal was published posthumously. Dan has read this journal and has said in a recent interview that "It makes me feel absolutely terrible. I feel that I caused the death of this great man.</p>
<p>Dan Kelley has been in and out of insane asylums and mental hospitals for the last year. He is currently living at home and is on constant suicide watch. His hair remains intact.</p>

The Mexichina war was fought from 1995 to 2000. [China] invaded [Mexico] in 1995 because they thought Mexico was so poor and dirty and want to be in the US anyway that they wouldn't mind being taken over. China also wanted to feed their unneeded female babies to the Mexicans. But, to China's surpirse, the Mexican army fought with bravery and courage. They did not let the Asian invaders take over their land. Many people died including the famous pointilism painter, Georges Seurat.</p>

<p>In Fantasy Role Playing Game Credits there are two authors by the name of Steve Marsh.</p>
<p>The one is the so-called "real Steve Marsh" who shows up in wiki articles such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahuagin" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahuagin" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahuagin</a></p>
<p>The other is the Steve Marsh working for Steve Jackson Games who coined the term "the real Steve Marsh" in a keynote address he gave at a convention he was the guest of honor of.</p>
<p>A better dividing line is that the "real" Steve Marsh is older and a lawyer, the one who speaks at conventions is younger and an editor. It is a point of humor to ask which is worse (to be a lawyer or an editor).</p>
<p>The older Steve Marsh originated the good-evil/law-chaos alignment system for D&amp;D, the aquatic monsters, the original design for the D&amp;D planes of reality, the origional psionics system (as a character class) and a number of other core contributions. He is the subject of discussion and his works are collectables (see <a href="http://www.acaeum.com/forum/index.php" class="external free" title="http://www.acaeum.com/forum/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.acaeum.com/forum/index.php</a> for collectable information for D&amp;D materials and <a href="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/index.php" class="external free" title="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/index.php</a> for the sticky about him.</p>
<p>The younger (and some might say more vigorous) Steve Marsh works at <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.sjgames.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sjgames.com/</a> and has on-line references at:</p>

<p>The older Steve Marsh when questioned about the younger one has said "I'm not sure he is more vigorous, just thinner, taller and more charismatic." The younger Steve Marsh has yet to comment on that characterization.</p>
<p>The older Steve Marsh's credits include contributions to Runequest, Heroquest, D&amp;D, editing Expert D&amp;D, some board bames, Superworld <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superworld" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superworld" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superworld</a>; Champions, Champions Hero and many other projects.</p>
<p>The younger Steve Marsh has been involved in GURPS, EO Nomine, and more GURPS (there are enough GURPS products to swamp the rest of the FRPG market) as well as editing Pyramid.</p>

<p>A Stotan is described as a cross between a Stoic and a Spartan. It was coined by Percy Cerutty to describe Herb Elliot during his training for the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome. During this time, Elliot ran a considerable distance over dunes after his regular work out and came several times on the brink of death. A Stotan is used to describe someone who trains themselves past the point of exhaustion.</p>

<p>A Stoic was a type of philosophy that taught self-control, fortitude, and detachment from emotions such as pain and pleasure. A Spartan was a Greek soldier from the city-state of Sparta. Spartans were known to be able to handle a great amount of pain without uttering a sound. If you put the values of the two together, you get a Stotan.</p>

<p>Rubber will have been used around the world for 162 years on March 17. Ever since it has been used in various ways, Hair scrunchâs, sling shots, jump ropes and of course Rubber bands.</p>

<p>Well on March 17, 1845, A man by the name Stephen Perry of a manufacturing company (Messers Perry and co. London) patented the first rubber bands. The bands had been made of vulcanized rubber. Vulcanization is the process of cross-linking molecules to make the bulk material harder, less breakable and more durable. Vulcanization is also called curing. Mr. Perry had created the rubber bands to hold his papers and envelopes together.</p>
<p>About three quarters of rubber today in production is a synthetic product made of crude oil. During Word War 2, the United States was cut off from rubber supplies around the world. Also during that time they stepped up the production of synthetic rubber for war uses.</p>

<p>1770 a British chemist, Joseph Priestley discovered that rubber could be used as an eraser for pencil marks by rubbing. In 1791 another Englishmen named Samuel Peal discovered the means of water proofing cloth by mixing rubber with turpentine.</p>
<p>And now after 161 years we still use the original vulcanized rubber bands.</p>

<p>The National Theater for Children, based in Minnespolis, Minnesota has been one of the most active touring theater companies for children over the past 25 years. It delivers short plays with a message to elementary and middle schools across the country free of charge, thanks to the underwriting of private corporations or governmental institutions who pay for the programs.</p>

<p>The National Theater for Children was formed in 1978 under the name of Small Change Original Theatre by University of Minnesota Students <a href="http://www.incognitotheplay.com/documents/biography.html" class="external text" title="http://www.incognitotheplay.com/documents/biography.html" rel="nofollow">Michael Sidney Fosberg</a>, <a href="http://www.nationaltheatre.com/ward_eames.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.nationaltheatre.com/ward_eames.htm" rel="nofollow">Ward Eames</a> and Wakeley Smith. It's first production was The Energized Guyz- a take off of the movie Star Wars written and directed by its Artistic Director Michael Sidney Fosberg. The program was created as an energy safety program for Northern States Power. In its early years, it remained a small organoization that toured regionally with original programming for electric utiltiies. After Fosberg left the company, the artistic side was managed by Jack Starr and then Steve Roath.</p>
<p>During the mid 1980's, under new management, the company expanded to provide programs for water utilites nationally. During this time, the company became one of the most active touring theater companies in America. In 1990, co-founder Ward Eames returned to the company as Executive Director and in 1992, the company hired Ian Gallaner as its Artistic Director. It was during this time that the company saw great growth- evolving into a nationally recognized company that performs for over one million children a year. The name change occurred during this era.</p>
<p>Christopher Becker took over the Artistic reins of the company in 1998 and has since been succeeded by Jon Mikkelsen. Over the past ten years, the company has expanded its programming to the health insurance industries, food companies and financial institutions. In 2003, the company performed at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll hosted by Vice-President Dick Cheney's wife Lynne Cheney.</p>
<p>It is estimated that, since its inception, over 800 actors have worked for the National Theatre for Children performing for over 10 million school aged children.</p>

<p>He is a self taught painter and has been selling his paintings since the age of seventeen.</p>
<p>His oil paintings are surreal. George Melly has said of Michael: âhe is an extremely accomplished painterâ¦. Mr Forbes, who was born and brought up in the extreme North of Scotland has been granted access to a poetic world, all the more remarkable given his isolationâ¦. his pictures are truly impressive.â</p>
<p>Ricky Gervais has recently said "Michael Forbes, I think he may be a bit mental, but in a good way".</p>
<p>Terry Gilliam has recently said "Surreal, mischievous, wryly sweet... and chockablock with wit and wonder.. Michael Forbes' paintings make me smile and give me hope for humanity... an extraordinary acheivement these days"</p>
<p>He was commissioned by the London Underground to produce a poster in 2000.</p>

<p>Shao Huang (éµé», c. 164 AD -&#160;???, in pinyin: ShÃ o HuÃ¡ng), was a general of the Kingdom of Shu in the Three Kingdoms period of China.</p>
<p>Shao Huang is best portrayed through his description in his Sanguo Zhi biography by Chen Shou. Some sources suggest that Shao Huang was a childhood friend of Zhang Fei, but his official biography states that he was raised by Nanman nomads in the province of southern Nanyue.</p>
<p>When Liu Bei entered Yizhou in his war against Liu Zhang, Shao Huang was given the rank of General of the Northern Rivers, but was later demoted when Liu Shan became successor. It is said that Shao Huang was such a dedicated vassal that he soon after died of shame.</p>

<p>The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons (www.abjs.org) was conceived in 1947. The purpose of the Association was to give younger men in orthopaedic surgery an organization in which to present papers, publish manuscripts and share experiences with colleagues. Membership was offered by invitation to orthopaedic surgeons under fifty years of age who had been certified by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery at least three years previously. Scott F. Dye, MD, serves as President.</p>
<p>The ABJS maintains a journal, Clinical Orthopedics and Related Research, published by Lippincott. (www.corronline.com)</p>
<p>The editors of Clinical Orthopedics and Related Research will meet in Philadelphia on October 6th and 7th.</p>

<p>Bordee is a web 2.0 program with a lot of potential. It allows you to post a comment on any website you wish, and express your opinion. With posts on Famous Dave's and even the FBI's websites, it's surely showing what it's made of.</p>
<p>Other ideas have been expressed that this could be a very liberating program for oppressed countries, such as China. Where freedom on the internet is not normally enjoyed.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-06_0edd.html" title="Edit section: Tanman">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tanman</span></h2>
<p><b>Tanman</b></p>
<p>J. E. Eletto (1 October 1979) of <a href="../../../u/p/s/Upstate_New_York_7a34.html" title="Upstate New York">upstate New York</a>, who is best known as Tanman, is the creator of the humor website Speedini.com <a href="http://Speedini.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://Speedini.com" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and swimming briefs known as Speedinis.</p>
<p><b>Childhood</b></p>
<p>Tanman realized at age 6 that oversized, heavy beach shorts were slowing down his beach abilites. Tanman convinced his mom to buy him swimming <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briefs.html" title="Briefs">briefs</a> so he could speed and jump with increased skill at the beach. This led to heavy ridicule and occasional sucker punches from Tanman's peers in the first grade. Tanman stopped wearing small swimming briefs immediately.</p>
<p><b>Brazil</b></p>
<p>For 20 years, the male bikini was far from Tanman's mind. It was on a trip to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> that Tanman's childhood beach dream was reborn. Tanman noticed that Brazilian men sped, jumped and karate kicked around the beach with much more <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom.html" title="Freedom">freedom</a> than in the U.S.A. Tanman realized that the male <a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini.html" title="Bikini">bikini</a> they were using was the secret to their <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skills.html" title="Skills">skills</a>. It was also clear to Tanman that <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women.html" title="Women">women</a> enjoyed the swimming briefs due to the beach <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equalism.html" title="Equalism">equalism</a> that they offered. Tanman knew that the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedo_%28suit_style%29.html" title="Speedo (suit style)">Speedo (suit style)</a> existed back home with little popularity among regular beach goers. Tanman was impressed and became motived to change the beach <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a> of the U.S.A.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Today</b></p>
<p>Tanman returned <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home.html" title="Home">home</a> and created a website and brand of briefs called Speedini. The name Speedini comes from <i>speed</i> (men can run faster when using them) and <i>bikini</i> (the male version). Tanman's website has become one of the most visited humor <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beachwear.html" title="Beachwear">beachwear</a> webpages of the year. He is using humor to help beach culture in the U.S.A. evolve.</p>
<p><b>Groupies</b></p>
<p>Tanman is known to have more <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groupies.html" title="Groupies">groupies</a> than 90% of all start up <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emo_%28music%29.html" title="Emo (music)">emo (music)</a> rock bands.</p>

<p>The Carter Challenge is a <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croquet.html" title="Croquet">croquet</a> sports event between the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. This event has been held since 1991 when the US team defeated the Irish team. The event has been held 5 other times and the Irish have defeated the US each time. The Irish currently hold ownership of the cup at the Carrickmines Croquet and Lawn Tennis club, Glenamuck Road, Dublin, Ireland.</p>
<p>The Carter Challenge and the Soloman Cup are test matches to help prepare the US croquet team for competitive play in the <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacRobertson_International_Croquet_Shield_b505.html" title="MacRobertson International Croquet Shield">MacRobertson International Croquet Shield</a>.</p>
<p>The Carter Challenge is named for a past [<a href="http://www.croquetamerica.com" class="external text" title="http://www.croquetamerica.com" rel="nofollow">USCA (United States Croquet Association)</a>] President Foxy Carter.</p>

<p>Two teams consisting each of six players play the test over a 4 day period. The test consists of 21 matches, each match a best of three games. There are 12 single and 9 doubles matches.</p>
<p>The event started out with an unusual format of playing the set of singles matches under the governing Laws of Association croquet and the doubles matches played under the rules of the USCA as created by its founder, Jack Osborn, circa 1970, and widely played throughout the United States, and parts of Canada and Mexico. The Laws of Association Croquet extend well beyond the Commonwealth and in the latest World Championships, 21 countries were represented.</p>
<p>Presently the players have been settling toward playing the test exclusively using the Association rulebook.</p>

<p>It is up for debate as to when the Wheezy Bus became the dream of three young leaders in the architecture major at Brooklyn Technical High School. What is known that it definetly happened in their junior year while doing architecture related activities. Since then Wheezy Bus has grown beyond 20 memebers and continues to grow like a turnip patch. The founding fathers include Mason Charter, Joshua Eisenstat, and Joseph Weiner.</p>

<p>To the north of india are the The himalayas . they are a chain of fold mountains with peaks exceeding 8000m . millions of years ago the teths sea occupied the area the land presently occupied by the himalayas . to its north was the angaraland to its south the gondwanaland . as the southern land moved northwards the sea floor sedimentary depositions were raised to form mountains . the himalayas are still growing at a rate of 1 cm a year. it consists of i)the northen mountain wall ii)the middle himalayas iii)the shivaliks . 1)the northen range or the Himadri rang has an altitude of 6000m above sae level . its western most point is the nanga parbat overlooking the indus while namcha barwa overlooking the brahmaputra river is its easternmost points . kanchenjunga (8598 m) , dhaulagiri(8712 m) , nanda devi (7817 m) are some of the the impotant peaks .</p>
<p>2) the lesser himalayas or the himachal is a dissected upland crossed by various streams . it includes the pir panjal and the dhaula dhar ranges . the kasmir valley , kangra valley are some of the important valley s in this range .</p>
<p>3) the outer ranges or the shivaliks have an average altitude of 1200m . the duns are narrow valleys in this range . the terai are the ill-drained marshy plains formed at the foothills of the mountains .</p>
<p>the himalayas are usually divided into 3 regions from west to east . the western himalayas are in the states of jammu and kashmir and himachal pradesh . the central himalayas cover the states of uttaranhal , uttar pradesh and the eastern himalayas are in the states of west bengal ,sikkim , arunachal pradesh .</p>
<p>The impact of the himalayas a)provide a natural barrier between india and china . b)its great height prevents the cold winds from china to coming towards india . it also forms a barrier to the moisture laden winds coming from the indian ocean and causes hevy rainfall in the indo-gangetic plains . c)the water from the melting glaciers provides water to the rivers in the dry summer season .the water water also provides cheap hydro-electric power . d)the shivaliks and the himachal ranges provide good tourist and winter sports spotes . they also provide rich pasture lands for raising sheep and cattle and also give valueable timber . e)slopes also provide land for terraced farming and tea cultivation . tea grown in the darjeeling region are world famous . f)himayas also maintain bio-diversity in the region by providing habitat for various types of speceis .</p>

<p>To the north of india are the The Himalayas . They are a chain of fold mountains with peaks exceeding 8000m . Millions of years ago the Tethys sea occupied the area presently occupied by the himalayas . To its north was the Angaraland to its south the Gondwanaland . As the southern land moved northwards the sea floor sedimentary depositions were raised to form Fold mountains .The himalayas are still growing at a rate of 1 cm a year. It consists of i)The northen mountain wall ii)The middle himalayas iii)The shivaliks . 1)The northen range or the Himadri range has an altitude of 6000m above sea level . Its western most point is the Nanga Parbat overlooking the river Indus while Namcha Barwa overlooking the Brahmaputra river is its easternmost point . Kanchenjunga (8598 m) , Dhaulagiri(8712 m) , Nanda devi (7817 m) are some of the the impotant peaks .</p>
<p>2) The lesser himalayas or the Himachal is a dissected upland crossed by various streams . It includes the Pir Panjal and the Dhaula Dhar ranges . The Kashmir valley , Kangra valley are some of the important valleys in this range .</p>
<p>3) The outer ranges or the Shivaliks have an average altitude of 1200m . The Duns are narrow valleys in this range . The Terai are the ill-drained marshy plains formed at the foothills of the mountains .</p>
<p>The himalayas are usually divided into 3 regions from west to east . The western himalayas are in the states of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh . The central himalayas cover the states of Uttaranhal , Uttar Pradesh and the eastern himalayas are in the states of West Bengal ,Sikkim , Arunachal Pradesh .</p>
<p>The impact of the himalayas a)They provide a natural barrier between India and China . b)Its great height prevents the cold winds from China to coming towards India . It also forms a barrier to the moisture laden winds coming from the Indian ocean and causes hevy rainfall in the Indo-Gangetic plains . c)The water from the melting glaciers provide water to the rivers in the dry summer season .The water also provides cheap hydro-electric power . d)The Shivaliks and the Himachal ranges provide good tourist and winter sports spots . They also provide rich pasture lands for raising sheep and cattle and also give valueable timber . e)Slopes also provide land for terraced farming and tea cultivation . Tea grown in the Darjeeling region are world famous . f)Himalayas also maintain bio-diversity in the region by providing habitat for various types of speceis .</p>

<p>The Wonderbolt circus is a Newfoundland based circus that has been ongoing for 25 years. Founded by Beni Malone, this circus has acts from all around the world and some of the members change each year. There are international acts and things such as juggling, bounce juggling, pair acrobatics, Magic, unicycling, silks, handstanding and much more.</p>
<p>The story behind the acts of Wonderbolt are based on a family called the Zuma's. Beni, being Benzito Zuma. Though not all performers are part of the Zuma family. They live their lives like anyone else, except with the magical twist of circus arts.</p>
<p>Wonderbolt is a magical, musical, fantastical experience and people should look forward to seeing them perform each summer at St.Bon's gym in St.John's NL Canada.</p>

<p>While the story of pinocchio is as we all know created by the Italian author Carlo Collodi, he got some of his inspiration for the masterpiece (later made into a Disney motion picture) from the puppet stories in Spain. Although Collodi was never known to have ever been to Spain, he told stories of them in his personal journal. Thus I have come to my conclusion that the so called Italian Pinocchio is accually a Spanish dirivitive. Spanish Pinocchio</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-06_0edd.html" title="Edit section: Albany Convict Gaol,  Western Australia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Albany Convict Gaol, Western Australia</span></h2>
<p>The Albany Convict Gaol is unique in the history of convict labour in Western Australia. It was built by convicts for convicts. Its construction used local granite as well as bricks made on the site. Much of the original construction is intact and visible.</p>
<p>The original building was for Imperial Convicts who had committed minor crimes. There were only a few occasions when the gaol was full and only two criminals were held. One man was hanged.</p>
<p>The newer part of the Albany Convict Gaol held local miscreants including citizens of Albany and districts, drunks, seamen and Aborigines. Although a section of the Gaol was set aside for women, few were ever held.</p>
<p>You may wish to contemplate just what it would have been like to be held in these buildings. Remember there was no electricity, running water and toilet facilities were primitive to say the least.</p>
<p>It is interesting to contemplate the life of the McGovern family. Mr McGovern was a warder for over thirty years. The family including eight children lived at the Gaol. Mrs McGovern, followed by each of her older daughters was a matron.</p>
<p>THE BUILDING: The building of the Albany Convict Gaol dates from the time that convicts were brought into Western Australia from Britain to help develop the state. The Gaol was built in two stages: The oldest part of the building, built in the 1850s, is to the right of the entry door; the newer section was built in the 1870s.</p>
<p>The Albany Convict Gaol was part of the complex, which was established as a hiring depot and included the Residency Museum, which was the Commissariat Store and an assortment of buildings for the Military Miners and Sappers (Engineers), and their families, a twelve-cell lock up (The Albany Convict Gaol) and keeper's quarters. Other buildings at Point Frederick included workshops, a hospital, kitchen, a garden, and a parade ground. The Albany Convict Gaol was used as a place of punishment for ticket-of-leave men who committed offences while working at the depot or in the district. It was built by the convicts mainly ticket-of-leave men, and by stonemasons from the Royal Sappers stationed at the depot.</p>
<p>The end of the small exercise yard had a wall on which broken glass was placed to stop convicts climbing the wall and escaping. Most of the prisoners that were held in the Albany Convict Gaol stayed from three days to twelve months, the most common offences being drunkenness and fighting.</p>
<p>During the 1860s, overcrowding of the town's Civil Gaol at Lawley Park was noted and a decision was made to make the hiring depot a public gaol. In 1872, work started to enlarge the site to provide facilities for women in the form of female cells and a matron's quarters. The refectory or dining hall was built with a cell at the rear to accommodate Aboriginal prisoners. Walled glass-topped exercise yards for male and female prisoners were constructed and in later years, the whole gaol was surrounded by a high brick wall that was topped with broken glass.</p>
<p>Apart from superficial changes and repairs, little was done to improve the facilities of the Gaol and the form of the Albany Convict Gaol today is as it was in 1880.</p>
<p>A decision was made in 1940 to close the gaol and demolish the buildings but because no tenders were received,the building stayed in tact. Later the Public Works Department used the buildings as a store and repair shop. Public Works Department vacated the buildings in 1959 and in 1968, they were handed over to the Albany Historical Society (Inc) who have since repaired and renovated the buildings. In 1973, the buildings were classified as Heritage Buildings by the National Trust of Australia.</p>
<p>The period between the withdrawal of the Public Works Department and the Albany Historical Society (Inc) taking control of the buildings saw the complex fall into disrepair. It was used during this time by local school age children as a local haunt. The children graffitied and damaged the complex extensively. It is also believed that in this period that up to three local people committed suicide within the complex.</p>
<p>A number of alterations to the cells were made over the years including the division of sleeping arrangements, which varied over the years. It is thought that the original convicts slept in hammocks, and then wooden beds were used and later probably iron bedsteads. Toilet arrangements would have included a slop bucket in the cell. Outside privies were built in the small exercise yard and were evidently appalling. The toughest prisoners were put in the cells closest to the foul smelling latrines - an added punishment. After the new gaol buildings were completed, new water closets were built in the main exercise yard.</p>
<p>THE CELLS: The twelve cell stone lock up was one of the first buildings constructed and was completed in 1854. Attached to the lock up was a three-roomed brick cottage used as the superintendent's quarters and depot store. Reports from later years describe the cells as damp, poorly ventilated with spring running water flowing under the building in winter.</p>
<p>The granite used was quarried from Mount Melville. The bricks were made from local clay, which was taken from the town clay pit, which is now a part of Parade Street, the oldest street in Western Australia.</p>
<p>The lock up was intended to be a place of punishment for ticket of leave men who committed offences while working at the depot or in the district. All the convicts were Imperial convicts being those who had committed offences in Britain and had been transported to Western Australia. However, colonial convicts i.e. those who committed offences in the colony were soon also gaoled in the building.</p>
<p>A number of alterations to the cells were made over the years including the division of the lock up into two sections each of six cells, and the changing of single cells to become two man cells. A wall was demolished to combine two cells as a kitchen; this wall has been restored.</p>
<p>THE BLACK HOLE: The Black Hole cell was a common form of punishment for difficult prisoners, though the stay in the Black Hole cell was usually for short-term isolation. The use of the Black Hole cell for punishment was officially abolished in 1898.</p>
<p>At the time of the first settlement a Black Hole cell was used for punishment for several drunken soldiers. They were packed into the Black Hole cell and as a result, one soldier died from suffocation.</p>
<p>THE ABORIGINAL AND SEAMEN'S CELL: This cell was built in 1874 for Aboriginal prisoners. Up to that time, the Aborigines had been held in the town gaol at Lawley Park. Aboriginal prisoners frequently escaped from that prison by digging under the walls. When the cell was built, it was lined with timber to prevent digging. The cell has a number of remarkable carvings on the timber. They include a snake, a lizard, and a kangaroo. They are believed to be the oldest Aboriginal cell art in Australia.</p>
<p>Foreign seamen were also held in this cell and there are carvings of sailing ships on the walls. Grooves have also been carved into the timber to denote the number of days some prisoners had been gaoled.</p>
<p>THE GREAT HALL: The Great Hall was planned for in 1871 as part of the new additions. Its exact purpose is unknown as an unusual sloping section was planned for and built along the length of the north wall. A piece of this sloping shelf can be seen in the far corner.</p>
<p>Because of the number of warders the Hall was later used as a dining room, thus the area is called 'The Refectory' but it was also used for other purposes including a day room and a church.</p>
<p>By the 1900s, it was used as a ward for hard labour prisoners.</p>
<p>THE TOWER: The upstairs room was built in 1879 after the Great Hall although the design was included in the original plans but the exact purpose and its subsequent use after construction is unknown.</p>
<p>It is constructed with a high window and has a fireplace on the east wall with access to the room by external wooden stairs. One theory is that it was built for a mentally ill person. The story is that a young man had periods of unmanageable behaviour, which included hurting his sister. He was incarcerated in the Tower and was only visited by his priest. At times when he was lucid, he wrote poetry.</p>
<p>However, this has not been proven. It may have been two cells, one either side of the fireplace. Another theory is that it was a storeroom but this is unlikely because of the fireplace.</p>
<p>THE FEMALE CELLS: These cells were added for female prisoners in 1874. All the female cells are doubles. Most of the prisoners were convicted of drunkenness, prostitution or other minor offences. There was at least one mental prisoner but she was transferred to Perth. The female prisoners had a day room where they were allowed during the daytime. The female prisoners worked in the adjoining washhouse doing the washing and ironing.</p>
<p>People who have worked in the Albany Convict Gaol and some visitors have related experiences of ghostly happenings in the area of the female cells. These include the sound of a baby crying. As a number of the McGovern children died while living at the Albany Convict Gaol, there are theories that the ghosts belong to them.</p>

<p>Steve the Heron is a plastic heron. Aged 17 and a pupil at Wymondham High School, Steve has done a great deal of good to the world. Despite this fact, Steve is largely unrecognised by the general public and the praise he greatly deserves is long overdue. Steve likes to "Steve" as well as to perch on various objects.</p>

<p>Occumbophobia is the irrational fear of falling. It is derived from the Latin words 'occumbo' (to fall) and 'phobia' (to be scared of). It is the fear of falling and not heights, and it exceeds common sense. For example anyone would be scared to fall off a scyscraper, but someone who is occumbophobic will regularly have nightmares depicting themselves falling from great heights.</p>

They ended up losing the campaign, but after the campaign John called Mikal and asked him if he wanted a job Mikal agreed, and they ended up starting a company called Western Wireless in the mix of all of this Mikal met a woman By the name of Lynn Hoefener, and after a while they got married, and bore two children by the name of Sam and Pete Thomsen who are now 10, and 14 years old. 11 years after John, Mikal, and John's wife Terry started the company they sold the cellular telephone company to Alltell. Currently Mikal lives with his wife Lynn and his two son's in Bellevue near his great friend John Stanton.</p>

<p>Robert Rhodes is a homeland security officer who forcibly subdued an innocent Chinese tourist named Zhan Yan on July 21, 2004. During his trial, his attorney argued that he was the only officer involved who was being prosecuted, and speculated that this is because Mr. Rhodes is openly homosexual, and thus the investigators were persecuting him. He was acquitted of civil rights violations, and retains his job.</p>

<p>Zhao Yan and two other Asian women were walking across the rainbow bridge, when they saw Homeland Security officers beating an African American man who was pinned on the ground. They would find out that the man was accused carrying marijuana. The other two women ran the other way, and Yan stood frozen. Officer Rhodes claims that he ordered Yan to come to him, and she stood frozen. Officer Rhodes allegedly pepper sprayed a non-resisting Yan, grabbed her by her hair, threw her to the ground, banged her head against the concrete, and struck her several times with his Knees.</p>
<p>Rather than being brought to the hospitable, Yan was placed into a holding cell that she describes as dark and small, and subjected to a full body cavity search, which she described as humiliating.</p>
<p>Yan suffered substance superficial injuries, bruises and abrasions and broken teeth, see attached image. <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Beatingvictim.jpg">Image:Beatingvictim.jpg</a> In addition, she complained of headaches for months after the beating, insomnia and substantial emotional stress. She was quoted as saying</p>
<p>"The humiliation I suffered from being beaten by the policeman far outweighs my physical pain. As a career woman, I was very confident in the past, but now my confidence has all gone. I'm now living in my friend's apartment which is on the 25th floor, sometimes, I really want to jump out."</p>
<p>Also</p>
<p>"Although five days have passed, my whole body still aches fiercely in many parts, and even the use of pain-killer is ineffective, and this is often accompanied by syndromes like nerve paralysis and immovability of many parts of my body."</p>

<p>Rhodes was charged with violating Yanâs civil rights by injuring her, and faced 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>His attorney claimed that he was being singled out because he was openly gay, and that other officers involved in the incident were not charged. When he moved to have the case dismissed on these grounds, the judge refused.</p>
<p>Two other DHS officers, Emmett Russell and Amina Zinnerman testified that Rhodeâs actions were unwarranted, unnecessary and dangerous.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Martin Littlefield argued that Rhodes âwithin seconds of running up to the petite Zhao, Rhodes emptied a can of pepper spray in her face and threw her against a wall, causing her to fall to her knees in a fetal position, her hands clamped to her burning eyes. When one of two other officers who arrived to help could not pry Zhao's left hand from her face to handcuff her, Rhodes kneed her three times in the head and then grabbed her hair and pounded her head into the cementâ He added that "There's no indication she's flailing or kicking. She just won't give up that arm,"</p>
<p>Rhodeâs attorney, Steve Cohen argued that Rhodes believed Yan was associated with the suspect that he was subduing, and appealed to a fear of terrorism.</p>
<p>"We don't have little Miss Innocent who was sprayed for no reason at all," Cohen said. "Terrorists come in all sizes, shapes and colors,"</p>
<p>It took a mostly white jury, with no Asian members less than 5 hours to acquit Mr. Rhodes.</p>

<p>Some allege that a tape of the beating exists, but has been hidden from investigators. The area where the incident took place is supposed to be covered by a camera run by the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission (Camera #13), however the commission claims that that camera was âmalfunctioningâ at the time of the beating.</p>

<p>In China, the acquittal lead to a great deal of press, with several questioning the United Stateâs self proclaimed model of freedom and democracy.</p>

<p>After the beating, Zhao spoke out against her attacker, here are a few quotes taken from the Peopleâs Daily (<a href="http://english.people.com.cn/200407/29/eng20040729_151256.html" class="external free" title="http://english.people.com.cn/200407/29/eng20040729_151256.html" rel="nofollow">http://english.people.com.cn/200407/29/eng20040729_151256.html</a>)</p>
<p>"I used to think that American police are handsome, tall and strong. But I've never thought that they would resort to such brutal violence on a woman. It is already cruel to spray me with liquid pepper, why did they even beat me violently?"</p>
<p>"That policeman, with one hand, beckoned me to go over there, while sprayed me with liquid pepper with another hand. My eyes, hair, face and neck were sprayed successively, and then I fell to the ground, and was surrounded by at least three policemen, they kicked me on the face and body with their leather shoes. My eyes were so swollen that I simply couldn't open them, and one of my teeth was broken, my skin was in great pain, I thought I was dying at that timeâ</p>

<p>âMentalâ John can often be seen frequenting many bars and clubs around the city of Liverpool, most notably The Liverpool Guild of Students for events such as Double Vision and 'Time Tunnel'.</p>
<p>Known for his brash but fun-loving and party-animal attitude, âMentalâ John has become a somewhat local celebrity, with trademark sayings such as âTegwkgheighaihgbhiuribnhiohpabvbgm'.</p>
<p>Height</p>
<p>The exact height of âMentalâ John has been widely disputed with some experts insisting that he is actually 9ft 2inch, contesting âThe Liverpool University Encyclopaedia of Clubberâs Heightsâ (c. 2006) in which âMentalâ John is measured as 8ft 9inch.</p>
<p>âWahay!â</p>
<p>The catchphrase âWahay!â was created by a group of âMentalâ John fans during the academic year 2005/06. It is intended as a greeting of âMentalâ John when he is spotted in a club. The catchphrase is more often than not synchronised with a raised hand, similar to a high-five.</p>
<p>Morning Myth</p>
<p>Fans have reported sightings of âMentalâ John walking back from a night out in the city of Liverpool at times as late as 9am the next morning, when his loyal fans are themselves making their way to a morning lecture at The University of Liverpool after a good nightâs sleep. Unconfirmed sightings even suggested that 'Mental' John's shirt was smeared with blood, although this is only rumour.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that cedar bedding (chipped cedar wood) contains chemicals, such as aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols, which can be harmful to small pets such as rodents, ferrets, and rabbits. Though cedar is a popular bedding material and has been shown to repel insects, such as fleas, the chemicals naturally found in the wood appear to cause respiratory issues and changes to the enzymes in the liver of small animals. Direct links have not been established between cedar and these symptoms. Pine bedding also contains chemicals, but it is unclear how this affects small animals. Aspen is a common alternative for those who prefer wood bedding, although there are several types of paper, grain, and hay beddings commercially available.</p>
