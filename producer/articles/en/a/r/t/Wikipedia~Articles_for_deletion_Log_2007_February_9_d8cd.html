<dd>It's clearly both WP:RS and WP:V. The detailed information should be in the articles of the playmates. And if you use WP:NOT, you should specify which point precisely in the rather extensive list you think it fails. If this article should be delete I suppose you'd support deleteing the two I mentioned above to be deleted as well. Else there would be no uniform system to it at all. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune_X2_d1ac.html" title="User:Rune X2">Rune X2</a> 11:20, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - only if there is some verifiable reason why being a Playmate makes one more apt to die. Fact is the first Playmates are now in their 60s and 70s; nature is going to take its course eventually anyway; there isn't anything particularly notable about the fact members of a certain group die over time. If this list were of Playmates who were murdered,, that would be a different story, and probably a very short list. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:47, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>You know, your argument isn't very convincing. (Not least because you're not making one as to why it's indiscriminate. Just claiming it is so doesn't really convince me.). Anyway, I think it's pretty clear that Death itself is notable, and it's a given that it's going to be included in any article about a person, or group of people. Playboy Playmates also have some degree of notability as well. Thus I don't see any reason why one would have to show in particular that any given group that is notable has to show anything about its deaths to include the information. That said, a quick look has shown me at least 2 movies/tv specials on Playmate deaths. I suspect ANS will spawn at least one as well. Thus I'd say there's enough interest in the subject of some Playmate's deaths to give it at least some coverage. I just wouldn't say this article is the right way to go about it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 07:11, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think I've ever said that their deaths should not be mentioned on Wikipedia. Their deaths should be mentioned in the articles about the individual people. That's obvious. What's not obvious is why there should be a separate article discussing this. There's nothing underneath this article, it's original research to say that there's something important about this intersection between dead people and Playmates. The reason it's indiscriminate is that it's just a list of women in a particular profession who are dead. What on Earth is notable about that? Nothing.

<li>In any group of reasonable specificity, listing the basic biographical facts of their lives is a given, even if it's just the dates of their birth and death. Adding the cause of death is not an especially large change, and can be found on many pages already. Sometimes it's even a page of its own. See the Presidents page I already mentioned, or this one <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monarchs_of_the_British_Isles_by_cause_of_death_a19d.html" title="List of monarchs of the British Isles by cause of death">List of monarchs of the British Isles by cause of death</a> among others. I'm not saying that is the route I'd go here, but I don't know why you're quibbling about interest, as I said, I found several movies/tv specials about Playmate deaths.

In fact, as I said earlier, it's already in <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy_Playmates_c86a.html" title="Playboy Playmates">Playboy Playmates</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:00, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It is very informative and kind interesting to know, but I think the title should be changed to "Deceased Playboy Playmates" instead of the "harsh" title of "Dead Playboy Playmates" <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazzaler_71a0.html" title="User:Tazzaler">Tazz</a> 17:04 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I can understand why this would be interesting. Most of these Playmates died prematurely and tragically. There's a kernel of something that could <i>possibly</i> be kept--perhaps a legend of a "Playmate curse"--but <i>only</i> if such is based on reliable sources. That's not present here, and a mere list of Playmates who happen to be dead is unencyclopedic <s>and as unnecessary as a List of deceased United States presidents</s>. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 16:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article was quick to access with general search engine. Data was quantitative and reliable. Many articles are written about Playboy's negative impact on society.

<li><b>Delete</b> The sources cited are a promotional site belonging to the performer, and a couple of websites which also appear to promote porn and not to be particularly reliable. Being in a great many porn films does not appear to be equivalent to being in the same number of Hollywood films or broadcast TV shows, since they might be low budget efforts in a motel room with a camcorder, and are in general weak on plot, dialogue, acting, and production values.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Term is frequently used (many search results and the External links at the bottom of the article).

<li><b>Delete</b>. The subjects covered already have articles. I dont like the idea of the redirect going to <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netlabel.html" title="Netlabel">Netlabel</a> because this NEOs is similar to standard terms and it will direct traffic in the wrong direction.

<li><b>Comments</b> - I think that the "only 6 songs made into music videos" needs to be removed. What is with <i>only</i>? 6 seems like a lot. It's biased criteria of notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> Not entirely so. While the Notability of Songs proposal is no longer active, making the top 20 in a "large or medium sized country" was part of that proposal.

<li>It probably would be a good idea to discuss primary topics, since not a single one of those links mentions the song in more than one sentence. Several are blogs, as well, which would not count for notability even if they were primarily about the song. And the top 40 charts! What is the point of bringing this up again? Tens of thousands of songs make top charts! That doesn't mean those songs get to have articles. The german site you came up with for one of the other songs was good, although for that song there's still a need for at least one other reliable source to make it "multiple". That's the sort of coverage we're looking for here. Isn't there anything comparable for this song? —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 09:36, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In short, no, there doesn't appear (at least to me) to be anything comparable, which I find interesting. As far as the blogs are concerned, I'll repeat my comments in the other AfD where we've exchanged views, which are that where no other references exist, blogs are all we have. Given that we're talking about singles, which tend not to get reviewed in the music press short of a mention that X has released Y as a single, the fact that this particular single has attracted <i>any</i> mention at all would appear to be an argument for its notability. In terms of the charts issue, in this case my response is two-pronged. Firstly, I'll repeat my question of what else a song can do other than reaching number 1. Yes, lots of songs do this, but it's a considerable achievement to do so regardless of how many do it. Thus, if a song verifiably reached number 1, which this one did, why does that not count either way? Secondly, given that this song appeared not only in the Finnish charts but also those of three other countries, surely that must count for something as well, or does it simply suffer from appearing in the charts of the wrong countries? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:40, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What else can a song do besides reach number 1? See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imagine_%28song%29.html" title="Imagine (song)">Imagine (song)</a> for an example. It can be the topic of media coverage. It can be a subject of artistic criticism. It can be deconstructed. There's a great deal that can happen to make a song repeatedly notable, besides simply being a chart topper and then fading away and apparently never being written about. I wish we could discuss this without making insinuations about geography. I don't care what country it was number 1 in. I've only said repeatedly that number 1 anywhere doesn't matter. Since I have clearly said that, why would you assume that I don't mean it? Why does this have to be about geography? As for blogs, well, the fact simply is that you can't write a verifiable article with blogs. Blogs don't have editorial oversight, so they aren't reliable sources. It may be that many songs' claims to notability comes from blogs. This should be taken as an indication that these songs are not notable enough to have their own article here. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 12:44, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, other things can happen to a song in certain situations. However, not all songs happen to be written by people who are venerated as deities of the songwriter's art. Neither are they necessarily going to be deconstructed and so on just a year after they were released. The fact remains, however, that this particular song has already achieved some kind of notability by reaching number 1 in one country and charting elsewhere. Precedent has been that a song released by a notable band and reaching number 1 is notable of itself, and currently I'm leaning towards the view that the argument to delete is based on a needlessly restrictive reappraisal of notability. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 20:27, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. A No. 1 hit single in a significant country is unquestionably notable. The nominator appears to be setting an absurdly high bar for song notability, one that would sweep <i>most</i> existing song articles out of Wikipedia if applied consistently. As for having articles about every other single that topped the charts in a significant country, I have to ask "why not" - as Wikipedia is not paper, the primary limitation is the number of editors who are willing to write such articles and enjoy doing so. A few years ago in Wikipedia, only unknown songs by unknown bands were nominated for deletion. Is Wikipedia now so pushed for space that we have to start deleting <i>Number 1 singles</i> by significant bands? Is this <i>really</i> what the AfD/VfD process was created for? <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 20:05, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, AFD <i>really</i> was created fro getting rid of articles that shouldn't exist. There's nothing that can be written about this song beyond a stub, because there are no sources of notabilty and thus verifiability. If an article can never expand beyond a stub, then it must be merged. There's nothing absurdly high about these criteria. I am only asking for what <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is asking for: "<i>the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself.</i>" And nobody is presenting those. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 12:54, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I believe articles about major hit singles by notable artists absolutely <i>should</i> exist on Wikipedia. You have used a strict and subjective interpretation of the WP:N guidelines in judging that the subject is non-notable. Imposing notability criteria which exclude no.1 hit singles by major artists <i>is</i> setting an absurdly high bar for song notability. As per Cpt.

<li>You seem to be applying your own strict criteria here. What parts of the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> guidelines suggest that the subject of an article should be the <i>primary</i> topic of any given sources? <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 20:33, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It has to be <i>non-trivial</i> coverage. "<i>"Non-triviality" is an evaluation of the depth of content contained in the published work, exclusive of mere directory entry information, and of how directly it addresses the subject.</i>" This is widely regarded to mean the subject of the article is the primary subject of the coverage. That is exactly what <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says, for example, but only to make it clearer. Specifically, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does say that it must be <i>the</i> subject. In a newspaper piece about Lordi, the band is <i>the</i> subject of the article. It's possible for there to be more than one subject, I'll grant, but that is not the case in any coverage yet presented here. All the coverage has been nothing more than passing mentions of the song. And "a guideline" does not mean "something we can pretend doesn't exist". Notability is required, it is part of policy. See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_be_needed" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Problem articles where deletion may be needed</a>, non-notability is one of those things that requires deletion. Again, one cannot write a Wikipedia article from a passing sentence or two. In order to be verifiable, the topic must have plenty of third-party reliably-sourced coverage. That's what notability establishes: that enough such material exists. If this article is never going to expand beyond a stub, then it must be merged. If it can expand beyond a stub, that would only be because there are notable verifiable sources to rely on, so let's see them. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 13:07, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Firstly, even if it cannot be expanded beyond a stub, that would not in itself be a reason to delete the article in my view. Even a stub can be a valid article, there is nothing to say it <i>must</i> be merged, and there are some advantages in maintaining a separate article (e.g. categorisation and infoboxes). Nobody is disputing that notability is required, the reason we have AfD at all (instead of having admins just zap every article on sight) is because notability is subjective. As for WP:BIO - that is about people, not songs, so does not apply here. Taken absolutely literally, the phrase "the subject..." in WP:N actually implies that the article subject should be the ONLY subject of a cited work - which is evidently absurd if interpreted as a requirement - I would guess that almost no sources meet this requirement. As the literal interpretation makes no sense, I would be more inclined to interpret it as "<i>a</i> subject" - if "the primary subject" is actually what was meant, then the guideline page should say so. This is actually just a semantic argument over something which isn't cast-iron policy anyway. <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 17:03, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Doesn't matter that it was a major hit. That's not enough information to write an article from. Now why, by the way, do you say this is a less clear cut case?

<ul>
<li>Simply because this was a major hit, but not a No.1 hit. It's not <i>that</i> much less clear cut, to be honest. We may well disagree as to whether there is enough verifiable information to write an article from.

<li>Discussed in, yes (very briefly in each, for a single sentence). But not the primary topic of, which is the notability requirement. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is not fulfilled yet by these passing mentions. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 09:15, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>That is your subjective interpretation. <i>Nowhere</i> in <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does it state that the article's subject is required to be the <i>primary</i> topic of a given reliable source. Besides which, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> describes notability <i>guidelines</i>, not requirements - the distinction is important. <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 20:53, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It has to be <i>non-trivial</i> coverage. "<i>"Non-triviality" is an evaluation of the depth of content contained in the published work, exclusive of mere directory entry information, and of how directly it addresses the subject.</i>" This is widely regarded to mean the subject of the article is the primary subject of the coverage. That is exactly what <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says, for example, but only to make it clearer. Specifically, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does say that it must be <i>the</i> subject. In a newspaper piece about Lordi, the band is <i>the</i> subject of the article. It's possible for there to be more than one subject, I'll grant, but that is not the case in any coverage yet presented here. All the coverage has been nothing more than passing mentions of the song. And "a guideline" does not mean "something we can pretend doesn't exist". Notability is required, it is part of policy. See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_be_needed" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Problem articles where deletion may be needed</a>, non-notability is one of those things that requires deletion. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 12:08, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>An absolutely literal interpretation of that phrase in WP:N is nonsensical, as it would exclude almost all sources. If "<i>the primary</i> subject" is what is meant it should say so; I prefer to interpret it as "<i>a</i> subject". See my comments on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Blood_Red_Sandman_eb73.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Blood Red Sandman">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Blood Red Sandman</a>. Ultimately, I don't see the point in nit-picking over semantics on a page which isn't cast-iron policy anyway (and even policy pages are open to interpretation). The whole point of AfD discussion is to answer the question "Should this article be on Wikipedia" - it is fundamentally just a clash of opinions in a bid to achieve consensus. References to guideline pages may bolster arguments, but they are not arguments in and of themselves. <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 18:32, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> <s><b>Delete</b></s> The references cited by JulesH only make a passing reference to the song, and it is not a primary subject, so the article do not support notability for the song, only for the band, per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<li>But that is a criterion concerning bands. They would be notable from a top single. That doesn't mean that the single itself is so notable to have its own article. I've never questioned the notability of <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lordi.html" title="Lordi">Lordi</a> here, their chart success would establish that if so many articles didn't already. But the song still doesn't have sourcing for its own independent notability. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 09:15, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think it's pretty clear that AFD should be "about" deleting articles that don't need to be separate articles.

<ul>
<li>I disagree with your conclusion here. Many articles do not absolutely <i>need</i> to be separate articles, but there is still some intrinsic value in keeping them separate. A song article, for example, allows the addition of various categories and a Singles infobox which would otherwise clutter up a band or album article. As I said in one of your other AfDs, a reasonable stub article is fine - it doesn't have to be War and Peace. <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 18:32, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Blogs are not reliable sources for the purposes of notability. The tartareandesire link is not <i>about</i> the song, so it doesn't much help. The rockdetector link isn't <i>about</i> the song either. The metalspheres.de link is good, the language doesn't matter. This is one reliable source for notability.

<li>I disagree where it comes to blogs. As a general rule, yes they probably don't count. In the case of popular culture, however, particularly where 50% of the post deals with the single in question, I would argue that they are frequently the only source we have for a great many things. In the case of the average single in this day and age, the music press tend to concern themselves with the fact that it has been released, saving a review or whatever for the album, so the fact that this single has generated any publicity in and of itself seems to be a point in its favour. Obviously if there's a bit of policy I'm missing here, I'll be happy to be shown it. The tartareandesire link is included because it demonstrates that the song was a milestone for the band (first single release). Yes, it does this in a sentence and a half, but the point is that it does it. I'd argue that the first instance of something is probably going to be notable more often than not. Likewise, the rockdetector link (which I'll agree is probably the weakest of the bunch) is important because it explains that the song (despite being relatively old) is deemed sufficiently important to be on the American release of a new album. Yes, there's only one source there which talks about the song and nothing else (although there's another source which spends half its time doing the same thing), but what the other sources do is underline the importance of the song as well - the fact that they do so briefly is neither here nor there, when what they actually say is considered. If all they were were tracklistings, I'd agree with you entirely. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:23, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Again, I think we're only in subtle disagreement. I still maintain that the first single by a notable band is a notable event. The lack of coverage is due to the relative recent vintage of the band.

<li>Because you can't write an article from this. The point of gathering reliable sources is so that you can write a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> article. You can't write an article from raw data. "'Would You Love a Monsterman?' was a number 1 song in Finland" would be all the article could ever say. A stub that can never be expanded must be merged back into its parent article. If the song is notable enough to pass our notability requirements using multiple third party repliable sources, then that gives us sources to work from to write the article such that it will satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as well.

<li>A fair point in the abstract, however it slightly mis-states the situation. What we know about the song is the following: It is by a particular band, it is to be found on a particular album, it was released as a single (the first single the band ever released, as a matter of fact), it achieved a certain place in the Finnish charts and may well have achieved other placings elsewhere (my guess is that it didn't, but I didn't look particularly hard), it has a video which consists of various things occurring, it either will be or is on the American release of the band's latest album (I'm unclear whether the album's out in the States yet), and the lyrics are about certain things. Every single one of those things can be verified, and at least two of them (being the first single the band released and achieving the distinction of topping the charts) are pretty impressive achievements. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:49, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>That it's by Lordi and was on a particular album is already communicated by the article <a href="../../../g/e/t/Get_Heavy_0651.html" title="Get Heavy">Get Heavy</a>, that it was the single off that album can be communicated at that article and that it was the first single can be communicated at <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lordi.html" title="Lordi">Lordi</a>, all very trivially. No reason yet for a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wp%7Econtent_fork.html" title="Wp:content fork">wp:content fork</a>. That it reached a certain place on the charts seems better suited to the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lordi.html" title="Lordi">Lordi</a> article, since this is notability directly for the band, the video can be on the album page and it is already on the band page, still no reason to content fork.

All one needs is a copy of the lyrics to establish what the song's about. If the songwriter's been interviewed and has gone on record as saying there's a deeper meaning as well, then all the better, but not all songs have deeper meanings and neither do all songwriters say as much. I also think you're putting the cart before the horse on this one. Something must be verifiable in order to be notable, not the other way around. There's verifiability (whether you believe that the information is better positioned in the band's article or not, personally I think a number 1 single gets its own article), and from that verifiability comes notability. To use the old hackneyed analogy, I verifiably exist, but from that verifiability comes no notability (yet). A head of state, on the other hand, verifiably exists and from that verifiability comes his or her notability. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:17, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>If a songwriter has been interviewed and explained what the song was about, then that quote can be included. But art is way too subjective for us to be deciding that here. Wikipedia is not for artistic criticism, and deciding the meaning of lyrics is always original research. We would absolutely have to have reliable sources for that. Regarding your example of a head of state, why are they verifiable? Because much has been written about them. Why was so much written? Because they are notable. If something is notable, it will become verifiable, usually quite quickly. But anyway, it's not me who demands notability for verifiability. This is Wikipedia's stance: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Rationale_for_requiring_a_level_of_notability" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability#Rationale for requiring a level of notability</a> says "<i>In order to have a verifiable article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will have been researched, checked, and evaluated through publication in independent reliable sources.</i>" I don't think that's putting the cart before the horse at all, I think it's quite sensible. But you may disagree, so I'm just making clear that it's not a requirement that I made up. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 12:28, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>...art is way too subjective for us to be deciding that here. Wikipedia is not for artistic criticism, and deciding the meaning of lyrics is always original research</i>: No. Not always. There are two levels to any song or text that can be talked about. The first level is the simple question of "what do the lyrics say?" For that, all we need is a copy of them. The second level is the question of "what else might it all mean?" For that, we need interviews with the songwriter, academic analysis and whathaveyou. If we were talking about Bob Dylan or someone like that, I'd grant that we'd have problems in figuring out anything about it. As it is, we don't. It won't be as strong an analysis as it could be, but it'll be something. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 20:37, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>We can't just repeat the lyrics without breaking copyright law. The only way to bring the lyrics into this is to go under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, but to do that we need to subject the lyrics to critical analysis. Any critical analysis strong enough to support fair use would inevitably be a violation of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wp%7Eoriginal_research.html" title="Wp:original research">wp:original research</a> without reliable sources such as the band talking about the meaning of the song. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 22:57, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I didn't say we would just repeat the lyrics, did I? What we do is we link to them as an external link or a reference (depending on how picky people want to be with "fact" templates). Having done that, one can then write sentences such as "The lyrics deal with XYZ" with something approaching impunity. Without having the lyrics in front of me, I can't say what they're about, but it could potentially be that the lyrics are clearly full of references to "Beauty and the Beast" (they may not be, I'm just blue-skying here), in which case we can say as much. If Mr Lordi later goes on record as saying that the lyrics were inspired by his experiences being bullied at school, that's well and good, but the simplest and most basic level of "what the song is about" can be answered just by looking at the lyrics. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:24, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

AfD should not be a one-man show - we all have our views as to whether articles like this should be on the wiki, and all such opinions are equally valid (the more the merrier). Even if stubs <i>need</i> to be able to grow (something I don't necessarily agree with - many stub articles are valid and useful as they are) they do not need to grow <i>right now</i> - more sources may be found at a later date by someone who has read the article and wishes to expand it.

I thought that user should be apprised of this ahead of time. How is that incivil? Your point about stubs is a good one. They do need to be able to grow, but if there's a reasonable expectation that they will grow later, that would be a good argument for keeping them. I haven't seen indication that this is likely to grow, though.

<li>Given that the song was released in Finland in 2002 and may only have been released more widely in the last few months (and given that the band only achieved worldwide fame less than a year ago), is it possible that calling this "a stub that never grows" is slightly premature? There've been a lot of songs in history which flopped initially and later went on to bigger and better things. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:27, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see the point of starting an AfD DISCUSSION if you're not going to keep an open mind about the subject. It's an open discussion, and each and every viewpoint opposite of yours does not need to be responded to.

<li>I don't see the point of complaining like I've been eating babies here. It's an open discussion, which is why I'd prefer to give every replier the respect of taking their argument seriously enough to engage with. If I disagree, should I ignore them? Why? It's a discussion. It's worthwhile to ask for more input when someone hasn't answered the questions I've already put forward. What's not worthwhile, however, is to simply complain that I'm asking too many questions. As for an open mind, I think <i>this</i> song is halfway to being notable. It just needs one more source. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 22:57, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So Albanian Udi is a religion? Before assuming bad faith and accusing voters of things, please visit both articles I have cited, more particularly the one on Religions in Azerbaijan. The only reason this article talk about religion is because it was created by copypasting from another article. Its content word by word exist in another article, and its subject also has its own article. Albanian Udi and Udi people is the same thing. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 16:20, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>First of all, I am not accusing, I am guessing. Please, assume good faith yourself. I have read all the articles you had mentioned, but my point of view is different from yours. I don't see anything wrong in creating an aricle by copypasting from some part of another article, expecting that the new article will be expanded by someone.

<li><b>Keep</b> Of course it should be kept, as it shows very vauable historic and related information, has attracted attention from the famous Norwegian researcher Thor Heyerdahl, and the Udin people, as the keepers of the Caucasian Alban apostolic and autocephalous Church's heritage have been thanked by Pope John Paul II during his visit to Azerbaijan: "Praise to you, Christians, who have given so much, especially through the ancient Church of the Albans, in shaping the identity of this land." <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2002/may/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20020522_world-culture-azerbaijan_en.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2002/may/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20020522_world-culture-azerbaijan_en.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. Many more sources will be brought to this page in a few weeks, that will undoubtedly enrich this article. By the way, I've been to Kish village and have seen the Church both before and after its reconstruction by the Norwegian and British experts, and made several photos, which I can also upload and release copyright. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 18:20, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is a stupid comparaison sorry. Artsakh is a historic geographic place when Udi people and Albanian Udi are just synonimous. Artsakh and NK could be compared with Constantinople and Istanbul, while Udi-people and Albanian-Udi could be compared with 'Amenian people' and 'Armenians.' They're both a redirect of the same thing. Requesting keep just because Armenians happened to vote delete, without even bothering to understand the arguments amuses me, really. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 13:21, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Extremely hoax-like. Please consider that although the article seems well-edited and long full of data, it has only two links, one for an "official site" that is down, the other is for a highly speculative fanforum. It was created and edited by only one editor. IMDb has no results for it, nor has for the producer, creator or cast. And it has already a February 2009 DVD release date before filming and airing are set. Looks like a children joke <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi"><b><font face="Lucida handwriting" color="#78866B">Lajbi</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/a/j/User_talk%7ELajbi_4318.html" title="User talk:Lajbi"><b><font color="#C3B091">Holla @ me</font></b></a></sup> 01:32, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm almost embarrassed by this vote since I have some underlying issues with paranormal subjects being addressed seriously on Wikipedia, but my own POV aside this is a well cited article which I presume was split off from a main article on <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parapsychology.html" title="Parapsychology">parapsychology</a> for space. As such, it's logically laid out and strongly footnoted. It could use a strong re-write, it could benefit from a more objective tone in the introduction, it could certainly do a better job of introducing and discussing each subsection -- but all of that can be addressed by editors, no reason for AfD in my opinion. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 02:23, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

All ya gotta do is take out the soap! Lots of people (like myself) who don't know a lot about parapsychology are going to wonder what is so controversial about a lot of it, and what specific arguments have been made for or against it.

<li><b>Keep.</b> As I said on the talk page, the topic is a good one for an article but the chosen format needs to be changed as does the focus. i believe the editor who created the article is perfectly capable of reformatting it and changing the focus to the topics I outlined in my discussion on the talk page here: <a href="../../../c/r/i/Talk%7ECriticism_and_response_in_parapsychology_b373.html" title="Talk:Criticism and response in parapsychology">Talk:Criticism and response in parapsychology</a> - <a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisapollison_fe0d.html" title="User:Lisapollison">Lisapollison</a> 03:28, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> because it is a valid topic for an article. The <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parapsychology.html" title="Parapsychology">parapsychology</a> article should discuss the field of parapsychology itself with a summary of the criticism, but the criticism itself has a great deal of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> and source material of its own. It has its own history, its own key players, and so on. I strongly recommend a re-write, however, and a title change to <i>Criticism of parapsychology</i>. The re-write should change it from a criticism and response format, and soon, for several reasons. One, it really does seem like it's leading the reader towards one intepretation. Two, it suffers from stylistic problems where it looks like a forum, blog, or a collection of notes, and doesn't read like a fluid article. All of these things aren't a reason for deletion however. They're reasons for a re-write. That seems to be the general consensus thus far, even among the delete votes. The calls for delete (from what I read) are all based on style and content, not topic. The article itself shouldn't be deleted. --<b><a href="../../../n/e/a/User%7ENealparr_0e08.html" title="User:Nealparr"><span style="background:#000;color:#fff">~Nealparr~</span></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../n/e/a/User_talk%7ENealparr_39bc.html" title="User talk:Nealparr">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nealparr_5991.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nealparr">Contribs</a>)</sup> 05:03, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Markeer. Being badly written is not a reason to delete.

<li><b>Keep</b> While the style in which the article is written is not suitable for a Wikipage, and there are more than a few weasel words, the topic is notable, the pro-parapsychology text is accompanied by citations and is mostly evidently not WP:OR, and there is a good coverage of the issues at hand which is not POV pushing.

<li><b>Move to userspace</b> I can see that Martinphi put a lot of work into this article, and reading it I found it to be very interesting; but before I even looked at the talk page or this AFD I knew why it was up for deletion. It does not read like an encyclopedia article, but more like a college essay. It is a well written, well sourced essay, but an essay non-the-less. Don't get me wrong; I like this article. But I don't think it belongs on Wikipedia; certianly not in a criticism/response format. I'm suprised that no one arguing for the deletion of this article has yet pointed out the relevant page from the Manual of Style, the one that says that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EPro_%26_con_lists_a531.html" title="Wikipedia:Pro &amp; con lists">Pro &amp; con lists are considered harmful</a>. With that in mind, there is a lot of material here which could conceviably be used to craft a break-away article from the main <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parapsychology.html" title="Parapsychology">parapsychology</a> article, so I don't want to argue for blanket deletion. Rather I think the solution in this instance is to <b>userfy</b> it to Martinphi's userspace for a rewrite. It needs to be rewritten so it's not in a criticism-response format and so that it's less essay like and more encyclopedia like. ~ <i><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="color:#0cc">ONUnicorn</span></a></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup><small><a href="../../../p/%26/s/WP%7EP%26S_1d27.html" title="WP:P&amp;S">problem solving</a></small> 14:51, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep but cleanup</b> - Useful discussion and should be kept, but is very essayish, and the conclusion is POV. It needs work, but so do many other articles.

<li><b>Delete</b> and merge relevant criticism into main article. It's basically a list of "answers" to strawman arguments, a POV fork which violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a> and gives the impression that the critcism (which is made up of strawmen to begin with) has been decisively rebutted.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This article has some problems with conflation. There are 3 fields of Parapsychology: ESP, Telekinesis, and "ghosts". There are three things that are being criticized: whether parapsychology is a valid field of study, whether the results are valid, and whether the results prove anything. Following these divisions would help eliminate the "blog feeling" that a lot of deleters have noticed. It might also help this article come a little closer to the truth: some parasycholgists (mostly esp researchers) have used good methods, others clearly lack understanding of the scientific method (I saw some <a href="../../../e/v/p/EVP_694e.html" title="EVP">EVP</a> researchers on TV who were hilarious) -- Some "skeptics suffer from <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientism.html" title="Scientism">scientism</a> and are therefore easy strawmen, but there are some legitimate qualms some scientists have. The article also lacks a historical perspective which is a flaw that the main parapsychology article also has. It needs attention from an expert, but it is not OR nor is it really NPOV. It should prtobably be merged with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_skeptical_view_of_parapsychology.html" title="The skeptical view of parapsychology">The skeptical view of parapsychology</a>, Maybe some of the project Paranormal people can agree to help this article.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Markeer. This article is not a POV or Content Fork, it is instead a “spinout” article that falls under <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_fork_160a.html#Article_spinouts_-_.22Summary_style.22_articles" title="WP:POV fork">article spinouts, summary style</a>. The main parapsychology article is currently 42KB long and growing - larger than the Wikipedia recommended size of 32KB, the main body of prose is slightly smaller in size, but still in range for spinoffs. Criticism of parapsychology is a notable and relevant subject. I agree that the article needs a rewrite and should be renamed, but it should not be deleted. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> <small><a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreadlocke_6c29.html" title="User talk:Dreadlocke"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></a></small> 21:33, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>No-one has, I believe, argued that the topic 'criticism of parapsychology' is neither notable nor relevant. The main arguments against retention have been whether the article, as written, constitutes a valid, neutral article, or that it exists and has been formatted to be a <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apology.html" title="Apology">defence of a position</a>. Deletion does not preclude re-creation under the same or a different title; the issue is whether the article is valid now, and if not, it is salvageable in its current form. — <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBillC_aaf9.html" title="User talk:BillC">talk</a></sup> 00:21, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Note:</b> Thanks BillC, I guess my response wasn't clear in that regard. I do believe the article is salvageable and can be fixed in short order. The current contents are interesting, and I do not believe it is sufficiently "bad" enough to warrant deletion while being re-written. Until then, we can add the {{ActiveDiscuss}} tag to it. If we all put in as much effort there as we did here, it would be done already...&#160;:) I mentioned notability and relevancy because, first, they are a key focus in AfD discussions; and second, there seemed to me to be some question in a few of the above comments as to whether or not the subject needed its own article or was a sufficient topic to warrant an article - perhaps I was reading a bit too much between the lines. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> <small><a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreadlocke_6c29.html" title="User talk:Dreadlocke"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></a></small> 00:59, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

For example, the following statement would be acceptable in an article on Christianity: "Christians believe that Christ was ressurected." The following statement would not be: "Christ was ressurected." In the case of this article, the statements in it cannot be verified, but the statement "Christians believe that Christ was ressurected" can be. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 03:22, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I assure you, I am not trying to censor you at all. To quote from the primary <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guideline, and as such expand on my nomination, <i>"a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself"</i> (emphasis maintained). Christianity, Buddhism, and the like have been the subject of such works. As for the verifiability, it is one of the three core content policies, the other two being <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>, and writing from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. Additionally, the threshold for inclusion within Wikipedia (from <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>) is "<b>verifiability, not truth</b>" (emphasis maintained). That means since the material within the respective religion articles can be verified by editors using <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, the respective articles merit inclusion. Additionally, <a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> really sums it up. It's the verifiability of the content of the article, not the religion.

<dd>I think you may be missing the point. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a web space provider (there are plenty of free providers though). It has content standards that have been well explained, unless you can assert notability (more than existence) you can't have a page it is as simple as that. It has nothing to do with religion, Christianity et al get pages not because we believe they are fact, but because they are major religions with millions of followers and more importantly countless pieces of literature from which to source an article. No one is bigoted here, no one is trying to stop you from spreading your message, the only thing people are trying to do is insure the quality of Wikipedia, not looking at a particular page as you suggest we do is not a solution. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<dd>Great; then just as soon as Saxetism achieves such a history, it will undoubtedly be notable enough to include in Wikipedia4K.

<p>This research is original as i am writting a paper for my university on singles events and speed dating. you will note that i have also edited a couple of other pages on wiki in relation to the origins and legal complications of speed dating and singles events.</p>
<p>My research has led me to search through msn, yahoo and google the three major search engines on the internet all of which have confirmed that ticket4one is the largest online both in bandwidth / indexed pages and viewable members.</p>
<p>i have spent a lot of time researching this industry so far and have found no other website to contradict my research.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rocky4885 (<a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERocky4885_4f79.html" title="User talk:Rocky4885">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rocky4885_6bf4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rocky4885">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>ok so i have removed the title "largest in the world" to comprimise with wiki standards. However i have left the stats on the article for further researchers to establish their own conclusion.</p>

<p>Either way it may not be notable to you, But clearly the amount of members in the first nine months makes it notable for someone else.Compared to the numbers indicated for members in the social networking website list Dont you think&#160;?</p>
<p>As for it being a website "a non notable one" does that mean seeing as though you want to compare numbers that we should go and delete sites such as advogato, babbello, consumating, studybreakers,vietspace and zaadz from wikipedia&#160;?</p>
<p>After all the term " social networking site" is searched 50 -60 times greater then that of the term " Singles Events yet the memberships of these sites is as you like to put it "death"</p>

<dd>Well then I request that you read our <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> guideline (actually a policy, non-negotiable) and demonstrate how your website meets the notability requirements, using <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_Sources_f4fe.html" title="WP:Reliable Sources">WP:Reliable Sources</a>. Google hits are not reliable sources, and just for the record, 2280 google hits is a <i>very</i> small number anyway. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 07:17, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>for a start it is NOT my website. secondly it is not "2280 hits" they are press releaase/news articles.As i mentioned earlier to compare these results to our social networking list the following can be seen. ticket4one 2280 articles babbello 974 articles studybreakers 918 vietspace 1040</p>
<p>I believe 2280 is no longer a "very" small number when compared to other wikipedia content.</p>

Admittedly, it used to be higher - their traffic has dropped 43% in the last 3 months, according to Alexa. Basically, this is NO WAY the largest or most popular speed dating site.

<p>May i point out that the article does state " it may not have the highest amount of unique visitors.</p>
<p>In regards to 8minutedating, hurrydate, offlinespeeddating only one of these websites seems to have members profiles being hurrydate, To which anyone of you can compare the search results to ticket4one. It seems Ticket4one actually has approx 3 times the amount of members. (which is what the article is stating)</p>
<p>wow sounds like rocky4885 has rubbed some people the wrong way. or do you just have invested interests within that industry?</p>
<p>i have read <b>ALL</b> the facts submitted by rocky4885 " (which i strongly suggest some of you do) in discussion and talks all of which i cannot help but find the exact results to which this article proclaims are true.

<p>HPcruft, listcruft; unencyclopedaic. Yes, HP is a great company, but we don't need to list their products in microscopic detail.

<dd>Note that (a) As far as I can see, none of the above product pages asserts any notability (b) most of them read like copyvios of the HP website, which they may be (c) even those that aren't, are basically just statements of the technical specs of the printer (or scanner or camera or computer) and its present state of availability. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 06:27, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep the list, delete the others.</b> I read through some of the articles and agreed with the nominator's assessment. Then, for comparison, I wanted to see how competitors of HP had their products listed. Sure enough, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Canon_products_ea45.html" title="List of Canon products">List of Canon products</a> is long and full of cruft and redlinks, but it's not as bad as the HP list. Although inclusion is not an indicator of notability, I'm willing to keep the list itself, provided that the redlinks be cut down. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 07:46, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So where did the idea come from that we needed lists of <i>any</i> company's products? Isn't that what the company's website is for? <i>Notable</i> products is another matter, but how many of these products are actually significant in some way? Obviously, someone needs to AFD some of the Canon product articles as well. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:56, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> list, aggressively prune product articles. Not every company's products need a list, but HP is a major manufacturer with thousands of products, a fair number of which have articles. There's a basic utility argument here per <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>. As for the product articles, we don't need them on every model; that's like having articles like <i>Ford Taurus 2007½</i>. But we do have <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Taurus_17f2.html" title="Ford Taurus">Ford Taurus</a>, so why not <a href="../../../h/p/_/HP_LaserJet_e3f3.html" title="HP LaserJet">HP LaserJet</a>; and arguably even HP LaserJet II deserves its own as a standard-setting product that dominated corporate offices for roughly a decade . The DeskJet certainly deserves a family article, the ScanJet, though I'm less certain the others are individually notable products. The Pavilion is now a longstanding HP brand of PC. But yes, individual product editions down to four numbers is something we can never keep up with. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 09:32, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>None of these articles are about lines of products or make any attempt to discuss market impact, social/cultural value, etc. - they give the specs, what product it replaced, what toner it uses. I agree that an article on "HP LaserJet" would be notable... but none of these articles attempt to do that. If you look at HP Pavilion dv6000t, it is about only that particular model.--<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 12:55, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't see your objection? I offered up a "should be" state.

<ul>
<li>I was responding to the difference between "aggressive pruning" and "slay them all!" I don't think any of the ones that I AFDed contain much useful info towards the general articles that we both think would be useful. And I think that "aggressive pruning" is not something that a closing admin is going to adopt; they generally want a clearer directive. AND, the next comment below is someone who "seconded" your "pruning" comment - but they seem to have a bias towards retaining articles, not deleting them. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 05:37, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> pruned list, as per Dhartung. A product list or an article about a single product may be valuable if it contains not (just) the details given by the producer, but information about past products, products for different countries, criticism etc., as is partially the case for <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_menu_items_c7c2.html" title="McDonald's menu items">McDonald's menu items</a>. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 10:56, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I can't see any value in providing a list of a company's products. HP may be a large company, but that in itself does not warrant a list such as this <i><b><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChill_doubt_fb3d.html" title="User:Chill doubt"><span style="background:#008;color:#fff">•C<span style="background:#206">H<span style="background:#504">ILL<span style="background:#702">DO<span style="background:#a00">UBT•</span></span></span></span></span></a></b> 15:27, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</i></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> list and cleanup (e.g., replace redlinks with regular black-white text). Merge the individual product articles into <a href="../../../h/p/_/HP_LaserJet_e3f3.html" title="HP LaserJet">HP LaserJet</a>, <a href="../../../h/p/_/HP_DeskJet_5cc9.html" title="HP DeskJet">HP DeskJet</a>, etc. and then delete. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:12, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Cleanup</b> Keep the list. It's not a problem to list HP products, any more than it is to list Ford or General Motors ones. I do agree that most of the models don't warrant articles, but they should at least be redirects to the product line itself. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:20, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with people that articles on the various product lines might be good - company history, technological history, etc. Unfortunately, I don't think that merging, say, the five Officejet articles together will get you an Officejet overview - these articles are just sets of technical specs, basically. I still advise just throwing out all these "model" articles and starting over. For what it is worth, there already seems to be a <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laserjet.html" title="Laserjet">Laserjet</a> article; the other lines don't seem to have articles yet. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 18:52, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

But nobody's using this before the article creator made it, so a redirect is just going to sit around anyway. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 06:21, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You may be right about it not being specific to speed dating, but I bet people have searched for this before (hoping to find events in their areas or something silly like that). We could redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtship.html" title="Courtship">Courtship</a> instead (for some reason <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating.html" title="Dating">Dating</a> redirects there). --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 06:28, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Probably because it has a "commercial dating services" subsection. I'm not strongly against either redirect, but I still think it ought to be a redlink, to encourage some ambitious editor to come along and write a good singles' events article that would actually include the various phenomena, or at least a good dab page. But, hey, I could go either way on this. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 06:38, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Regardless of that, it does not qualify for speedy deletion under G4, since that is only for items deleted by an XFD process and the first nomination of this article was closed not by consensus but because the article had been deleted in a different way. So, will the ‘speedy delete’ people please refresh their memory of <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> and reconsider? —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 12:59, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article has changed completely since I nominated for AfD. My problem is still that there are no published sources... although the article is better than where we started (by a long shot), it's still essentially unverifiable by anything other than the blogosphere/interweb. Just because it's notable within the world of webcomic fanbase doesn't make it actually notable in the "big picture". /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 17:25, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The sources aren’t very good. Ideally, we would replace some. However, I think most of them actually pass the reliability test, even if only at its lowest setting. Since the article is about pop culture and not not astrophysics, the sources, weighted by their reliability, do, in my opinion, substantiate the article well enough to have it kept. (It goes without saying that the Websnark search page should be replaced by something more tangible and everything else should be cited properly, but that’s a style issue.) —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 20:39, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think you're confusing <i>primary</i> and <i>secondary</i> sources. Every source under the references section is a self-published webpage/blog/comicfansite (be it comixpedia, etc.). The strip itself may have been published in print, but this doesn't mean that these are sources discussing the strip (a <i>secondary</i> source). I'm not saying they don't exist, but right now the article is lacking anything but online citations (generally a no-no).

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> While I am no fan of webcomics and their lack of notability and worth in general, this one may need to be kept, and I will be fair in that regard. If this is to stay, then those familiar with it really should help better establish notability, and expand the article in that regard. The article mentions that it was the first series in a rater large website featuring webcomics - did the site expand rapidly because of this series's popularity? It is mentioned that this webcomic existed in print form - how many copies were printed, by whom, and how widely were they distributed? This may be one of the few notable webcomics, and thus, I am hesitant to condemn it without allowing a chance for certain ambiguities to be first cleared up. Should the needed facts fail to appear, my opinion will be that of a <b>solid delete</b>. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a> 02:19, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Jawa Pesisir Lor is not an ethnic group within Indonesia recognized by anyone except a bunch of Christian mission websites. Despite the claim by these sites that there are 18.6 million people in the ethnic group, there are no academic references at all mentioning this group and even no Indonesian websites.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I have personally met with someone while I was living in Java 95/96 who was either with the project or was thinking on <b>exactly the same line</b>. I believe the <b>project</b> needs an article ( I havent checked) because of the spread and many of the astonishing assumptions made by the project - but this particular article is a <i>construct</i> that has been made by the project needs to be incorporated into the project article - or an article about the projects assumptions about ethnic groupings in the indonesian region. I am impressed by the time and labour taken by editors above - but would only encourage deletion if I knew there was either an article about the Project - or at least the intention there - as this issues arising from the assumptions of the project need to be addressed somewhere or somehow in wikipedia <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatuSuro_ccea.html" title="User:SatuSuro">Satu</a><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">Suro</a> 09:26, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The Ethnologue entry for Javanese (<a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=jav" class="external free" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=jav" rel="nofollow">http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=jav</a>) lists a number of dialects, including one they call Pasisir. If there are academicly defined ethnic subgroups of Javanese, I would suggest that a subsection of the Javanese article would be the first place to add content, and then maybe a <i>single</i> article describing all subgroups in further detail if there is enough content to fill it. I think an article on the Joshua Project could be notable enough, though I'm not sure that going into the level of explaining each of their definitions is worth the effort.

<dd>A language dialect does not define an ethnic subgroup.

<li><b>Comment</b> - this is an Afd vote - parts of the conversation above are more suited at the Indonesia Project talk page!

<li><b>Comment</b>: Most of the comments here are correct. THis is a region not an ethnic group. <i>Lor</i> means north and <i>pasisir</i> is 'coast' in Javanese. This is a region NOT an ethnic group, and although there are indeed differences between the people of the central javanese interior and the north coast, they are ALL Javanese.

<dd>According to Wikitionary: "Censorship: the use of state or group power to control freedom of expression, such as passing laws to prevent media from being published or propagated." Not the case here. I removed a comment based on <i>my</i> right in an open source forum to do so, and based on my experiences with wikipedia and the cautionary use of the above template. Nothing more. You replaced your comment, which again is <i>your</i> right to do so. As the comment below points out, the template wording may have changed. I was reacting to what I thought was an unnecessary addition/comment to the template which seeks to remind all users that this isn't a poll. You see it a different way. That's fine, and I won't remove your comment this time around.

<dd>Thanks for your help, Andy but I doubt it is worth pursuing, and I don't want to keep any grudges or hard feelings.

<dd>I'm not trolling for another fight, but I thought you should get some support. Being right is better when you get some validation. Anyway, as an gesture promoting AGF, I've asked <b>chimneybrown</b> (Cbrown1023), the admin who deleted DTN over my objections, to look at this AfD with a view to closing it. It's turned into such a rout that the gesture has been somewhat devalued, but better late than never.

<dd>Thanks. Should be a keep unless an unreasonable admin does a drive-by delete. My first AfD was DTN, and an admin did just that: no explanation of why he thought there was a consensus, no cleanup of the dead links, no retention of history so that material could be merged... Left a bad taste, and me less willing to AGF in the face of evidence to the contrary. Hipocrite's nomination is typical of what he's been doing. No effort involved on his part, just involves everone else in a lot of wasted effort dealing with his messes. He's not the only one.

<dd>Since it seems we are now being encouraged to continue the argument here rather than simply demonstrate a consensus, let me address the RS question here. The people who claim that DHFC is not a reliable source (for itself, or anything else) have yet to provide even ONE instance where information on that site has proved to be unreliable or erroneous. They provide their sources and footnotes for all their information better than wikipedia does, and every statement they have made so far has indeed been corroborated as far as I know. Claiming it is "uncorroborated" etc. is a merely part of a non-neutral political ploy designed to tilt the balance of wikipedia in general over to one side. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 15:37, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My fault. I've relocated the template. I think this is the first AfD I've seen when it wasn't on the page, so <b>I</b> added it.

<p>Contested prod. Where to start with this one? Article is entirely unsourced, and makes huge amounts of hoax claims. Firstly the company has <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22alliance+wrestling+federation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22alliance+wrestling+federation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">19 unique Ghits</a>. There is an alleged TV show about to premiere, called Brute Force. A search for AWF Brute Force and Alliance Wrestling Federation Brute Force return <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22AWF+brute+force%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22AWF+brute+force%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">1 Ghit</a> and <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22alliance+wrestling+federation%22+%22brute+force%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22alliance+wrestling+federation%22+%22brute+force%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">2 Ghits</a> respectively. Apparently there's an annual pay-per-view each year as well, that I can find no details of. Apparently their shows attact a "usual attendance ranging from 6,000 to 10,000", which is about the same as the average <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wrestling_Entertainment_4940.html" title="World Wrestling Entertainment">WWE</a> show. Strange then I can find so little information about this promotion isn't it? There probably is a small independent promotion called Alliance Wrestling Federation, but it isn't the one described in the article.

<p>Advertising for a youth program.

<dd><b>Conditional keep</b> - I think there is potential for an article on this subject.

<li><b>OK</b> and why is this not a joint nomination? What are the fundamental differences between those lists that they might need to be treated differently? ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wasn't sure. I've done batches of AfDs before and no one ever suggested combining them, and I'm always afraid it'll get messy if some people have different opinions on different articles. Is there a rule of thumb on the practice? I'll make sure to do a joint nomination next time if that is preferred. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 09:02, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yeah if they're not just of the same <i>class</i> (obscure programming languages) but functionally identical and there is no apparent reason why they should be treated differently you're better off joint nominating. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 09:07, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> more because I can't really decide and one should err on the side of not making permanent decisions (such as deletion) lightly. Yes, the article in its current form fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for lack of citations of notability, but just a quick google search shows (on page 1) a <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902EEDE1438F937A15751C1A964948260" class="external text" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902EEDE1438F937A15751C1A964948260" rel="nofollow">New York Times profile on him</a> and an article on his most memorable event from <a href="http://www.ringsidereport.com/Smith452005.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ringsidereport.com/Smith452005.htm" rel="nofollow">a reputable boxing news website</a>. Keep in mind <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states "The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field." as a valid criteria. It seems from a quick glance that he had at least one particularly notable effect on the sport of boxing, distinguishing him in his field. Article needs more citations, but I say it should be given a chance. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 02:57, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> while the person could pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> the article does not include any references that could substantiate this, causing a problem with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> I will add the NY Times profile to the article, giving him as references 1)an obit and a 2) a2 paragraph article in the New York Times. Is that enough to satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>? The Ringsidereport website is about a fighter and only gives Curtis a 1 sentence passing reference. Not being a "primary subject" and not being substantial coverage, it does not support notability. As nominator I would still call it a weak delete. The obituary claims he was an inductee in the International Boxing Hall of Fame, but their website <a href="http://www.ibhof.com/ibhfrost.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ibhof.com/ibhfrost.htm" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> does not list him. Perhaps some other hall of fame? Are there more sources? Was he notable during his boxing career? Is he in boxing reference books? <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 19:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - the claim to have 1.6 million members constitutes an assertion of notability, but it needs to be backed up by reliable sources. More evidence of non-trivial independent coverage also needed (per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). I would vote Weak Delete, but the author deserves the chance to improve this article (per the comment above) and to add sources to verify the claims. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 11:31, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> unless reliable sources are provided to show how this meets our <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">criteria for notability of web sites</a>. The author's block has expired so he is able to improve the article. Note also this could be speedied under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>:G4 since it is reposted material previously deleted by an AfD. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 15:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Changed to <b>Keep</b> following Eedo Bee's sourcing of the article. It does need improvement but now meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 13:05, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> as the reasons for putting up for deletion were due to a misunderstanding of wikipedia policy, that is, if an article lacks sufficient reason to be notable, then it would require improvement. The article is of notability, both relevant and now up to date, make the article one that is of value to wikipedia and should be kept. While the article could do with a bit of work, I have since improved it and added many cources verfying its notability. <a href="../../../e/e/d/User%7EEedo_Bee_d006.html" title="User:Eedo Bee">Eedo Bee</a> 12:32, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>FYI, we do delete articles that are not notable, so the original nomination was quite proper and not a misunderstanding of policy. Thanks for finding the additional references that show the article's notability. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 13:07, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - external links clearly show notability. I do wish, however, that the article was expanded, and the external links used as footnotes, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 16:07, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Convention only started last year and had less than 500 people. With that, I seem to be able to determine that this convention is non-notable.&#160;:: <em><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Keigher_bca8.html" title="User:Colin Keigher">Colin Keigher</a></em> <font color="red"><b>(<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_Keigher_2a62.html" title="User talk:Colin Keigher">Talk</a>)</b></font> 08:08, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I haven't yet decided on this one. However, I do want to say that attendance figures aren't the sole measure of notability. Since this is the first and only convention in Scotland, it is notable. But the biggest problem I have with the article is lack of references to reliable third-party sources. If I do decide for delete, it would be for that reason alone. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 12:56, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Is there any established guideline for what counts as a "reliable" source for anime conventions? It's not like many of them are covered by the New York Times or anything, and most news outlets are amateur websites, especially in the UK. It's also rare that any established American news sites (like AnimeNewsNetwork.com, for instance) covers conventions on this side of the Atlantic. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAniki21_c4e4.html" title="User:Aniki21">aniki21</a> 15:14, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>While I am sympathetic to this issue, the fact that a given topic is so specialized or under-the-radar that third party sources are exceedingly difficult to find indicates that it should not be on wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Farix. There's a fair amount of info (more than a lot of cons) here. I don't think the lack of references alone is a reason to kill it off. If that were true, we'd have like 2 anime con articles left on Wikipedia. We just need people to start putting references in. It shouldn't be hard to find them, but it takes time. --<a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPDelahanty_5985.html" title="User:PDelahanty">PatrickD</a> 18:46, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>How about.. <i>Give deadline for more references, then delete if none</i>? I also agree with the idea that attendance shouldn't be the only thing we look at, but without references it becomes a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> issue. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 03:42, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. No references to establish notability. A quich search and the fact that none have been forthcoming in the year the article has existed leads me to believe there are none. However, I'm willing to change my opinion if proven wrong by the deadline of the the end of this AfD. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 15:11, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I utterly disagree with the nominator's suggestion that attendance is the only measure of notability for an anime convention. As the first anime convention in Scotland, Auchinawa is notable. The lack of references is an issue, but I don't believe it's reason for deletion on its own. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAniki21_c4e4.html" title="User:Aniki21">aniki21</a> 15:10, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Being the first Anime and J-Culture convention in Scotland, I also believe that this is notable. The references need updating and adding, but I feel I can have these done by the end of the day. Mystcb 15:41, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with the points raised above, attendance should not be a criteria used to define notability, especially with regards to conventions in the UK, where attendance is on average far below the likes of conventions across the Atlantic. Ninja Steve 18.21, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Whilst I agree that many serious games are indeed "made up in school one day", they don't get their articles here until they're widely played and well-documented in independent sources.

However, this discriminating criterion is quite broad. Tens or hundreds of thousands of people are murdered each year across the world.

<dd>Granted, it is an essay, which is why I said contributing factors, and not reasons. As you pointed out, murder is a fairly common way to die, and I believe that this renders the list, if not indiscriminate, an exercise in futility for proper maintenance.

<li><b>Keep</b> If changing <i>famous</i> to <i>notable</i>, the criterion for inclusion becomes perfectly objective: being the subject of an article in the Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> The point here is not entirely over the definition of "notable", it's over the entirely subjective and dubious judgment of who and who didn't "become famous only in death."

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<dd>I agree. That should be deleted or turned into a separate list (including, I assume, mostly writers, musicians, painters, etc.). Posthumous recongition for <i>achievements</i> is separate from notability gained to the <i>circumstances</i> of their death (e.g., unusual deaths, killed by a famous person, first person killed by etc.). I have deleted the section in question, would you agree to let the article remain and be cleaned up?

<dd>I'm still not totally convinced - I feel there's a better title even than one which replaces "famous" with "notable", and a couple of the remaining names still don't quite sit too well - but I'll have a closer look and see what I can see. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:01, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the title List of people who became notable only in death is somewhat problematic (and quite long). I'm thinking List of people notable for their death might be an alternative (it's two words shorter), but it may be less descriptive. I would appreciate your suggestions, if you have any. My feeling is that this information (cleaned up, of course) should be present on WP, but I'm just not sure how to incorporate it.

<dd>This is certainly the kind of thing which is very interesting and would be nice to have somewhere (particularly if "interesting" were the only criterion for inclusion here - a lot of those "Miscellany"-style books have lists like this). The suggested alternate title, though, doesn't fill me with great joy because not all the list does what it says on the tin. Those who are notable because of what happened to their corpse, for example, aren't really notable "for their death" so much as "for what happened next". There was an AfD ages ago for something like "List of Notable Deaths", which would be interesting as a comparative point, but I can't remember the title of the article to find it here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:41, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see your point. Perhaps "in death" is better after all. However, even if the title is not perfect, I think that as long as the introduction clearly spells out what the article is about, there should not be too much of a problem (or rather, there should, but it should be consigned to the article's talk page where multiple people can try to come up with a better title over time).

<p><b>keep</b> As one of the main editors of this list, but not it's originator, I found the list had potential but at the time I found it, it was totally pointless, subjective, &amp; filled with original research &amp; POV entries. I developed some guidelines to help make a "cutoff point" for fame to make it more objective &amp; also debated the word "in". The aspects which came out of it are:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Credentials for making the list were:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Lasting fame (must be dead by 3 years at least)</li>
<li>National or international fame (no local fame)</li>
<li>Victims are grouped if of the same event or chain of events</li>
<li>Reason for their lasting fame is noted with their entry<br /></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The debate over the word "in" is also in the discussion area. "In" could mean "because of" &amp; it could simply mean "in the state of", which covers both those who's means death was the reason for fame as well as those who were only posthumously famous.<br />
I had every itent of making this a meaningful list after coming upon it in it's horrible state. Those were attempts to put guides on it to make sure it was a useful &amp; consice list. I do think it has a meaningful purpose &amp; I found it because it partially filled the thing I was looking for. So please, this is not a list for deletion but cleanup &amp; refinement. Some greater objective criteria needs to be put up. The originator refused any attempts to write out criteria, but I really think it needs some. My proposed criteria are right there for scrutiny &amp; discussion. --<a href="../../../d/u/e/User%7EDuemellon_5403.html" title="User:Duemellon">Duemellon</a> 15:19, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

An organization around since the 1970s, with dozens or perhaps hundreds of local chapters, is obviously going to have citations, probably going back into the 1970s.</dd>
<dd>Now, finding these citations was time-consuming, but it was not difficult. You could have asked at <a href="../../../b/o/o/WP%7EBOOKS_edbc.html" title="WP:BOOKS">WP:BOOKS</a> for someone to look for sources; I'm sure someone there would have been able to help. This article has been tagged for a while, but it has had very few editors and wasn't on very many watchlists. So a trip to <a href="../../../b/o/o/WP%7EBOOKS_edbc.html" title="WP:BOOKS">WP:BOOKS</a> would have served well. It's not helpful to take articles directly to AFD when the subject has 61000 google hits. The citations are out there, and there could never have been any doubt that the article can be shown to be notable. But this five-day window to find sources is a <i><b>last resort</b></i>, not a first choice.

<dd><b>Comment</b> First, my apologies for not thinking of friends at <a href="../../../b/o/o/WP%7EBOOK_b369.html" title="WP:BOOK">WP:BOOK</a> as a stage in the journey. Second, there's already an article on <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Kite_Award_ded5.html" title="Golden Kite Award">Golden Kite Award</a>, and that's not the subject of this debate. Checking through Coelacan's links hasn't convinced me to change my mind yet. (Is the Remick article a reliable source?) <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 14:19, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's a reliable source unless you have reason to believe otherwise (e.g. she's lying, or she was paid by the SCBWI to write it). All the Golden Kite Award sources are both about the award and the organization, and demonstrate notability for both, imho. And since the University of North Dakota cite is probably the strongest cite here, what's your opinion on that one? —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 14:24, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sadly, I don't see a single sentence about SCBWI as the primary subject in that North Dakota link. And I don't believe that notability automatically flows both ways between a corporation/organization and a named award: my reading of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is that each named subject stands on its own. Meanwhile, the Remick article isn't that strong against <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Non-scholarly_sources" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and I think that's the most depth of published material we've seen so far. But I'm always trying to be open-minded and better sources would quickly convince me. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 16:31, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The North Dakota thing is a "<i>27th Annual Writers Conference in Children's Literature</i>", presented by the "<i>Society of Children's Book Writers &amp; Illustrators and the Department of English, UND</i>". That means the organization is notable enough that the department cosponsors an annual conference with them. It doesn't have to be the primary subject of the page; their notability is demonstrated by the collaboration itself. And I'm afraid you're completely wrong about the Golden Kite Award. The Award is notable <i>because the SCBWI presents it</i>. If the Award is notable <i>because of the SCBWI</i> then the SCBWI has to be notable to lend its notability to the Award. As for Remick, I wish you'd actually be specific about what you think the problem is. As I've demonstrated, she's independently published elsewhere (January Magazine for example), and the Writing-World site where this is published is independent of both her and SCBWI. It's not even indiscriminate free hosting, or something you can pay to have your article hosted on, Writing-World <i>paid Remick</i> for that piece, 5¢ per word, to be exact.<a href="http://www.writing-world.com/admin1/guidelines.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.writing-world.com/admin1/guidelines.shtml" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 23:11, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It doesn't matter how many times you challenge it. It doesn't matter how many people you dispute. It doesn't matter how many times you repeat your accusations. Denying the obvious doesn't make it any less obvious. Those two words have clearly defined factual meaning in printed dictionaries. When the words are combined, the meaning is clear in the referenced context of how they are used. It's like denying that 2.13 + 2.17 = 4.30 because you haven't seen the equation in print. Unless you can get the words "image" and "development" removed from every dictionary, It's your opinion versus common sense. <a href="../../../o/i/c/User%7EOicumayberight_a327.html" title="User:Oicumayberight">Oicumayberight</a> 19:49, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We have achieved some consensus: "Those two words have clearly defined factual meaning in printed dictionaries". I agree 100%. Any further 'explanation' of the words is obviously erronous in that it precludes the obvious meaning and narrows the definition. This makes the article entirely misleading and there's certainly no need to have an encyclopedia entry about it, unless of course, there is verifiable evidence to the contrary? --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavemon_bc43.html" title="User:Davemon">Davémon</a> 15:28, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are cleverly trying to make it like the article is defining the term. It's not. The sources define the term by using the term in context. Just because you expect to see it word-for-word as stated in the article, doesn't mean the article is the primary source of the term. The article does not narrow the definition, because the article is not defining it.

<dd>I don't know where it originated. The first time I saw it was back in 2000 on a poster for a creative advertising awards event. It showed symbols for each category. The "image development" symbol was a camera and a paintbrush. I wish I could remember the sponsor. I remembered the term because I was putting together a talk on art specialties and was conflicted about calling photographers "illustrators." I don't know if anyone has ever officially defined it in print word-for-word, seeing as how the meaning is obvious when used in context. The wikipedia is full of these umbrella terms and loosely defined terms. I don't see a problem with visual arts having a few. <a href="../../../o/i/c/User%7EOicumayberight_a327.html" title="User:Oicumayberight">Oicumayberight</a> 06:14, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Davemon, now you are trying to make it like everything anyone says on the wikipedia, including discussion pages, needs to be sourced. Wikipedia policy allows for people to have opinions. You seem to be stuck on the computer graphics aspect. Again, image development does not exclusively apply to computer graphics. <a href="../../../o/i/c/User%7EOicumayberight_a327.html" title="User:Oicumayberight">Oicumayberight</a> 22:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Simply offering opinions doesn't help progress a debate which is fundamentally about verification. As an aside, if image development isn't about computer graphics, then you must admit that the article is heavily skewed in that direction - and has mislead the anonymous user below. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavemon_bc43.html" title="User:Davemon">Davémon</a> 15:52, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> While browsing around Wikipedia in attempts to learn more about graphic design, desktop publishing, illustration, etc. various topics, I saw 'image development' and a link to this article more than just once or twice. I found it to be a useful and interesting article (I'm already aware of your 'notability is not subjective' point, no need to remind me), and it clarified my previous hunch on what it basically was (mostly stuff like computer graphics, photo editting, etc.). The way I see it, if I already thought subconsciously that 'image development' had to do primarily with a generalization of computer graphics rather than, say, development of images such as paintings or sketches and such, then the term must be used in that context enough for a general amount of people to view the term in that way. There is such a thing as slang terms and jargon, which Wikipedia holds a plethora of articles on, I can assure you (I like to look up slang terms and such that I find interesting here when bored, they've got much smaller-scale, less-widely-used term definition/articles than 'image development', trust me). I also found the article was a good generalizer so that I could find something that linked or referenced to various other related articles, which I, and probably others that are attempting to learn more on the various related subjects, was interested in. I find no 'good' reason to delete this article outright, and the reasons cited to delete it seem highly exaggerated or untrue, especially that last note, with '...doubtful, and not notable'. What do you mean by 'notable'? Many different sites, scraper sites or no, and articles in Wikipedia itself seem to find it notable enough to apply the terms in themselves and link to this 'unnotable identification of the word-pairing as a phrase'. At the very most, maybe a clean-up tag or something of the like, but full-on deletion is somewhat ungrounded and a tad on the ridiculous side. I've seen much worse articles that still have plenty of chance to be altered, merged, or improved rather than deleted outright.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>Hi, could you sign your comment please? I note this is the only edit to come from this users IP address. With regards to not notable - I mean that it hasn't been written about by reliable secondary sources, i.e. if you looked it up in a "Dictionary of Art" or a "Dictionary of Design" it would not appear - it simply doesn't have status as a term any more than 'sandwich making' does - it doesn't matter how many people use those two words together, if no reliable source has written <i>about</i> the use of the term, then it's not notable (i'm basing that on <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> - and am aware that whilst the words are not new - the idea that they carry a specific meaning is new). Scraper sites are just robot-sites that copy wikipedias content and add advertising to it - so don't help establish the terms use or notability. Secondly, your assumption about "image development" having to do with computer graphics isn't actually borne out by the references given in the article - 'image development' is generally used in it's broadest, most obvious sense - to mean anything to do with the process of making an image (there are examples of this misappropriation of references on the talk page, two of them specifically use the term with reference to sketching, painting etc.) - so your previous hunch wasn't clarified - so much as you have been mislead by this article. If it were to be cleaned up to reflect the reality of the use of the 'phrase' it would just be one line: See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Image.html" title="Image">image</a> <a href="../../../d/e/v/Development.html" title="Development">development</a>. As for a 'good' reason to delete it, nothing stated in the article is verifiable - it contravenes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>,<a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enot.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="Wp:not">Wp:not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary</a>, and it will not only mislead people as to the actual nature of the word-pairing but also lowers wikipedias standards as an encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavemon_bc43.html" title="User:Davemon">Davémon</a> 14:53, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article states why the term is used and contrasts it from corporate image development. According to Davemon logic, there doesn't need to be an article for any term that includes more than one word if the words are individually defined. So Davemon must not think terms like "computer science" and "graphic design" need articles as well. <a href="../../../o/i/c/User%7EOicumayberight_a327.html" title="User:Oicumayberight">Oicumayberight</a> 22:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Of course, but he's also established himself as an artist in his own right with a significant recording career.

<p>Tagged for speedy on the righteous grounds that it is completely and utterly opinionated and POV. Is it wirth rewriting? Doesn't look it to me. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:09, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Delete</b>. I admit I was a bit hasty with the Speedy tag, but as you say, it's not worth re-writing. It's not an article with a few POV bits, instead it appears that the majority of text on the article is POV-orientated. ≈ <b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Haunted_Angel_31d7.html" title="User:The Haunted Angel"><font color="Indigo">The Haunted Angel</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Haunted_Angel_42d1.html" title="User talk:The Haunted Angel">The Forest Whispers My Name</a>)</sup> 14:39, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it can be re-written. I presented the facts on Purvis' life briefly and the facts on the Hamwi murder and its results. If it sounds amateurish, make it professional.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could change the article to THE HAMWI MURDERS or something. I based the article on the book THE WRONG MAN: A TRUE STORY by Kevin Davis, a non-fiction book documenting the Susan Hamwi-Shane Hamwi murders. It is unfortunate that Johnny Purvis was merely coerced into a confession by threatening police officers when there was no evidence of his being on the scene of the crime. I think it miraculous that they caught the real killers, when they discovered that Paul Hamwi had paid $14,000 to Robert Wayne Beckett and Paul Serio to kill his ex-wife to get out of paying child support. I don't think the article should be taken down. I think it just needs someone to present it more professionally.Corey Bryant 20:16, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The point of view of the article, that John Gordon Purvis was unjustly convicted, appears to be correct. "The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person." Being written about in the New York Times is a strong hint that somebody might be notable. -- <a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 21:19, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The NY Times article and the federal appeals court case cited as well as the book cited indicate he was innocent, his mental condition made it easy to obtain a bogus confession, he was convicted despite exonerating evidence withheld from the defense, and he was imprisoned for 9 years of a life sentence. What is in the article that is POV, given the facts? If the facts are referred to in words that seem pov, well, Wikipedia is the encyclopedia that "anyone can edit," <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFIXIT_9fe7.html" title="WP:SOFIXIT">WP:SOFIXIT</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Case is notable. And interesting. Article is loaded with subjective, "fictional" style, which is possibly why it was mistaken for POV throughout by some members. There are enough factual sources to enable thorough re-write in appropriate objective register.

<p>Contested prod. My prod rationale was "<i>Wikipedia is not a dictionary. In any case, no sign that this term is in wide use so should be deleted per WP:NEO.</i>" The tag was removed with the explanation "21000" Google hits which, of course, is true but only because "meshback" is a common description of baseball caps. However the definition used in this article is not in common use. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 13:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Contested prod. No notability, no verification. This article basically describes a religious organization (or an anti-religious organization) and its philosophy.

<li><b>Merge</b>. There are zero sources outside of the show, which, per the nom, fails to establish any sort of notability outside of it.

<li><b>Merge</b> She appears in neither of the lists in the nomination, which is just weird. She isn't in the major character list, yet the other one treats her as major. Since I know nothing about this topic, I don't know which list she belongs in. But with no evidence of individual notability from independent sources about her, at this time the article should not exist on a stand alone basis. And that lack of evidence is an argument that the major list is probably incorrect. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:31, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm somewhat neutral on this article. On the one hand, the <i>fictional</i> elements of the character appear to be properly referenced with episode footnotes (so an editor can just watch that episode or look up other plot information elsewhere to verify the info). However, one could also argue that per WP:NOT#IINFO, articles should not include <i>only</i> plot summary information, but should also have some real world context and analysis. It's not clear that this article meets that standard, since the entire thing appears to be a summary of the various plot elements involving this character.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The question of whether or not a plot-element-only character article is "encyclopedic" by WP:NOT and WP:FICT standards would seem to me to be a fairly broad question covering virtually any article about fictional characters on Wikipedia. So it might make more sense to bring it up as a topic on the talk pages for those policies/guidelines, and perhaps look at a way of maybe clarifying the language of WP:FICT regarding plot-element only character summaries. For my part, I could go either way, so long as character articles are handled somewhat consistently. Just some thoughts to consider while deciding what to do with Mrs. Puff's article. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:26, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, and to reply to Peace's specific comments at the top of the afd, I'll mention that <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)</a> specifically says, in <b>bold</b> print, that "<b>Wikipedia is an out-of-universe source, and all articles about fiction and elements of fiction should take an out-of-universe perspective.</b>" It goes on to explain the differences between in-universe and out-of-universe perspective, and that out-of-universe perspective includes things like critical reception, sales figures, real world factors influencing the design, and "a summary of the plot or elements of character and exposition, <i>treated briefly</i>, and clearly defined as fictional." This could be taken as further indication that while a fictional character article can include plot elements, it should also include information that isn't taken directly from the plots. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:33, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b>.

In this case, there's no reliable secondary sources to show what kind of impact Mrs. Puff has had outside of the SpongeBob series, so she fails the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> notability guidelines. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">(<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">walk</a>)</font> 00:38, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. This article has always bugged me a bit. IIRC, it was created as an autobiography. I'm pretty sure Evertype has admitted to this and claimed ignorance of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> at the time of creation...but I'm a little doubtful, given the number of red WP links with the same (or higher) level of notability, that it would have been created otherwise. That said, it's been around since 2004 and deleting it now seems pointlessly punitive. Notability has been established, and he correctly points out that he is allowed to correct factual errors in his own entry. <a href="../../../d/p/p/User%7EDppowell_6cfb.html" title="User:Dppowell">Dppowell</a> 18:40, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> Some of the sources cited are not independent or reliable, but there seem to be several among them which do add up to multiple reliable independent sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> Michael Everson is certainly very well known as a major behind-the-scenes driving force in the world of computer character sets. I have heard about him many years before I have heard about Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Unicode_Standard_5506.html" title="The Unicode Standard">The Unicode Standard</a> lists him as one of the principal authors. Compared to that, it is rather irrelevant how often a New York Times journalist has interviewed him so far. His celebrity status among the users of <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8859-14_b1ef.html" title="ISO 8859-14">ISO 8859-14</a> and the many other character-set related standards that he fathered is mostly limited by the fact that the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Organization_for_Standardization_b57e.html" title="International Organization for Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> sadly keeps the authorship of its standards a rather well-guarded secret. Notability to a notable specialist community should be perfectly adequate to justify inclusion in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkus_Kuhn_4bd1.html" title="User:Markus Kuhn">Markus Kuhn</a> 08:57, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep but edit</b>: The article could get a good edit, like citing sources for the various claims in the article like him being a Buddhist, living in Lecanvet, becoming a neutralized Irish citizen in 2000, Tengwar and Cirth being under consideration by Unicode, Everson Mono being the third Unicode-encoded font that contains many characters (what does that mean, really?), etc, etc. There are also so many links on the page, which I think is much higher than Wikipedia's other pages. This can be reduced perhaps by listing scripts already in Unicode that Michael has not worked on! <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoozbeh_5649.html" title="User:Roozbeh">roozbeh</a> 11:01, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It might be more appropriate to simply start over when or if anyone actually wants to work on such an article. This article has existed in essentially this form since July 2006, and no one has cleaned it up. I don't want to bother, do you? If no one is going to work on it, it's better that it just be deleted. Someone who actually wants to write such an article in the future would probably not want to bother starting from this draft anyway. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 23:28, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are tons of articles in bad shape that haven't been touched in forever; however, poor (or sometimes downright awful) writing is not a basis for deletion - just look in <a href="../../../a/l/l/Category%7EAll_pages_needing_to_be_wikified_fc1c.html" title="Category:All pages needing to be wikified">Category:All pages needing to be wikified</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/e/Category%7ECleanup_by_month_e71f.html" title="Category:Cleanup by month">Category:Cleanup by month</a>. If there are any POV problems with the article, etc., I can't see how hard they would be to remove (and it appears the {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_1e7d.html" title="Template:POV">POV</a>}} tag was never applied to the article). I won't lose sleep if this article is deleted, but that should only be done if it fails to meet the content policies and guidelines. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 00:36, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I don't think there are serious POV problems with the article. The problem is notability and verifiability. A lot of these women don't seem to have Wikipedia articles. Are they notable? I don't know, because there't no reliable sources in the article. It reads like a bunch of original research. I don't know if any of this happened, and without evidence of notability, I don't even know if the reader should care. There's a strong possibility of spam, too, since the one external link has been here since the beginning. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 02:59, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This might be a case where it would be cleaner to just nuke this mess and let anyone who wishes to create something coherent start fresh (preferably with a new name like List of Canadian fashion models).

<li><b>Keep</b> - Most of the IRA biogs that have been added recently are not very notable in my opinion. This chap, however, is. One reason for this is that he was a member of both the PIRA and the <a href="../../../i/n/l/INLA_887e.html" title="INLA">INLA</a> while also working for the RUC Special Branch. When he becamea supergrass his testimony was used to convict a large number of republicans. His paramilitary career is therefore a notable, though minor part of the history of the Troubles. Perhaps more importantly, he has written a book about his time as a republican paramilitary, "Dead Ground -Infiltrating the IRA", (Warner Books 1998 ISBN 075152615)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dead-Ground-Infiltrating-Raymond-Gilmour/dp/0751526215" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Dead-Ground-Infiltrating-Raymond-Gilmour/dp/0751526215" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>. A google search for him <a href="http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=raymond+gilmore+ira&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=raymond+gilmore+ira&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=raymond+gilmore+ira&amp;meta=</a> throws up a very large number of hits for this reason.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Excuse me, but what exactly is not objective here? The Diplock Courts were special anti-terrorist courts with no juries. Under the supergrass scheme, the only evidence was the testimony of the informer. For this reason, most of the cases brought before it were thrown out by Lord Lowry, who did not find the witnessses to be credible. Where is the bias in what I wrote? Please explain. I edited this article in good faith and resent the allegationof bias. Gilmour is notable, aside from his role in the supergrass trials, because he is the subject of a high selling book and numerous newspaper articles. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a> article here <a href="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/theatre/features/article13312.ece" class="external autonumber" title="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/theatre/features/article13312.ece" rel="nofollow">[66]</a></dd>

<dd>I'm not sure what you think I have retracted, but I stand by all my comments above.

<li>Hey, don't over-sauce the dinner: <i>One would have to be delusional not to note Bass vast accomplishments</i>... Whatever Bass has done, "vast accomplishments" is putting it way too strongly for your own case. Furthermore, leave out the dangling slur, <i>unscrupulous editors</i>. I don't much care one way or the other whether Pinky remains a Wikipedia article, but your tone has put me off enough that I would like to vote <i>delete</i>, especially as the article is quite wretched at the moment.

She has had one solo exhibition. Has it verifiably generated critical comment? Has there been a single book of her work? Despite working in a populous, affluent English-speaking nation and thus having a great advantage in the (admittedly often absurd or repellent) struggle for recognition, Bass doesn't appear in the long index of the capacious <i>Oxford Companion to the Photograph.</i> (She's also not mentioned in any other photography book in which I looked her up.)

<li><b>Still wondering</b>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Notability (people)</a> tells us that notable photographers are those who "received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work". I don't see multiple independent reviews, and I see no awards other than those of two grants: no award of a kind that is, or might reasonably be, included in <a href="../../../p/h/o/Category%7EPhotography_awards_b75e.html" title="Category:Photography awards">Category:Photography awards</a> or similar. This guideline continues: "This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted." I wholeheartedly agree with this: without it, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Rossier_1b23.html" title="Pierre Rossier">Pierre Rossier</a> and many other articles would be wrongly deleted. However, Rossier (like many others) has obvious alternative notability, and I have trouble seeing this in Bass. She's mentioned in some books, occasional photos by her appear in some books, she teaches. The only possible plus is that her work has, we are told, been exhibited (by itself? within group shows?) in some prestigious places. However, there seems to be no evidence provided for most of these exhibitions. She verifiably (<a href="http://www.montevallo.edu/art/artgallery.shtm" class="external text" title="http://www.montevallo.edu/art/artgallery.shtm" rel="nofollow">link</a>) had a solo exhibition at a university. Fine, but the university I went to had/has a little exhibition space that (perhaps unjustly) was/is largely ignored by the outside world and indeed by the huge majority of the university's own staff and students: I wouldn't take an exhibition there as proof of notability and until I see external reviews of the Montevallo show I wonder about that too. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Comment: Bass is also listed in the <a href="http://www.womeninphotography.org/bookarchive/booksa-c.html" class="external text" title="http://www.womeninphotography.org/bookarchive/booksa-c.html" rel="nofollow">Women in Photography, International Archive</a> now housed at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>. also for those who would like to know more before weighing in on Bass work please read the article after I have updated numerous sources. It is important to realize that photographers, as a general rule, are exhibited in more group shows more than say painters or printmakers. Please consider the achievements of Bass when casting a vote. How many other photographers on WP have far fewer achievements and still have posted articles? <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">Artsojourner</a> 16:44, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> This article is really poor. The alleged notability of Bass is all very thin and the primary author only makes it worse by repeatedly trying to puff up her qualifications. For example, the honor of being named a "Georgia Women in the Visual Arts" is a title that the Ga. legislature bestowed on at least 150 other women that year. Its great that she made the list, but we can't hardly have articles on each of those people, so it doesn't make her notable. The same holds true of these exhibits that she has been included in -- she was one of many artists so included. A second example is the <a href="http://www.womeninphotography.org/bookarchive/booksa-c.html" class="external text" title="http://www.womeninphotography.org/bookarchive/booksa-c.html" rel="nofollow">Women in Photography, International Archive</a> listing (which we are thoughtfully told is "now housed at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>"). Bass has a one line reference to a 24 page catalog of an exhibit. <a href="../../../i/m/o/Imogen_Cunningham_b52f.html" title="Imogen Cunningham">Imogen Cunningham</a> has 13 listings, many of which are major books about her. This article is so full of this puffed up information that on more than one occasion I tried to edit it down to its provable, notable points to see what we have. I was harshly accused of "hacking up" the article, but my point then and now is that including a phone book's worth of information tells the reader nothing. These laundry list articles merely leads a discriminating reader to wonder why all this unnecessary information is listed. Have a look at a truly notable photographer's article -- Cartier-Bresson or Edward Weston -- and you will not find a listing for every group exhibit in which the photographer was included. Now look at this article's reference or external link list -- most of these references contain a single line for Bass out of a much larger publication. And now <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">Artsojourner</a> makes his last chance argument that many other photographers listed on Wiki are less notable -- please list these articles and we can start an AfD process on them. No, this article does not demonstrate Bass's notability and should be deleted. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMindsEye_e83c.html" title="User:TheMindsEye">TheMindsEye</a> 04:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. TheMindsEye is in places undeservedly harsh, I think: most photographers who rightly get an article in WP aren't as notable/celebrated as Cartier-Bresson or (grandpa) Weston. (Only half a dozen or so could be.) Better to compare Bass with less celebrated but yet deservedly respected north American photographers as different from each other as, say, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Polidori_b480.html" title="Robert Polidori">Robert Polidori</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Owens_%28photographer%29_2178.html" title="Bill Owens (photographer)">Bill Owens</a> (neither of whom has half as good an article as he deserves, incidentally). It's here that we see how weak Bass's claim to notability is. And I fear that TheMindsEye is right: the article on Bass has recently suffered from an infusion of ho-hum material. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:34, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weighing in</b> Seeing that I pulled this article together, how many Southern Women photographers are as notable as Bass? Maybe just a handfull. Editors please make your decision based on the relative facts as anything else here is not useful. When I was asked for more information to try to win over support for this article I felt compelled to find what I could find not necessarily weighing it against what is already there nor did I try to <i>puff it up</i>. I stated what I thought to be correct information to the best of my knowledge and I have never vandalized an article by including misrepresentation or by deleting whole areas from someone elses articles for any reason. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">Artsojourner</a> 08:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>That's a tough one: being neither in nor from north America, I tend to confuse Canadians and Youessians, let alone northerners and southerners within the US. (I'm also not well up on very recent US photography, as a lot of what I've glanced at is "me" and "my friends" stuff that doesn't interest me.) <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally_Mann_30ef.html" title="Sally Mann">Sally Mann</a>? <a href="../../../e/u/d/Eudora_Welty_46b3.html" title="Eudora Welty">Eudora Welty</a>? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 10:11, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, the list is based on wrestlers who have signed "legends contracts" which basically means they can appear on WWE programming whenever they want and action figures of them are made. But, there is no source. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 15:32, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> <i>if</i></s> <b>Delete</b> <i>unless</i> a source for this can be found. Since there's hard-and-fast criteria to get on this list (signing a "legends" contract), it's not "indiscriminate". All of these wrestlers are notable and indeed legends in the business. However, all this is true only if there's a source, and I couldn't find one. I did find the <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_Hall_of_Fame_2e32.html" title="WWE Hall of Fame">WWE Hall of Fame</a>, but that already has an article. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 16:02, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I disagree, and I'd love to debate it, but I'm not going to yet because we do agree on one thing: It's unsourced. If it gets a verifiable source, then I'll make my case, but until it does, it can't be kept and I support deletion. With no source the criteria is entirely subjective.

<p>At least 1/4 (if not more) of the list are not verifiably signed to "legend contracts", which is an actual thing and the basis for the defense of this article, except that the list has no basis in reality and can be just as easily covered in the <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_Hall_of_Fame_2e32.html" title="WWE Hall of Fame">WWE Hall of Fame</a> article.

<dd>For those unfamiliar with hockey, <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Gretzky_af9c.html" title="Wayne Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> was dubbed "The Great One", which prompted many to speculate about who would be "The Next One". This is what makes the article more legit than "The Next Michael Jordan". Just to solidify the connection between Gretzky's nickname and "The Next One", here are two sources which mention the link:</dd>

<li>So you think you can turn those links into an article? Has anyone written <i>about</i> the "The Next One" phenomenon, rather than just apply it to the one or other player? ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:23, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It could at the very least be a short disambig page- The Next One is certainly a nickname that has been applied to several players. It is <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sourcable</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, and not as minor a piece of fan trivia as people would think. I don't know how easy it would be to find sources on the <i>history</i> of the term (which would flesh it out in terms of an article), but like I've mentioned, it is a nickname that has been applied to several players already and would be a fairly useful disambig page at the very least. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 17:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry for the overkill, but I feel like nobody's even bothering to read the sources I'm posting here. These are national/international major sources from sports journalists, regular journalists, NHL affiliates, etc. It's a common nickname attributed to several players, so it should at least have a dab page. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 23:06, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Wafulz, though I disagree with simply leaving this as a dab page. The obsession with finding a "Next One" has a lot of history in hockey, and I believe a decent article can be written about it, especially given the numerous sources listed here. It is a reasonably significant piece of <a href="../../../i/c/e/Category%7EIce_hockey_lore_f31f.html" title="Category:Ice hockey lore">hockey lore</a>. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 07:38, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I could see this becoming a large and very informative article... I am suprised it is not already. For the past 15-20 years, this has been a huge issue in professional hockey.... Gretzky (The Great One), Lemieux (The Magnificent One), Nolan, Sundin, Daigle, Falloon, Lindros, Ovechkin, Malkin, Crosby... every draft, every year... the list goes on... <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 07:46, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As said above, nobody has ever really used it as a nickname, it's been at best a temporary designation (unlike The Great One, Le Magnifique, etc). Otherwise, this article would have to include every sourcable instance of a hockey writer throwing "The Next One" out there. Zipster 20:51, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, strongly</b>. This article is a useful observation of a social phenomenon. The very fact that this nickname exists gives insight into Gretsky's importance; and the passing of the nickname on to people of differing skills, whose careers have played out in different ways, is not only a story in and of itself, but adds to the Gretsky mystique. Hockey aficionados know the term, know the meaning, and have read or heard it numerous times (others above have provided more than sufficient references for this).<br />
<br />
Additionally, I personally believe a resource such as Wikipedia should philosophically be inclined to err on the side of inclusion in situations like this. Links exist leading to it, contributors have listed supporting references, and while to some it may seem trivial, others obviously find it useful. To delete this article, despite demonstrated references and accuracy, would be an arbitrary standard that flies in the face of Wikipedia's policy to respect other contributors.<br />
<br />
Removing the "suggested for deletion" notice would probably encourage more people to expand it, who otherwise might be nervous that their efforts would be wasted.--alexfiles 18:57, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The cited source is an excellent example of why wikipedia demands multiple sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> I was initially going to say "delete", but after further consideration, I think this article describes a notable cultural phenomenon created as a direct result of a major historical event. It was covered by <a href="../../../n/p/r/NPR_8c1a.html" title="NPR">NPR</a> and other news outlets.

<li><b>Keep</b> most especially DiscNW, it is not a team, but one of the model regional organizations in Ultimate. Also keep Seattle Sockeye, Furious George and Eugene Darkstar as they are men's teams playing at the highest level of Ultimate in the USA. The others I'll go a weak keep on.

It looks like their biggest achievement was "7th in the UK's Indoor Nationals", and "a host of Trophies from various competitive events over the years."

<li><b>Keep</b> These teams compete in the highest possible level of Ultimate -- the UPA National Championships (alright, except for Fingers 6, I don't know anything about them). Riot, Sockeye, and Furious George have won many of the championships this last decade, and Brown won 2 years ago in College nats.

<li><b>STRONG Speedy Keep</b>, close debate and <s><b>block nominator</b></s>. A clear example of a bad-faith nomination, judging by the nominator's obvious unfamiliarity with <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and implied unwillingness to bother learning. I have nominated many articles for deletion ... I wouldn't have created this one to begin with if I wasn't incredibly familiar with WP:WEB, and the meaning of "multiple non-trivial news coverage." I included references to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> <i>for precisely that reason</i>.
<p>That some people seem to be embarrassed that this made the Main Page shows that we need better deletionists than what we've been getting lately. As recently as six months ago this nomination would have been laughed off AfD.</p>
<p>As for merging it, <i>no</i>. Unless you want to merge <i>everything else</i> in this vein, like <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Feiss_b080.html" title="Ellen Feiss">Ellen Feiss</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus_Uncle_3dc3.html" title="Bus Uncle">Bus Uncle</a>, and even <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonelygirl15.html" title="Lonelygirl15">lonelygirl15</a> back into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Internet_phenomena_9aec.html" title="List of Internet phenomena">List of Internet phenomena</a>, which is long enough as it is. I found enough out there doing research to justify a stand-alone article and created it. It passed newpage patrol, which is where most of the real cruft gets deleted (believe me, I know). I'm really dismayed (can you tell?) that I have to go here and take the time to restate what should be obvious to anyone who knows policy reasonably well.

<dd>Personal attacks are not appreciated. I do happen to be familiar with the web notability guidelines, and there may indeed be a way of twisting the (disputed) wording to count random youtube videos as notable... But that doesn't mean the article should exist. It's a youtube video. Not even a real one at that. There are many millions of youtube videos. Should there be an article on every one that gets a mention in the press? Should we include all advertisements, youtube, TV, radio, etc as well? It's just another random video, that no one will even remember a week from now.</dd>
<dd>My personal solution would be a "List of notable internet viral advertisements" or similar, where things like this can have a one-paragraph summary and some analysis (effects, aftermath, etc). As to the other articles you list, <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Feiss_b080.html" title="Ellen Feiss">Ellen Feiss</a> is a bonafide actor with appearances in a french short film and televised commercials, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bus_Uncle_c6bf.html" title="The Bus Uncle">The Bus Uncle</a> was an actual event (and not a pr stunt) involving a criminal act resulting in long-term effects, social changes, and so forth, and even <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonelygirl15.html" title="Lonelygirl15">Lonelygirl15</a> is a series of videos, corresponding websites and blogs, a commercial entity, profitable game, the actor appearing in other productions, and so forth. This isn't any of that. It's some random faked video that a couple news outlets mentioned, with no bearing on reality.</dd>
<dd>I generally count myself as an inclusionest... I don't even mind the 27 trillion or so imaginary pokemon creature pages. But giving youtube videos their own pages is too far. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBushytails_47fe.html" title="User:Bushytails">Bushytails</a> 04:07, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ahh, so it's still a categorical matter. If I read you right, the article should be deleted not because it isn't a notable subject, but because YouTube videos shouldn't have their own articles. I tend to agree that things that have never received news coverage, such as that wedding party doing the dance from Michael Jackson's "<a href="../../../t/h/r/Thriller_%28music_video%29.html" title="Thriller (music video)">Thriller</a>"<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmYbP0F4Zw" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmYbP0F4Zw" rel="nofollow">[81]</a> will never merit their own articles despite widespread linkage.
<p>But it isn't <i>just</i> a YouTube video; it was part of a marketing campaign. And even before it was revealed as such, it was the subject of a good deal of news coverage devoted specifically to it. I don't know how you can argue, based on existing policy, that that <i>doesn't</i> merit a separate article. Based on the amount of information out there, I don't see how a list could hold all these things. Eventually, if this becomes common (which I'm not sure it will), this will still have been one of the first.</p>
<p>You might want to consider also that the <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Feiss_b080.html" title="Ellen Feiss">Ellen Feiss</a> article was created long before her appearance in the short film (short film? What's the difference between that and a video?) and that the commercials she has appeared in are what made her notable enough for inclusion and a separate article. That <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonelygirl15.html" title="Lonelygirl15">lonelygirl15</a> was originally <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lonelygirl15_9cc1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lonelygirl15">deleted</a>, restored after deletion review and then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lonelygirl15_%28second_nomination%29_bfa8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lonelygirl15 (second nomination)">speedy kept</a>.</p>
<p>What of that favorite of everybody who sees their vanity article going down in flames here, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_kid_473a.html" title="Star Wars kid">Star Wars kid</a>? <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Ghyslain_Raza_8a94.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Ghyslain Raza">Twice</a> nominated for deletion, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Star_Wars_kid_b56b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Star Wars kid">twice</a> kept.</p>
<p>A "couple" of news outlets here includes Canada's major newspaper (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Globe_and_Mail_a135.html" title="The Globe and Mail">The Globe and Mail</a></i>) and TV networks, coverage echoed south of the border (I would leave it to Canadian editors to point out that, had the video been filmed in the U.S. by Americans and first covered by <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a></i>, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation). Your use of disparaging terms that do not accord with the facts but suggest an emotional reaction to the subject of the article ("random faked video") again is contraindicative to your pleas that this nomination is based on a thorough understanding of Wikipedia policy.</p>
<p>Forgotten after a week? Sounds more like a hope on your part to me. One could have said that about all the other Internet phenomena. And even if the public <i>does</i> forget about them after a week, that doesn't change any notability the subject may have earned through news coverage.</p>
<p>Personal attacks? I apologize for the tone of my remarks, but I would consider that, had a new editor created this article, the way you have phrased your arguments for its deletion and counterarguments to me arguably would open you up to charges of violating <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 08:07, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't say no youtube videos should have articles... just not ones with no lasting effects or other notable characteristics. Nor does being in the news (canadian, american, or otherwise) make something encyclopedia-worthy... Should every cat fetched from a tree by the fire department have an article, since it was reported in the odds-and-ends section of a few newspapers? Being part of a marketing campaign _really_ doesn't make something encyclopedia-worthy... an article for every advertising campaign would be absurd, would it not? And just because an article doesn't blatantly violate policy doesn't automatically merit its inclusion ("... the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept.") As to having too much information to put in a list-article... most of that information is really not needed. Hell, more than half the article is just a blow-by-blow description of the video! <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBushytails_47fe.html" title="User:Bushytails">Bushytails</a> 09:11, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How do you know this won't have lasting effects? It could launch one of the actress's careers. And I think it will certainly be discussed anytime and anywhere viral video marketing comes up. It will have an effect on that field, to be sure. In any event, the future's possible lack of interest is not a reason to delete, or we'd be without a lot of <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-hit_wonder.html" title="One-hit wonder">one-hit wonders</a>.
<p>You confuse major and minor news coverage. No, every cat rescued from a tree is not notable. But my argument was not that this was covered <i>per se</i>, but that this received serious coverage from <i>major</i> newspapers and TV networks. (See how I applied this distinction from the opposite position <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Brain_Trauma_ed27.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brain Trauma">here</a>. I'm quite aware of that difference; I wouldn't have created the article if I weren't.</p>
<p>Yes, there's too much info for a list article. I have that synopsis in there because it's essentially a short film (see the categories), so I followed part of the <a href="../../../f/i/l/WP%7EFILM_df1c.html" title="WP:FILM">WP:FILM</a> template, which includes a synopsis and character list.</p>
<p>I also think it's just better having separate articles than a list ... <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Internet_phenomena_9aec.html" title="List of Internet phenomena">List of Internet phenomena</a> pretty much covers that already, and list articles, as such, have softer boundaries. Believe me, they require someone pay constant attention to them and rigorously evaluate new submissions to keep them from getting crufty (the best require that any new submission be discussed on the talk page first). I think it would be too likely to get bogged down with marginal cases (if you produce a series of viral videos to promote your garage sale, should they be on that list? Probably not, unless they get lots of eyeballs). If you have separate articles, it makes it harder to try to pick up some notability by adding it to a list here.</p>
<p>I also think it likely that such a list would be vulnerable to spamming by anons trying to get their videos legitimized. More headache for a maintainer.</p>
<p>In the area of detail, you might also take a look at <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus_Uncle_3dc3.html" title="Bus Uncle">Bus Uncle</a> having a full transcript of the video (to me, completely unnecessary), which is much more detailed than that synopsis I wrote. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 05:09, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I didn't <i>demand</i> the nominator be blocked; it's just a suggestion and one I now withdraw. Still, I think that if something has been effectively researched by an editor willing to take the time to do it, passed newpage patrol and been accepted for DYK, it has already been vetted properly and reasonable deletion arguments are moot. I cannot help but suspect that someone had an emotional reaction to the idea of this being linked from the Main Page purely because of the subject and chose this as a way of retaliating <i>à la</i> <a href="../../../k/a/d/KaDee_Strickland_6255.html" title="KaDee Strickland">KaDee Strickland</a>'s turn as the Main Page featured article ... I see many similarities between the tone, if not the arguments, of those arguing for deletion here and the people who <a href="../../../k/a/d/Talk%7EKaDee_Strickland_613e.html" title="Talk:KaDee Strickland">got mad</a> about it being on the Main Page, then tried to <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_removal_candidates_KaDee_Strickland_7adf.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article removal candidates/KaDee Strickland">tried to defeature it</a> for purely emotional reasons (that article's creator, too, followed existing policy and procedures and seems to have been punished for it).
<p>I argue for its retention on the grounds that existing <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> standards, as quite a few other voters correctly note, could not justify its deletion. As I so often say when the shoe's on the other foot, a deletion discussion is <i>not</i> the place to argue for a change in policy, anymore than you'd use a traffic trial to argue for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>If the nominator <i>does</i> want to seriously consider what sort of notability standards we should apply to individual video clips, I would happily set up such a policy proposal page if he withdrew the nomination. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 08:07, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

(I, having done both, have a different impression. I have gone through many a log page of fifty new pages or edits and found the most delete- or revertable have already been dealt with (although it's important when doing both to go completely through the list no matter how little work you find to do. That's when stuff gets away).

<dd>I would think that getting a seven-digit hit figure at YouTube would count as an achievement (and how does one, exactly, accomplish an achievement? But I digress).

<dl>
<dd>What was the historical significance of Ellen Feiss? Does the article document how many more people bought Macs because of her saying "Beepbeepbeepbeepbeep"? Does it need to? I'm missing something here. It was just an unintentionally funny ad that a lot of people remembered, which is why there's an article on her and her subsequent doings of note.
<p>And when <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_kid_473a.html" title="Star Wars kid">Star Wars kid</a> was kept, his parents hadn't filed suit against the school and there weren't yet a million parodies to document in established media.</p>

<dd>If a month from now, this video is shown to have had some effect on the planet, it may be worthy of inclusion...
<dl>
<dd>If "some effect on the planet" (and what, exactly, does that mean, anyway). were the standard for keeping articles, we'd have a very small Wikipedia. What about all those fictional characters and webcomics? I don't think they've got much "impact on the planet", but we've kept quite a few.
<p>And why bother recreating the article a month from now? Why not just keep it now and delete it later if it "doesn't have an impact on the planet" (Perhaps it will raise the average temperature a tenth of a degree?)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I'm all for any encyclopedia-worthy article being on the main page... it's not about the main page, it's about whether this should have its own article at all. Perhaps as your next project, you should condense the article's content into one or two paragraphs (deleting the huge plot summary would almost get it there), and start a "List of internet viral advertisements" page? This article would appear to be notable enough for a mention on a list, and the list would certainly be DYK-worthy if written well...

We should not necessarily be deleting every single article just based on this. Attempts should be made to save some useful information and genuine work.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I was really in doubt when I created this article, and hence I'm not going to discuss whether it should be deleted or not. I am not the owner of the Church of Google page, nor have I any affiliations with the page, I just stumbled across it and it seemed to me that it was mentioned and linked to from many places. It also had a lot of hits when searching for the string on Google. I would also like to say that I did not know that the page had been deleted before and it is therefore not a repost.<font color="green"><b>Snailwalker |</b></font> <b><a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnailwalker_86d1.html" title="User talk:Snailwalker">talk</a></b> 11:24, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> to The Clutter family murders. The individuals listed were portrayed in at least 2 major motion pictures, and were discussed at length in a best selling book. Their deaths were not the product of simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time, but were the result of a long-formed plan, or perhaps a long term plan gone awry. Exclusive of Wikipedia and "In Cold Blood," individual family members get over 1000 Google hits. This was a notorious mass murder of the 1950's and was written up in Time magazine<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,825964-1,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,825964-1,00.html" rel="nofollow">In Cold Blood. Monday, Nov. 30, 1959 (The book got its title from this).</a> and the national press, so the articles could be expanded. I could support a merge to The Clutter family murders since their common fate is the basis of their notability, and the articles would be very similar.<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 22:44, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

The IMC considers them notable enough to list in their regular reports (they give reports about every three months, I believe). They have been mentioned in every IMC report since February of 2006, which is just about a year now. The group emerged from the Continuity IRA, but are distinct, and thus should not be kept within the CIRA article. The modern Irish Defence Forces started out as the original <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republican_Army_c60e.html" title="Irish Republican Army">Irish Republican Army</a>, but so did all of the modern terrorist organizations. Should we just group the IDF with the Provisionals in the same article, simply because they evolved from the same group if you go back far enough? No. That would be asinine. This is how new IRA groups are started, and we have articles on most of them. <b>As for changing the name:</b> You can go ahead and try to convince the group that they need to change their name, but as it stands, this is the only name we have to refer to them by. Every IRA group to ever exist has claimed the name of Oglaigh ne hEireann at one point or another, as well as the IDF.

However, the IMC reports are reliable enough sources. The group's activities appear to include assault and robbery, but their notability is asserted by the statement that the group had made and planted IEDs, and referenced by the IMC. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 06:56, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article was nominated for deletion in July 2006 (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Simtropolis_aec9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Simtropolis">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Simtropolis</a>). The verdict was no consensus, despite all bar 2 of the keeps being from first time visitors to Wikipedia. I believe that nowadays we actually do require an article to assert why it is notable (this does <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">not</a>), to contain multiple independant reliable sources to back that up (this does <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">not</a>).

<dd>I can understand a need to improve this article, possibly adjusting the format and style to better conform to Wiki guidelines (the addition of citations is very much desired). Deletion, however, would be an extreme and unnecessary action. The content seems quite valid. That being said, I believe this article would be much more practical if put into context. Simply merge it with <a href="../../../s/i/m/SimCity4_6b1a.html" title="SimCity4">SimCity4</a>. <a href="../../../k/u/g/User%7EKugelmass_9651.html" title="User:Kugelmass">Kugelmass</a> 23:39, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did not realize that a merge was previously discussed. As someone who has never played SimCity 4, I found the Simtropolis content very supportive and pertinent to the subject. Where can I find an archived discussion page? Among other things, I am very curious as to why it was not deleted during the previous nomination. <a href="../../../k/u/g/User%7EKugelmass_9651.html" title="User:Kugelmass">Kugelmass</a> 01:04, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: The existing form of the article is certainly not in optimal form and needs pruning and rewriting. On the other hand, I reverted an edit that overrode the entire article content with a mere redirect to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush.html" title="Rush">Rush</a>: there is too much content here to simply throw away, either.

<li>(1) Preemptively, but if it was unnecessary and proves irrelevant, so much the better. (2) From the prior talkpage discussion, my understanding is that the current content of Rush in popular culture was taken <i>out</i> of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_%28band%29.html" title="Rush (band)">Rush (band)</a> as the result of a discussion on featured article review, and I didn't see any indication that any of it was reinserted when you changed the former article into a redirect.

Circumventing Merge intent with a second AfD Nom by the same editor. Contradicting PhilWelch is that during the Rush page's FA review, it was the recommendation to split the Popular Culture into it's own page, and this was done<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rush_in_popular_culture#Question" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rush_in_popular_culture#Question" rel="nofollow">[99]</a>.

<li>The website didn't take it from Wikipedia. The "in popular culture" used Power Windows as a reference from the point the list really began. Besides, even if it was, that further strengthens the reason to delete, because there would be <i>no reliable sources</i>. Not to metion Power Windows isn't technically a reliable source to begin with.

Furthermore, the Power Windows site has been operational since 1997, as Phil has explained above.

<li>I think it needs to be made clear that we cannot "merge" this information without merging the entire thing. Otherwise, we'd be inviting POV. Let's remember that most Movie and band featured articles don't have long lists of "in popular culture" sections. There is a whole fan site devoted to that; we make a cite, and we provide the link. That's our job. That's it. I don't see how a few points can be merged, because then the issue is...what points to merge, and how do we prevent people from including more or their own OR? I'm no deletionist, I lawywer the "preserve the edit history", I'm a mergist to the core, and even I see no way to merge this information logically, based on how Wikipedia is now. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 00:04, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have looked far and wide for additional non-trival cites to no avail. I also now have a better understanding of SourceForge and see that it is self-authenticating. I even download the app-- it seems to have good potential, but sadly that does not help verify the article. I personally find deleting the work of other users distasteful so I won't argue for "delete" but need to withdraw my "keep." I wish <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikinerd2000_f4aa.html" title="User:Wikinerd2000">user:Wikinerd2000</a> the best and I'm sure he will do great things. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 02:45, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
