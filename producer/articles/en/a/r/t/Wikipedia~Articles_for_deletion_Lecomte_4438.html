<li><b>Keep</b> Merely playing Major League baseball or NFL football is sufficient to have an article. The Olympics represent a similar level of notability for many lesser-known sports.

<li>Coming in 8th in an archery event at the Olympics in 2004 would give a person a claim to being the 8th-best archer in the world. Coming in 8th in an archery event at the Olympics in 1900 meant that he was the 8th-best archer who happened to be at the Paris World's Fair that day. The <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900_Summer_Olympics_98eb.html" title="1900 Summer Olympics">1900 Summer Olympics</a> were not contested at the same level of competition as contemporary Olympics, as suggested by the fact that contemporary sportswriters failed to keep track of the subject's given name.

<li><b>Keep</b> all Olympians. Participation in the Olympic Games is certainly sufficient for notability. As for the "fact that contemporary sportswriters failed to keep track of the subject's given name", please note that all Olympic Reports until 1964 similarly "failed". As for having every Olympian, please check <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECompetitors_at_the_1896_Summer_Olympics_2624.html" title="Category:Competitors at the 1896 Summer Olympics">Category:Competitors at the 1896 Summer Olympics</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The official Olympic reports included athletes' first names well before 1964; see <a href="http://www.aafla.org/5va/reports_frmst.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aafla.org/5va/reports_frmst.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for examples. Note that the 1960 Summer Olympics report devoted over 200 pages to a list of every athlete participating in the Games, including their full names, dates of birth, places of birth, heights, and weights, none of which are known in the case of <a href="../../../l/e/c/Lecomte.html" title="Lecomte">Lecomte</a>. Furthermore, even if an athlete's full name had not been printed in the official report, his or her full name would be known if they had accomplished something of merit -- it's not as though sports historians are wondering, "I wonder who this <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Ewry_b5e2.html" title="Ray Ewry">Ewry</a> is, who won 3 gold medals at Paris 1900?" They <i>know</i> who <i>he</i> is. I guess I'm much in the minority here, but I do not think that merely competing in the 1900 Olympics is an accomplishment comparable to competing in the contemporary Olympics in the 21st century, since the idea of having to qualify for one's national team was a minor aspect or nonexistent in 1900. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:51, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: per. Jonel. That's why I qualified my earlier delete vote - I didn't know if there was an include-all precedent like in other sports.

<li><b>Keep</b> After myself proposing this for deletion I have investigated further, and replaced what must be the spurious mention of Beaudoin in article by Lecomte, which leaves it making sense (I have also rewritten the text). The article originally made no sense, asserting nothing whatsoever about Lecomte. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPol098_88b3.html" title="User:Pol098">Pol098</a> 16:31, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm not certain at this moment if I would support the blanket statement that all Olympic athletes are notable. However, I certainly support the idea that being an Olympian should change the burden of proof. Instead of having to demonstrate his worthiness to include him in the WP, we should have to demonstrate his lack of worthiness to keep him out of the WP. He's an Olympian and there's no compelling reason not to include him. -- <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_Sowell_3ef6.html" title="User:Don Sowell">Don Sowell</a> 20:09, 23 February 2006 (UTC)
