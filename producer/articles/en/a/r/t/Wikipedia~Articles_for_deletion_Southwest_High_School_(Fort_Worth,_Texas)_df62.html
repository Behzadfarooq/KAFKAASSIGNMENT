<dd>Strongly, emphatically agree with Soltak. What are we here for, if not to make a better encyclopedia? Getting rid of content that doesn't belong here is exactly that sort of work.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. OK, I'll answer that. For things like schools and churches notability doesn't arise simply from existence. If every school were "notable" this would have the practical effect of depriving the word of meaning when talking of schools: we would have the equation "school = notable school". Rather, notability for schools is like notability for people: we think they are notable when they do something which marks them out from their peers. For schools we might regard them as notable if they consistently educate their pupils to a high level of excellence in Latin, say, or if they meet a special need. A school is not notable simply because it teaches: all schools do that, so it's rather like eating or breathing for a person. Notability arises when a school outperforms ( or, sadly, underperforms ) in its tasks. For example, we have an article on <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_College_8864.html" title="Eton College">Eton College</a> because, somehow, it's managed to educate an enormous number of successful UK politicians: it does something different, though it's not clear what the "magic ingredient" is. Similarly, we have an article on <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvey_Milk_School_6210.html" title="Harvey Milk School">Harvey Milk School</a> because the school is providing something that virtually no other school is doing. As it happens, I have reservations about the wisdom of the Harvey Milk School approach to education, but I strongly feel we should be documenting their work, and I strongly support retention of its article here. But for Southwest High there is no evidence that the school is doing something unique: it's not doing anything special that marks it out. There's no evidence of sustained academic excellence, nor does it appear to be winning notable awards for its educational policy on a consistent basis. It isn't meeting a need for special educational facilities for a minority group, and although it may be a good school it is pretty much just another normal school. Giving it a Wikipedia entry is like giving an entry to the ordinary guy you see every day: he's a good, honest guy, and he works hard, but he's just like the rest of us. Southwest High is a good, honest school, working hard to educate its students, but it's just like most other schools. Show us something unique and interesting about a school that has relevance outside its local community, and I'll gladly advocate retention: in the past I've advocated retention of school articles for reasons that have varied from <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birendra_Sainik_Awasiya_Mahavidyalaya_a4ad.html" title="Birendra Sainik Awasiya Mahavidyalaya">being the only military school in its country</a> to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herndon_Elementary_School_368a.html" title="Herndon Elementary School">entering into a unique business partnership with a federal agency</a>. Notability, it seems to me, arises from doing something different that people might want to know about, not simply from existence. I hope this helps explain the opinion I express below. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 16:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well-stated, but not quite right, I think. Although it is true that "notability does not arise merely from existance," the general notability criteria at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> make it perfectly clear that the subject of an article need not be exceptional or extraordinary. excellent or abysmal. Schools don't have to do something unique or admirable or different, although they are, of course, all different in sufficient detail to result in the publication of official government reports and published news stories about their activities and their performance, This is all that is needed to make them "notable" per WP:Notability.

Thus, the primary notability criterion is a way to determine whether "the world" has judged a topic to be notable. This is unrelated to whether a Wikipedia editor personally finds the subject remarkable or worthy."</dd>

<dd>Since there is no consensus guideline on school notability, it seems to me that many of the efforts to delete school articles are contrary to policy, since they are based on subjective personal opinions about what should not be in Wikipedia that go beyond accepted consensus. There is no arguing taste (even if people do it all of the time). If the deletion-inclined want to prevail, it seems that their discussion should be at {WP:N]], where they could try to build a consensus that to achieve "Notability" in general, any subject must be exceptional and interesting. Finally, regarding "interesting:" I do not think that every article here should have to be able to catch the interest of any user who drops in and presses the random article button. Most of the users of this project are not idlers trying to becomed enlightened by Wiki-browsing—they are looking for something specific. It is much more important that anybody who drops in to look up something specific finds something useful. Preferably something that is thorough,NPOV, and verifiable.--<a href="../../../h/j/a/User%7EHjal_95ba.html" title="User:Hjal">Hjal</a> 01:06, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The only way to reach a consensus here would be for everybody to just give up. There have been one or two previous thoughtful posts to the effect that the participants in all of these discussions didn't appear to be heading toward a consensus on what does or does not make schools notable, and the only possible resolution was for the deletionists to accept that all schools (more or less, with a few exceptions) belong in the project, while the school inclusionists should agree to work on developing guidance (probably at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools</a>) about what makes an acceptable school stub and what doesn't. I think that this is the only solution.</dd>

<dd>We should all also accept that a new school article should not go to AfD unless it has first been prodded and ignored for months or tagged for CfD, if appropriate, and subsequently challenged. If every farm boy that made it to the major leagues for a week in the 1930s is automatically notable; if every English football team playing at a level I never heard of is notable; if every company included in a stock index is notable, then every school is notable (or darn close).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All of the school AfDs that I've participated in or looked at have resulted in a keep or in no censensus and keep by default if anybody from <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> participated seriously. The few high schools that have been deleted recently were not only candidates for good articles, some of them were notable by the strictest interpretation. Look at the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Windward_High_School_1938.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Windward High School">AfD for Windward High School</a> and then look at <a href="http://www.windwardhigh.org/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.windwardhigh.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">its website</a> for five minutes--it looks like one of most innovative and interesting new high schools in the country, but a dozen people who made no effort to research the school and one administrator sent the article to the void.</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is the only test that a high school or other public school article should have to pass, and almost every school could have a good article written about it that meets that policy, just as they could meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.

<ul>
<li>Every school is the subject of numerous publications by reliable sources. Every school. The information may not be available online, but it was published and it's out there. Public schools are planned and built following, in almost every case, multiple public meetings and formal public hearings; for teh past 40 years, most require significant environmental review and documentation; most are the subject of a bond election; many are conroversial, with local disputes by NIMBY neighbors and remote parents, struggles within the district or City for funding, dusputes with state education departments over designs and budgets, and hiring of the first and subsequent principals; followed by bond issues and parcel taxes to replace derelict buildings; sports dynasties and football coaches fired for incompetence; extraordinary teachers and pedophiles; and, however derided because of their universality, the mandatory reports required in the UK, California, and almost everyplace else are, in fact, not just verifiable and, generally, reliable, they are evidence of the "notability" of schools in the eyes of the whole community. These are not just "records," like a utility bill or a traffic ticket; they are complex, expensive, sometimes comprehensive, "reports." That we mandate them, pay for them, and dedicate scarce staff resources to them demonstrate the significance that society places on the differences between schools, their faculties, their facilities, and the success of their students.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Almost every "notable" person went to school. Their schools get listed in their biographies (almost every serious biography about a modern person discusses their education). A blue link to their schools makes it easier for editors to write good articles about people, without having to do separate lookups about the person's schools themselves. It makes it a better article for subsequent readers, who can decide whether they want to know more about the subject's educational abckground or not.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Almost every city and many CDPs have schools, and the rest are in one or more school districts or individual school attendance areas. Having school articles to link to allows the settlement's educational system to be discussed in summary or in a few bullets, with detailed information in the appropriate district or school articles. And, yes, localities provide a good place to list useful information about schools that have not attracted an editor willing to start a serious article about them. In either case, coverage of local schools makes for a better locality article, while links to separate school articles keep articles about small towns from being overloaded with school information.</li>

<dd>I realize my discussion is specific to the U.S, in some ways, but I'm sure that similar arguments apply in most other countries. I also realize that many school articles are subject to constant vandalism, but it is usually fixed easily and without getting trapped in endless revert wars. I realize that the opponents of school articles are sincere in their belief that Wikipedia should include only "notable" schools (by which they usually seem to mean "extraordinary" schools), but I know that they are wrong. Jimbo has spoken on this issue, and even though it was not <i><a href="../../../e/x/_/Ex_cathedra.html" title="Ex cathedra">ex cathedra</a>,</i> I know that he was right.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, this specific article is not even a very good stub. However, it has only been up for two weeks, the information included is useful to interested people, if not interesting to general browsers, and it is not contaminated with POV or vandalism. Make it better or leave it alone. I'm too tired to bring it up to start class tonight and I'm taking my first grader on a field trip tomorrow moring. Why don't some of you go fix it up a little?--<a href="../../../h/j/a/User%7EHjal_95ba.html" title="User:Hjal">Hjal</a> 09:44, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>WP:SCHOOL is not the only notability criterion that applies to schools. The general <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> will do just fine. To say that all discussions about the notability of schools should default to keep just because the specific notability policy is in flux is <i>ludicrous</i>. And don't pretend like AfD's don't result in the deletion of bad school articles all the time. North Side High School (Fort Worth, Texas) is heading there right now. Nothing is automatically notable, and schools are no exception. Unless valid sources can be presented, the school should go.
