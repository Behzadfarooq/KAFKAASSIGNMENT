<p>Tiny fringe political party with no national notability. Fielded less than the 50 candidates required to receive a national <a href="../../../p/a/r/Party_political_broadcast.html" title="Party political broadcast">party political broadcast</a> in the 1997 General Election, therefore their political activities must be classed as local rather than national and thus failing notability requirements for organisations as I cannot find any reliable third party sources to verify the article. It should also be noted that of the 10,829 votes they won in the 1997 election, 4,181 of these were for <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bromwich_West_d463.html#Election_results" title="West Bromwich West">West Bromwich West</a> which was the constituency of the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons_0fba.html" title="Speaker of the British House of Commons">Speaker</a> and not contested by the major opposition parties. Political activity since then seems to have been minimal.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, the entire organisation has precisely 2 members and contested a few seats in one election with negligible success. Allowing this to remain is basically allowing them to buy a Wikipedia page, in the same way they bought their candidacy. Not enough to give them a platform on WP. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 15:28, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - verifiable, won over 10,000 votes in 1997. The fact that it has only two members now is irrelevant -- Wikipedia has lots of articles about both major and minor parties that no longer exist at all. Wikipedia would not be improved by deleting this information. Wikipedia also has articles about local parties, such as Independent Kidderminster Health Concern or whatever they're called, that would not meet your "national" criterion. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 16:25, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>(EC) I believe the Kidderminster group hold a seat in the UK Parliament, and have been the subject of many non-trivial media reports in reliable published sources. Winning an arbitrary amount of votes, which constitute a tiny fraction of votes cast, with almost half coming in a constituency uncontested by the major parties does not equal notability. If the Sunday Times report could be verified, and other information also sourced this would be a far more acceptable article. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 16:41, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Strong keep</b> They exist and can be in no way described as a 'local'!! Their influnece within the extreme-right and neo-Nazi fringes of UK politics is well-demonstrated in the article and their members have overlapped with other, perhaps better-known parties. The returns to the Electoral Commission said two members, but remember that such reports are very new and have caused some upset to fringe groups - I would not place much reliance on this. In any case, whatever the strength of the party now, it has recent historical significance and the article succeeds in demonstarting this and shows the links between organsations and individuals. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 18:10, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'll use the text from the Wikipedia guidelines for Notability for organisations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28organizations%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28organizations%29" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> to expand upon my points:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Criteria for organizations</b>
<ol>
<li>Organizations are usually notable if the scope of activities are national or international in scale and information can be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verified</a> by a third party source.
<ul>
<li>Individual chapters of national and international organizations are usually not notable enough to&#160;:warrant a separate article unless sufficient notability is established through reliable and verifiable sources. However, chapter information is welcome for inclusion into wikipedia in list articles as long as only verifiable information is included.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found.</li>

<dd><b>Assertion of notability</b></dd>
<dd>Notability can be asserted for organizations through:
<ol>
<li>Inclusion in third party published materials.</li>
<li>A significant amount of media coverage that is not trivial in nature and that deals specifically with the organization as the primary subject:
<ul>
<li>For example, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, <a href="../../../u/c/_/UC_Berkeley_d44e.html" title="UC Berkeley">UC Berkeley</a> enforced a moratorium on alcohol for fraternities and sororities. The moratorium became a much covered topic in the media outlets in the San Francisco Bay Area. While this asserts notability for the moratorium and the Greek system at Berkeley and possibly justifies an article either on the moratorium or the Greek system in general, it does not assert notability for an individual chapter of a fraternity or sorority on campus.</li>

<dl>
<dd>The following cannot be used to assert notability:
<ol>
<li>Internal documents cannot be used as an assertion of notability. However, they can be used as source material for an article.
<ul>
<li>Internal documents can include, reports, newsletters, press releases, magazines and websites published by the organization itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Student-run newspapers.</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dd>The scope of activies are not national or international in scale. No national campaigning for the National Democrats happened in the 1997 General Election, only local compaigning for the small number of candidates they fielded. Had they fielded 50 candidates and qualified for a party political broadcast, I would happily concede that they campaigned at a national level and were therefore notable. However this did not happen, and therefore according to guidelines the organisation is not notable unless verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 19:22, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I may be a bit biased due to my strong focus on politics, but I believe that any political party that is fielding more than one or two candidates and wins some votes should be considered notable. Now, whether Wikipedia guidelines here are clear enough to say that this is definitely non-notable, I don't really believe so though I won't be upset if that is the conclusion of this afd. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:45, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, All parties, even those who do not win seats in parliaments but have enough following to influence others should be included. The National Democrats have enough following to make the mainstream right <i>jump on their bandwagon</i>. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 14:03, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> if the reasoning is to keep parties who have some kind of influence - this lot have none. They are not one of the prominent English nationalist parties that have distracted the Tories into losing the last couple of elections, they are less covered than the Official Monster Raving Loony Party and have slightly less chance of forming a Government. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 20:28, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
