<li><b>Keep</b> - This is no different than any other poet or writers page, I can see a couple of items that look pompous but I have edited them out. You might as well delete all the poets in all the lists because they all contain relevent information on the persons accomplishments. Who is saying it is a HOAX?? All information is true. What is unvarifiable? Where is the material used in the accusations. Are you going to delete my other articles?? I am not tooting my own horn but I am known in Canadian poetry circles, I have made a contribution to Canadian poetry and Canadian "Small Press Publishing" and No to deleting me or any other poet just cause you dont know them. I will continue to try and learn wiki principles and editing practice and I DO rework pompous or personal pages to appear more neutral.
<p>There is such a thing in both Canada and the USA calles Small Press Publishing. Not all poets start out or continue with major publishing houses. Local and regional Small Press Publishers can publish famous and not so well known poets and authors. As far as the ISBN's I rarely noticed them in other authors pages, however I have taken note and mentioned that listing a book without the publishers name is the same as just making it up and writing anything down, THAT is unverifiable. I have been endeavouring to update and add many Canadian Publishers so the wiki links are there. Personally I never think of the ISBN in verification because the name of the publisher is usually listed and I know many of them. WayneRay 00:29, 20 April 2006 (UTC)WayneRay</p>

<dd>It is usually frown upon when people write article about themselves. All the claims of notability are seriously weakened. Additionally, the objectivity is questionned.

<li><b>Keep Additional Comment</b> - I just went through all my Canadian Poets pages (see my <a href="../../../w/a/y/User%7EWayneRay_bb81.html" title="User:WayneRay">WayneRay</a> 01:02, 20 April 2006 (UTC)WayneRay page) that I have written or edited and they all read like mine, most have Small Press publishers and some have major Canadian Publishers. We all know them and the names and the editors etc, You don't, and they are classed as minor? Hardly any had ISBN numbers attached and several had no publisher at all. They are still notable in the Canadian literary scene. Are you or someone going to delete them all??? I can go through the lists of American poets (etc) and I bet I will find the same thing. <a href="../../../w/a/y/User%7EWayneRay_bb81.html" title="User:WayneRay">WayneRay</a> 01:02, 20 April 2006 (UTC)WayneRay

<li><b>Comment</b> - I've not written any articles on authors, but if you type out the ISBN then Wikipedia will automatically link to sources for that book like <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0590353403</a>, it just makes it easier to check. I'm however, not too sure on Wikipedia's guidelines on ISBN numbers in authors articles.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Well-known in Canadian small-press publishing; I agree the article needs improvement. The notability of poetry is inherently hard to judge in an age when even well-known poets sell very few copies; I would hate to think that this means poetry is inherently unencyclopedic or that a quick google equips one to judge its notability. There's also some history here: the nom's suggestion of hoax may seem bizarre, given that a quick google shows he exists. But in fact the same nominator was behind two failed AfDs for <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Faiers_4f91.html" title="Chris Faiers">Chris Faiers</a> two months ago; the second was opened ten minutes after the first was closed as no consensus (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Chris_Faiers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Chris_Faiers" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Chris_Faiers_%282nd_nomination%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Chris_Faiers_%282nd_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>).

<li><b>Reply to all</b> Thanks for the positive and negative input. I took a look at 30 other Canadian poets in the List of Canadian Poets and theirs or most of the Small to Medium press published poets, have a similar article page to mine so why not delete all of those?? I shall endeavour to do a Google search on US and Canadian poets just to see what the counts are and put them beside the poets names. ALSO in regards to Amazon.com: As a publisher I was heavily involved in listing my app. 200 paper and electronic books but after 5 years deleted them all. The Canadian Poetry Association has its own electronic bookstore as does the League of Canadian Poets. Maybe I and others are staying Canadian! You might want to also try www.abebooks.com as well. I will add the ISBN's to the book lists as well as update the List of Canadian Poets ISBN's as there are very few listed there and on many US poets pages. And put back the award after I verify a link with the CAA. <a href="../../../w/a/y/User%7EWayneRay_bb81.html" title="User:WayneRay">WayneRay</a> 13:01, 20 April 2006 (UTC)WayneRay</li>

<dd><i>WTF</i> pardon my French Ardenn, BUT, didn't above users just tell me to update the page with references and ISBN numbers to verify the information. You really should give me examples instead of just criticism. There is way less information on almost the entire List of Canadian Poets and a few others US and foreighn ones I have been working on, why don't you go put a delete logo on all of them and then take a relax pill.Will someone other than myself and Ardenn please put the page in the correct tone, I will leave it alone for now. <a href="../../../w/a/y/User%7EWayneRay_bb81.html" title="User:WayneRay">WayneRay</a> 13:20, 21 April 2006 (UTC)WayneRay</dd>

<p><b>93 Highland</b> Yes, I had not finished writing and editing it, i saw, a paragraph that I was going to delete, while away this week on vacation. The last paragraph should have been opmmitted, the plant list one. Maybe it is just under the wrong heading, should be part of U of Toronto and I may have it linked under botanical gardens. Delete the whole thing if you like, I am not back for a week to do anything about it. There are three photos on the page actually and yes, that is the President's house photo for the University of Toronto.(wrong phot what happened to the one I put there&#160;?????
