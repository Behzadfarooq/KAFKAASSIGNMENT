<li><b>Delete</b> per Bubba. The only reference to the term "Fischer's endgame" is in a Russian source which might make it suitable for the Russian wikipedia, but there's no evidence that this term is ever used in English. That makes it a neologism at best. As noted by others, the endgame itself was well known both in tournament practice and in endgame literature decades before the Fischer-Taimanov game at issue. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 10:03, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Quale and Bubba. Only one single source (I am not even sure if that book really wanted to call such endgames Fischer's endgames in general) and not in any way a common term.

<li><b><s>Weak</s> Strong keep</b> - I used to play chess on a high school team and this was a classic match Fischer was involved in. After winning the match, Fischer became a big fan of this <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endgame.html" title="Endgame">endgame</a> and advocated it. A Yahoo search for the term, <i>Fischer's endgame 1971 Taimanov</i> yields several commentaries of it including this <a href="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1044361" class="external text" title="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1044361" rel="nofollow">Java enabled version of the match</a>, <a href="http://www.chesscafe.com/text/mueller09.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.chesscafe.com/text/mueller09.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF analysis</a> and other articles.

<dd>The endgame did occur twice in the 1971 Taimanov match and once between them in the interzonal tournament the previous year. It is also the second most common type of endgame (see <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endgame.html#Table_of_the_most_common_endings" title="Endgame">Endgame#Table of the most common endings</a>). The external article you link to states that Fischer was especially good at playing the side with the bishop (with those three impressive wins over Taimanov, for example). However, I haven't found any English reference naming it "Fischer's Endgame". <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 05:15, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - This was one of Fischer's candidate matches which was a requirement to challenge the chess champion, Boris Spassky in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> (please see our Wiki article on <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fischer_d4b3.html" title="Bobby Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a> and the paragraph, <i>The road to the world championship (1969-1972)</i>. This is also commentated in this <a href="http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/lookup/encyclopedia/bo/Bobby_Fischer.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/lookup/encyclopedia/bo/Bobby_Fischer.html" rel="nofollow">article</a>. It is over time that this endgame has been proved to have a weakness (as all new winning variations usually do). The reason you see <i>pathetic</i> is a commentary on Fischer's eccentric life especially after he failed to defend beating Spassky for the championship in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>rename</b>. If this title is a neologism in English, it is also ambiguous: the article might be about Bobby Fischer's endgame play generally, rather than a specific combination of pieces on each side.

<li><b>Delete</b> as this information is simply wrong. This type of endgame, or evaluation of such, is not named after Fischer like the article suggests. This is either a mis-translation of the Russian cited , or the original author took some serious liberties. You won't find any other sources to corroborate. The 1971 game(s) vs. Taimanov are not really notable by themselves either. At best they should get a brief mention in the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fischer_d4b3.html" title="Bobby Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a> article. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubSeven_abca.html" title="User:SubSeven">SubSeven</a> 01:53, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b>: I added the endgame at <a href="../../../z/u/g/Zugzwang.html#Example_from_actual_play" title="Zugzwang">Zugzwang#Example from actual play</a> because it contains two zugzwang positions, and the article didn't have an example of zugzwang in the endgame from an actual game. However, it is later in the endgame after the rooks have been exchanged. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 03:37, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Translation</b> I had AltaVista translate a paragraph from the Russian source, and it does say that the endgame is named after Fischer:
<blockquote>
<p>Many generations of chess players made their first motions on the board with the aid of the brilliant textbook of the second champion of the peace Jose Raoult Capablanca. There among the wise councils of great knots are similar: in the ends the boat and elephant, as a rule, are stronger than the boat and horse, as a rule, this the sufficiently open nature of position. Then in the match Robert Fisher- Mark taymanov (1971) were played several endgames surprising on the beauty precisely with this relationship, after which this relationship began to bear the name - Fisher endgame. Specifically, this end obtained computer. Although in its cold memory all parties of Robert Fisher are stored, to demonstrate anything similar for computer it was impossible. It is here necessary to note the very good protection of blacks. Motions: 24....Kg", 35... L.d', 47....fshch - this is evidence of the deepest penetration into the secrets of position.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I have a reasonably strong acquaintance with post-1980 literature chess endgame theory. Fischer-Taimanov 1971 (4) is generally considered a technical masterpiece (see Kasparov, My Great Predecessors, vol. <u>5</u>4, pp. 389-93); Kasparov does cite its influence on his generation, <i>but more for the pure bishop vs. knight ending</i> (p. 393). Also see Shereshevsky, Endgame Strategy, pp. 179-81. Are we going to have articles on Fischer-Unzicker, Siegen 1970 (another masterpiece), or Capablanca-Tartakover, NY 1924 (whose influence can be seen in the final game of the Kramnik-Leko WC match or Topalov's win against Kasimjanov in the 2006 WC)? Nonstandard, even in the Russian literature. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 16:06, 21 January 2007 (UTC) P.S. Fischer botched a won ending in game 2 of the same match: Balashov called 50.c5?! "a surprising error for a player of such a high class"; and Kasparov writes that Fischer's 52.Ra2? "shows that Fischer has lost the thread of the game" (MGP 4:383). <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 16:11, 21 January 2007 (UTC) corrected typo <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 23:10, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> No one doubts Fischer's contributions to chess. (There is plenty of information about Fischer in WP.) The issue is whether or not the endgame of rook and bishop versus rook and knight (with pawns) is commonly known as "Fischer's endgame", and whether or not it is notable (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>), which says that there should be two independant sources in order to be notable. Fifty years before the 1971 match, Capablanca's 1921 book <i>Chess Fundamentals</i> states that the bishop is better. The endgame is also discussed thirty years earlier in Fine's 1941 <i>Basic Chess Endings</i>. Recently, this <a href="http://www.chesscafe.com/text/mueller09.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.chesscafe.com/text/mueller09.pdf" rel="nofollow">article</a> by endgame expert Karsten Muller discusses three games between Fischer and Taimanov in 1970 and 71, but does <b>not</b> call it "Fischer's endgame". Also recently, <i>My Great Predecessors</i> by Kasparov discusses it but does <b>not</b> call it "Fischer's endgame". The only source we have been able to find is the Russian one, and it is a little wishy-washy. The translation says that "it began to be called...". Perhaps it did began to be called "Fischer's endgame", but the name doesn't seem to have stuck. I favor deletion on the basis that it is a non-notable stub. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 17:55, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I think it can be mentioned in the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fischer_d4b3.html" title="Bobby Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a> article. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 01:44, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The idea is notable; the term (and thus the encylopedia entry) is not. I refer the interested reader to Kasparov and Agur to get an appreciation of the wide variety of Fischer's contributions to chess theory. Does each one of these ideas get an article?

<dd>I agree. It (the idea) is notable, as a lot of others are too, but it doesn't deserve an article under this title. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 18:08, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have several books about Fischer and I will look and try to find further references. I have recently published an article on a specific endgame (K+R vs K+R+B) in <a href="http://www.chessville.com/Dothan/index.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.chessville.com/Dothan/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chessville.com/Dothan/index.htm</a> (article 10) and it seems that a deep analysis of an endgame should be on a chess site and not in wikipedia, unless we want to develop a branch of wikipedia that deals with endgame technique. After reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Chess_games" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Chess_games" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Chess_games</a> and seeing 16 games (there could be much more!!!) I thought why not do a similiar category of famous endgames? This is certainly one of them. --<a href="../../../y/o/a/User%7EYoavD_612b.html" title="User:YoavD">YoavD</a> 11:54, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are a few articles on endgames, but they are general and not from specific games. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 15:51, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Both <i>Endgame Strategy</i> by Shereshevsky and <i>Secrets of Chess Endgame Strategy</i> by Hansen discuss the ending between Fischer and Taimanov, but neither of them call it the "Fischer endgame". I like the idea of an article about famous endgames from actual games, but I still think this article should be deleted. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 18:23, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> First of all, if this were about any other board game besides chess, it wouldn't even have gotten to AfD. I don't even think a general-interest encyclopedia should be covering individual chess matches, much less parts of individual chess matches. We certainly wouldn't tolerate an article on, say, an individual inning of a baseball game, for example. Besides, given the wealth of information on Fischer, including a number of full-length books, we should have plenty of sources for this if it's something he's famous for, but I couldn't even manage a single Google Books hit for either "Fischer's endgame" or "Fischer endgame". <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 04:46, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If anyone seriously believes that before Fischer, folks didn't know that R &amp; B (in the general case, with many exceptions) were stronger than R &amp; N, they're naive. If someone can't articulate a particular contribution to endgame theory made by Fischer in game 4 of the Taimanov match, this article should go. Game 2 of the same match is notable only for the atypically blunder-filled play of both players; the Palma 1970 game was well-played but otherwise non-notable.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Quite simply put, there's no indication that this is widely known as Fischer's endgame. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 23:38, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>added a link to his article "Fischer teaches the endgame" --<a href="../../../y/o/a/User%7EYoavD_612b.html" title="User:YoavD">YoavD</a> 05:00, 28 January 2007 (UTC) "Kamsky's woes continued, as he was outplayed positionally by Ivanchuk in a Kan Sicilian. The latter is on record as having named Fischer as his chess hero, and today he turned his pressure into the "<b>Fischer endgame</b>" of rooks and bishop v rooks and knight. (Those of you to whom this terminology is unfamiliar are strongly recommended to buy a copy of <b>Mihai Marin's wonderful book Learn from the Legends</b>, after which all will become clear). Kamsky showed his usual tenacious defence, but with the more passive pieces and several pawn weaknesses, he never looked likely to hold the ending, and went down to defeat in 54 moves.
