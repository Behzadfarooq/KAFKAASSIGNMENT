<p>EarthMan exists in reality as a work of art. It is a non-commercial form of expression on a non-commercial website (nothing is for sale on the linked website <a href="http://www.dionlaurent.com" class="external free" title="http://www.dionlaurent.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dionlaurent.com</a> and it's pages) EarthMan was created initially in 1992 in Tokyo Japan and is an on-going performance and installation art project. Linked web pages are noted as reference to EarthMan and similar and related projects. Nothing noted is commercial, spam or advertising. It is matter of fact of an artist, his art, and his art history. laurentdion</p>

<p>Art is not a treasure in the past or an importation from another land, but part of the present life of all living and creating peoples. Franklin Delano Roosevelt --<a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurentdion_e518.html" title="User:Laurentdion">Laurentdion</a> 16:52, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I suggested on the discussion page that the artist create a page for him/herself and include a description of this work there. I think that the examples given above are not particularly relevant due to the severe disparity in notability between those works and this one. The POV pushing in the comment above is unwelcome and hardly likely to help your case, Laurent, btw. Wikipedia is, by nature, not a community where "experts" have more rights than anyone else. FDR, for instance, was not an expert in art or art history, but you feel comfortable in using him to speak for your viewpoint. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardjames444_81a9.html" title="User:Richardjames444">Richardjames444</a> 16:58, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Richard, I appreciate your suggestion. However, this entry is about the EarthMan project, not the artist or creator. This is all new to me, but in reading through all of the guide to deletion and deletion policy, I see no relevent facts to delete this entry. Editing, perhaps. And yes, I am comfortable to quote FDR as above. Perhaps you all have heard of The New Deal and The Federal Arts Projects of FDR and his admin.?!

<li><b>Comment</b>. Laurent, I fail to see how any of the sources you give report anything that's actually in the wikipedia article. In fact, the sources say Earthman is "a guy clad in a genuine-looking spacesuit on a Segway scooter" and say nothing about a structure (Arts Extra gives a structure, but little information on what it is. The fact that "Air Port" is part of the Earthman project had to be supplemented by you.). I'm also worried about on the sources themselves. So, the articles and the third party sources don't mesh, and the third party sources themselves give so little information about the project that it's probably not going to meet either. If all the information about the project is coming from the primary source (you), then it is in danger of being vanity. Oh yeah, please don't vote multiple times (the closing admin will be unhappy with you, at the very least) - I've striken out all of your other votes. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 06:16, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. ColourBurst, In fact, Earthman is "a guy clad in a genuine-looking spacesuit". That's the work. It's EarthMan, not SPaceMan, though he is "a guy clad in a genuine-looking spacesuit", "a complex sytem..." designed to keep a person alive in the extreme environments of earth."</li>
</ul>

<p>See "technical specs. 1 - Human, ... 1 - Silver reflective suit." It is a form of expression and an invention reflecting the reality of global warming, heatwaves, droughts, blah, blah... Spacesuit implies: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit</a> "A space suit is a complex system of garments, equipment and environmental systems designed to keep a person alive and comfortable in the harsh (lack of) environment of outer space. This applies to extra-vehicular activity outside spacecraft orbiting Earth and has applied to walking, and riding the Lunar Rover, on the Moon."</p>
<p>EarthMan is in an "earthsuit" so to say. Say of EarthMan:</p>
<p>EarthMan is a work of art and an invention. "EarthMan is a complex system of garments, equipment and environmental systems designed to keep a person alive and comfortable in the harsh (lack of) environment of Earth. This applies to extra-vehicular activity on Earth as applied to walking, and riding the Segway on Earth".</p>
<p>Those more sournce below are reliable sources that further unfold and are described in the other reliable and verifiable sources published text, photos, video and audio. Published images in the Houston Press and on their website show further what EarthMan is and describe his performance. Ch. 2 News Houston describes and shows video of EarthMan in detail, aired twice during prime time.</p>
<p>Of your concerns about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>: There is nothing "obviously wrong, absurd, or harmful" in the entry, nothing dishonest or unbelievable about EarthMan as a work of art, cited sources have "demonstrable published expertise in the field they are discussing", including the orange show staff and judges. Oh yeah, I am not voting multiple times. I am reiterating the case to include EarthMan as a Wiki article. Below are more reliable and verifiable sources. Note the judges who voted 2 awards to EarthMan. View their credentials as arts professionals and experts in the field. Watch both publications of Channel 2 news prime time coverage including video and commentary of EarthMan. EarthMan is a work of art. It is published multiple times in reputable hard copy, video and internet news, and on the website and news pages of one of America's most reputable non-profit arts organizations.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Okay, let's try this. Do you have more than one source (news, art reviews) that specifically talks about Earthman alone in a substantial way, and not just a blurb? If so, then I'll be happy to retract my vote, but there's nothing in your links about Earthman but one-liners.

It's you, no? Uh, and as you nominated for deletion above "Article reads as spam/advertising." What do you feel!</p>
<p>I find this all amusing and laughable. And so I choose to edit EarthMan as such:</p>
<p>Earth Man , also known as EarthMan, is the name of a phenomenon which has polarized people around the world, being either the product of vivid imagination or a creature that has somehow avoided close observation or capture by man.</p>
<p>Earth Man is described as a large, bipedal silver humanoid creature living in remote wilderness areas of the United States and of Canada, specifically those in south western Canada, the Great Lakes, the Pacific Northwest, the Rocky Mountains, large cities of the U.S. Northeast, and the U.S. Southern states. Some claim it is a creature which may be found around the world under different regional names, such as the EarthMan, Earth(Hu)man or is at least a closely related species. Sightings have allegedly occurred in Malaysia, China, Japan, Europe, and South America. [1] [2] [3]</p>
<p>The majority of scientists reject the possibility of the creature's existence, and consider the stories of Earth Man to be a combination of unsubstantiated folklore and hoax. This is due to current scientific knowledge plus the lack of bones or a body.</p>

<p>EarthMan phenomenon</p>
<p>EarthMan is one of the more famous creatures in cryptozoology. Cryptozoologist John Green has postulated that EarthMan is a worldwide phenomenon (Green 1978:16).</p>
<p>Many who consider the creature's existence a possibility claim that accounts of large, silver, ape-like or "wild man" creatures (or reports of inexplicably large, human-like footprints) from the Pacific Northwest date as far back as the late 20th century. Some researchers have argued that these earlier accounts are consistent with more contemporary EarthMan reports, while critics doubt their authenticity and question the accuracy of interpreting older reports through modern preconceptions. Skeptics also question the authenticity of these earlier reports in general, as many of them were not documented before the 1990s.</p>
<p>The earliest unambiguous reports of gigantic ape-like creatures in the Pacific northwest date from 1992, after a series of alleged encounters at a location in Washington later dubbed EarthMan Canyon, as related in The Oregonian [8] As noted in "Etymology" below, similar reports appear in the mainstream press dating back at least to the 1990s.</p>
<p><br />
[edit]</p>
<p>EarthMan</p>
<p>The late Smithsonian primatologist John Napier noted that "the term EarthMan has been in colloquial use since the early 1990's to describe large, unaccountable human-like footprints in the Pacific northwest" (Napier, 74). However, according to Loren Coleman and Jerome Clark, Andrew Genzoli deserves credit for the first formal use of the word on October 5, 1994 (Coleman and Clark, 39-40). Genzoli was a columnist and editor at the Humbolt Times, and that day's front page story showed Jerry Crew, a bulldozer operator on a road-building crew, holding an enormous plaster cast of a footprint. The text began, "While the tracks of old EarthMan [sic] have been in evidence for some time...," before detailing the worker's claims to have discovered an enormous footprint at an isolated work site.</p>
<p><br />
[edit]</p>
<p>Eyewitness reports</p>
<p>Some cryptozoologists have argued that the most persuasive circumstantial evidence for EarthMan's existence is the high number (possibly thousands) of credible eyewitness reports from individuals, who claim to have clearly seen creatures that they describe as large, bipedal and ape-like and shiny silver.</p>
<p><br />
[edit]</p>
<p>Psychological explanations</p>
<p>Arguing against the existence of EarthMan, anthropologist David Daegling suggests that EarthMan fills a basic human need for mysteries and monsters.</p>
<p><br />
[edit]</p>
<p>Mainstream response</p>
<p>Skeptics</p>
<p>Wikipedia editors and academics generally "discount the existence of EarthMan because the evidence supporting belief in the survival of a silver prehistoric, bipedal, ape-like creature of such dimensions is scant". Furthermore, the issue is so muddied with dubious claims and outright hoaxes that many scientists do not give the subject serious attention. Napier wrote that the mainstream scientific community's indifference stems primarily from "insufficient evidence ... it is hardly unsurprising that scientists prefer to investigate the probable rather than beat their heads against the wall of the faintly possible" (Napier, 15).</p>
