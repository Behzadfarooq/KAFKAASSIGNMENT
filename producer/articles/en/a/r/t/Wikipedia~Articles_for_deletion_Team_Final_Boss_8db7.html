<p>The result was <b>Redirect/Merge</b> to <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Gaming_b3d2.html" title="Major League Gaming">Major League Gaming</a>. For all the vociferousness of the comments, I am unimpressed with the quality of sources to back them up, and especially with the attempts to sell press releases, blog posts, and interested (i.e., not independent) media as reliable sources. So the threshold primary subject of multiple independent sources has not been met. On the other hand, the scraps of acceptable material, especially the Reuters article, show that coverage of the team is acceptable within the right context, in this case the main MLG article (which is also how it is covered in that article). I expect that the exposure of the team will increase, so in due time with more <i>reliable</i> sources it can be spun out, but poorly sourced articles like this one fail the core policies of Wikipedia. I'm redirecting because the team is already covered and I don't see much in terms of sourced material that can be merged, but if anyone has better material than urbandictionary to source the claims, the edit history is still available. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:06, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> MLG is a very significant league - it offers the most prize money for its permanant games and has broadcasted shows on USA Network featuring every single player and team on the list. Most if not all players have had articles written about them in their local newspaper. EGM magazine - the most popular gaming magazine (you can get it in any of your local pharmacy stores) regularly feature MLG and its best teams and players. Wall Street Journal published an article about the first contract deal MLG offered to its top gamers.</li>

Only featured in pulp entertainment press and business press, not in electronic sports press. Notability is also in question. The team has not appeared in any major international competitions. MLG achievements are slightly notable, but not major enough in order to have an article. Notice in the <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Gaming_b3d2.html" title="Major League Gaming">Major League Gaming</a> article should suffice. Notable results mentioned in the article (WCG and CPL wins in 2005) belong to <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_3D_82e5.html" title="Team 3D">Team 3D</a> and should definitely be removed from this article. -- <a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjith_4679.html" title="User:Djith">DJiTH</a> 23:13, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, the fact that it appears in the media <i>outside</i> electronic sports press probably makes them <i>more</i> notable, rather than <i>less</i>. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 23:32, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Not in these cases. The field we are talking about is relatively young and general media have shown no effort whatsoever to inform themselves well regarding the field. Professional gaming is a buzz phrase right now, and whoever shouts loudest (or whoever gets the biggest investment to put into a communications department) "wins" the media attention. This is exactly the case with these MLG related articles. I think we should be weary regarding "bought" media attention. Nonetheless, the point was that they were hardly mentioned by electronic sports media. Eg, the media specialized in the field has deemed them hardly notable. -- <a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjith_4679.html" title="User:Djith">DJiTH</a> 23:38, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I appreciate your work on e-sports in general, but I am seeing a major anti-MLG bias in all your 'delete' votes. I feel that I have gone above and beyond in proving notability in all these AfD's, and that you are against the articles merely because they are members of MLG rather than some other league. <a href="../../../j/0/l/User%7EJ0lt_C0la_0b17.html" title="User:J0lt C0la">J0lt C0la</a> 00:48, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But is notability based on whether something is discussed by the experts in the field or if it is known by the average Joe? Far fewer people have heard of eSports than happen to click across USA Network while surfing cable. I'm still up in the air about the article since the original quality of the writing obscured whether it might be notable. I think our criteria in evaluating some of the stars of eSports (<a href="../../../k/s/h/Ksharp.html" title="Ksharp">Ksharp</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/a/HeatoN_c6b1.html" title="HeatoN">HeatoN</a>) was whether they could make a living doing it. If these kids on Final Boss get paid $60,000 a year, I think they pass that criteria. They may not have been at the top of their profession for 5 years, but it sounds like they have been for 2-3 years. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 18:11, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> This would be the Team 3d of console gaming. Djith it is strange that you claim EG hardly finds them notable when they "were" Team 3D. I would need to see citations for you claim (or maybe that was your opinion?). The fact that non-gaming industries find them notable only makes your argument seemingly more bias and anti-MLG. Your claim that this industry is based on who is willing to push more money out differs from other industries in what way? Of course all of that is irrelavent to the fact that media attention paid for or not is a guideline for notablility. The more media attention the more notable (at least in the case of the current entertainment industry). <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 06:05, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There are in fact some guidelines regarding the reliability of sources; <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Also take a look at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#SELF" title="WP:V">WP:V#SELF</a>. With these, you will have to come to the conclusion that the show on USA Network does not pass. Regarding <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_3D_82e5.html" title="Team 3D">Team 3D</a>, 3D is a major e-Sports club, that in the past, had players that now play for MLG Team Final Boss under contract. However, Team 3D is much broader and is mostly focussed around their Counter-Strike squad. For the results of the Counter-Strike squad alone, it would be notable. For the results of the former HALO squad alone, it may not be. Regarding the accomplishments now listed at Team Final Boss, it would be highly dubious to take achievements players had at one club to a new club. For instance, if the entire squad of <a href="../../../f/c/_/FC_Barcelona_8216.html" title="FC Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> would move to <a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajax_Amsterdam_0e8e.html" title="Ajax Amsterdam">Ajax Amsterdam</a>, would Ajax have won the <a href="../../../u/e/f/UEFA_Champions_League_a339.html" title="UEFA Champions League">UEFA Champions League</a> in 2006?
