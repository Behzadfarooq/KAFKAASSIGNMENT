<li><b>Comment</b>, I notice the overwhelming amount of keep votes here and have seen similar trends in other articles. What people seem to forget, imho, is that while the act of the first passenger shot by an air marshall is significant, and I therefore support keeping the AA flight article, the person Rigoberto Alpizar is in no way notable except for (the sad) fact that he happens to be dead. An encyclopedic article about a person should, again imho, be a biographical article about the notable life and/or accomplishments of said person. Mr. Alpizar has accomplished nothing that is notable enough for him to be remembered in a few weeks time except, again, for the fact he was shot dead. He was no politician, scientist, humanitarian or artist, he was no more notable than you or me. I suggest we put the info that is of note into the flight article but I vote delete for this one for the stated reasons.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 16:12, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b>. Look, the man himself is utterly non-notable. What <i>is</i> notable is that he was shot dead by air marshals. <b>It is the shooting that is notable, not the man.</b> Therefore, we should only have an article on the shooting, to which the man's name should redirect, so that people who look for the man find the information on the shooting.

Many comparable articles would have to be deleted on that basis. I see Kalsermar and Haeleth's argument in the abstract but feel it's flying the face of reality.

<ul>
<li>I don't think anyone saying we should merge is saying we get rid of information. What we are saying is that we shouldn't have an article on the man <b>and</b> an article on the flight. The flight is only notable because of the man, and the man is only notable because of the flight. The people you all name are not fair comparisons as they do not really have an article that they could be merged into (apart from a more general article on police shootings or something). <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Monkey_6b08.html" title="User:Evil Monkey">Evil Monkey</a> - <a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvil_Monkey_65b0.html" title="User talk:Evil Monkey">Hello</a> 03:43, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, I take your point that information is duplicated in those two articles (though surely this should have been a vote to merge rather than delete). You could see the incident as being about what happened to a certain man, or what happened on a certain flight, and no doubt time will tell what name it goes down in history under. But I was disagreeing with Kalsermar's view that the man is non-notable because he never did or achieved anything notable except by dying -- this is what I meant by "sad celebrity". Also, I would think that there is scope for the article about the man to contain important information (yet to appear but no doubt emerging as investigations progress) that perhaps applies more to him than the event itself. Not just trivia but stuff about his personality, mental condition, (lack of) terrorist affiliations etc. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 19:32, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Excuse me? what happened to assuming good faith here? I object strongly to even the notion that a delete voter may have political bias just as I would object to the notion that a keep voter has, opposite, political bias, which some may very well have. The existence of bias is neither here nor there.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The only flight number that I remember after an air disaster was the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_Am_Flight_103_91ad.html" title="Pan Am Flight 103">Lockerbie bombing</a>, which had 270 victims (it was flight 103, by the way). Clearly, you wouldn't have an article about each individual on that flight. But when it's ONE INDIVIDUAL who is the victim, everyone remembers the VICTIM'S NAME <i>way</i> before they remember his flight number. It's total nonsense to merge with Flight so-and-so (the flight number is totally inconsequential). Of course it should be an article about THE MAN. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanesDaddy_efbe.html" title="User:JanesDaddy">JanesDaddy</a> 20:39, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Good observation. Couldn't agree more. An article based on the flight is more appropriate for an event that affect all the passages. Here, even if we use flight #, the whole article end up talking about a single person. That don't make sense. The net is unnecessarly too wide.</dd>

<li><b>Merge or Keep</b> Merging Rigoberto into Flight 924 article with a special subsection for him in the article. Having the two articles is confusing, repetitive, and sometimes they contain conflicting information. At first I was for having two seperate artciles, but now I think it is best to merge.
