<p>Woodburn is located just outside of New Glasgow, in Pictou County, Nova Scotia. It is located at the west end of Merigomish Harbour, on Nova Scotia's North Shore. It is a main road connecting New Glasgow to the Melmerby beach, home of the warmest waters north of the Carolina's.</p>
<p>In 1810, John Wood became the first settler in Woodburn after he received a grant of land. The word "burn" is Scottish, meaning river or brook, so the actual name Woodburn is derived from "Woods Brook" as most of the early settlers around the area are from Scotland. Fishing is the main industry on/around Woodburn.</p>
<p>Kevin Murdoch, a notable contestant on the popular CTV show, Canadian Idol who made it to the wild card round in the shows first season is originally from Woodburn.</p>

<p><br />
The Classical Lyceium Anavryton, (known as Anavryta) was originally an elite Greek Lyceium (originally a boarding school only for boys) that was established shortly before the beginning of the second world war (1940) in order to provide education to the members of the Greek Royal Family and notable athenian families.</p>
<p>The school was based on the educational principles of [[Kurt Hahn], and modelled on Han's own creations the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schule_Schloss_Salem_7dc7.html" title="Schule Schloss Salem">Schule Schloss Salem</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordonstoun.html" title="Gordonstoun">Gordonstoun</a>. The effort to create an elite high school in Athens inspired by Han's principles has originated from <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_II_of_Greece_0bb5.html" title="George II of Greece">George II of Greece</a> following the tradition of the Greek Royal Family, members of which had attended Hahn's schools(<a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh_e472.html" title="Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>). The effort was supported by the Greek academic society mainly because of the strong relationship of Hahn's theories with ancient Greek philosophy. The main goal of the Lyceium was to focus on the pursue of the Hahnian ideals and the study of Greek classics.</p>
<p>The school complex is located in the area of Maroussi and particularly in the middle of the beatiful forest of Anavryta, from which it got its name. The main building was the former mansion of Greek billionaire Andreas Syggrou and the school also included other facilities including a small theater and a chappel (st.Antony).</p>
<p>The fate of the Lyceium was closely tied with the Greek Royal Family (<a href="http://www.greekroyalfamily.org/index.cfm?get=family" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greekroyalfamily.org/index.cfm?get=family" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) but the only King of Greece who actually graduated from the School was <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_II_of_Greece_ceec.html" title="Constantine II of Greece">Constantine II of Greece</a>,class of 1955. After the support of Constantine to the military junta in the early months of 1967 and with the public strongly opposing monarchy, a referendum vote established the system of presidential democracy and denounced the king in 1974. (In an extraordinary turn of events the graduate society of Anavryta chose not to support the king, an event that had an effect on the vote)</p>
<p>Under circumstances that followed in the next years and expecially in the 80s it was increasingly difficult for a public school to have an elitistic approach in Greece. Anavryta lost its exlusive character, but remained a school with a solid reputation for academic ecxellence. Eventually at the end of the 90's the school was prohibited to set any kind of admission standards and requirements and so completely lost its original charachteristics.</p>
<p>The Anavryta experiment ended mainly because of the hostility, that the democratic Greek goverments have shown to what was considered to be the reminder of the previous regime and the complete transformation of Greek society in the decades that followed. Nevertheless it is not possible to underestimate the importance of the Lyceium and its educational role. The impressive alumni of the Classical Lyceium has to show important members since generations of spiritual leaders, academics, spokesmen, bussinesmen, and other prominent members of the Greek society had graduated from the Classical Luceium in the decades following 1940.</p>
<p>At the present date the school still exists under a new title. The "Peiramatiko Lyceium Anavryton"<a href="http://lyk-peir-anavr.att.sch.gr/new_page_home.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://lyk-peir-anavr.att.sch.gr/new_page_home.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> is a small Greek public school continuing the existence of the former Classical (it was finally renamed at 1998). Sadly the school estate and facilities are now in a terrible state of decay, since the buildings received almost no attention for thirty years. Furthemore any restoration seems impropable due to the lack of funding and needed govermental support. It is now clear that sooner or later the school will have to be abanoned, ending what can only be described as the most historical school of modern Greece.</p>

Jan-Joseph Stok is dutch, born in Tilburg in 1978, but lived nearly his entire childhood in France. After school he decided to go back to his home country and started a study of photojournalism at the fotoacademie in Amsterdam for three years. After a year of freelancing, he was attacked and hurt near Kosovo, he decided to have more knowledge to be more prepared to understand the world, followed an another study, European Studies in Maastricht, were very quickly he changed his study in a more photojournalistic course. He was the first international student to follow a semester photojournalism at the famous Danish school of journalism in Aarhus Denmark ( the school of nearly all famous danish photographers, like Erik Refner, Jan Grarup, Joachim Ladefoged,...) At this same period he did an internship at Politiken (Danish National newspaper).In 2005, Jan-Joseph had four exhibitions, three in the Netherlands, and one in Paris. He has been working freelance for magazines and newspapers all around the world. Even sold a story in Greenland about Greelandic prisoners in Denmark. He is going regularly to Africa to show the daily life of the people out there, not always concentrating on hard news, but looking sometimes more deeply in the things that people don’t always care about. In his work, he tries to contrast the western world with the third world by putting pictures side by side. For example contrasting rich tourist in Iceland having a bath in the blue Lagoon with Children working in stone quarries in Africa to survive. But also within the third world, not only showing the poverty, like in Uganda, contrasting the nightcommuters with the rich Ugandese playing golf in the capital. For him photography is a look it needs both side to make a good picture, how people look at you and how you look at people, that will make the strength of the picture. Respect and understanding is something very important in photojournalism according to him. His main goal is to show the human condition everywhere in the world were there is injustice and to see individuals as human beings after all. In January 2006, he has been awarded best photojournalist under 30 of the year in the Netherlands at the Zilveren camera, he won the canon price. (www.zilverencamera.nl) . He is now based in London for one year, working as a freelance photojournalist and doing a master in photojournalism and documentary photography at the London college of Communication.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-15_52bb.html" title="Edit section: FTD (band)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">FTD (band)</span></h2>
<p>FTD is an Alternative Rock and Punk band started in 2004 by founding members Josh Henrich (Guitars, Bass, Piano, and B/U Vox), Caleb Lanners (Guitars and Vox), and Brent Johnson (Guitars)in the town of Greenfield Minnesota on the date 10-16-2004. It was started as a basement rock band, but quickly turned into the real thing. After a month or so Pat Martinson was added in as drums after auditioning a few other drummers. They quickly began to learn cover songs so they could play at local coffee shops. It was inevitable that they would start writing and so they did. They managed to scrap together 3 original songs before their first gig at "The Coffee Cubby" on 12-10-2004. It was a success as the band made $86 and made a name for themselves in their local Rockford High School. They were asked to play at a local dance at school to raise money for the homeless, so they greatly accepted. It was a smash hit. They managed to make $125 off of it and spread their name further. At the time they were called Insert Name Here, and after the dance changed to The Perfect Crime, which is where they recorded their first 2 home demos and copyrighted the songs to that name. In the month of January 2005 they Recorded:<br />
"Home Recording 1" which had the following Tracks on it:<br />
1.Popular Girl<br />
2.What it Is<br />
3.Into the Mind<br />
4.Get Out Of my Head.<br />
5.I Need This Now<br />
6.The One For ME&lt;7.The Brent Song<br />
8.Popular Girl<br />
After having close to zero sucess with sound quality, they rerecorded in February to create<br />
"Home Recording 2" which had these tracks on it and was also avaiable as an instrumental cd<br />
1. Popular Girl<br />
2. Funk And Roll For Your Soul<br />
3. I Need This Now<br />
4. Into The Mind<br />
5. When Time Stood Still<br />
6. What It Is<br />
7. The One For Me<br />
8. Listen To The Voices<br />
9. Another Day<br />
10. My Skin Itches<br />
11. Stranded<br />
12. Once<br />
13. Get Out Of My Head<br />
14. Popular Girl (Acoustic)<br />
15. Brent Is A Crazy S.O.B.<br />
16. Caleb's Uncle Song After recording these tracks, they decided to play two more shows, one at the Coffee Cubby and the local fountain The Retro. Before this, they played at the school talent show with the song Popular Girl which amazingly boosted their sucess. Then they played those two shows in 2 consecutive weeks. They racked up about $300 from, these two shows and 100 bucks from selling CDs at school. They then sunk into a time when they just fooled around at Brents house and played music every once and a while. July came and they had a bid to play at the Redwood Falls county fair and they took it, drove two hours to perform "Get Out of My Head." The croud didnt like it, but they were looking for more of a family related song. The radio station had them play at Renville's fair which in the end gave Brent his fall from the band. Brent didnt want to drive 2 hours to the show so they had a local Bassist Josh Miller come play with them. The croud went nuts but the judges like the country acts better. That was ok. The radio station played their horrible recording of "Get Out Of My Head." The ban played another show at the Retro gaining another 100 dollars. Tensions increased with Brent and the other members decided to let him go. Josh was then asked to join. Using Caleb's golf cart, they transported all of the stuff from Brents house, past Calebs house, and To Josh Henrich's House. (Which was a half mile away!) Practice was held here and during this month of session, September 1st 2003 and Admit were written. Josh's parents hated the noise so practice was moved to Josh M's house. During the next month, OJ was written and the band practiced everyday. This caught the eye of studio producer Nick Fournier who decided to porduce the bands first real CD. In the days of 12-16-2005 to 12-18-2005 the band recorded their self titled EP<br />
FTD EP included these tracks:<br />
1. Get Out Of My Head<br />
2. New Punk Song (OJ)<br />
3. Admit<br />
4. Popular Girl<br />
5. September 1st 2003<br />
6. TBB<br />
Joshs dads company reproduced the CD and the band began to sell them at every oppourtunity. They sold over 400 of them gaining about 800 bucks. They played at the High school talent show with "Admit." This would be the last time Pat played musc with the band. He nevershowed up again to practice so the band had to let him go. For the next 3 months they went without a bassist as Josh H played Guitar and Josh M played bass. Then they asked friend Nick Herringshaw to play bass for them. He and Josh H now switch off duties as Guitar and Bass players. They are currently writing and getting ready to go back into the studio to make their first full length studio album.</p>

<p>The Intersection is a band that illistrates love and passion for music and music of the soul. Four boys, best friends in their younger years, decided to prove their love of music to the world and join together in a band. Ian Herbert, Joey Arcidiacono, Charlie Bryan, and Robert Jameson have solely proved their musical ability and brought it together to form a unique psychodelic sound. They compliment the genres of jam and funk and create a "classic" rock type of sound. So far, the Interesection has been very popular in Houston, Texas playing at many well-known clubs like the swanky Fitzgeralds on more than one occasion. Numerous times they have raised money for charity causes and seem to be headed on the right track. They have two demos recorded and hope to get a real CD out within the next couple of years. They are planning on participating in the South by Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas and continue to show off their talent with repeated notorious performances. They may seem like just another small-town band but each of them shows tremendous talent and determination. Ian Herbert, the lead vocalist, guitarist, and on occasion tambourinist, has propelled himself to a new level of singing over the past couple of years and continuously brings new lyrics to the group. Joey Arcidiacono is the skilled drummer for the band. He has vastly improved over the past couple of years and serves to be a major contributor to the band. Charlie Bryan is the lead guitarist and is so advanced that it is hard to understand the different technology and techniques that he uses while playing his guitar. He also plays the keyboard in some of the Intersection's songs and just as well proves to be extremly gifted. Robert Jameson is the bass guitarist for the band and in many ways holds the band together by his friendly nature and guitar beats. He has been playing for many years and is very skilled at playing the bass guitar. In one memorable performace, he was wearing a rainbow poncho and the fans really enjoyed that. The Intersection has come out with 2 demos, both being released by the 8th Note Recording Studio in Houston, Texas. Texas listeners, be prepared to hear this great band come out on the radio with some of their main hits like Early Dreams and 8:15.</p>

<p>Overflow started out of their youth group in Pendleton, South Carolina. After several years playing throughout the southeast for churches and various organizations, the band recorded their major label debut for Essential Records (Provident Label Group/BMG). On August 24, 2004 the album debuted to mixed reviews, eventually garnering two top 10 hits on Christian CHR charts. "Cry On My Shoulder" is the band's most notable song to date making it all the way up to the number four spot on Christian CHR. Continuing to tour unabated the band has reunited with Robert Beeson (who originally worked with them at Essential Records) and is currently in the midst of recording their sophomore album with producer Ian Eskelin.</p>
<p>The band currently consists of four longtime and original members: Mark Breazeale (lead guitar/background vocals), Will Carter (drums), Matthew Hayes (keys), and Tom Pellerin (lead vocals, rhythm guitars).</p>

<p>This instrument has been used in advertisments such as an 'Elvive's Colour Protect' ad. Although this Ad was appealed it was proven by OFCOM (the UK regulator of advertising at the time) that this Photogonioreflectometer is an accurate device very capable of the chore appointed to it</p>

<p>The correct title of this article is General [M]ayhem. The substitution or omission of any &lt; &gt; [ ] { } is because of technical restrictions. General [M]ayhem, nicknamed by its users Genmay or the "[M]", is an Internet forum containing general discussion forums; its title aptly describing the character of these discussions. General Mayhem has very few rules. Genmay is currently one of the largest message boards on the Internet, with over 18,000,000 posts (considering the relatively small number of registered users). [1] While a diverse and independent community, Genmay is almost directly derived from a now-defunct hardforums sub-forum of the same name. It bears mentioning that Genmay itself is a for-profit LLC.</p>
<p><br />
Community General Mayhem is administrated by two members - M|22 (Pronounced Mr. 2) and sanjay. However, General Mayhem is mostly moderated by its users in the form of a unique paid-banning service which generates income for the forum and culls the obnoxious at the same time. Genmay implemented a new donation system, allowing automated changes of usernames (name-rape), thread subject lines, user titles, user avatars, along with automated banning and the ever-popular [H]-mode (Some creative scripting that mimics the ever-mocked instability of the Hard OCP Forums from which genmay derives, allowing the user a 10% (?) chance of actually reaching his destination following a link click). However, the Genmay store is currently closed due to potential legal issues. There is no set date for revival as of this writing. These are also used as secondary forms of punishment, or in some cases, rewards. [2]However the store has not worked for some time, dispite frequent promises to fix it.</p>
<p>The forum tends to segregate users based upon their UserID, which were assigned to them upon joining. The general rule is that the higher the UserID is, the newer the user. The usage of UserID as an insult, previously a common practice, has since become an offense that is generally looked down upon and punished by the community, but seniority still garners respect.</p>
<p>Genmay's posting follows a daily cycle to a far greater degree of precision than most forums. Most posters being in North America, most posts are made during the daylight hours, giving the forum its greatest burdens around the noon and evening hours. Posting then sharply falls off around 1-2am PST.</p>
<p><br />
Forums The discussion board is divided up into sub-forums as follows:</p>
<p>General [M]ayhem - This is the main forum which shares its name with the site. This forum is for posting anything (hence the name).</p>
<p>CompuGlobalHyperMegaNet - (CGHMN for short) This forum is for posting anything computer and electronics related. CGHMN is home to many professionals (and would-be professionals) working in these areas. The name of this forum is based on an episode of The Simpsons where Homer decides to start his own internet service provider.</p>
<p>Games - This forum used to reside in CGHMN as a subforum. The popularity of this forum has warranted a shift to the main page. As the name implies, it is for the discussion of electronic games, whether it be PC, console, handhelds, or some other form.</p>
<p>Automotive [M]ayhem - If it has a combustion engine, it is probably posted about in this forum.</p>
<p>Dangerous Toys - A forum purchased by user 'wolf' for discussion of guns, knives, paintball, air soft, and other weapons.</p>
<p>Home, Garden, and Personal Finance - A forum for sharing recipes and various types of household and financial advice. The least popular of all subforums. Formally House and Cookery</p>
<p>Photography and i[M]aging - Like the name suggests, a forum specifically made for the discussion of imaging, photography, and cameras.</p>
<p>Altered [M]inds - A recent forum addition used for discussion of drug related subject matter. Until now, "drug threads" as they're called were posted in the main forum. The new forum is strictly moderated to keep discussion mature and to promote education about drug use. Asking a member for drugs, and where to obtain them on the forum is forbidden and will result in immediate and permanent ban.</p>
<p>The Pit - The forum for any heated debate, including political, religious, conspiracy theory, and racial discussions. It is also the home of callouts, where two members may debate publicly over a disagreement. Callouts can be over real life disagreements between members or simple attempts to destroy someone's credibility. The most common use of the Pit is for discussion of opinions on news items.</p>
<p>Beast[M]ay - (Formerly Bone Closet) Serious discussions about relationships and social interaction, sex, and personal fitness. Like the games forum, sometimes considered a forum within a forum; many users who post here do not post in the other forums often. In contrast to the General Mayhem, this forum is strictly moderated, and only mature and sensible replies are allowed. Spamming and personal attacks are strictly forbidden within this forum and will usually result in banishments if posted.</p>
<p>Babe Forum - A forum for posting pictures of beautiful women (and sometimes men). Pornographic material is strongly prohibited.</p>
<p>Deals and Steals - Generally the least viewed subforum on the site, this is where members can sell and buy various things from each other.</p>
<p>IMNobody bought hell for you! - (Formerly the Kiddie Corral or KC and RMTC's Pigsty (Named after permanently banned member RedManThatCould.)) Currently named after IMNobody, a wealthy member who on top of buying a new subforum for General Mayhem, has been responsible for numerous "name rapes" and related shenanigans. This is the only forum where banned users are allowed to post.</p>
<p>"Trinity" - A computerized bot that lived in RMTC's pigsty. Was once known for her witty responses inside Kiddie Corral and often tricking the unsuspecting poster that she was indeed a real person. Trinity has since been turned off, possibly for performance reasons.</p>
<p>Vault of [M]ayhem - Notable and otherwise funny posts are kept in here for archival and easy access. It is often suggested that newbies read this forum in order to understand some of the references used in General [M]ayhem. Once a thread is "vaulted" it cannot be posted in anymore. Often members will sarcastically request for a poor thread to be vaulted.</p>
<p>One complaint some users, especially newer ones, have about the current set of sub-forums is that a lot of serious or obscure threads are "doomed to death" by being only suitable for Genmay - where they are quickly spammed off-topic. Others take this as part of the atmosphere, and feel that only the most popular threads should survive, and new subforums would only "dilute the [M]ayhem."</p>
<p><br />
Registration Before recently it was thought as rather difficult to gain membership to Genmay. This was because one would have to have a non-free e-mail address, which helps prevent spamming and duplicate accounts. After this, each and every registration would have to be approved by an administrator before the user would be able to post. Other than this, registration is closed a large part of the time, so no one can make new accounts at all. In mid January 2006, registration was opened again. New users were also allowed to post immediately. It is believed that this was done to help raise Genmay's rating on Big-Boards.com (a forum ranking site). Some people are concerned that this will reduce the quality of the forum with more spam. However, Genmay has since reverted to letting only people with a paid email account register.</p>
<p><br />
History Of General Mayhem The current General [M]ayhem was founded after the original HardOCP sub-forum was spontaneously shut down by its owner, one Kyle Bennett, after a server upgrade. Following the upgrade, users found their favorite forum had evaporated. Any disagreement following the deletion was met by immediate banishment, hand-dealt by the infamous Bennett.</p>
<p>Three forum members jumped on the idea of creating a new forum for the displaced community. FLECOM registered genmay.com, M|22 registered genmay.net, and James Crivellone registered genmay.org. The first controversy happened when the 3 domains were consolidated into one forum run on M|22's computer, a dual Pentium 3 which was frequently unable to handle the load that was required, and a question of ownership and control came up between the 3 leaders of the forum. FLECOM was eventually de-admined "from [his] own ------- forum" and disappeared from the site. Crivellone gave up his control over the domain and left as well (going on to administer the more regulated forums of Rage3d). The control of the forum currently rests in the hands of M|22 and sanjay. Lately Genmay.org no longer works, although the Whois says that it still belongs to James Crivellone. A whois for Genmay.info also reveals it is owned by sanjay, although it features the same error message displayed on Genmay.org.</p>
<p>The site is now owned and operated under the name General Mayhem, LLC, of which Sanjay holds a 51%, interest, and M|22 the remaining minority interest. Genmay is run off of a database server with two Opterons, 8GB of memory, and a dual channel UPS backed RAID array. There are four 1U Dell servers that serve Genmay via Squid proxies and Apache/PHP.</p>
<p><br />
Pranks In the Summer of 2005, General Mayhem created a rumor that Christopher Walken will run for president in 2008. A website, Walken 2008, was later created to ensure the rumor was more believable, accompanied by the production of Bumper stickers to encourage and gather media coverage from well-respected news stations. The rumor was finally shot down when Walken's publicist, Mara Buxbaum, stated that it was a hoax.</p>

However, this is essentially a straight copy of the start of the quoted source, and the only thing that might save it from being a copyviolation is that the list of supported formats might count as being the only reasonable representation of the facts.

Students are encourage to abide by the college motto "be the best you can be" by means of drinking 60 shots of alcohol in the quickest time possible. The name for this student pass-time relates to its place of origin, and current field of play, Hatfield A-stairs. The challenge brings together students from all across Hatfield College, and is seen as one of the most exciting and interesting traditions which have been created over Hatfield's many years of existence. Other important traditions include the singing of college songs (including adapted versions of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beach_Boys_6081.html" title="The Beach Boys">The Beach Boys</a> classic "<a href="../../../s/l/o/Sloop_John_B_6c4d.html" title="Sloop John B">Sloop John B</a>", and <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolf_Harris_544a.html" title="Rolf Harris">Rolf Harris</a>' "Two Little Boys") and the sitting of formal dinners before the SCR. Those unable to complete the A-stairs challenege in a respectable time are often subject to ridicule from their counterparts, and he who holds the quickest time at the end of each academic year is treated to the social of his life; courtesy of those losing contestants from that year.</p>

<p>The New Detroit Science Center was started nearly 30 years ago by Detroit businessman and philanthropist Dexter Ferry and is located in the heart of the Midtown Cultural Center in Detroit, Michigan. The Science Center was created as a place for children to learn about science in a hands-on environment. The Cultural Center is the heart of thriving food, art, culture and university life in Detroit’s midtown. The Science Center has Michigan’s only Dome IMAX Theatre, a state-of-the art Dassault Systèmes Planetarium, more than 200 hands-on exhibits, traveling exhibits and live demonstration shows. The Science Center has long been a city icon and is architecturally one of its most dramatic buildings. The Science Center’s current traveling exhibit is Magic: The Science of Illusion. Within walking distance are other cultural attractions such as the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Detroit Historical Museum and the Scarab Club.</p>

<p>Seeta was born in London, England. Although she is known to millions as WPC Datta in ITV’s The Bill for which she won the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress Awards, Asian Film Academy, this popular actress made her stage debut as Cassandra in the original London production of Andrew Lloyd-Webber's CATS. In the last few years, she was made a Fellow of the Royal Society Of Arts, created a film production company MashMosh Films, performed her one woman cabaret, An Evening With Seeta Indrani, and in May 2004 she was presented with the Asian Women Of Achievement, Arts And Culture Award.</p>
<p>MashMosh Films is her current passion. Created in 2004, with editor Chris Bishop, 2005 saw a commission for Sony Entertainment Television Asia’s series Asians in Europe, a promo film for Asian Music Award winner DJ Swami, and their debut short Snapshots in the Cannes Film Festival, Short Film Corner. They returned to Cannes in 2006, screening, The Goodbye Girls, starring Nina Wadia, in the Short Film Corner. The Goodbye Girls has already been selected for the 12th Bradford Film Festival and shortlisted for 8th Tongues On Fire Asian Woman Film Festival. Future plans include a specially commissioned script by award winning writer Jim Sweeney.</p>
<p><br />
She has a well-established reputation as a versatile performer; amongst other things she created her own dance company, Fuego Flamenco. Perhaps not so well know is her work in the theatre. Personal Highlights are: Fulfilling a long-held ambition to work with Christopher Bruce as The Spanish Singer in his revival of Cruel Garden with the Rambert Dance Company at the Teatro Reggio, Turin and the Sadlers Wells Theatre, London. Appearing at the London Palladium with childhood heroine Cyd Charisse. And she was invited to take part in the first national tour in 40 years of Britain's oldest opera company, Carl Rosa Opera Company, playing Prince Orlovsky in Die Fledermaus.</p>
<p>Seeta studies singing with Mary Hammond and keeps in shape with a mixture of ballet and yoga class. Her hobbies include gardening, reading, she devours crime fiction, and travel when she has the time!</p>

<p>Dr. Vladimir Kvint, economist, professor and published author is well known throughout the international business community for his insightful observations and keen predictions of global trends. He is currently a professor of International Business at the Kogod School of Business at American University in Washington D.C. In addition to his professorship, he is currently and has been a consultant to several foreign governments. Dr. Kvint’s work has been appeared in such well-known publications as the New York Times, The Harvard Business Review, among others. He is a regular contributor to Forbes magazine in which he published his most profound forecast in 1990, predicting the fall of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>1. Beginnings in Siberia</p>
<p>Dr. Kvint was born the son of two successful professional engineers in the very heart of Siberia in what was unfortunately the capital of Stalin’s infamous labor camp, Gulag. He then moved to Norilsk, the most northern city in the world, located 1,000 miles above the Arctic Circle. He began his 14-year career in the non-ferrous metals industry at the age of 14 as a construction and metal worker. Most of Dr. Kvint’s education was completed in parallel with his professional and athletic activity. By the age of 28 Dr. Kvint had established himself as the Chief Economist and Vice Chairman of a major Russian high-tech company in addition to successfully earning his Ph.D. in Economics, and being well educated in the fields of Mining-Electrical Engineering and Law.</p>
<p>2. Topics of Research and Forecasts</p>
<p>30 years of Dr. Kvint's research and scholarly activity have been dedicated to the creation of theories on new regional economic development and emerging market countries. Among Dr. Kvint's achievements are the Theory of Regionalization of Scientific-Technological Progress; an evaluation of the role of the scientific-technical strategy in the regional economy; the development of the methodology of regional programs; the Theory of the Global Emerging Market; the system of optimization models of business strategies in emerging markets and the development of economic solutions to poverty, unemployment and migration.</p>
<p>While his strategic analyses and forecasts of events are not infrequently outspoken, controversial, and at times even criticized as outlandish or impossible, in hindsight, they have been remarkably accurate and insightful. Indeed, it becomes evident that his forecasts are soundly grounded in detailed analysis of fact, coupled with a unique perspective and the wisdom gained of a long and unique career.</p>
<p>One of his most outstanding and accurate forecasts was published in 1989, proclaiming that “by 1992 there will be no country called the Soviet Union”. In fact, the Soviet Union disappeared in December of 1991. Dr. Kvint’s cover story in the February 1990 issue of Forbes Magazine was called “Russia Should Quit the Soviet Union”, and received worldwide attention.</p>
<p>Among his well-known forecasts are: accurate prediction of exchange rate between East and West Deutche Mark during unification of Germany; prediction of an early stepdown of President Yeltsin and his replacement by a successor in uniform; ruble's default in 1998, etc.</p>
<p>3. Executive Experience in Heavy Industry</p>
<p>Despite an invitation to work as an associate professor in Moscow, Dr. Kvint returned north to Norilsk, the most Northern city in the world, located above the Arctic Circle. Between 1975 and 1976, he continued his work in the metallurgical industry. He founded and was Chief of the Department of Organization Management at the Norilsk Mining –Metallurgical Concern, which was the largest Russian enterprise (150,000 employees) and still the largest producer worldwide of nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium and osmium. Under his leadership, the company’s first General Organizational Structure, focusing on the improvement of final products was developed. The theoretical results of his work were published in Moscow in 1976, "The Acceleration of the Industrial-Technical Development". This book received the U.S.S.R. Annual Award “Best Popular Scholarly Book of the Year”.</p>
<p>In 1976, Dr. Kvint was promoted to the position of Deputy Director General and Deputy Chairman of “Sib Tsvemet Automatica,” a scientific-technological company, which automated the nonferrous metals industry throughout the former U.S.S.R. He was responsible for economic policy, business planning, the organization of compensation systems, and accounting departments in this company of 5,000 employees. Under Dr. Kvint’s economic strategy, this company became one of the first self-sufficient firms in the U.S.S.R. despite the Soviet command planning system. In addition, he was Chief of the Forecasting Economics Laboratory of the Nonferrous Metals and Gold Industry, and prepared strategies and forecasts for the nonferrous and precious metals and diamond industries.</p>
<p>4. Leadership of the first ever Arctic Seaway Economic Expedition</p>
<p>In 1978, he was invited to join the most prestigeous think-tank, established in 1724 by Peter the Great - the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, and was elected as the Chief of the Department of Regional Problems of Scientific-Technological Progress at the Institute of Economy and Industrial Organization of the Siberian Branch of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences. The Siberian School of Economics was at that time under the leadership of the world renowned economists Abel Aganbegyan and Leonid Kantorovich.</p>
<p>In the Academy, Dr. Kvint found a tremendous lack of accurate empirical statistics and economic information. As a result, many economic studies based on this inaccurate information had no practical use. With Dr. Kvint’s business experience, he immediately recognized this serious problem and developed the methods of studying economic situations, natural resources, and strategic business opportunities through the organization of Complex Economic Expeditions. In 1979 the Chairman of the Siberian branch of the Academy appointed him to head these expeditions. Several of these major expeditions were unprecedented. For example, in 1980 the academicians ventured across the entire eight seas of the Arctic Seaway by ship, helicopter and SUV. Another economic expedition traveled through three seas along the entire Pacific Coast of Russia to evaluate the area’s natural resources and productive forces.</p>
<p>5. Research at the Russian Academy of Sciences (Moscow)</p>
<p>In 1982, Dr. Kvint was elected as a Senior Researcher and then as the Head of Department and later a Leading Scholar at the Institute of Economics of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences (Moscow). During these seven years he discovered and developed the concept of two new global trends: Regionalization and Technologization. He defined the category of regional scientific-technological policy and the role of this policy in the reduction of poverty and ecological protection. In the late 1980’s he came up with the theory of regional and global emerging markets. In 1986, he wrote the report on the organization of strategic development of scientific-technological process which he brought to the attention of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, explaining that without the activation of these factors, as well as the function of motivation, the Soviet Union would have no economic future. After this predication, Dr. Kvint again faced a great deal of pressure from the Soviet power structure.</p>
<p>In 1985, Dr. Kvint prepared his second Doctoral dissertation on the “Regional Management of the Scientific-Technological Development of the National Economy”. Among the consequences of Dr. Kvint’s recommendations would have been the decentralization of the Soviet command economy. As a result, he was not allowed to present his dissertation to the Scientific Council until February of 1988, when he finally received the highest scientific degree in the Soviet Bloc, “Doctor of Sciences in Economics”. In 1989, he received the lifetime title of “Professor of Political Economy” - the highest state academic title in the former Soviet Bloc. During his years at the Academy he experienced great support of three prominent economists: Leonid Abalkin, Abel Aganbegyan and Aleksandr Granberg.</p>
<p>The fundamental ideas of Dr. Kvint’s theories were explored in his dissertations and books. Since 1989, he has continued his studies in Austria, and then in the United States. However, the development of his theory of the Global Emerging Market has its roots in all of his years of scholarly activity. For these studies, Dr. Kvint would later receive international recognition.</p>
<p>6. European Professorship and International Lecturing</p>
<p>In 1988 and 1989, Dr. Kvint was finally allowed to travel outside of the Soviet Union, upon which he gave speeches and lectures on the results of his studies. He was invited to many universities and prestigious academic centers in Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, Luxemburg, China, the United States, Great Britain, and Germany. Among his many lectures was his speech in front of the Presidium of the Royal Belgian Academy of Sciences. In 1989-1990, he worked as a visiting professor at the Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration, an institution with more than 100 years of history.</p>
<p>Dr. Kvint has lectured at universities in Albania, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Canada, Estonia, Georgia, Germany, Great Britain, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Mongolia, Poland, Russia, Switzerland, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United States, and Uruguay.</p>

<p>The Macclesfield Band, began life in February 1997 as a group of friends under the leadership of Ken Mackintosh, who met twice a week to make their kind of music. Originally intended as a 10-piece band, at least for its first year of existence, word quickly spread amongst like-minded players and, by April 1997, the band boasted a full complement of 27 players. Silk Brass has enjoyed several successful years in the contesting arena, not only locally in the Whit Friday contests over the past 5 years, as far a field as the Isle of Wight in 1998. The Band won the Entertainment's Contest here with comments from the adjudicator James Scott "this band should be competing at Championship level!" In the 1999 contesting season the band had an unprecedented victory at the High Peak championships scoring 197 points out of a possible 200 with the very demanding test piece 'The Land of the Long White Cloud.' 2002 contesting season has seen the Band winning at Rolls Royce in Derby, 2nd placing at the North West Area Championship qualifier at Blackpool,qualifying the band to play at the National Championships of Great Britain, 1st place at the National Champions of Great Britain which titles the band as British Champions 2002/2003 3rd Section. Silk Brass released its first CD in 2003 with the recording of "The Land Of The Long White Cloud" the test piece which placed them as national champions.</p>

<p>John Philip Morier (1778-1853), British diplomat, was born on 23 November 1778 in Smyrna, the eldest son of Isaac Morier, a Swiss-born merchant British by naturalisation and a member of the London-based Levant Company, and Elizabeth Clara Van Lennep. Educated privately in England he worked in his father's Smyrna business between 1794 and 1798. In 1799, through the influence of his uncle by marriage, William Waldegrave, a distinguished naval officer and later Baron Radstock, he went to Constantinople as one of the secretaries to the Ambassador, 7th Earl of Elgin, who sent him in 1800 as his representative with the Turkish army then fighting Napoleon's army which had invaded Egypt. He was briefly a prisoner of the French but returned to London in 1803 from where, next year, he was sent out as British Consul-General for the 'Morea, Albania and the adjacent territories of the Ottoman Empire' with the principal task of encouraging local resistance to any French attempts to gain control in that area. In this capacity he had many dealings with the notorious Ali Pasha of Ioannina in northern Greece. He returned to England in 1809 and spent some time studying at Cambridge University before being sent to Washington as Chargé d'Affaires in 1810. He returned to London in 1813 as an Under-Secretary in the Foreign Office. He was sent on a special mission to Norway for a few months in 1814, in which year he married Horatia Seymour, daughter of Vice Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour. In 1816 he was sent to Dresden as Minister Plenipotentiary and retired from there in 1824. He died in London on 20 August 1853, his wife dying only six days later.</p>

<p>The Antilla is World War II shipwreck off the coast of Aruba that is a popular snorkeling and scuba diving destination.</p>
<p>When Germany invaded Holland on May 10, 1940, the relationship between the two nations was obviously strained. As part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, this extended to Aruba. The Antilla was a U-boat supply ship that was anchored off the coast of Aruba at the time. A contingent of Dutch Marines gave the ship 24 hours to surrender.</p>
<p>The Antilla was fairly new at the time, and rather than see her turned over to the enemy, the Captain decided to scuttle the ship. After putting the crew ashore, he heated up the boilers, which are amidships, and opened the sea cocks. When the cold sea water hit the hot boilers, they exploded, ripping the ship in half. It sank in eight minutes.</p>
<p>The captain and crew were captured, and served out the remainder of World War II as prisoners.</p>
<p>At 400 feet long, the Antilla is the Caribbean’s largest shipwreck. It lies on its port side at a maximum depth of 55’, though it can readily be seen from the surface. It’s location is N 12.60175 W 070.05815.</p>

<p>Sean Michael Klitzner is a new comedic actor who was signed July 3, 2005 with the talent agency, Acme Talent and Literary. He won his signing on the E! Entertainment Television reality show, “Fight for Fame.” Sean started his comedic act when he defied the gender of his birth. All signs pointed that he’d be a girl, but he came out a boy. Other than childish pranks, nothing much happened until he attended the University of Miami, where he decided to show his comedic side with a camera and a computer. These clips of his comical side became known as his “Weekly Fixes,” and can be found at www.seanklitzner.com. At the University of Miami, Sean double majored in Film and Theater. A talent which is displayed throughout his “Weekly Fixes.”The “fixes” are split into two sides. One side shows a series of clips of a story that seems to have no end. The other side shows clips of random ideas that Sean had to put on his site to keep the returning audience entertained until he could continue the storyline side. Recently Sean added two more series of clips to his site, “Is Grandpa Harry Funny?” which Sean gets his grandpa to tell a joke and his friends’ judge to see if it’s funny or not. And, “Awkward Moments,” in which Sean films himself confessing awkward events that might have happened. Another ongoing series of clips is his “Weekly Mailbag,” where Sean answers people’s emails every week. Each “weekly Fix” takes about 35 hours to film, edit and add special effects. After graduating University of Miami after 3 years, Sean knew comedy was his life. He tried stand-up and improvisation, but knew he wouldn’t be totally happy until he was on a screen. He now resides in LA.</p>

<p>New Yorkers Resist the Apartheid Walls from Palestine to Mexico</p>
<p>On Saturday, November 11th, the Ad-Hoc Coalition for Justice in the Middle East and DRUM (Desis Rising Up &amp; Moving) held a workshop in Manhattan highlighting the parallels between the wall on the US-Mexico border and the Apartheid Wall in Palestine. The workshop was immediately followed by a spirited march through Manhattan with protesters carrying a long black cloth “wall” as they snaked through the crowded New York City streets.</p>
<p>Dena Qaddumi of the Ad Hoc Coalition introduced the workshop by noting that the event was being carried out in conjunction with the International Week Against the Apartheid Wall called by Stop the Wall: Palestinian Grassroots Anti-Apartheid Wall Campaign. She added, “It is wonderful that we can do this event in New York, focusing on the Apartheid Wall in Israel and the border wall between US and Mexico, connecting issues and bringing communities together to create movements that challenge racist policies. Similar events protesting Israel’s Apartheid Wall are happening all over the world this week.”</p>
<p>Fahd Ahmed and Fernando Reals from DRUM provided first-hand accounts of their recent visits to Palestine and Arizona. Their presentations focused on the similar repressive measures adopted by the Israeli and US governments against indigenous peoples, the devastating impacts the walls have on communities, and the forms of resistance that communities adopt to challenge the oppressive measures being utilized against them. Through moving photos from Palestine and Arizona, the DRUM activists showed the links between the struggle for immigrant rights in the US and the struggle for freedom in Palestine, including the common fights against racist travel bans, against militarized borders, and for dignity.</p>
<p>Fernando Reals explained that "migration isn't only about people coming to places, chasing the American Dream, but it is also about people being pushed out of places." He also spoke about the Palestinian children he had met during his recent visit, saying that if we possessed the same level of dignity and courage which these children have, we would achieve real strides in challenging racist policies here in the US.</p>
<p>Following the workshop, over 100 people marched around Washington Square Park and through the streets of Greenwich Village in Manhattan carrying two 6 ft. cloth “walls” covered with slogans calling for an end to the Apartheid Walls from Palestine to Mexico. The protesters hampered the normal flow of traffic and attracted a lot of attention with the walls, signs, flyers and chants. The lively chants in Spanish and English included: “From Palestine to Mexico, All the walls have got to go,” and “Bush, Escucha, Estamos en la lucha!!!”</p>
<p>Activists distributed information sheets highlighting some of the connections between the Wall being built by Israel and the Wall proposed in the Security Fence Act 2006 signed by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2006. Since 2002, Israel has been building a 400 mile long Wall that is preventing tens of thousands of Palestinians from reaching their places of work, school, health services, land for farming and sometimes even family members, usurping large tracts of land from the Occupied West Bank in Palestine. The Secure Fence Act signed by Bush authorizes the building of 700 miles of double-layer border wall between the United States and Mexico. Elbit Systems, Ltd., an Israeli company building and profiting from the Wall in occupied Palestine, has been awarded a contract to help build the US wall. The proposed multi-billion dollar U.S. wall will further separate border communities, break apart families, and increase the number of deaths on the border as immigrant workers are pushed deeper into the desert.</p>
<p>To express solidarity with the popular struggles in Palestine and Mexico against racism and state-sponsored violence, the march ended at the memorial service for NYC Indymedia journalist Brad Will who was murdered by government-backed paramilitaries in Oaxaca, Mexico, while he participated in and reported on that struggle for self-determination.</p>
<p>The event was organized by DRUM, Desis Rising Up &amp; Moving (www.drumnation.org), which organizes low-income South Asian immigrants and family to end detention, deportation and policing of immigrant communities, and the Ad-Hoc Coalition for Justice in the Middle East (www.mideastjustice.org) which is comprised of a number of New York based organizations including The New York Campaign for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, Jews Against the Occupation - NYC, International Socialist Organization, Action Wednesdays Against the War, International Solidarity Movement - NYC, Solidarity, Socialist Action, the National Council of Arab-Americans, the Network of Arab-American Professionals of NY-PC, The Queens Anti-War Coalition, American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, and the WESPAC Foundation. The event was endorsed by ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism), NYU- Students for Justice in Palestine, United for Justice and Peace (UFPJ) and the Arab Muslim American Federation.</p>

<p>The Laser 5000 is a skiff-style two man high performance sailing dinghy that was produced from 1993 to 1998. It is a two trapeze model where both helm and crew balance the boat via mast-suspended trapeze like the 49er Olympic class. The Laser 5000 also provides a very large asymmetrical spinnaker for high performance sailing.</p>
<p>There were in excess of 300 boats built in the class, with the bulk still actively sailing the United Kingdom and in Europe.</p>

<p>Miller Beach is located on the outskirts of Gary, Indiana on the south shore of Lake Michigan. Geographically it represents the southernmost point on Lake Michigan. The beach covers about 4 miles from the U.S. Steel breakwall on the west end to West Beach on the east end. The lake and beach can be accessed from two locations. The Lake Street Parking lot can hold around 100 vehicles and is open year round. From Memorial Day to Labor Day there may be a small fee to park in the lot if arriving after 7:00 am. During this time period there is also a usable boat launch. Marquette Park lies half a mile east of Lake street and has parking for several hundred vehicles year round.<br /></p>

<p><br />
The beach is popular for many outdoor activities but has gained popularity as a bird watching hotspot due to the number of rare birds that turn up in the area. From August to November bird watchers gather at Marquette Park to take shelter form the winds off the lake at a building known as the concession stand. From here, lake watches in sometimes gale force winds and terrible rain and snow are conducted for hours at the off chance of seeing a rare bird. In particular many “birders” that convene on Miller Beach, come to look for Jaegers. However, in the past forty years there are a number of remarkable records from lake watching.</p>
<p>Ken Brock is considered the local expert on the birds of the Indiana Dunes and the Indiana Lakefront. He is the author of the book, Birds of the Indiana Dunes, and can be found on most Saturday’s at the concession stand recording all the birds seen during a lake watch.</p>

<p>In 538 BC, Duzali, a man of great knowledge lived in the caves of mountains in ancient Tibet. His practices in spiritualism and shamanistic rituals allowed him to create “Belief,” the book of fundamental principles that states the purpose and ways life should be lived in order to attain salvation. This ancient book was uncovered by religious figures who did not want people practicing other religions, however it is now fully unscripted and very much in use. “Belief” was written after Duzali’s experiences with the paranormal worlds. His methods of reaching other worlds was through complex meditation and a ritual known to few as ‘Somatism,’ which is a deep state of sleep, where the pulse is still alive yet at a very slow level, and people can stay in that state of sleep for hundreds of years. On these Somatic trips, Duzali witnessed many things that he vividly remembered and would convincingly conceive as rules of life in his book, “Belief.” He was never greatly looked up to but through his fascinating words of inspiration that were so severely condemned by the religious figures, he was able to live a life of happiness and freedom: a lifetime in salvation rather than seeking salvation in his afterlife. “Belief” holds the answers to this lifestyle of salvation and defies the idea of Heaven and Hell, as well as an all-knowing, so-called ‘God.’ His experiences with the paranormal worlds led him to create this book, which to him and a few others was a religion, a faith in something he would forever follow and simultaneously achieve. He referred to this religion as “Crystalism,” translated from the Ancient Tibetan language. Crystalism had a set of principles that Duzali put his faith in. The word Crystalism was derived from ‘Crystal,’ which is something pure, clear, and innocent, without worries and uncertainties. “Belief” stated that everything is answerable if one shall only listen in oneself. The true answer to all is within the mind. There is no good or evil, no Satan or ever-eternal God; only the individuals mind. The mind knows when something is the correct thing to do, and it is up to that individual to deeply indulge in his morals and conscience to do what seems to be beneficial to continuing the life of purity, freedom, unity, and overall, salvation in this lifetime. Crystalism is a religion that may come simply, to some; yet it needs clarification to most. Even though it is a faith in oneself, the ones seeking guidance in the ever-eternal God need to see things in clarity as they purely are. The cave in which Duzali would experience Somatic trips is known to have crystal formations within. The cave was called Sjin Kloew, however in 182 BC, due to a cave-in, it has been lost forever. Duzali’s sights were enhanced by these crystals that surrounded him during his Somatic trips, and they allowed him to clearly portray his ideas into his written manuscript. He left a single sketch of a crystal with an aura that represents a mind which is at ease and in full potential of transformation into salvation.</p>

<p>David Richard Morier (1784-1877), British diplomat, was born on 8 January 1784 in Smyrna, the third (surviving) son of Isaac Morier, a Swiss-born merchant British by naturalisation and a member of the London-based Levant Company, and Elizabeth Clara Van Lennep. He was educated privately in England except for two years at Harrow school 1796/97. In 1804 he was employed as secretary to his eldest brother, John Philip, apppointed British Consul-General for the 'Morea, Albania and the adjacent territories of the Ottoman Empire'. He returned to England in June 1806 after experiences which led to his publishing in 1869 a novel 'Photo the Suliot: a tale of modern Greece' which unfortunately failed to attract a large readership. In June 1807 he accompanied Sir Arthur Paget on his mission to Constantinople to try to restore British relations with Turkey which had broken down in 1806. This mission failed and they withdrew to Malta at the end of 1807. Next year David accompanied Robert Adair appointed to try again and as a result became a close friend of Stratford (later Sir Stratford) Canning who was on Adair's staff. David was involved in some secret negotiations with the Turks which led to Adair's being formally accepted by them as ambassador. In August 1809 David was sent to join the staff of Sir Harford Jones in Tehran temporarily, returning to Constantinople in May 1810, at the special request of Stratford Canning who had now become Chargé d'Affaires there. They both returned to England in the early summer of 1812 on the arrival of the new ambassador, Robert Liston. In August 1813 David was taken on as secretary to the 4th Earl of Aberdeen, whom he had known at Harrow school, for Metternich's peace conference with Napoleon, and later he joined Castlereagh's personal staff during the negotiation of the first Treaty of Paris in 1814. That summer he married Anna, youngest child of Robert Burnett Jones, and then accompanied Castlereigh to the Congress of Vienna and , next year, for the negotiation of the second Treaty of Paris. He became Consul-General in Paris until April 1832 when he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to the Swiss Confederated States. He retired in June 1847. His wife died in 1855 but he survived into his 94th year, dying in London on 13 July 1877.</p>

<p>Cumberland County commissioners withheld support for the proposed CorridorOne project due to project sponsors' inability to provide information on finalized funding sources, efficacy of ridership projections, and inabililty to demonstrate substantial public support, and unwillingess to undertake substantive efforts, such as a referendum, that would provide such information.</p>
<p>The position of the commissioners also noted that 80% of the project cost would be absorbed by the new construction component of the plan (to be completed in Cumberland County) which represented approximately 5% of the planned mileage of the route, and that removing this segment would substantially reduce costs and thus improve prospects for federal approvals, while also alleviating the county's concerns over financial liability, and other concerns, including governance, management accountability and project sustainability. Cumberland County further allocated 1/2 million dollars for a bridge in Cumberland County to preserve the right-of-way for future railway or busway construction.</p>

<p>66% of all searches for "Elephant in the room" can be returned with the search "THE Elephant in the room" - this appears to be phrase that is used two-thirds of the time. I was very surprised to see that "The Elephant in the room" did not already exist in Wikipedia.</p>
