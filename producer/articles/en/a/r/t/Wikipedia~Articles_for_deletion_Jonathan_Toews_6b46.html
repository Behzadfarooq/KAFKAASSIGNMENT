<li><b>Comment</b>. I just denied speedy deletion of the article. The guy played in the national team for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_World_Junior_Ice_Hockey_Championships_adca.html" title="2006 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships">2006 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a> and seems to be highly ranked by the scouts for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_NHL_Entry_Draft_1d2b.html" title="2006 NHL Entry Draft">2006 NHL Entry Draft</a>. I don't know much about ice hockey, so I just guess he will be drafted and will be notable <i>six days from now</i>, which will make deleting this article five days from now a bit pointless. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 22:53, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I think he's notable already, but if not, he is guaranteed to be in exactly six days. And did you miss the section in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that says "highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States"? <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoojiBoy_02a7.html" title="User:BoojiBoy">BoojiBoy</a> 22:56, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Normally, i would say delete to an ice hockey player who has never played a single NHL game, but i feel differently about amateur players who are extremely high ranked with an extremely high possiblity of playing professionaly. It would be different, though, if he was a player with little to no chance of making the big leagues. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 01:54, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Wow, Toews is the highest Canadian prospect for the NHL draft. He is most definitely worthy of an article. -- <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTeterenko_c1e2.html" title="User:JamesTeterenko">JamesTeterenko</a> 02:28, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Yeah, Strong Keep</b>, I find it ironic that if this gets deleted for Toews not being notable enough, then a day or two after it is deleted he then becomes notable because of the draft. It'd save everyone a hassle if this is kept, just because it'll be re-created anyways on Saturday or Sunday by someone. Teterenko! You just edit conflicted me! <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroat_Canuck_c04a.html" title="User:Croat Canuck">Croat Canuck</a> <i><a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECroat_Canuck_1286.html" title="User talk:Croat Canuck"><font size="1"><font color="blue">Go Croatia Go</font></font></a></i> 02:30, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Seriously? Are the Deletionists on a big rally today? I'm sorry man it's been a bad day, but Kershner, this guy does deserves to have his own article. It's worth it. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 02:31, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> No offense taken. What I like about the AfD process, is that it is a relatively reliable way of finding out the notability and importance of a person. If I suspect vanity, I often aggressively pursue deletion. As in this case, articles where the subject has legitimate merit have more than the original creator to defend them. Such articles get kept, while the trash is deleted. The system works. &#160;:) Also, <a href="../../../h/e/y/WP%7EHEY_63b4.html" title="WP:HEY">WP:HEY</a>. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 02:36, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Hey-oh. Thanks, no offence was meant of course. And I agree the system works. We just have a guy right now trying to delete hockey team stubs and it is really annoying because he really just seems to be doing it for the pleasure of doing it. I respect the system and peoples opinions, I'm just annoyed by some peoples political agendas. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 06:23, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: "Sportspeople/athletes who have played ... at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including <i>college sports in the United States</i>." (emphasis mine) Ranked third on the Central Scouting rankings doesn't denote the "potential" to get drafted; it denotes a certainty that he's not going to fall below the top ten in the first round. This kid tied for fifteenth in the nation in goals as a <i>freshman</i> and is a first-line starter for one of the top programs in the NCAA. He's scarcely a scrub. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 02:44, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Toews is not a possible draft pick, he is a definite first round draft pick. He has played at the highest level of his age group, at the highest level of college athletics, and is projected to be a guaranteed NHLer. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 03:32, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. This guy doesn NOT meet the requirements of notability and should not be here. Maybe if actually achieves something this might change but WP should not be filled up with people with potential. Robertsteadman 09:10, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline, not a policy. Toews is an highly ranked draftee, the exception to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is worthy, much like <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Morrison_fea1.html" title="Adam Morrison">Adam Morrison</a> or any other listed here: <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_NHL_Entry_Draft_1d2b.html" title="2006 NHL Entry Draft">2006_NHL_Entry_Draft</a>, here: <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_NBA_Draft_9921.html#Projected_draftees" title="2006 NBA Draft">2006 NBA Draft#Projected draftees</a>, or any of draftees here <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_NFL_Draft_7574.html" title="2006 NFL Draft">2006_NFL_Draft</a> whose articles were created long before the actual event took place.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think this is pretty close to a consensus to close (one <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">dissenting vote</a> notwithstanding), but I can guarantee this article will see gigantic traffic come Saturday. Hopefully the AFD can be closed by then so there isn't a major influx of traffic on the AFD that might be disruptive. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoojiBoy_02a7.html" title="User:BoojiBoy">BoojiBoy</a> 14:25, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Toews is drawing interest from the public because of his draft ranking, he has played for Team Canada, and this stub will develop into a complete article once he is drafted this weekend. <a href="../../../p/m/o/User%7EPmorrow136_c14a.html" title="User:Pmorrow136">Pmorrow136</a> 17:41 ET, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
