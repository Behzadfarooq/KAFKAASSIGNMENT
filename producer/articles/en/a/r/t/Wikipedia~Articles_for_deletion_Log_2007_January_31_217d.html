<li><b>Comment</b> - Having authored articles in such publications as the New York Times and the Economist is, in my opinion, certainly enough to establish notability for a Wikipedia article, regardless of the greenlighting issue. The quality of such publications sets journalists whose articles they publish above the herd. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 22:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Being a columnist would be a different matter, but the fraternity of people who've published one NYT article is rather large. The WP:BIO criteria for authors seems to be reviews or awards; for a journalist, determining notability should be much the same. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 22:30, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, because there are oh so many reviews of newspaper articles. And <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> paper - the fact that there are a lot of notable journalists does not mean we should cover fewer of them. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 00:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, he's published six New York Times articles, not one. Also two Economist articles, two Slate articles, a wealth of stuff in MacWorld, and a bunch of things for Wired News.

<li><b>Delete.</b> It's difficult to search for media coverage ABOUT a journalist, because google turns up so much BY him. But I'm not seeing very much written about this person, and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> requires significant writing about him. Even in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenlighting.html" title="Greenlighting">greenlighting</a>, which is his strongest claim to notability, I'm not finding examples of anyone but himself writing about his role in it. Of course, someone else might come up with the sources I'm not seeing. -<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisherQueen_a50d.html" title="User:FisherQueen">FisherQueen</a> (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User_talk%7EFisherQueen_b952.html" title="User talk:FisherQueen">Talk</a>) 22:39, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What? Journalists tend to be more notable for their own contributions than what people write about them. I know of very few who would pass notability on the grounds of other people writing about them. But that's OK, since "has written for the New York Times" tends to be pretty good. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 00:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> This is getting ridiculous. Are you just trying to wear us all down? I guess so. Let me repeat the argument I gave in the past two VfDs: Media sources often publish no information about who its authors are, other than their byline. Wikipedia articles about journalists allow a transparency that otherwise might not exist. At a time when even our most respected media sources, such as the New York Times, are being called out for not properly investigating <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/opinion/28pubed.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/opinion/28pubed.html" rel="nofollow">the ties and backgrounds of its writers</a>, is Wikipedia not a valid source for looking up more information on the backgrounds of the people who are shaping our impressions of the news? Wikipedia is not a printed encyclopedia. More information is better. If even one person who wants to know more about Farivar or any other writer, including background that might influence their writing on a particular topic, gets that information from Wikipedia, it has served its purpose. Wikipedia is not Who's Who. It should be expansive. <a href="../../../j/s/n/User%7EJsnell_4a6e.html" title="User:Jsnell">Jsnell</a> 17:38, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just because a media source doesn't publish information about its authors, doesn't mean Wikipedia fills that niche; <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a> of journalists or anything else. Just like any other journalist, until Farivar receives "multiple independent reviews of or awards for (his) work", or fulfills any of the other <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines, he is simply not notable enough for his own article. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 20:03, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The previous keep vote has no grounding in Wikipedia's policies. We do not compromise our notability guidelines to combat potentially false information in other mediums. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 00:20, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We compromise our notability guidelines whenever we feel like it - that's why their guidelines, not policies. Furthermore, it's clearly the case that the author guidelines are poor choices for journalists, considering the paucity of meta-reporting. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 02:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. There are no 100% objective criteria for anything except in Mathematics. Everything else is to some degree subjective. Clearly there are a lot of pseudoscientic concepts around, like e.g. creationism etc. A list of things that are considered to be pseudoscientific by the scientific community is a pretty objective and verifiable criterium.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It's certainly not like a list of politicians that have been called idiot at all.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Having no references is not an article deletion criterion, nor are POV problems. Also, "objectivity" is not the overarching standard for content inclusion on Wikipedia (this term is even avoided on policy and guideline pages); <b><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a></b> is. The standard for inclusion on this page is that members of the scientific community have labeled a field or concept as pseudoscientific. Whether a field of endeavor or concept has been labeled so is verifiable. <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 01:16, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Science and pseudoscience can be judged in the same way that the relability of sources can be judged. The notion that it is just someone's POV is silly, foolish and dangerous and the sort of thing I'd expect to hear some one who's found their own pet crank theory listed here.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. While the list itself may not have references, the articles on each individual topic have plenty of references to support being labeled as pseudoscientific.

<li><b>Keep</b> This list is a good complement to, cf. <a href="../../../c/s/l/WP%7ECSL_69ec.html" title="WP:CSL">WP:CSL</a>. AS <a href="../../../c/g/_/WP%7ECG_8b50.html" title="WP:CG">WP:CG</a> says, "Categories appear without annotations, so be careful of NPOV when creating or filling categories. Unless it is self-evident and uncontroversial that something belongs in a category, it should not be put into a category. A list might be a better option." Thus, having this list allows a topic to be listed along with information about who said it is pseudoscientific and why. And that, mis amigos, is what NPOV and VER are all about. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 01:52, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is unencyclopedic. All it materially consisted of was a cut and paste from the Internet Sacred Text Archive from a source dating to somewhere in the 1800s, meaning that it is possibly completely inaccurate with respect to modern obligations. Without that, as the article currently stands, there is nothing else to say about the topic that isn't already mentioned in the main <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> article. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 00:39, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - The problems with the 1800s source go beyond being inaccurate with today's masonic rituals. It was not even accurate in respect to any ritual used in the 1800s. While the selection that was cut and pasted conveniently did not include it, another section of the source has Masons swearing to obey the rules and regs of a "General Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the United States of America" - a body which never existed. Without that material, the article is indeed duplicative of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> article. And while "secret masonic rituals" may be an interesting or "cool" topic for non-masons, an article that is duplicative of another is unencyclopedic. And before the usual "Keep, but clean up" croud chimes in... the article already says everything that can be said on the topic.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> That's precisely the trouble - there is no true and current version, because there is no one single universal Masonic ritual. It is decided upon individually by each Grand Lodge. There are always going to be differences, and there's no one obligation that takes precedence as "correct". People are constantly going to be debating on this, changing the article so it matches what they know. If this article material exists on ISTA, why simply duplicate it here? This is not WP's purpose, and there's nothing that can be said that isn't already mentioned in the main Freemasonry article. I fail to see the <i>encyclopedic value</i> in this article, which is why I put it up for AfD. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 19:26, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is also the problem that Masonic rituals have traditionally been unpublished.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I understand what you are getting at, but you cannot republish current, verifiable versions as to do such would be a gross breach of copyright. I am breaching no masonic rule when I tell you that they were last majorly revised (under UGLE juristriction) in 1986, and can perfectly legitimately be found within <a href="http://www.lewismasonic.com/product_info.php?products_id=53" class="external text" title="http://www.lewismasonic.com/product_info.php?products_id=53" rel="nofollow">this book</a>, if you are willing to pay £12. I cannot speak for other juristrictions. To reiterate, these are not secrets and so there is no reason why masons would be trying to hide them. The versions given on the article are not at all verifiable, and so should be removed. Once they are removed, there is nothing in this article that isn't in the freemasonry article. Therefore, the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_b339.html" title="User:Dave">Dave</a> 21:53, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> The article content itself doesn't appear to add anything to the existing portfolio and appears to be a vehicle to bear un-representative material. The explanation given already indicates why the padding is superfluous and inaccurate, providing a reference for contemporary material. I suppose there could be potential to expand into a discussion of obligations in general, perhaps including material about the promises one makes when being baptised and confirmed in the Christian church etc, but without this broadening it's an de-contextualised section from elsewhere which doesn't say anything more than is already explained in context.ALR 23:07, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As articulated by <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">User:Blueboar</a>, the only material that remains after removal of all that is non sourced is duplication of article content found elsewhere upon wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_b339.html" title="User:Dave">Dave</a> 00:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Blueboar and others and <b>redirect</b> to main Freemasonry article - without the alleged (and I've yet to see any proof it is accurate, or was/is used by any masonic body) obligations, nothing here that isn't covered allready in main article. As to the wisdom of including alleged obligations without any proof to it's accuracy... I feel that goes against <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, but others milage may vary. <a href="../../../w/e/g/User%7EWegianWarrior_abbf.html" title="User:WegianWarrior">WegianWarrior</a> 07:17, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> if only source for full reproductions of obligations is Sacred Texts Archive, then we have a few problems: first of all, ISTA is currently being looked at for a number of copyright violations by the heirs of some author's whose work is on ST. This makes Sacred Texts, as a source, a poor choice. Secondly, given that all jurisdictions use their own version of the ritual, there is no way for the article to be a comprehensive encylopedic look at it. All that can bee said, if direct quotes are given, is that "This is what Duncan's says the obligations are. What the actual versions as used by various jurisidictions are, is speculative and original research."--<a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidkun_7f51.html" title="User:Vidkun">Vidkun</a> 17:25, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> both objections are spurious. As Duncan's was first published in 1866, there is no possibility that it is still protected by copyright. Also, it is available in print as well as from ST. ST provides a convenient source for instant verification. Two, Masonic editors keep removing or revising two sources which say that Duncan's is still in use in some Prince Hall jurisdictions, particualar Missouri. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater_Xyzzy_0e2b.html" title="User:Frater Xyzzy">Frater Xyzzy</a> 17:37, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> neither objection is spurious. Sacred texts as a website should not be used because of the ongoing copyright issues on various other items. I'm well aware that Duncan's is public domain, however, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> has commentary about not linking to sites which reproduce copyrighted material. ST <i>themselves</i> say they can't get copyright clearances on some of the stuff they reproduce, thus disqualifying them as a source for wikipedia. And as for the second, you can show that one Masonic author claims the PHA Missouri uses Duncan's. Can you prove that any other one does? If not, why not title the article "Obligations of Freemasonry from Duncan's exposé, as used by PHA MO"? why aren't you trying to include the material from "Three Distinct Knocks" or "Jachin and Boaz", which would easily show that, among the exposés there is disagreement on what the obligations are.--<a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidkun_7f51.html" title="User:Vidkun">Vidkun</a> 17:44, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I think the article breaks up the rather lengthy Freemasonry article and provides a sample of obligations.

<p>I know this article has come up for debate twice before and voted to keep, but since then it seems a more stringent consensus has been reached and a lot more esoteric programming languages have been deleted as non-notable, including the entire <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_esoteric_programming_languages_24ba.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of esoteric programming languages">List of esoteric programming languages</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the creator and primary editor of this article. (Jerem43)</li>
</ul>
<p>The are several reasons I created the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>To help show how BK adapts it product lines for the local taste across the globe. Being a large multinational corporation, Burger King has chosen to adapt its product lines to the markets they are operating in. The Burger King menu items article is in fact showing a facet of the corporate business strategy BK has chosen to employ as it expands globally.</li>
<li>There were numerous commentaries in the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Talk%7EBurger_King_ccf5.html" title="Talk:Burger King">Burger King Talk</a> section about article being US-centric, specifically the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_King_5522.html#Products" title="Burger King">Products</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_King_5522.html#Advertising" title="Burger King">Advertising</a> sections. Because of the large number of local menus and advertising programs BK has around the globe, to add all of the information from all global menus and advertising would make the primary article too large and unwieldy. With this in mind, I created the two secondary articles Burger King menu items and <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_King_advertising_7294.html" title="Burger King advertising">Burger King advertising</a> to more accurately and thoroughly cover the information.</li>
<li>The main <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_King_5522.html" title="Burger King">Burger King</a> article was over the 50 KB range, because people had added information to the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_King_5522.html#Products" title="Burger King">Products</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_King_5522.html#Advertising" title="Burger King">Advertising</a> sections of the article n an attempt to address point 2.</li>
<li>After seeing the <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford.html" title="Ford">Ford</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unilever.html" title="Unilever">Unilever</a> and other articles, there seemed to be a precedence of showing products of these corporations. In each of these articles there there is a master list or table of contents listing the products the companies sell or manufacture. Furthermore that list or TOC have links to secondary articles that give more detail on the products. While the Burger King menu items is a separate article from the main <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_King_5522.html" title="Burger King">Burger King</a> article, it is providing the same function of the lists that are seen in those other articles. Please note that the there is a request to separate the Ford article into a main corporate article and a separate product article, this would follow the same structural pattern that I used in creating this article.</li>
<li>In listing the menu items, I was attempting show how BK uses corporate cross licensing to help grow market share. Specifically, in the Beverages section you will see that BK sells specific products of other companies (<a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-Cola_Corporation_09d6.html" title="Coca-Cola Corporation">Coca-Cola Corporation</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadbury-Schweppes_9687.html" title="Cadbury-Schweppes">Cadbury-Schweppes</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/s/Nestl%C3%A9.html" title="Nestlé">Nestlé</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hershey%27s.html" title="Hershey's">Hershey's</a>) to help drive customer sales. It has been shown that people exhibit brand loyalty, and this is one way BK exploits that brand loyalty in boosting its market share.</li>
<li>In listing the menu items, I attempted show how BK targets specific demographic markets. If you read the article, you will see that several, but not all, have the demographic target that BK is attempting to reach with that product. (I had been cleaning up other BK related articles and was going to finish the tagging demographic markets of the products, but had not gotten back to the article.)</li>
<li>Burger King is not in all markets: China, Russia and many other nations do not have Burger King restaurants. The Burger King menu items article could provide people of these regions an idea of what BK sells. This adheres to the mission of Wikipedia in providing an unbiased informational source. If people of those markets went to BK's corporate web site for that data, they would not be getting unbiased information.</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on these facts, the '<i>Burger King menu items</i> article is not trivia or just a list of menu items, but instead it helps to show some of the corporate strategies (e.g. demographic targeting, co-branding and local market awareness) BK employs in competing in the global market.</p>
<p>In addition, I am sure that if you research the Wikipedia database you will find similar precedence of having a separate article relating to products sold by a corporation.</p>

<dd>There is a major difference between a list of products from something like <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-Cola_916a.html" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> or <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford.html" title="Ford">Ford</a> from this, the main thing is that it's a store, that the menu here can change all the time and it's different for all parts of the world, unlike ford kraft or coca-cola. You are basiclly saying that you are endorsing articles of a listing of every product for every major brand like <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a>, which wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for, there is a limit Jaranda <a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJaranda_87d5.html" title="User talk:Jaranda"><sup>wat's sup</sup></a> 21:30, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your argument is flawed.
<ol>
<li>Wal*Mart is a retail chain, not a manufacturer. Burger King <i>is</i> a manufacturer, specifically of a food product that is designed for immediate consumption. You do not think of it as a manufacturer, but it is. A store is a retail establishment that usually sells pre-manufactured products, while a manufacturer takes raw or semi finished materials and constructs a product to sell. The product maybe sold at a retail establishment, on on-site or through private vendors. In addition, a restaurant, while not only manufacturing the product (food), it provides a place to consume the product (food), but does not have to.</li>
<li>The menu does not change on a consistent basis, in fact is fairly stable. BK offers special products on occasion (e.g. special Whopper varieties) as does Coca-Cola (e.g. Special flavors of Sprite) and Ford (e.g. Eddie Bauer Explorer). Like Ford, it removes non-selling (Ford Excursion, CCC's Tab product) products from its lines when necessary.</li>
<li>Wikipedia provides an informational source of products manufactured by Hershey's, Nestle and others. They are manufactures of food products designed for resale, while restaurants such as BK or McDs are are manufactures of food product designed for immediate consumption; just because the food is consumed in different venues does not matter, both groups should be treated equally.</li>

<dl>
<dd>Yes it is. The point is that a restaurant is specialized form of manufacturing with multiple manufacturing locations and whose product is designed for immediate consumption by its customers. Just because it is a restaurant does not mean that it should be treated any differently than the other manufacturing companies listed in Wikipedia. The article is not just a list of products, but a slice of the way BK targets its consumer base: it has data on the demographics the products target, reasons why it chooses to remove products from its menu and what BK does to its menu to compete in "foreign" markets. I fully intend to expand the article further to explain the process BK bring its products to market (I worked in the hospitality industry for 25 years and have experience with market development of products), which will help make the article truly encyclopedic.

<dd>Ah, so you are arguing that Burger King outlets are not the same as other stores, they are actually (manu)factories? I would be interested in some evidence to back this claim up, especially considering that, where applicable, local licensing authorities class them as retail outlets *not* factories, and Burger King agrees. In the UK, for example, Burger King would not be allowed to open one of their factories in an area designated for retail. I suspect the same holds true elsewhere. Could anyone give me an example in the US, say, where a shopping mall contains a mixture retail outlets, Burger Kings and a steel mill? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 08:06, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your are twisting my argument- At no time did I use the term <i>factory</i>. You are seeking to discredit my argument with data that seem to be applicable but are really not. You do not have to have a giant mill or factory to manufacture a product. Examples would the people who make hand crafted jewelery, weavers who make there own cloth for sale, tailors who manufacture custom clothing, potters who make hand thrown stoneware- all of these people are manufacturing products, usually in a small location that also usually serves as their retail outlet. Yes BK is a retail outlet- it serves food products that are manufactured on site, as do brewpubs, bakery cafes, chocolate stores, small coffee roasting houses etc. Look at the definition of manufacturer from Webster's:</dd>

<dd>Function: noun</dd>

<dd>Notice that it does not say giant factory or mill. Based on the definition, all restaurants are manufactures; just as Coca-Cola, Nestle, Ford, Sony, Dow etc are. Just as these companies' products are important and noteworthy, restaurant menus from these fast food restaurants are too- they affect major societal issues like health (Mr. Spurlock's film showed this), the economy (several million burgers are sold each day generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue) and business practices (these companies spend millions on product development, and the failure of these items can be detrimental to the company). The menu is an integral part of the business operations of these companies and to delete them would be removing an important piece of the main article. I have stated my opinion as why Jarada's argument for deletion is flawed and that the article should be kept. I believe that it meets accepted Wikipedia standards for articles.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Burger King is absolutely notable, nobody would even consider deleting an article on them. What are they notable for? Serving food. Accordingly, having information on the food they supply is essential for Wikipedia. I suppose this article could use some clean-up, maybe more of a historical perspective, but that's improvement, not deletion. I've said more on this subject in the McDonald's one, but basically, the nomination is flawed, and frankly, I do think any restaurant that gets an article on Wikipedia could quite possibly deserve an article on its menu. Disk space is cheap folks, and if we don't cover the food provided by these companies, well, I'd say that would cause problems. Providing more information is what Wikipedia is about, not less. Yeah, listing everything sold by Wal-Mart or Amazon might be a bit much, but listing all the software made and sold by Microsoft? Or Apple and their computer models? Or Ford and their cars? Or Coca-Cola and their beverages? Of course not. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:33, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I do not feel you are correct in your understanding. Every outlet will not be included, only the menus of restaurants which are notable enough for inclusion. Thus mom and pop hamburger stand will not be covered, unless for some reason they, and their menu is notable. The same goes with every individual McDonald's or Burger King. Or even some sections of franchisees. I might understand your complaint if this was say a list of a restaurant chain's stores and their menus/addresses. But it's not. That would be a problem. But the overall pattern? Completely reasonable to cover. Also special events, say, if the McDonald's in some special location has some super-food item that gets heavy news coverage. Your arguments about size are also not recognizing something: Wikipedia is not <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">not paper</a>, which explains why it's perfectly feasible to include this information. It's really no different than having an article for each and every member of the US Congress, and every other legislative body in the world. That may not be information you care about, but to me, not recognizing its importance is hard to fathom. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:10, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To clarify, I'm not saying that one article won't lead to another of course. I'm saying I have faith in the Wikipedia community to judge notability in such cases where the strongest argument for deletion seems to be "it's cruft" (tantamount to "I'm not interested in it"). Obviously the concept of an article on every Pokemon really rubs some people up the wrong way, but if others want that information and are willing to maintain it, and there's considerable community support then what's the problem? I presuming you're not suggesting that <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam.html" title="Gundam">Gundam</a> aren't notable enough for an article. So in this case, <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonalds_menu_items_790b.html" title="McDonalds menu items">McDonalds menu items</a> should be OK because <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonalds_bd82.html" title="McDonalds">McDonalds</a> is notable.

What's mentioned in the History article has to do more with which artwork was implemented when (Uncle Pennybags/Mr. Monopoly starting in US editions in 1936, but not in most of the rest of the world until later, and even then only on the game's logo). A major point that tried to be made in the two articles is how the cards, and thus the gameplay, changed from 1933/34 through 1936 in the United States, and how further changes were made from US to UK editions (and elsewhere), because of cultural differences. The articles deliberately do NOT go in depth into EVERY variation made for EVERY edition of Monopoly since the 1990s, as that would be ridiculous and an absolute violation of the point you made. They are currently brief lists, and works in progress. My only OTHER suggestion would be to merge them with information about selection/retirements of tokens (and the UK wartime spinner, etc) into an article along the lines of History of Monopoly game equipment. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 03:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Wikipedia does not need "to cover Monopoly fully" and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for that purpose. Wikipedia needs to cover Monopoly "encyclopedically", that is, describe how reliable sources discussed it and how it influenced culture, game design, any gaming hobby that may have existed then, the modern gaming hobby, or other things that might pass the "hundred year test". Changes in particular cards -- cards which do not drive the game and rarely have more than a minor influence on who wins or what choices players make next -- don't belong in this category, unless multiple sources clearly demonstrate that they do. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:21, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I have to disagree here - I'm in full agreement with what JJay states (which is why these articles got forked off in the first place, along with the history article, which is an FA, and the pop culture references article, which is also a work in progress). The Monopoly article is TOO LONG to take on any more material. Again, I'd go for a "Monopoly Equipment" article, but I wouldn't upmerge these into <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly_%28game%29.html" title="Monopoly (game)">Monopoly (game)</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_board_game_Monopoly_af1d.html" title="History of the board game Monopoly">History of the board game Monopoly</a>, simply because of the length. I just pared down the lists to reflect the major differences between the 1935/1936 US editions and the 1936 UK edition, the two most widely known versions of the game in the English speaking world. Cards in other editions (South African, German, French) have based their texts on the UK edition. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 03:51, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What kind of a comment is that? These articles are not lists. And where exactly do you think the articles should be merged? That needs to be specified. I agree with you, though, that this should not be a discussion. AfD is singularly unsuited to address complicated editorial questions involving featured articles. I'm willing to venture that few of the commenters here have read any of our extensive coverage of Monopoly. Given that, drive-by comments by editors who have devoted one or two minutes to the issue do not serve much purpose. It is insulting to the editors who have devoted extensive time to working on the monopoly articles.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: These articles (as has the history article) have been developed wholly independently of ANY WikiProject. I'm offended that anyone would want to impose ONE project's guidelines on any article or series of articles. One project should NOT decide content or rules or guidelines to apply everywhere, not even EVERY game article. And even if these were developed by project members, exceptions are, should be and will be made. These two articles were developed with the game's early history in mind, modified to reflect cultural differences, and I'm pleased to see others calling for either a more in-depth view of the game's elements as a historical whole and others calling for a broader cultural view. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 03:03, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm not trying to "impose one project's guidelines" on this, I'm trying to hold it to Wikipedia's core standards. The guidelines at the BTG project are clarifying how those core standards apply in more detail to boardgame articles, which is why I referenced them instead of WP:V or WP:NOR. If the significance of these component changes in the game's early history is so significant that it should be featured in encyclopedic (not fansite) coverage, then you need to show why this is strong enough to be an exception. (I agree that the guidelines have flexibility for special cases, but WP:ILIKEIT is not a special enough case.) This is "excessive detail not appropriate for an encyclopedia" in my view as a gamer and as an editor; show me where reliable sources demonstrate great impact of the "cultural" "historical" differences, or stop being offended by people upholding WP policies. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 15:39, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The article still contains <i>no</i> claim of notability, <i>no</i> content about cultural influence, <i>no</i> content about how gameplay might be affected, <i>no</i> references indicating that anyone except the single niche author has ever cared, not even a link to anything on BoardGameGeek or other modern gaming reference sites.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't know enough about Australian politics to get involved in this one, but there are failed political candidates with their own Wikipedia entries which would seem to set precedent. For example <a href="../../../r/a/j/Raj_Bhakta_41fd.html" title="Raj Bhakta">Raj Bhakta</a>, who recently tanked in the 2006 race for <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania%27s_13th_congressional_district.html" title="Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district">my local district</a>.

<dd>Bhakta was a candidate for a federal legislature; Rishworth was a candidate for a state legislature (Krimpet, your equivalent would be the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_House_of_Representatives_8bd8.html" title="Pennsylvania House of Representatives">Pennsylvania House of Representatives</a>).

<dd>Huh? Rishworth is a <i>current</i> candidate in a federal (as with the Bhakta article), not state race (though she previously contested a state seat), and stands, unlike Bhakta, a very strong chance of winning. If we're keeping American articles on candidates who didn't stand a chance in hell, and deleting Australian articles on candidates who are very much favoured to win, then this is one hell of a double standard. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 06:38, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I was responding to the comment about failed candidacies in long-shot elections. Bhakta was a failed candidate in a federal election, which in and of itself made him notable. Rishworth's failed candidacy was for a state election; Krimpet and Timshift9's comments indicated they felt there was precedential value in a comparison between those two failed candidacies, which there really isn't. That both Bhakta (reality TV contestant) and Rishworth (current candidacy, youth leadership positions) have other claims to notability was beside the point of the comments. Personally, I think major-party candidates for state legislatures (in whatever country) are notable enough for articles. Clearly, that position is not in vogue; I've written enough subsequently deleted articles to realize that. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 13:28, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Rishworth has been preselected for the most marginal of 150 seats in the upcoming 2007 election. The Liberals won on a particularly strong 52.8% of the two party preferred vote at the 2004 election, so there is a strong chance that Rishworth will take it at the next election even if the polling showing the ALP ahead doesn't hold out - so she'll either be a successful or non-successful federal candidate. Not to mention she was president of Young ALP etc. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 14:04, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep</b> it seems to be well established elsewhere that major party candidates in a election for the legislative body are notable whether they win or lose. The doubts come in when the candidate is not from a major party. In any context I would regard getting one-third of the vote as substantial--at 5% or so it might be different. Some of the objections seem to be based on her politics, or speculation about her subsequent career.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Rishworth would not have been notable based on her previous unsuccessful run for state office, but she is notable for this one. Kingston is one of the seats most likely to change hands at the next election, and as such her name is repeatedly popping up in the newspapers, and will continue to do so over the next year.

<dd>How are there not reliable references? Just about very polling organisation in the country has been looking at Kingston in the last fortnight, and Rishworth appears in just about all the reporting on those polls. It is a patent double standard to keep a whole bunch of American federal candidates who never stood any chance, and to delete an Australian one in one of the most crucial races in the country. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 12:11, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

The doubts come in when the candidate is not from a major party. In any context, one-third of the vote as substantial--at 5% or so it might be different. The fact she also brought Labor ahead of the Liberals candidate to face them on the two party preferred vote as opposed to the Liberals in 2002, and also the fact she's been preselected in the country's most marginal of 150 lower house seats, Kingston at less than 0.1 percent, where a poll was done a week ago by The Advertiser newspaper in Adelaide of 550 electors in Kingston, with Labor on 56 percent of the 2PP.

<ul>
<li>The subject matter is encyclopedic. The subject? A list of foods served by the biggest chain of restaurants in the world. Millions eat McDonald's food every day. I think this is enough to claim that this belongs in an encyclopedia.</li>
<li>This is not an indiscriminate collection of information. The minimum requirements right now are any food items sold by McDonald's, past or present. This can be tightened up a bit if need be. The list can't possibly be "endless". Large? Duh.</li>
<li>Sources <i>exist</i> for this. Whether they be primary (from McDonald's) or secondary, they do exist.</li>
<li>Secondary sources have covered the subject of McDonald's food as a whole. Therefore, we are not inventing some new concept by mashing a bunch of unrelated subjects together. Here's something that was published just today: <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/business/234980,CST-FIN-Mac30.article" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.suntimes.com/business/234980,CST-FIN-Mac30.article" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></li>

<p><b>Keep</b> I cannot state it any better than RockMFR. The article is decent.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I think it's worthwhile. Pretty much everything can be verified (it's not as if McDonald's is a small chain with a supersecret menu) and the original research can be edited out. I think that the "regional dishes" section is important/interesting enough for the article stay. This is more than a menu, some of the entries include history and many others might be expanded in the same way. The article is too long for the intersting stuff to be merged back into any other McDonald's article. <b><a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikm_d2c0.html" title="User:Mikm"><span style="color: #36393D;">superapathy</span></a><a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikm_27e1.html" title="User talk:Mikm"><span style="color:#B02B2C">man</span></a></b> 04:33, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per most of those advocating same.

<li><b>Keep</b> before looking at the article, I thought the same as several people above: "<i>if Wikipedia starts including menus, then God help us all...</i>". However, looking at the article, I think it's a perfect example of the sort of international collaborative effort that is virtually only possible on Wikipedia. The article is NPOV, this is not a "fan page" as some have suggested.

In addition, the menu is not just a collection of products for sale but a form of advertising that targets demographic trends and groups as well as the tastes of the markets these companies operate in. These companies spend millions of dollars and thousands of man hours on developing products that will give them market share and is a major part of their operating budgets; these articles help demonstrate that. To delete these sub-articles would take away from the main articles and fail to demonstrate how one aspect of the modern restaurant chain business works. While I understand his initial reasoning that these articles were just a list of products, it is my belief is that Jarada may never have been fully exposed to the product development processes of modern business that these articles are trying to explain and may not fully understand the reasoning process that goes into creating products at a major, international chain (<i>I am <b>not</b> making a dig or insult of him, just trying to understand his thought process</i>).</li>

<dd>There is a major difference between a list of products from something like Coca-Cola or Ford from this, the main thing is that it's a store, that the menu here can change all the time and it's different for all parts of the world, unlike ford kraft or coca-cola.

<dd>Your argument is flawed.
<ol>
<li>Wal*Mart is a retail chain, not a manufacturer. Burger King <i>is</i> a manufacturer, specifically of a food product that is designed for immediate consumption. You do not think of it as a manufacturer, but it is. A store is a retail establishment that usually sells pre-manufactured products, while a manufacturer takes raw or semi finished materials and constructs a product to sell. The product maybe sold at a retail establishment, on on-site or through private vendors. In addition, a restaurant while not only manufacturing the product (food) a restaurant provides a place to consume the product (food), but does not have to.</li>
<li>The menu does not change on a consistent basis, in fact is fairly stable. BK offers special products on occasion (e.g. special Whopper varieties) as does Coca-Cola (e.g. Special flavors of Sprite) and Ford (e.g. Eddie Bauer Explorer). Like Ford, it removes non-selling (Ford Excursion, CCC's Tab product) products from its lines when necessary.</li>
<li>Wikipedia provides an informational source of products manufactured by Hershey's, Nestle and others. They are manufactures of food products designed for resale, while restaurants such as BK or McDs are are manufactures of food product designed for immediate consumption; just because the food is consumed in different venues does not matter, both groups should be treated equally.</li>

<dd>As on the Burger King outlets discussion above, you argue that a McDonalds is not the same as any other store, it is actually a factory. Again I ask you for evidence to back this up; McDonalds don't claim their outlets are factories, and where local authorities have powers to zone or designate specific activities in specific areas, they do not class McDonalds as factories. Show me an example of a shopping mall where such a mix is allowed - the shops, the McDonalds, the Ford truck engine plant etc. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 08:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your are twisting my argument- At no time did I use the term <i>factory</i>. You are seeking to discredit my argument with data that seem to be applicable but are really not. You do not have to have a giant mill or factory to manufacture a product. Examples would the people who make hand crafted jewelery, weavers who make there own cloth for sale, tailors who manufacture custom clothing, potters who make hand thrown stoneware- all of these people are manufacturing products, usually in a small location that also usually serves as their retail outlet. Yes BK is a retail outlet- it serves food products that are manufactured on site, as do brewpubs, bakery cafes, chocolate stores, small coffee roasting houses etc. Look at the definition of manufacturer from Webster's:</dd>

<dd>Notice that it does not say giant factory or mill. Based on the definition, all restaurants are manufactures; just as Coca-Cola, Nestle, Ford, Sony, Dow etc are. Just as these companies' products are important and noteworthy, restaurant menus from these fast food restaurants are too- they affect major societal issues like health (Mr. Spurlock's film showed this), the economy (several million burgers are sold each day generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue) and business practices (these companies spend millions on product development, and the failure of these items can be detrimental to the company). The menu is an integral part of the business operations of these companies and to delete them would be removing an important piece of the main article. I have stated my opinion as why Jarada's argument for deletion is flawed and that the article should be kept. I believe that it meets accepted Wikipedia standards for articles.</dd>

They are the world's largest retail concern after all.

<li><b>Keep</b> Let's see, nobody can question McDonald's overall notability, right? What are they notable for? Serving food. Heck, their food gets in the news with some regularity. (I know there were news articles about the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arch_Deluxe_d7db.html" title="Arch Deluxe">Arch Deluxe</a>, and I bet they even appeared on the Today show and Good Morning America. Thus covering their food is highly important. This article does a reasonable job of doing that, and in fact, the nomination for deletion makes a good argument for having this article.

<li>So, being arrogant, trying as many times to vanquish an article for good? Do you know how <i>immature</i> that is?

<ul>
<li>Well, I actually read that as saying that JuJube would take a keep decision as a grounds to review the deletion of the Burger King article, not as an intent to argue for the deletion of this one. Perhaps you might wish to ask if that was what he or she meant? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:27, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Since, generally, objects that number zero are pluralized (i.e. "there are zero sources"), saying that there are no sources is flatly misleading. Furthermore, that it is Internet-only is irrelevant - we're dealing here with an online magazine owned by the Washington Post.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> How is a single one-page article in Slate a year and a half ago any different than, as you said, being "mentioned once in passing in the New York Times"? From reading <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2123673/" class="external text" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2123673/" rel="nofollow">the article itself</a>, I get the impression that it seems to be more of a focus on the (somewhat self-aggrandizing IMO) adventures of the journalist "exposing" the hoax and getting ganged up on by the SA goons, rather than actually being an expository piece describing the hoax itself. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 20:23, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, since Slate didn't adopt pagination until this year, the page length isn't exactly relevant - it's a full-length article. As for the focus, I'm sorry that you're not fond of its writing style, but that does seem rather beside the point to its notability. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 20:37, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I never said I "wasn't fond of its writing style" let alone use that as an argument against its notability; you're heading into straw man country here. However I would say that the focus of the article is very relevant. It's a first-person narrative of the author finding and "exposing" the hoax, and being messed with by the hoax's perpetrators afterwards, more of an entertaining piece than an informative piece. I noted that the style is self-aggrandizing because it suggests that elements of the story could have been fictionalized to some degree for all we know; we have no other reliable sources at all, because this hoax was simply not notable enough. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 01:39, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's still a subjective judgment of the piece that is far beyond what is appropriate under <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The piece was published by Slate as non-fiction - that's sufficient to establish its relevance. If you have any objections to its content, they should be sourced, not original research. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 01:53, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that this illustrates the reason why we need <i>multiple</i> non-trivial sources to write an encyclopedia article. Especially for an article with "hoax" in the title. This is a common sense issue for me. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 02:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That would be relevant only if Slate were self-published.

<dd>I strongly disagree with the implication that Slate/Wash Post is "vouch[ing] for the event's notability."

<dl>
<dd>You do realize that totally goes against the entire distinction we make between self-published and independent sources, right? Slate thought the event was significant enough to pay for an article on it and publish that article. Slate is a highly notable publisher. In judging notability, I consider Slate's judgment that it was worth publishing on very important, and your judgment that Slate was wrong more or less irrelevant. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 23:22, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Slate's credibility is an entirely separate issue from whether everything that they write about is "notable" in the sense of the Wikipedia guideline. It is unlikely that Slate's editors took a look at our notability guidelines before publishing this article. This is why <i>multiple</i> non-trivial articles are necessary to establish notability. For example, in the current issue of Slate, there's an article by this guy about his wife's post-partum depression <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2158735?nav=tap3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2158735?nav=tap3" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. That doesn't make her notable enough for a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 00:14, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, it's multiple non-trivial mentions. One mention of this kind of substance is also, I think, significant. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 02:38, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be missing my point, which is that a full-feature coverage is at least as significant as two "non-trivial mentions." <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 03:46, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's pisses the point of having <i>multiple</i> non-trivial sources, i.e. not having to rely on a single source. We can dress this Slate article up all you want. The fact is that this greenlighting hoax is no more notable than the average internet meme and definitely not up to the criteria of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which doesn't say "multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself <i>or one really sweet full feature coverage in an internet periodical</i>." <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 03:49, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's also a guideline, and we're allowed to sod it if it seems poorly phrased, off base, or otherwise not useful. They're guidelines, not rules. Especially not WEB, which is disputed on the relevant section. And especially not since we're not talking about a website here, so it's not even clear to me that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is the operative guideline. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 04:03, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>WP:WEB is definitely the operative guideline for an internet hoax. In this case the article violates both the letter and the spirit of the guildine because the purpose of requiring mulitiple non-trivial sources is to limit out minor internet hoaxes which never achieved significance in the non-internet realm. We seem to just be repeating ourselves here. Why don't we just let some other people weigh in. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 07:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>This is a rare self-nomination- I wrote a bit of this article because when I found it it was a list and I was trying to broaden its potential. But, it's redundant to the plot summaries of the episode articles and to the article on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheese-eating_surrender_monkeys.html" title="Cheese-eating surrender monkeys">cheese-eating surrender monkeys</a>, and the list seems to attract OR- in case you're curious, Homer was originally listed as a Democrat, was then categorized as a Republican, and is now labelled a communist. I'm curious as to whether it will survive, I abstain. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 05:32, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b>: Perhaps the article should just be improved. The point of having theme articles is because in the main Simpsons page, you have to deal with people who say "a section The Simpsons stance on politics should be included", but instead, there is simply a link to this page. The Simpsons archive has a section on political leanings and other references. As for Homer, I don't think he has a specific party, but he has had republicanish thoughts. And, he has done Communistish things, which is why he's listed under a communism section, but perhaps that one can go. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 05:38, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Keep</b> and improve per Scorpion. It's certainly redundant with the episode articles, and some of the categorizations are suspect (really Homer's political views change depending on the plot, compare <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sideshow_Bob_Roberts_929d.html" title="Sideshow Bob Roberts">Sideshow Bob Roberts</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/There%27s_Something_About_Marrying_cff4.html" title="There's Something About Marrying">There's Something About Marrying</a>), but I agree that the topic is kind of unavoidable given the show's length and popularity, and The Simpsons has been analyzed on its religious and political content throughout the years. The article could certainly improved, but it's not bad as-is and at least close to the standards of <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_The_Simpsons_cbdd.html" title="Education in The Simpsons">Education in The Simpsons</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_in_The_Simpsons_3d04.html" title="Religion in The Simpsons">Religion in The Simpsons</a> <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 07:20, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This article should provide a discussion of the politics, but all it does is to summarize anything that happened on the show related to politics. You can write a good article about this, but it takes sources, which are hard to find compared to religion, psychology and philosophy, which has been the subject of some books. Since I can't find anything out-of-universe worth keeping that isn't already mentioned in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">main article</a>, then the best solution is to delete it and maybe someday somebody can start a fresh sourced article. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMaitch_8373.html" title="User:Maitch">Maitch</a> 19:52, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. While the DFBot summary has this AfD listed under no consensus (50%), the two keep and one weak keep votes seem to provide little to no support for their arguments, other than noting that there are stubs just as bad as this one in Wikipedia. Delete arguments on the other hand provide strong support, and the sudden waivering of former "keep" voters to neutral or delete suggests to me a deletion consensus. Ultimately, there's nothing in this article really worth saving and no one with enough knowledge or ability to research the topic to approve it. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 22:32, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I appreciate you pointing me to that guideline. However, I think this part of it actually strengthens the case for deletion: <i>While some demographic or directory-type information is essential to provide context about the place, it tends to make for a dry article if that's all the article contains. If the only verifiable information is along these lines, you probably shouldn't create a new article specifically about the place. Keep in mind that Wikipedia is not a directory.</i> This article provides no information besides location. If information can be found about a landmark or battlefield or "(random famous person) slept here," then I can understand how the "places of local interest" guideline might apply. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 07:50, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Comment--If it is Wikipedia policy that a town is automatically notable, then I will change to a keep.

<li><b>Keep</b>; I'd say that the thousands of auto-generated stubs from USA census data have kind of set a precedent about the notability of towns.

<li><b>Comment</b> - What is it? The article states it is a location. A location? Is it a town, a hill, a mountain, a valley?

<li><b>Delete</b>. The coordinates given are wrong (I'm about to change them - but even my finest-grained UK map doesn't show this place - and in the Highlands it shows things down to <i>farms</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - there seems to be dispute on whether this place actually exists. The coordinates are wrong and the map shows nothing, but there is a post code? Can someone clear this up? If it's just a mile marker or a nickname for a crossroads with a gas station, it probably doesn't warrant an article. -<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 07:49, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>My bad about the coordinates - I misread the decimals as minutes of arc, which put the place off the north coast of Scotland. It does exist - at least, it is mentioned as existing on quite a number of websites - most notably <a href="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/scotgaz/councils/councildetails17.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/scotgaz/councils/councildetails17.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the coordinates check with those at <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~agene/locations/a.html" class="external text" title="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~agene/locations/a.html" rel="nofollow">Rootsweb's location page</a>, which is usually pretty accurate. But it doesn't show up on my trusty atlas, which usually means - as i said - that a place is so infinitesimal as to not be worth mentioning. When you consider that the same map shows that the road between Skail and Rhifail contains two hunting lodges and - a little further south - a farm which is at the site of a former village (population &lt;20), but doesn't show Achargary, I think it gives some indication of its likely size. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 23:58, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete without prejudice</b> - Hmmm...tricky one. The concept of an Islamic Society (or equivalently a Muslim Students Association, the two titles are entirely interchangeable and refer to exactly the same thing) certainly has currency. You'd find MSA's/IS's on most campuses/schools where there are large Muslim minority populations. That said, there is not much more to be said about them than the fact that they exist and look after Muslim students' interests. As JzG mentions, this is no better than having a general article on "Engineering professional bodies". For the time being <b>delete without prejudice</b>. Perhaps it <i>is</i> possible to write an all-encompassing article about this topic. However, the current one isn't it, and without references does not provide the basis for such an article to be written. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange">®</font></a></b> 14:35, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>reply from the author: i work for 20 year as an artist visual performance and exhibition in many countries. And i am a pioneer in visual art starting at a time were even the word "visualart" was not existent. I was as artist in EXPO Sevilla 1992, at ARTCORE_05 in paris, made visual performance in front of 400.000 people last year, what must happen to be accepted in wikipedia? Be an artist for 150 years? I don´t know a lot about wikipedia policy but i see a lot entries accepted from thing less important than my 20 years of hard work in art. How can i change the entry 2 be not deleted?

<p>This material has just been copy/pasted from the relevant subheading on University of Melbourne. Given it is highly specific to UniMelb, there is no reason for it to have a page in its own right. Especially since it adds nothing new from the original section. <a href="../../../s/u/i/User%7ESuicup_44f3.html" title="User:Suicup">Suicup</a> 11:01, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not sure if this is how to do it but, i've stated why there needs to be an extra site specifically dealing with growing esteem: Growing Esteem is significant because it is seen by some as a harbinger of a new two-tiered higher education system in Australia. The plan has been endorsed by the federal government as part of its plans to 'diversify' higher education institutions.</p>
<p>It is an important plan of greater significance than just melbourne university. I believe there may be a significant amount of searches on wikipedia for 'growing esteem' , and if this article is deleted people will not be able to find anything. Maxyk 11:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> almost skipped over this one. At first glance they are notable, but of course it needs 3rd party documentation, like almost everything that come here.

Unusually, the ed. asserts on the talk p. that he is writing about the company &amp; wants to write about others, thus implying he is not part of it. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:46, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> defaulting to "keep". I am not persuaded by the arguments that individual episodes are not notable: how then could they be awarded <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy_Award_4d8c.html" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Awards</a>? I also understand that this is a work in progress, in common with most of Wikipedia, and that older seasons will be brought into line. The delete arguments mostly appear to amount to "smash them all" which is hardly in the spirit of constructing an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> - these articles are pointless - other articles have separate articles for episodes because each episode is a self-contained story. 24 is different as each episode is part of a single series-long story. These are episode articles for the sake of it - i.e. just created because other shows have them. (Same applies to all 24 episodes). -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 21:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete /</b> <i>maybe merge</i>, per Chuq and other concerns. While I'm usually not a fan of individual episode articles anyways, Chuq is right in that the unique nature of 24 makes these types of articles just stupid (even if you love episode articles, why organize the plot summary like this?). This same logic can be applied to the reason I normally (but certainly not always) discourage individual episode articles, the individual episodes are not independently notable nor do they need to be split for page size concerns. It's this kind of preemptive article creation that leads to the massive misconception about episode articles. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> #7, we are not plot summaries, and other uses of plot summary don't need this kind of formatting. It's being done just because that's what someone did for other episode articles. These episodes, aired or not, shouldn't be formatted this way, even if you like episode articles. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 23:49, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> If the other seasons do not have episode articles, we don't need them for this season. I support a season article and maybe a link to the 24 Wiki could be provided.

<li><b>Creator Comment</b> While I of course would hate to see my articles deleted, I do understand they need content. Content which hasn't been provided yet, via Fox. I do believe that we need individual articles to cover each episode. One reason would be the spoiler, some people may want to only read one episode. Second, usually the episodes are covered a bit more in-depth; and you shouldn't really pile them into one larger article. External links to the 24 wiki, while nice, discredit what we are here to provide. One large source of information, to research and look things up. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomitho_e029.html" title="User:Somitho">Somitho</a> 17:22, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>External inks to the 24 wiki don't discredit us.. If anything it helps us by directing editors to the proper place for high level of plot detail. As for the spoiler concern, that's pretty much nabbed in the ass by us not being censored. (Although I do think it is acceptable to write plot summary in a chronological sense. For example: "Jimmy went to the mall, is ok" but " Jimmy, who later died, went to the mall" is needless.) -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 01:20, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s>, no third-party evidence of substantial notability. DumbBOT, please read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>; Bravo's website is not an <i>independent</i> source about a Bravo program. I don't evaluate "other 'dignitaries' invited to the opening of one museum exhibit" as showing any significant notability by WP's standards. I'm neutral as to whether winning this televised quasi-competition is itself notable enough; if some genuinely independent publications said more than "here was this little show, so-and-so won, they'll do another round of it next year", and showed some lasting influence, and if it's cited, then I'd be much more in favor of keeping the article. If all the coverage is like that (and I assume some will be found), then a <b>merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Runway_a288.html" title="Project Runway">Project Runway</a> would be more appropriate. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:07, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b>: I dont know much about soccer/football hierarchy, so what kind of team was he on? I looked at the articles on the teams, but it still all looks Greek to me!

<li>Is being on the "youth team" like being a red-shirt freshman in the US? It's prep for the day you finally do get to play with the "real" team? Or is it more like a loose association to the actual pro team, like when two cities are "Sister Cities" or when a high school has a "sister school" in another country? If he got "high" enough in the ranks, I would consider him notable. I think his early death is an interesting fact, though I want to make sure he accomplished enough before that to justify his own article. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 17:07, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As a contributor to many chemical articles on Wikipedia, my bias is towards creating and keeping as many as is feasible. But there are ~30 million chemical compounds reported in scientific literature - and they were all made for <i>some</i> purpose. I can find no evidence in Chemical Abstracts that this compound has been used more than a few times as a minor intermediate in producing something else. There has to be a higher level of notability than the minimal utility this compound displays in order to deserve a Wikipedia page. I suspect this page may have been created as a test - even the original author posted a "delete" comment of the article's talk page in response to one of the earlier proposed deletions. --<a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgar181_7e9b.html" title="User:Edgar181">Ed</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/g/User_talk%7EEdgar181_fd91.html" title="User talk:Edgar181">Edgar181</a>) 20:07, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dicdef, I don't see much room for expansion. It's been here since March 2005 and there has been nothing added since. Contested prod. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESable232_a828.html" title="User:Sable232">Sable232</a> 16:06, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>. Nobody has said there's anything wrong with the information. Might or might deserve a separate article. I contested the deletion proposal, writing "This article is a valid stub. It can grow beyond a dictionary definition. The solution is to expand it, not to delete it." Wikipedia allows stubs (there are about a million) and has no deadline. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 02:12, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It is not clear that this term has *any* Google hits (as a fully quoted string of three words), except those derived from Wikipedia. Probably it's an obsolete terminology. No need for us to have an article on it; it could be misleading to our readers if we offer the term but can provide no context. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 20:49, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete or Merge</b>, but with what? The definition appears to be correct but without more of an article to clothe it with not much can be learned from it. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlakeloaf_bedc.html" title="User:Flakeloaf">Flakeloaf</a> 22:48, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Some of them are stubs with potential for expansion. The FS 1073C articles require a more discriminatory approach than that. <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Federal_Standard_1037C_clean_up_59ce.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Federal Standard 1037C clean up">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Federal Standard 1037C clean up</a> has been a slowly on-going project for over a year, now. I suggest that editors read read the prior discussion to familiarize themselves with the whole issue before commenting. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:45, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> is quite right that we don't delete stubs simply because they haven't been expanded yet. We only delete stubs if there is no possibility for expansion of the article beyond perpetual stub status. Furthermore, as stated, if editors want to deal with the FS 1073C articles, I suggest reading <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Federal_Standard_1037C_clean_up_59ce.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Federal Standard 1037C clean up">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Federal Standard 1037C clean up</a> <i>first</i>. Blanket mergers and blanket deletion nominations are not the best ways to proceed.
<p><i>However</i>, having said that, <i>this is not an FS 1073C article</i>. The article claims that it is sourced from FS 1073C. But I've just checked the two on-line versions linked to from <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Standard_1037C_b08c.html#External_links" title="Federal Standard 1037C">Federal Standard 1037C#External links</a>, and this concept is not listed. Several different searches lead me to no other sources.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that many of the the FS 1073C articles were created en bloc by 213.253.40.156 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.253.40.156_fca0.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.253.40.156">contribs</a>) in 2002. This article was created by Wanton creation (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wanton_creation_9805.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wanton creation">contribs</a>) in 2005, and is that person's sole contribution. It is possible that it is hoax.</p>
<p>Therefore: This is a stub that has no (valid) sources, and for which no sources can be found after a reasonable search. It cannot be expanded beyond perpetual stub status; the only sources that it cites prove to be false; and, looking, I can find no alternative sources to use. Therefore this is both an unexpandable stub and unverifiable, and per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> that means <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:45, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I haven't seen the articles, but I'm slightly familiar with the name of an Ed Pegg, Jr., who is fairly well-known for puzzles, such as <a href="http://www.maa.org/news/mathgames.html" class="external text" title="http://www.maa.org/news/mathgames.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_Association_of_America_1d1f.html" title="Mathematical Association of America">MAA</a> collection. If you restored his article I would ask to <b>keep</b> it. Three years of regular puzzles for a solid mathematics organization, <i>by itself</i>, establishes notability; and a little searching should show more, since '"Ed Pegg"' (in quotation marks) turns up tens of thousands of hits. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 05:11, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I got 19,400 hits on Google by entering "Ed Pegg Jr". That's a lot of hits for a very precise string like that. I looked at a dozen sites or so ... they all look pretty legitimate to me (i.e., not self-puffery, but posts by other people who are interested in his work). He's not just into recreational math, either. He apparently helped <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Wolfram_70b6.html" title="Stephen Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a> write his book <a href="../../../a/_/n/A_New_Kind_of_Science_173f.html" title="A New Kind of Science">A New Kind of Science</a>, and he's involved somehow in the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathworld.html" title="Mathworld">Mathworld</a> web site.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't see a lot of value in some of the external links (MathWorld, MKS, NKS forum) in the article as it stands, without a description of Pegg's role in those links. MathPuzzle and Math Games are ok because Pegg is the primary contributer to them, but "contributes online to the associated forum" could be said about millions of non-notable people for various internet forums. I think the standard of notability for a non-professional mathematician such as this should be, not <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> which doesn't make sense for this kind of person, but the general standards of notability for any person, in which we seek reputable publications that have written articles about Pegg. I see several such articles in Dhartung's search and think some of them should be added as references to the WP article. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 19:55, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The "contributes" phrase (which I added) is not so vague in the context of its use; the emphasis is on his seminal and on-going contribution to the NKS work. Disclaimer: I did not contribute the links you find of little value, and added the NKS remarks in support of others' observations about notability. For me, the MAA reference is sufficient evidence for a "keep".</dd>
<dd>If I may suggest an easy way to get some perspective on what <i>really</i> passes for "notable" on Wikipedia, view several <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">random articles</a> per day.

<dd>In my experience, these are fairly typical. I detest "advertising" articles and realize living persons necessarily draw extra scrutiny. Even so, I think we could ease off the trigger finger just a bit. I happen to recognize Ed Pegg's name, just as I recognize that of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Eppstein_f035.html" title="David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a>; but even someone who did not could quickly check that both have some claim to fame in their respective circles of activity. In fact, I find a disappointing lack of articles on numerous technical people who have an impeccable claim to notability. David will recognize the names of Marshall Bern, Frances Yao, and David Dobkin, for example, none with articles. And Dobkin is now the Dean of Faculty at <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_960f.html" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>! --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 06:48, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I do recognize those names! And they are clearly worthy subjects for WP, but I'm probably too biased to add articles on them myself. But back to the subject. My complaint about links not adding value is not so much that the links were not relevant, but that their relevance was not sufficiently well explained. I think you can see how the "contributes to a forum" could be read differently than you intended, for instance. The recent edits to the article have helped in this respect. But I think some references to external articles about Pegg from Dhartung's search would make his notability more clear-cut. And since I haven't yet expressed an opinion on the AfD, let me add <b>keep</b>. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 07:02, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>::I have to say that not only <b>is</b> this original research, but it can't be anything else, because apparently nobody has written anything on the term, a quick search of all the news sources in the US via lexisnexis gets 5 hits, not so much talking about art fags or the term as much as calling people art fags, although there is one news documented self proclaimed "art fag" at least. Google Scholar has a few hits that are for the word "art fag" instead of some chemistry acronym, but no article describing the term or its rise to popularity or anyone's opinion about it. I would argue that anything relevant you could put on this page is unsourcable, based on these little searches. Apparently, our academic and popular media have nothing to say about it.66.41.66.213 01:16, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As an additional comment, I'd like to say that I feel that the last debate was closed incorrectly ( that is, by an administrator with a particular bias ), and have no problem with this immediate re-listing.

I do not at present have substantial confidence that that particular administrator is unbiased, and have indicated accordingly on their talk page. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 16:48, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is <i>newsworthy</i>, not encyclopedia-worthy.

<li><b>Keep</b> I created this article because these two individuals not only represent person who are currently making headlines within south africa but represent a very interesting about South Africa's presidence at the UN Security Council as well as both South African and US relations as well as the USA's activities at the UN. Finally it is another point on the perpetual debate of what is a terrorist. A google search for "junaid dockrat" returns 380 returns. The article is not there because they are declared potential terrorist subjects but the issues that that declarations have created. If the exact same issue was happening, except the accused was residing within America i'm sure a much more extensive article would have been created about them. <small>—The preceding ry of the event is of drastic importance, had these two been citizens of Germany we would not be having this discussion. Secondly, the two individuals have not been arrested, please research the <b>incident</b> properly before requesting a deletion. Even if they had been that is not the issue, the issue is the <i>international</i> media attention surrounding the incident.

<li>Their country of origin (which happens to be <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">mine</a> too) isn't the question here. The crux of the issue comes down to whether persons or entities mentioned <i>in the news</i> qualify to be encyclopedia-worthy. I have doubts they would pass the 10-year test, much less a 1-year test. While the <i>incident</i> may throw up interesting debate (and may WELL be deserving of an article, especially if it results in an extradition order and/or international court case), the two people are not <i>in and of themselves</i> notable and don't automatically gain notability just by being arrested, no matter how unusual or rare the charge is. The distinction is important. There is a difference between the notability of an event and the notability of the people involved in the event. (This is similar to those murdered cops we had on AfD a few weeks ago. The murders may well have been unusual and article-worthy, but the cops themselves didn't gain sufficient notability just by being killed in the line of duty.) <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange">®</font></a></b> 15:59, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fistly, when it comes to notability the countirdly, cops are murdered on a daily basis, the questioning of the declaration of persons as terror suspects by the UN security council and the subsequent issues over what this means for South Africa's position on the UN Security Council and it's soverignty is important. If you would think it would be best to combine the two articles into an <b>incident</b> article then do so. The point of the articles is to convey, to the reader, the relevant information pertaining to a current event in South Africa that involves the UN, Al-Qaeda, the South African Government and its foreign policy and the American governmnet and its foreign policy. I fail to see why you feel something that has been frontpage news in South Africa - and has appeared in the international press - in the past couple of days will be forgotten in ten years. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliwalla_253d.html" title="User:Aliwalla">Aliwalla</a> 21:27, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Nominated for speedy deletion but contested.

I'm starting this AfD both because there has been a serious request (which to me is not worth rejecting out of hand) for the article's deletion, and because once the relevant arguments for keep/delete come out, hopefully the dispute between the anon and Paulley should calm down somewhat. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 17:06, 31 January 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Anyone with money and a wrestling promotion can hire an international wrestler, it doesn't make the promotion notable. There's no independent coverage, the sources are basically press releases posted on UK wrestling news and rumour sites.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The promotion is a split off of a notable territory system... as is a highly regarded pro wrestling school... hiring international talent isnt exactly non-notable esspecially if your bring over highly regarded stars into the country professionally for the first time. Their really is some bias against promotions and wrestlers of the UK on this site... i can list loads of non notable, poorly written American promotions that seem to hang around -- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulley_2f3a.html" title="User:Paulley">Paulley</a>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Why is it notable? If it's notable, provide sources to show that. Excuse me for not simply accepting your word that is is notable, but I think you should know Wikipedia doesn't work that way. Ditto for highly regarded, you need to cite sources to show that. As for your accusation of anti-UK bias, incorrect. I'm from the UK, and know that VPW tend to run shows in one area of the country that aren't particularly notable, correct me if I'm wrong didn't the Billy Gunn show draw about 120 fans? That isn't a criticism as I know how the UK wrestling scene struggles, but I'm more than happy to&#160;!vote (and have done so in the past) for American promotions that are of similar size. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 23:33, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Though it has infact caused me and other users too improved the page alot... im all for referencing and such these days (i tend to do that more now than i do adding info). Anyway RBW's territory system though short lived did cover the whole of England (which is notable, cus the last time that happend was Joint Promotions which was again short lived after management changes) this is the history of the South West territory that has numorous <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Varsity+Pro+Wrestling%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Varsity+Pro+Wrestling%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">hits on google (just under its current name)</a>, and has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Varsity_Pro_Wrestling&amp;limit=999" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Varsity_Pro_Wrestling&amp;limit=999" rel="nofollow">several internal links from other wikipedia articles</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> Sources have improved, but there is still a complete lack of newspaper articles. That would fit with the absence of hits in Google News that are later than 2005. A poster above claims that www.1stopwrestling.co.uk is anti-wrestling, but I don't believe that's the case. I think it's a general site for wrestling info, though as a self-published web site, it wouldn't be classed as a reliable source for factual issues.

Anyway, if the text is correct and this name has been used for multiple made-up speeches by antisemites, I think the topic is notable. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 18:18, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Not an OR: this short article is referenced. We don't want to promote hatred, and many of those ghits are hate sites. Remember Churchill: "A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on." All that said, surely our article could and should be improved. FYI, I have removed unsupported allegations. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Humus_sapiens_ea7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Humus sapiens">?</a></sup> 18:57, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> article topic is non-Googol-able. The ghits mentioned aren't RS in any case, so there is no reason to use them.

<li><b>Keep</b> -I don't think it should be deleted - yes, although it is a BSP of Windows Vista, it's generated enough attention via huge displays across the world to deserve a wikipedia entry, and people need information.

However, we did find a few people who were fascinated, and one guy who came all the way from detroit. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Hazzayoungn (<a href="../../../h/a/z/User_talk%7EHazzayoungn_3698.html" title="User talk:Hazzayoungn">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hazzayoungn_4de7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hazzayoungn">contribs</a>) 19:22, 28 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li>Another vote for <b>keep</b> I first learned of VP from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/technology/30soft.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ei=5094&amp;en=2f65fde416ea73b7&amp;hp&amp;ex=1170133200&amp;partner=homepage" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/technology/30soft.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ei=5094&amp;en=2f65fde416ea73b7&amp;hp&amp;ex=1170133200&amp;partner=homepage" rel="nofollow">New York Times</a> this evening and came onto Wikipedia for more information. I agree that the article needs to be improved, and I think we can rely on the usual process to make that happen. But that fact that VP is advertising doesn't make it less notable. There's plenty of articles on advertising-related topics in Wikipedia. If the lack of sourcing bothers you, work to improve it, don't just nominate for deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> I, too, took a look through Google news, but I couldn't find much of anything other than press releases, blogs, and discussion forums. I think someone mentioned a New York Times article, but I looked any couldn't find any. The article mentioned by Gabriel Roth above does mention Vanishing Point, but it is only a single paragraph of three short sentences at the very bottom of the article:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Most of Microsoft’s vast marketing budget will be on print, television, radio and Web advertisements. But some will go for so-called viral marketing events like an online puzzle contest called Vanishing Point, sponsored by Microsoft and A.M.D. The winner will get a ride into space from a private space travel company.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That's not a source on Vanishing Point; it's a source on Vista's release. I also searched through LexisNexis. If I searched for "vanishing point" in the headline or lead paragraphs, I got no hits. If I search through the full text, I did. That tells me that Vanishing Point only received brief mention; it did not have whole articles about it.</dd>
<dd>To those who think the article should be kept, please please edit the article to add sources. The <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neowin.html" title="Neowin">Neowin</a> forums are OK, but they're not sufficient alone. As I understand them, the notability guidelines call for multiple, independent, reliable sources.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, as another user asked above, is this marketing gimmick going to be remembered in 10 years? If not, does it belong in an encyclopedia?</dd>
<dd>Unless someone addresses these concerns, I stand by the nomination. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunch_e74c.html" title="User:Lunch">Lunch</a> 23:18, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Moreover, that new user has unusual edits for this edit doesn't mean that he uses another user name or even anon edits!

If you do not trust the anon (that's me), it's just fine, I have no further questions or more arguments to refute yours as you think having a username meant you're greater than other IP editors, and that anons do net deserve a right to speak here. --<a href="../../../2/0/2/User%7E202.71.240.18.html" title="User:202.71.240.18">202.71.240.18</a> 06:20, 2 February 2007</li>

<dd>Though the above came from User:210.0.209.178, from the fervent attitude, I'm guessing it's the same person who left the second comment on the AfD. It also seems to be the person who has made some edits to the article.</dd>
<dd>Regarding those edits, though, these sources still haven't been added to the article. And, no, I'm not claiming that these articles are written by or funded by Microsoft. But -- to pick on one -- a blog at the San Jose Mercury News isn't exactly the greatest of sources for an encyclopedia article. On the other hand, an article in the Mercury News itself would be a bit better.</dd>
<dd>I didn't suggest the <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> notability guideline; someone else did.

If you think the article would better fit under yet another guideline, then please suggest one. Bald assertions of notability aren't particularly convincing to me.</dd>

<dd><i>"There are pages for I Love Bees and Lost Experience so why not this."</i> -- for one thing, these articles read like much better crafted actual encyclopedia articles, and was also been brought up more in mainstream media, part because of the novelty and historic significance.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I earlier voted Delete on this one, but could possibly stretch to a Weak Keep if it was largely rewritten. I feel there's so much here right now about how Microsoft carries out the advertising of the game, and so little about the game itself. This case is worsened by the fact that due to the nature of the game, the concepts of "advertisement" and "gameplay" is all mixed up. I think the problem with articles like these is that they can read very confusing and quite a bit unencyclopedic with only scattered bits of info revealed. After all -- that's the whole point of viral marketing. However, it's a point that is in conflict with quality articles on Wikipedia, with clearly laid out facts and verifiable information. This article is everything but about a game where the developer is eager to reveal the exact content of it, with great coverage with interviews on it, and so on. The essence of the game that fuels it is speculation. At this point, the effect right now reads like an incoherent and confusing article to an outsider on the subject like me, and I barely understand what the point of the "game" is. The actual game play section also seem to be placed way late in the article, and should probably be the most important part of it. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthgrove_5a5c.html" title="User:Northgrove">Northgrove</a> 16:23, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There's a number of Yu-gi-Oh articles that say nothing except a plot summary (something just a one sentence long summary), an info box, and sometimes a cast list (indiscriminate collection of information, what Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. We don't need 98+ Yu-gi-Oh GX episode articles (only a matter of time before someone makes an article similar to this one for each Yu-gi-Oh GX episode, not hard to do either) if all they're going to contain only plot summaries and an indiscriminate dump of cast information.</p>
<p>And has an article that does have commentary and real life context. With information which can be verified and sourced (although it currently is not). However, there is no evidence that the 120 other Yu-gi-Oh GX articles will ever reach this stage.</p>
<p>A scene-by-scene synopsis is something to be avoided as per Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with episode articles if they're good and well developed, but that isn't the case here. Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes says:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Once there's enough independently verifiable information to do so, create articles on each season, or some other logical division, of the show.</i></li>
<li><i>Once there's enough independently verifiable information included about individual episodes, spin the information from episodes out into their own articles.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>

<li>Articles with really short summaries (short as in one-paragraph, or even one-sentence, long summaries)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Do NOT speedy it for chrissakes because: (1) Speedy-deletde pages may be freely recreated, while AfD-deleted ones may not. A speedy delete just means the article will be recreated. (2) Let the article author(s) see that there is broad support for the deletion of the article. No albums on a real label, no national tour, no notability. Also, the name of the keyboard player is "What The Hell Is This?", which is probably not a very good name for a musician (or anyone).

<li><b>Strong delete</b> ..The whole article is based on weak logical fallacies and on the pure hatred that user has against anything srilankan.. WE already have 2 articles related to human rights in Sl, and why on earth we need seperate one for STF&#160;? Do we need seperate articles for human right violations by Prabhakaran, Human right violation by Pottu amman,Human right violation by Anton balasingham,Human right violation by Sea tigers, human right violation by LTTE police etc..this is rediculous&#160;!! The whole argument is based on some Invidual actions taken by some STF individuals..hoｗon earth we generalize this and accuses STF&#160;?!!</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>if you still dont get it let me explain ..
<ul>
<li>if a german tourist engaged in act of paedophilia ,can we create an article name "Human right violation by germans"?</li>
<li>If a american soldier rapes a japanese lady, can we create an article name "human right violation by US army"?</li>
<li>If an indian　soldier steal something from a shop,can we create an article name "Human right violation by the indian Army"?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If NO is the answer for all above questions,how on earth we say some actions by the STF personals should be categorized as "human right abuses by STF"&#160;??
<dl>
<dd>editor should prove GOSL or the Higher ranks officers of STF were personally involved or directed these actions..if not, this should be immediately directed to a place in the dustbin.finally wikipedia should not be a place to express your personal vendetta .</dd>

<dd>notable? Also, simply packing an article with such accusations, none of which have been proven, and most of which have been done by indivudual soldiers, just dilutes Wikipedia and needlessly opens it up for abuse.</dd>

<dd>The first doesn't give enough details (e.g., where the shootings possibly provoked). The second and third are hardly noteworthy. Essentially, after all is said and done, I probably <b>deleted &gt;80% of the text of this article</b> pre-merger. I <i>do</i> believe, however, that the text of the intro and disappearances sections should be kept (perhaps as one section). I can be swayed on the "Extrajudicial killings" section, but that's probably more a matter for the article's talk page. I am in favor of having a more general section titled "Criticisms" that lists general facts (like the disappearances and the book qutoe) rather than specific sections. If you like, by all means do so. I decided to do the merger so that potentially useful information would not be lost, but I ended up deleting most of it myself.

<li><b>reply to Black Falcon</b>- First a big thank for spending your time in helping to make this a better article..Hats off to you&#160;!! BUT certain issues still remain to be solved..I would say immediately.As you have correctly pointed out the whole abuses section was made by just one editor ,who posses an extreme hatred towards anything SriLanka..The whole thing is a copyvio and thoroughly unencyclopedic ..Some of these accusations such as threatening a union leader is absolutely not notable..<b>Even if its true, how on earth we accuses the whole STF for that&#160;??</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole Extrajudicial killings" section ,as you have correctly pointed out must go to a place in the dustbin..We can keep the disappearance part,as it ,true or not, directly accusing the STF ..And it should be under a category, like "criticism" just as the IDF article..IF raiding the TRO is a crime, then raiding every single Al-Qaeda cell is a crime..TRO is a proven pro-LTTE organization and <b>regular raids should be carried out in order to safe guard the innocent people of SriLanka</b>..SL have certain rules such as emergency laws, to combat terrorism and using them cant be categorize as "Abuses"..If you read the points i made earlier, this article could create havoc here..The whole wikipedia may go crazy if maniacs start making "Abuses" articles ,insulting every single institution in the world&#160;!! If someone from the <a href="../../../n/h/k/NHK_c31c.html" title="NHK">NHK</a> sexually harass a lady ,can we create an article name "Suxual abuses by NHK employees"&#160;??.Common sense says we Cant..But this article gives us the impressions, WE CAN..thanks--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 06:58, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree. No matter how well-sourced a statement is, and no matter how reliable and neutral its source, it should not be kept if it is irrelevant or trivial. I've made three changes so far: (1) I renamed the section title to "Criticism"; (2) I deleted the "Abuses of rights" section -- one threat and an instance of a raid are hardly sufficient to condemn an entire institution; (3) I deleted the 9 Oct. 2002 shooting incident as the circumstances of the shooting are not made clear in the source -- it may have been an accidental shooting, a provoked shooting, etc. Criticism of an institution should, as you note, refer to a pattern of behavior by its members. The disappearances section makes such a claim (responsibility for 5% of disappearances over a period of 9 years). As you note, it's truthfulness is not at issue--it is verifiable and that is all that is needed and relevant. As for what's left of the "Extrajudicial killings" section, I am considering a way to trim it down because, even putting aside POV concerns, it just reads awkward and disconnected from the rest of the text. I will watch the page over the next week or so to see if POV is reintroduced into the section. Thank you for your comments and your acknowledgement.

I hope you will make adjustment to the "Extrajudicial killings" too..As this,you have correctly pointed out,make no sense at all.Also, thanks for promising to keep an eye on this ,for a while..I have the feeling that, this editor might pop up soon and start messing this article again.--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 05:19, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't know who started this article or why, but I don't want to automatically assume that it was a bad-faith creation. He or she may have simply thought that this was enough information to merit an article of its own. I have added one more sentence to the "Extrajudicial killings" section but really can't think of any other changes in the absence of additional sources. As per your concern above, I have noted at the start of the subsection that the examples given are of "extrajudicial killings involving <i>members of the STF</i>" (emphasis added), and thus not necessarily sanctioned by the STF itself (this last part is implied, but to write it in might violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). I am currently working on topics related to other countries--Iran and Yemen--but will periodically check the STF article for potentially NPOV material (given that the STF is an active organization, I suppose unsourced accusations might even be libelous). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlack_Falcon_2e2e.html" title="User talk:Black Falcon">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Black_Falcon_e059.html" title="Special:Contributions/Black Falcon">contribs</a>) 05:52, 3 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>This article is, first and foremost, Original Research. It compiles a list of harsh words or negative actions taken towards Persians, the nation of Persia before it became Iran, and the Iranian government and defines them as "anti-Iranianism." There is no question that racial prejudice against Persians or other Iranians exists, and it deserves an article. The problem is that this article lumps several different topics (anti-Persian sentiments in the ancient world, actions taken by governments against historical Persia, disputes between the US and Iran, anti-Persianism in the Arab world) and lumps them under the heading "anti-Iranianism." The term "anti-Iranianism" is a neologism. If you exclude wikipedia forks and websites referencing wikipedia there are only 365 google hits on the phrase "anti-Iranianism" of which only 150 are unique. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=anti-Iranianism+-wikipedia+-site:answers.com+-site:wikipedia.org&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=anti-Iranianism+-wikipedia+-site:answers.com+-site:wikipedia.org&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> Anti-Persianism only gets about 200 ghits without wikipedia <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=KXJ&amp;q=%22anti-persianism%22++-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=KXJ&amp;q=%22anti-persianism%22++-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, and "anti-Persian sentiment" only about 40 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22anti-persian+sentiment%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22anti-persian+sentiment%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>.

It is also highly-POV to lump actions taken against a government together with racism towards an ethnic group (Persians), but this article makes absolutely no distinction between the two. I recently removed a photograph of a US Army poster with the words "IRAN... you're next" and a picture of Uncle Sam holding a wrench from the article. Although presented as an official US Army poster, the image was, of course, ripped off from a WW2 <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Montgomery_Flagg_a87c.html" title="James Montgomery Flagg">James Montgomery Flagg</a> poster which originally referred to Japan.

<dd>Only the first of your three links works for me. Yes, there are books that use the phrase "anti-Iranian", but is it "anti-Iranian" in the sense described in this article? If the government of Azerbaijan is politically opposed to the government of Iran is that the same thing as racism against Persians?

<dd>To respond to your claim that the article is well-referenced: Yes, there are references that specific events happened. That's irrelevant.

<li><b>Keep, possibly rename, cleanup</b> - First, a clarification, the term "anti-Iranianism" would refer to the actions taken against the country of Iran or persons of Iranian nationality, but not persons of Persian descent (that's anti-Persianism). I do agree, however, that lumping anti-Iranianism and anti-Persianism together is inappropriate. In response to your criticisms:</li>

<li>Violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> - Even if the article is kept, the section on the US should probably be removed in its entirety and replaced with a brief summary and a link to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States-Iran_relations_7086.html" title="United States-Iran relations">United States-Iran relations</a> article. Moreover, much of the article (excluding the US section) is about anti-Persianism. Perhaps the article would benefit from being renamed to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Persianism_890e.html" title="Anti-Persianism">anti-Persianism</a> and edited to reflect this new title. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:53, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>OR</b> - The OR comes from taking many separate concepts (anti-Persian sentiments in the ancient world, actions taken against Persia by various governments, actions taken against Iran by various governments, anti-Persian sentiment in the Arab world) and lumping them together under a new concept that is not used by scholars. I agree that an article about racism against Persians is acceptable and I agree that an article on US-Iran relations is acceptable, but putting them all together under what is essentially a neologism is not acceptable. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 19:00, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>So, then, we are (essentially) in agreement (with the possible exception that I still think the article ought to be worked on and not deleted). I think the OR element would be removed if a distinction was drawn between anti-Persianism in reference to the Persian people, anti-Persianism in reference to the Persian government, anti-Iranianism in reference to the Iranian people, and anti-Iranianism in reference to the Iranian government. In order to fit with the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Arabism_9893.html" title="Anti-Arabism">Anti-Arabism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Turkism_482a.html" title="Anti-Turkism">Anti-Turkism</a>, etc. articles, the article should include only anti-Persianism and anti-Iranianism against the Persian and Iranian peoples, respectively. Although the two groups are not the same, I think the fact that many (including most Westerners) equate the two groups justifies their inclusion in one article at least for now (ideally, they would be separate articles about hostility to Persian ethnics and Iranian nationals). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:17, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I think I could support keeping parts of the article if it was called something like Racial prejudice against Persians and Iranians and only dealt with that topic. The problem is that the events and quotes in this article are generally cited, but I don't see a source that really defines the concept of anti-Iranianism or anti-Persianism and gives its history. In the case of prejudice against minorities in the west and even in the ancient world, there are many notable historical works that identify what the prejudice is, how it is defined, what its history is, etc. Those works can then be debated by other scholars. In this case we're doing that work ourselves and that is OR. If the article is rewritten so that it is based on scholarly work about anti-Persianism and not an original synthesis of historical events that identifies people as anti-Persian than the article is okay. Otherwise, I think we're outside the domain of an encyclopedia. Regardless, the political stuff (Bush Sr. not apologizing for shooting down a plane, the US denying visas, a legal dispute about Persian antiquities, etc. etc.) must be removed from this article. It is highly, highly POV. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 19:45, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, I posted in response to your unrevised comment. I do agree that most of the political section should be removed (in fact, I will take a look right after I submit this comment). I am not really familiar with the scholarly dialogue and can therefore suggest this: <i>Delete the blatantly POV sections and cleanup the remainder of the article through a discussion on the talk page. If after some time these issues have not been resolved <b>and constructive dialogue on the talk page has ceased</b>, nominate the article for AfD once more.</i> What do you think? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:52, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This would be an acceptable solution for me. Particularly controversial cases could be discussed on the article's talk page. However, the cleanup needs to be done carefully. For example, Russian occupation of Persian territories is really not anti-Persianism. However, other cases should be kept (or at least discussed). For example, the photo with the poster stating "Deport all Iranians" or a statement like "Nuke Iran" are aimed at both the state and the people. I think such cases should be included (but again, this is a matter for the talk page). So, (assuming, of course, you and the remaining contributors to this AfD agree) how do we go about doing this? I don't know if it's proper Wikiquette to rename/hugely modify a page during an AfD (although if it survives completely unchanged, I will be <a href="../../../b/e/_/WP%7EBe_bold_9c56.html" title="WP:Be bold">bold</a> and do it myself). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:48, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, maybe the current title should be kept and a statement added at the beginning about what the article will and will not include. I'm not opposed to renaming if a good (and ideally 'shortish') title can be found. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:48, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I realize that every action has not been listed; I was trying to make a point. I do agree that anti-Iranianism and anti-Persianism exists (see my comments above, including the example on "Nuke Iran"), but think the article should address them in the context of hostility to the Iranian and Persian peoples, and not the Iranian and Persian governments. Also, whereas "Fuck the Jews" is anti-Semitic, "fuck Israel" is not (at least not necessarily). Likewise, "fuck Iranians" is anti-Iranian (people) whereas "fuck Iran" is not (at least not necessarily). I still favor <i>keep and cleanup</i>. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:57, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I disagree with your second point that any criticism of Jews would be included on wikipedia. We do have notability standards and I would be absolutely opposed to including a discussion of non-notable idiot attack websites on wikipedia. Notable anti-semitism should be discussed, but nukeiran.com has an alexa rank of about 3,000,000. Perhaps there's a larger point here. If the best examples of anti-Iranianism you can come up with are a couple of non-notable webpostings, should we really have a 90k article on the topic? <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 20:07, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also note that while I do think the topic is encyclopedia-worthy (and should be kept), much of it currently reads like History of hostile interactions between Iran and other states. Anti-Iranianism against the Iranian state is <i>also</i> very real, but that should belong in the individual country relations articles (US-Iran, Iraq-Iran, Russia-Iran, etc.). I don't believe the content of the article is useless or bad (in fact, I think they are quite well-sourced and should be available on other pages on WP); just that it is inappropriate to put it all together and <i>especially</i> to put it under this title. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:28, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> per Mardavich and Zereshk. Article is very well sourced and the topic is legitimate, no question. That some people here want to minimise, ignore or even <b>deny</b> racism and prejudice against Iranians (who are NOT just Persians! I myself am half-Kurd, half Arab!) is horrible and disgusting. There is a double standard on WP when articles like <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">Antisemitism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Arabism_9893.html" title="Anti-Arabism">Anti-Arabism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Turkism_482a.html" title="Anti-Turkism">Anti-Turkism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Armenianism_eaed.html" title="Anti-Armenianism">Anti-Armenianism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Hellenism_8fa3.html" title="Anti-Hellenism">Anti-Hellenism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Irishism_7387.html" title="Anti-Irishism">Anti-Irishism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Italianism_6e78.html" title="Anti-Italianism">Anti-Italianism</a> are here, and this one is to be deleted! This is amazing! Anyone who thinks that racism and bigotry against Iranians (Persians, Kurds, etc etc) doesn't exist is living in a fantasy of ignorance and denial. And I am getting very tired of all the attacks on Iranians on WP - it never ends! We come to WP to help make an encyclopedia and instead we are all always having to defend ourselves against bigoted attacks towards our ethnic and national background.

<li>Perhaps you should consider actually reading the the nomination? To quote: "There is no question that racial prejudice against Persians exists, and it deserves an article. The problem is that this article lumps several different topics (anti-Persian sentiments in the ancient world, actions taken by governments against historical Persia, disputes between the US and Iran, anti-Persianism in the Arab world) and lumps them under the heading "anti-Iranianism." The term "anti-Iranianism" is a neologism." <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 20:36, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My point is that nobody is saying that there is no animosity towards Iranians in the world. This article is being nominated for deletion because some users believe that it violates wikipedia policy. Also, those other articles are separate issues. They may very well be worthy of deletion as well. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 20:45, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a>, I do not think this was a bad-faith nomination or constitutes "bigoted attacks towards our ethnic and national background". It has been noted many times above that Iranians and Persians are distinct groups (including by the nominator--see the first thread I started). I do not perceive <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a>'s concern with the article to be that it is about a non-existent topic, but rather that it conflates hostility against the Persian/Iranian states with hostility against the Persian/Iranian peoples. I believe the article should be <b>kept</b> and anything addressing only anti-state sentiments removed (not discarded; possibly merged to individual Country-Iran relations pages). Anti-Iranianism, as it refers to the state, <i>is</i> a real phenomenon, but it can be convered in the articles for US-Iran, Iraq-Iran, Israel-Iran, Turkey-Iran, etc. relations. I don't know if a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Iran_906f.html" title="Foreign relations of Iran">foreign relations of Iran</a> template exists, but (if it doesn't) it would be useful in connecting these separate articles. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:51, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I agree with you in spirit, but in action sorting out the bit about neg sentiments against the peoples vs gov'ts would be very difficult if not impossible and would involve a lot of OR. The first photo (70's us protestor), for instance, where would that fall? I'd wager many would say it was evidence of anti-Iranian-people sentiment in the US, but I think it was more of a protest (albiet a ridiculoulsy stupid one) against the Iranian gov't actions against Americans in that country. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 22:13, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, I think that that is something that could be resolved on the talk page. I personally favor including it due to the text of the poster: "Deport all <i>Iranians</i>", even though I completely agree with you as to its actual sentiment. True, the problem is compounded by the fact that sentiments often transfer from a regime to its people, but again I think that a solution could be reached on the article's talk page. As for the remainder of the article, I believe the <i>absolute majority</i> does not belong -- I have said above that it reads like a political history of Iran's negative interactions with other states. I have made the following suggestion to the nominator and he has said he is thinking it over: <i>Delete the blatantly POV and other irrelevant sections and cleanup the remainder of the article through a discussion on the talk page.

<li>I agree that the current article is POV, but only because it conflates hostility against the Iranian people with hostility against the Iranian government--this can be removed from the article. Also, while I support creating two separate pages for <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Iranianism_c948.html" title="Anti-Iranianism">Anti-Iranianism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Persianism_890e.html" title="Anti-Persianism">Anti-Persianism</a>, I don't think that is practical at this time. I see nothing wrong with including them in the same article, as long as they are treated separately in the article (and this separation is explicit), especially since many (in Europe and North America, at least) fail to realize there is a difference between the two groups. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The conflation is fundamental to the article. The article is an essay proposing a grand narrative of hostility towards Iran stretching from the Battle of Thermopylae to Operation Ajax. Not even <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Said_407a.html" title="Edward Said">Edward Said</a> was that historicizing. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexeiSeptimus_d337.html" title="User:AlexeiSeptimus">AlexeiSeptimus</a> 22:43, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree and have noted the same above (that the article reads like a history of Iran's negative interactions with other states). As I wrote to the AfD nominator, I think <i>at least</i> 2/3 of the article should go (including the whole of the US section). Yes, <i>most</i> of the article should be deleted (or at least merged into other articles), but the article itself needn't be deleted, just <i>significantly</i> improved. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:37, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To respond to your comment that "though I do agree with your criticism of the article and the need to drastically change it, I would also like to note that it's going to be rather hard to improve if it's gone." There's no reason to assume that just because an article is deleted through AfD the topic won't be covered by wikipedia. To give a recent example, after I nominated [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_killed%2C_threatened_or_kidnapped_Iraqi_academics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_killed%2C_threatened_or_kidnapped_Iraqi_academics" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>] I created a short article to deal with the topic at <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence_against_academics_in_post-invasion_Iraq_7d72.html" title="Violence against academics in post-invasion Iraq">Violence against academics in post-invasion Iraq</a>. I would advise waiting a couple of days before doing that in this case because this debate has really just begun.

<dd>Don't you think it would be simpler working with this (well-referenced) article as a starting point? People know where it is, it has (if not before then now for sure) attracted a great deal of attention and potential contributors, etc. And yes, I do intend to wait at least until this AfD is closed before I seriously think about starting a new article (e.g., by researching the topic). Essentially, I do think that this current version of the article should go, but I don't think all of the content should be lost. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:00, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>"By colonial powers" – purely political history (no hostile sentiments proven/sourced)</li>
<li>"By the United States" – same as above</li>

<li>"Against Iranian scientists" - mostly political actions against Iran itself</li>

<dd>What is left is the section on the ancient Greeks, (possibly, as I haven’t read the external article) the Turks, and the Arabs. These sections do, of course, need to be revised, but at least all of them directly address hostile sentiments held against Persian and Iranian peoples.

<li><b>additional comment</b> Just an additional comment. One of Saddam's ministor and former government of Baghdad said: <i>Ajam (Iranians/Persians) are animals that God created in the shape of Humans</i>. Also he further said: <i>Jews are a</i> mixture of the dirt and leftover of diverse people<i>. If anyone is offended, I apologize, but I wanted to mention the seriousness of the issue. Note just like the idiot Ahmadinezhad recently made some anti-semitic statements which have been condemned by Iranian intellectuals, there have been people and dynasties (like the Ummayads) who actively discriminated against Iranians. Note the chemical use of weapons by Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war against Iranian civilians. And here is a source from Cambridge university which is legitimate and uses the term:</i> The Barkamids probably favoured some Zoroastrian officials like Banu Sahl and opposed anti-Iranian officials like Muhammad b. Laith.<i>(The Cambridge history of Iran By William Bayne Fisher, pg 71).

<li><b>Keep</b>: I read the comments. All questions have been answered properly. The article has to be kept obviously and improved further. It is neither OR nor POV fork. It is not "Neologism" either. Calling this, neologism is itself POV fork. Wikipedia is not a dictionary of English language. Many of the titles that we have in wikipedia have no equivalent in non-western languages, simply because the issues are not relevant to those cultures. The reverse is also true. Anti-Iranism and other recisms like anti-arabs, anti-armenians etc exist both in real life and in the literature of those involved. Let me inform you that the word Holocaust did not exist in Persian literature until one and a half years ago (before the new president got the office). Do you think we should not have a page on holocaust in Persian wikipedia? Are persian wikipedians allowed to call it Neologism? I have noticed that some voted for "delete" arguing that they are against all "Anti-X'ism" articles. This argument is practically useless and irrelevant to our discussion here on this particular page. About anti-Iranianism in the US, the subject will be improved as time passes.

<li><b>Delete</b> First, the article muddles two things: international relations (political actions against the Iranian state) and racism. Personally, I think either one could be an appropriate topic for an article or part of an article, but not in this totally muddled form. Second, the article seems to me to be entirely original research. It might be interesting to have an article on divisions in Islam, whcih could include not only conflicts between Sunni and Shi'a, but also conflicts between competing national centers of power, and then, in another article on Iranian history, discuss Iran's conflicts with its historical neighbors as well as conflicts arising from European colonialism and then the Cold War ... I suspect much of what people wish were of value in this article could be accommodated by those two articles, each of which would provide more clarity and effective contextualization. Even so, contributors woul dhave to be more familiar with our NPOV and especially NOR policies. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 12:36, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> "Being original research or not" has nothing to do with our personal opinion. If some thing have been researched before it is no longer an original research. This article is not about Iran-US relations and the conflicts between these two countries. There are other articles covering it. If US president insult Iranian president, we will not cover it here. If US wants to attack a nuclear site in Iran, we will not cover it here. But when it comes to "prejustice" and "insulting" and "treating all Iranians the same way" then this article is a place for that. Racism and politics are not separate from eachother. There were lots of politics around Holocaust, Armenian genocide, and anti-Iranianism by Arabs. It is meaningless to separate policical manifestaion of racism from racism. I have to emphasize that Iran-Setizi or whatever you want to call it, has more 1000 years of continuous history. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 13:01, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Why does it violate NOR, when there are review articles on the subject in Persian? One can not say some thing is not OR because there is no proper review article on the subject in X-language. Racism exist every where (US, Iran, Arab countries, Europe etc). And it is not wise to look for a review article on recist view of let's say iranians in their language.

<dd>First of all, you are wrong about the article not being muddled, not muddling international relations with racism. The article is muddled. It does include much material on foreign relations anti-Iranianism, which is not racism. For example, contrary to your initial comment, the first quote (which comes from an apparently authorless and unpublished paper which may or may not constitute a valid source) refers not to racism but to US foreign policy - precisely what you said the article is <i>not</i> about. The anti-Iranianism in Vali Nasr's article is about Iraqui foreign policy - again, international relations, not racism. The section on the Greeks and Romans makes irrelevant remarks (th eentire last paragraph) and has no citations. I am not going to go on - virtually the entire article is about international relations and not racism, despite your protestations, and it includes unsourced or primary material, or inappropriate source (Edward Teller?) The Nelson frye quote concerning Arabs is more a statement of Arab ignorance than racism; the use of a dictionary definition to establish racism is clearly a violation of NOR because it is using a primary source to make a synthetic statement. Anti-Iranianism in early Islam is again about international relations (competition between different states for political power) and not racism. Changing the names of places from one language to another is not racism. The quote from From The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries is also original resource because a quote is taken out of context, put into another context to make a point the quote itself does not make. The section, Ali vs. Umar ibn al-Khattab, also seems to rely on primary sources. And so on, and so on. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 13:41, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not true. I never claimed that this article has a high quality. I only said racism will become important when it is put into practice by politicians. So political manifestaion of racism and racism need to be covered together. That's all what I said. We all know that people of any two country in Europe or Asia may make joke about each other. This is not important but when these ideas are put into practice and real life by politicians then it will become important. About Iranian-Arab relation which has been studied alot, I have to say that: There exists a racism and it was a driver for wars. Have you heard about Saddam last words about Persians? He wanted to clear the earth from Persians even in his last minutes of life! This is not politics or "international relation"!

<dd>It might be helpful to offer an example here. In wikipedia, Iranian president Ahmadinejad is considered racist. One can easily use your arguments and say all his remarks are about politics and international relation. But this argument can not succeed as our experience shows. Ahmadinejad even clearly rejected allegation of racism in one of his speech. But he is considered a racist by the public.

<p><b>Keep</b> This article should be kept for several important reasons. I will start off by addressing the arguments already made on this page (i.e. by user GabrielF). The section on the U.S. must be improved, but it should definitely remain. This is because a great deal of Anti-Iranianism exist in the United States. It is common knowledge that this was the case in the late 70's and early 80's because of the Hostage Crisis. In fact, the United States has been involved in Anti-Iranianism is many other cases. The article covers this a bit superficially and with a bit of POV, but this can be improved. I disagree with GabrielF that countries that are against the Iranian government aren't necessarily against Iranians. This is a distinction without a difference. Although there are many dissidents who oppose the government of Iran, we cannot say that the Islamic Republic is not a representation of most Iranians. Imagine a country being Anti-Israel without being Anti-Semitic. I must further disagree with GabrielF when he says "The problem is that this article lumps several different topics (anti-Persian sentiments in the ancient world, actions taken by governments against historical Persia, disputes between the US and Iran, anti-Persianism in the Arab world) and lumps them under the heading 'anti-Iranianism.'" An understanding of the divide between East and West is necessary to understand why Anti-Iranianism in the ancient world is directly related to Anti-Iranianism in the modern world. Greek and Roman literature has contribited to Anti-Iranian sentiment in the modern West. This is discussed in the book <i>Persian Fire</i>. Also, the reason that anti-Persian sentiments in the ancient world, actions taken by governments against historical Persia, disputes between the US and Iran, anti-Persianism in the Arab world are "lumped" into Anti-Iranianism is that they are all forms of it. Take the article on antisemitism for example, it discusses antisemitism in the ancient world and in the modern world. It "lumps" antisemitism by Arabs and by Americans under the title anti-semitism. This is the case with this article. Even though anti-semitism by Arabs and Americans are very different and for different reasons, they are still antisemitism and should be included in that article. As the sections on Anti-Iranianism by different countries grows, they will have their own articles. GabrielF concedes that Anti-Iranianism exist: "There is no question that racial prejudice against Persians or other Iranians exists, and it deserves an article." This article must be improved, not deleted. It is true that there are many problems with this article, but they should be addressed in its talk page. Furthermore, the article has greatly improved since the posting of this AfD, and many points have been addressed (i.e. referencing sources). GabrielF says that there are too few returns for the google search of Anti-Iranianism. But he does not elaborate why it is too few. I believe it is quite sufficient and only proves the point that this article should remain (i.e. scholarly books use the word Anti-Iranianism). The point has already been addressed that there are article on anti-ethnic and anti-national terms. This is significant because it shows precedent, a major theme in Wikipedia. In conclusion, there is no doubt that there should be an article on Anti-Iranianism, and this article is not only salvageable but quite sufficient as a starting point. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 22:02, 1 February 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader</p>

<dd>I should say this article not only has so many reliable citations but its notation with the name of Anti-Iranianism that is criticised not to have enough sources is unaccepted too. because the words about Iran have mostly been Translated from Persian and the translation has been different and I think the current translation is the best and says the meaning better as "Xisms" is translated extremely different . and I apreciate <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">User:Zereshk</a>'s added section (usage) that shows the accuracy of the article better. According to its use and this article's renaming mustn't occur becuase the titles discussed in do not qualify that name. For this claim you should be more familiar to Persian literature and Iran history to understand how different the Mongols where to Iran rather than the others. Not only their behaviour to Iran and their destruction is suggestive of this fact but continual centeral Asian People attack to Iran is another evidence for their Anti-Iranian policies(If can be said policy). As the mongols' army where mostly Centeral Asian people.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Deleting such an article, filled with numerous legitimate sources, is not the answer. The topic of the article is absolutely valid. Any issues concerning POV (of which I personally don't see much in the way of problems within the article) or information that pertains more to the government rather than issues of prejudice and so forth can be worked out on the talk page. But there is literally no justification for deleting this article, nor is there any Wikipedia policy that would support such a deletion. In other words, deleting this article would constitute a severe breach of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and would reflect badly on Wikipedia in general. Prejudice and discrimination should be denied, minimized, or ignored, especially in light of our post-9/11 world. The fact that certain editors would rather delete the entire article rather than work towards consensus on its talk page (as far as inclusion of information), speaks volumes. Its just sad and depressing, especially for those of us from Iranian backgrounds. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhodavand_fbc2.html" title="User:Khodavand">Khodavand</a> 00:45, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It think you're missing the point of this AfD. According to the writer of the article, Zereshk,: "Anti-Iranianism refers to any act act that causes the vast mass suffering of any entity affiliated with Iran." (quote is on the article talk page). That's the problem - this ISN'T an article about racism towards Iranians, its an article about everything anybody ever did that hurt Iran, whether those actions were caused by racial or ethnic prejudice is irrelevant as far as the article is concerned. Quite frankly, this article is a disservice to people who want to combat racism against Iranians because it devalues real racism by effectively calling everything anybody ever did that hurt Iran racist, even if the motivation was purely political or economic. When somebody says that everything anybody ever did that hurt them was racist, than people who might otherwise be sympathetic to combatting racism are going to be less likely to listen when real prejudice occurs. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 03:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm sorry that you feel sad and depressed about how Wikipedia functions; however please understand that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a soapbox or publisher of original thought. The Neutral Point of View policy has nothing to do with demanding some sort of "balancing of perspective" to Wikipedia-- it's about making sure that articles <i>themselves</i> are non-biased. However, the reason an article such as this has no place here is because it is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Original Research</a> -- conflating bits and pieces of history and news accounts into a proposition that there exists some sort of researched topic of "Anti-Iranianism". The very fact that the article itself can't point to a definition from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> demonstrates that this is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a> created to present a particular POV, not an academic or historical term. Every place, group, tribe, religion, cult, organization, political party, business entity, product, movement (did I leave out any categories?) has <i>someone</i> who is "Anti-" them. Just because there are people out there who may not like you, doesn't mean a bizarro-world "Anti-Wikipedia" article is required to set them straight. --<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 03:20, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Still, there is a section on the effect the 1979 hostage crisis had on American feelings toward Muslims in general (inclusive of course of Iranians). A quote: in a 1981 poll of Americans, "50 percent of the respondents described 'all' or 'most' Muslims as 'warlike and bloodthirsty'". I think scholarly work of this type can go a long way toward improving the quality of the article, once consensus has been reached, of course. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:28, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete:</b> This topic may warrant an article in Wikipedia, but certainly not in its existing format. It reads as a polemic that conflates all instances of hostility towards Persia/Iran the state as somehow being a form of discrimination. There is no treatment of (very real) ethnic hatred and condescension towards Iranians within Imperial Russia, while Russian territorial aggression is supposedly passed off as being an example of ethnic hatred?! Russia expanded because it wished to become more powerful. It expanded into Iranian territory because Iran at the time was weak and an easy target. That's only one example from a long list of fallacious assertions in this article. If we are to keep this article, we should start over from scratch with a coherent and limiting definition of what Anti-Iranianism (awkward term in my opinion) actually is. I would suggest: statements or beliefs regarding the cultural or ethnic inferiority of Iranians and actions taken based upon such beliefs. To include an action in this category, therefore, it would have to be demonstrable that it took place because of a belief in cultural/ethnic inferiority of Iranians. Moreover, the link between actions and beliefs would need to be established AND generally uncontroversial within the scholarly literature. This task is far from impossible; salvaging this article based on its present content is, however, impossible.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I agree with most of what you say above except the last part. I don't think "salvaging this article based on its present content is ... impossible" -- it simply requires a great amount of content to be deleted--there has been quite a bit of progress in this respect over the past two days. Also, in response to the reasons for deletion: (1) "unencyclopedic, unscientific, and unprofessional" -- I think you are being a bit too harsh; in any case, this can be corrected by editing/improving the article based on consensus reached on the talk page. (2) The article could (I believe should) be renamed (or moved) to "anti-Iranian sentiments"--this would no longer be a neologism. Overall, I think this AfD has been positive for the article as it has been improved quite a bit (although it still needs a lot of work) and, more importantly, the major contributors have begun discussing on the talk page and on various user pages to establish consensus as to the future direction of the article and to address criticisms raised in the AfD. The thing is: it will require time to improve an article of this size--time which the 5-day limit of the AfD simply does not allow. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 05:35, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I looked back over the very long article, and the only information that I think exists that would be relevant for an "anti-Iranian Sentiments" article is the section dealing with toponymic changes to eradicate Persian names. But that information should be condensed dramatically--I think its length is unwarranted. And more space should be devoted to a coherent explanation of why this activity constitutes ant-Iranian sentiment, rather than to listing empirical evidence of a phenomenon which has many potential causes. Quite frankly, I don't see a use to the rest of the very long list of examples for which relevance is not explained. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreemother199_9604.html" title="User:Treemother199">Treemother199</a> 05:56, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What about the sections noting "in the Greek of this period 'barbarian' is often used expressly to mean Persian" or "Be watchful of Iranian Muslims and never treat them as equals of Arabs"? I do agree that much of the content should be removed as unrelated to "anti-Iranian sentiment", but large parts of the Greek and Arab sections (and small parts of other sections except the Mongols, colonial powers, and the US--I think these three sections should go altogether) should be kept (and possibly the pan-Turkist section as well--I have not read the cited article, so I cannot comment). I do hope that the contributors take to heart the call to devote more space to providing "a coherent explanation of why this activity constitutes ant-Iranian sentiment" <i>based in reliable sources</i>, of course. I think efforts so far to improve the article are promising and that it should be kept so that these efforts can continue. If, after a real effort to improve based on consensus achieved at the talk page, the article still falls short of Wikipedia standards, I will re-nominate it for deletion myself. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:41, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There was also some canvassing by an IP user (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/70.48.243.54" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/70.48.243.54" rel="nofollow">edit history</a>).

<li>The canvassing seems <i>non-partisan</i>. The persons contacted are all interested in Iranian subjects, but there was nothing on their userpages that might constitute being "on the record with a specific opinion (such as via a userbox or other user categorization)".</li>

<li>If I may ask: was the text of the message neutral?

<p>I have nominated this article because I believe that it does not satisfy Wikipedia's requirement of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notability</a>.</p>
<p>Per the notability guideline: <i>A topic can fail to satisfy the criteria because there are insufficient published works from reliable sources that are independent of the subject.5 Without such sources, a proper encyclopedia article cannot be built at all.</i></p>
<p>There are no sources that meet the above criteria that are presented on the page. The only "source" relates to the comment on Bacliff, Texas and not the subject. Further, I was able to find no independent published material that relates to the subject.

<p><b>Delete</b>.For one thing, the article is entirely non-objective. I removed some superfluous fluff, but the whole article reads like a promotional piece. Nothing about the mass criticism his films have received, the questionable content such as using a real infant in one scene, or allegations of anti-semitism...nada. A lot of the information is unsourced as well.</p>
<p>I also don't think he's that notable, at least for an encyclopedia. No one outside the core horror community knows about his work, and a lot of the 'controversy' that his films have received usually stem from his own aggressive message board patrolling.</p>
<p>No categories and no links. He was actually listed on a list of notable horror film directors, but he is clearly not and I removed it. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 18:46, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comment: there aren't sources for the notability of Chander himself as a scientist--his pubmed citations don't place him above "average college professor." The implied notability seems to come from the lawsuit--and not very plaintiff in a lawsuit is inherently notable. In fact, few are. In this case, the damages were extemely low--$5,000--and it's not the only discrimination lawsuit in the history of the world (or Canada). It didn't get more than local mention, it appears. When are plaintiffs notable?--We do not have an article on the woman who received a 4.5 million dollar settlement for the Dalkon Shield, for example (nor would we call her a "human rights activist"). The article appears to have been written by a relative. I don't think mention should be in NRC, either, per due weight. A sentence or two could perhaps be merged into an article about Canadian discrimination lawsuits or something, if one exists.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 01:24, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> There need not be any N as a scientist. The articles is not about his physics, but about the discrimination lawsuit, which I think is sufficiently notable that the article should be kept. NRC Canada is a rather large organization &amp; the article is appropriately mostly an outline linking to the articles about the various component bodies. This material would not reasonable fit in there. The article seems objective enough, and it is sourcd, so I do not see that who wrote it is to the point. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:15, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>It's not sourced, actually--the first "source"is the lawsuit itself, which was not published/is a primary source, and the third is a general article that doesn't even mention Grover. The 2nd source is a small newspaper--The Ottawa Citizen--an article which isn't about the lawsuit per se, but about events which took place after. One indirect mention in a regional newspaper doesn't make it sourced/notable, I don't think...-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 03:52, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Currently, this article is not reliably sourced but rather relies on a bunch of fan websites. That by itself is enough to justify deletion. Additionally, I believe finding reliable sources for this is impossible, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Although Discordianism is a headless and anarchistic philosophy, calling anything other than the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principia_Discordia_be68.html" title="Principia Discordia">Principia Discordia</a> a "Discordian work" is a statement of bias, since it is an assertion that the work is wholly Discordian. Wikipedia simply cannot state whether or not something is Discordian without a reliable reference to back that up. And that's serious business.</li>
<li>The works listed on this page are clearly not Discordian, but some sort of loopy neo-paganism masqueraded as Discordianism.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Additionally, the parts of the article which one might find a source for if one looks hard enough do not belong in the article.</p>
<ul>
<li>The only non-published "Discordian work" -- the "Summa Universalia"-- is merely a footnote to the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principia_Discordia_be68.html" title="Principia Discordia">Principia Discordia</a> article.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocrypha_Discordia_0ade.html" title="Apocrypha Discordia">Apocrypha Discordia</a> already has its own article.</li>

<p>There was a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Discordian_Works_b02c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Discordian Works">previous AfD</a> which kept this article but I seriously do not see how it is grounded in policy. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 20:28, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>delete</b> There is a reasonably good article on the philosophy, where many o fthe works are mentioned, and some articles on the individual works. That is all that is needed, and all that other similar subjects use.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:19, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> Article needs a big clean-up, and much of it could be removed as cruft, but the phenomena of the recent generation of "Holy Tracts" by Discordians is a genuine one, and deserves mention as an important and notable part of modern Discordianism. I think it is demonstrable that each of the works listed identifies itself as a "Discordian Work" -- I'm not sure how the assertion that such a work is *not* a "Discordian Work" would be made (short of the possesion of a magic wand which reveals the Hidden Nature of things laff), but to say they are "clearly not Discordian" is a statement of opinion, not fact.</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>So, can I just write my own self-published book and it's automatically Discordian? In that case, how is this article useful at all?! <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 05:55, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, and it's not automatically Greek Orthodox, either. But if you self-publish a book called "Greek Orthodoxia" and write about the Greek Orthodox church, then that's a Greek Orthodox work. If somebody wrote an article on Wikipedia about there's been a bunch of books, including self-published ones, about Greek Orthodoxy, then someone could mention and describe your book in the article. <a href="../../../m/r/n/User%7EMRN_67b7.html" title="User:MRN">MRN</a> 05:34, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think you understand what I'm talking about. The books on this page are original essays that claim to be Discordian. But you could, for example, write an essay that claims you are a Discordian and the true nature of the religion is Satan worship. Who says whether you are right or wrong? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 13:21, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>A Discordian work (self-identifying as Discordian) which was accepted by other Discordians as being a Discordian Work is probably going to be Discordian. And that might include your hypothetical Discordian Work which postulates that Discordianism was "Satan Worship". This is kinda self-evident, I'm afraid, given the meta-religious nature of Discordianism.</li>

<p>Given that these are lists compiled by practicing Discordians and Discordian Cabals, I'm rather afraid that they count as "reliable sources". I do not understand why you might think that they are not, unless you chose to view them as "fan sites", an epithet which I am pretty sure they would object to vehemently. <a href="../../../d/r/j/User%7EDrjon_0697.html" title="User:Drjon">Drjon</a> 15:34, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> Are we going through all this again? It is reliably sourced--many of the links are to the original sites and even where you can buy a lot of these. And your argument that anything that isn't <i>Principia Discordia</i> isn't a Discordian work is like saying anything that isn't the Bible isn't a Christian work! And then you say the works aren't Discordian but are something else? Based on what?</li>

<dd>I have to ask. Is this deletion some kind of joke or are you really serious?</dd>

<dd>DGG sounds perfectly reasonable, but I do disagree. Many subjects have a lot of articles.

<dd>To comment on something actually worthwhile, we've already had this discussion before, so this is deja vu all over again. If I recall, the only arguments against the article originally were that it only talked about a couple or so Discordian works. Several more were added, the objectors were satisfied, and the situation was resolved. The article stayed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And by the way, Binky, if you do a search on Wikipedia for Nudism and Bahai, you'll find several more articles, which back you up even more. And if anybody checks, I have made at least 100 posts here, so I have the right to an opinion.

<ul>
<li>Which argument? You said it's impossible to find reliable sources because "Discordianism is a headless and anarchistic philosophy, calling anything other than the Principia Discordia a "Discordian work" is a statement of bias." So in another words, it's impossible to justify any article having to do with Discordianism that isn't about Principia Discordia. OK.
<ul>
<li>It's not <i>impossible</i> to justify it, but you need <i>reliable sources</i>. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 01:19, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Or "The works listed on this page are clearly not Discordian, but some sort of loopy neo-paganism masqueraded as Discordianism." -- now that's a logical argument, right?

</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li>Or "this article is not reliably sourced but rather relies on a bunch of fan websites." Most of the sites are the original sources. How can you get any more "sourced" than that?
<ul>
<li>Original sources are not reliable sources, but <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> which cannot be included on this encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 01:19, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So if there's an article on the U.S. Government, for example, we can't use any government site or publication or announcement, etc., as a source? Or if an article talks about the micronation of Sealand (which has maybe one or two residents), we can't use the official Sealand site as a source?

<li><b>Comment</b> Ashibaka has an interesting point - what makes a work notable enough to appear on this page? It's difficult to know how widespread a Discordian work is, but just throwing some text up on a site shouldn't be enough to get you listed here. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenisMoskowitz_1bb7.html" title="User:DenisMoskowitz">DenisMoskowitz</a> 19:19, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> DrJon points out that the great number of Discordian works IS the main point of this article. That's what this article is about--there are a lot of them that have been created in the 21st century. But just saying this is true is not a Wikipedia article. Listing the works, describing them, and showing websites where they can be found, is documentation that this is a real phenomenon and makes this a real Wikipedia article. The growth of Discordianism from works other than <i>Principia Discordia</i> was a big part of Robert Anton Wilson keeping his home during his last days <a href="http://hostgator.rawilson.com/main.shtml" class="external text" title="http://hostgator.rawilson.com/main.shtml" rel="nofollow">RAW Bedside Update October 10, 2006</a>, and the naming of <a href="http://discordia.loveshade.org/ek-sen-trik-kuh/planeteris.html" class="external text" title="http://discordia.loveshade.org/ek-sen-trik-kuh/planeteris.html" rel="nofollow">Planet Eris</a>. If that's not real, then what is?</li>

<dd>Face it. Someone thought it would be funny to put up a Discordian article up for deletion by using silly Discordian-type arguments. Nice joke. Problem is, this is a real online encyclopedia, and not everyone thinks deleting articles is funny.

<dd>However, I believe I am not overstepping my bounds in posting Ashibaka's removed edits to the article as they are mentioned above by DrJon (and yes, if this were used as part of an argument, this could be considered <i>ad hominem</i>; but I'm not making an argument, so judge for yourself):</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>20:21, 31 January 2007: This is evidence that the book is taking itself far too seriously to be a true Discordian work, since obviously it will have no impact on the use of traditional third-person pronouns in Western society. Genderless neologisms are frequently seen in neo-pagan literature, not Discordian literature.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>20:22, 31 January 2007: This, too, is far too serious and self-important to be considered a Discordian belief.</dd>

<p>There is reason to believe that the existence of this office cannot be substantiated. Most of the references on the page refer to the right of the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_High_Steward_of_Ireland_02ee.html" title="Lord High Steward of Ireland">Lord High Steward of Ireland</a> to appoint deputies. However, such deputyships, like appointments as deputy of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Marshal_3faa.html" title="Earl Marshal">Earl Marshal</a>, are not hereditary, as this office claims to be. The one exception, a reference to the Dublin Grant Book of 17 July 1442, appears to be a reference to the creation of the office of Lord High Steward itself. Furthermore, the office does not appear in any of the usual works of reference describing such dignities. Unless further evidence can be produced, I believe it should be deleted as unsubstantiated. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 00:03, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Seems to provide adequate references. On the other hand, I've never heard of this office (and my interest in traditional hereditary offices, and knowledge thereof, is rather extensive). The nominator is correct that most deputies to hereditary officers are not themselves hereditary - for instance, the Earl Marshal traditionally designates his eldest son and heir as Deputy Earl Marshal. However, this isn't necessarily a universal rule, and I would tend to trust the references. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 20:37, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment/question</b> - the article says one of the duties of office was "to formerly act as President of the Court by which a Peer may have been tried by his Peers in the Peerage of Ireland." Was there ever such a trial? If so, there are probably publications available concerning it and they would indicate who presided. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 00:38, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply to Newyorkbrad</b> - Yes, such a trial would have occurred (as Choess says below); historically all peers in the UK had the right to trial before other peers, as they could not be tried before a jury of commoners. In England and Wales they were tried before the House of Lords, under the presidency of the Lord High Steward (more recently, the Lord Chancellor fulfilled this role, as the hereditary Stewardship has been in abeyance for centuries). I presume that in Ireland (before the 1801 Act of Union) the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_High_Steward_of_Ireland_02ee.html" title="Lord High Steward of Ireland">Lord High Steward of Ireland</a>, or his designated deputy, would have presided (as Choess explains below). So you're right, there should be publications relating to this (although bear in mind that such trials were always quite rare, due to the small number of peers compared to the population as a whole). <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 09:08, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> There seems to be some confusion upon points of fact here, so let me try to explain at greater length. Two facts are incontestable: first, that there is such an officer as the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_High_Steward_of_Ireland_02ee.html" title="Lord High Steward of Ireland">Lord High Steward of Ireland</a>, an office now hereditary in the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Shrewsbury_4efe.html" title="Earl of Shrewsbury">Earl of Shrewsbury</a>, whose duties are to carry a white rod on certain occasions and who formerly had the right to preside over the trial of Irish peers. However, as explained in the article on the Lord High Steward (recently expanded, and excellently, by the author of the article now being considered for deletion), the office was for many centuries not claimed nor its rights exercised, until after <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Emancipation_5e59.html" title="Catholic Emancipation">Catholic Emancipation</a>; the Earl of Shrewsbury petitioned to be recognized as Lord High Steward of Ireland in 1862, and was so confirmed. The second fact is that the Lord High Steward had the power to appoint <b>non-hereditary</b> deputies, as the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Marshal_3faa.html" title="Earl Marshal">Earl Marshal</a> has the power to appoint Deputy Earl Marshals. (An examination of the list of Deputy Earl Marshals in that article will show that the deputyship has been given to various people unrelated or distantly related to the Earl Marshal; the grant to the eldest son is a matter of tradition, not of hereditary right.) Again, this is unquestioned, and in the past few years the current Earl of Shrewsbury has announced plans to sell deputyships. Such deputies have the power to exercise all the functions of the office of Lord High Steward of Ireland when the Lord High Steward is unable, himself, to carry them out. All this, I consider to be established. The <b>controversial</b> part of this article is that it asserts the existence of a <i>hereditary</i> deputyship granted to a member of the O'Donnell family, information which is *not* sufficiently corroborated. The first and third references establish the legal basis for creating <i>non-hereditary</i> deputies. I suffered the article to stand for some time on the basis of the second reference, to a grant of "17 July 1442" in the Dublin Grant Books, but I am now decidedly skeptical of that reference (which does not quote from the grant). John Talbot was created Earl of Shrewsbury in the year 1442, and Earl of Waterford and Lord High Steward of Ireland on 17 July 1446. The reference appears to be a confutation of those two dates. Given that the article draws heavily on the description of the duties and rights of the Lord High Steward, this would seem to be a reference to the creation of that office. It would seem most remarkable if the creation of the Vice Great Seneschally, simultaneously with that of Lord High Steward/Great Seneschal, escaped the notice of all the references on United Kingdom dignities which recognize the latter; particularly since I can think of no other <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Officer_of_State_df59.html" title="Great Officer of State">Great Officer of State</a> with whom a hereditary <i>deputyship</i> is associated. The office is described as being associated with that of "seneschal of Tyrconnell", and I find it not implausible that the O'Donnells of Ardfert might hold such an office created by the prerogative of <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Roe_O%27Donnell_aea8.html" title="Hugh Roe O'Donnell">Hugh Roe O'Donnell</a> as King of <a href="../../../t/%C3%AD/r/T%C3%ADr_Conaill_c1f6.html" title="Tír Conaill">Tír Conaill</a>, rather than as part of the United Kingdom system of offices. This would be congruent with the statements made by the author of this article, in other articles, that Hugh "left some of his O'Donnell kinsmen behind in Ardfert," "in stewardship to hold it". If such is the case, I would be happy to see evidence put forth for it, but it should be described as such, rather than part of the official order erected by the then Kings of England. Please note that I haven't put this up for deletion because of republican sentiment or some sort of political nonsense; a considerable amount of my work in Wikipedia concerns the peerage, offices under the crown and so forth. I'm simply concerned that this is not an accurate description. To claim the existence of a demi-Officer of State who has not, as far as I can tell, been recorded in any of the many works on the official structure of the UK is something of an extraordinary claim, and deserves careful scrutiny. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 03:48, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Yes, I'd strongly agree that if this is not an accurate description then it should be altered; I share your interest in the peerage and officers of the Crown. However, what about the references cited in the article? Obviously they could be incorrectly quoted - I don't have reference materials on hand to check them out. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 09:10, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: there aren't sources for the notability of Chander himself as a scientist--his pubmed citations don't place him above "average college professor." The implied notability seems to come from the lawsuit--and not very plaintiff in a lawsuit is inherently notable. In fact, few are. In this case, the damages were extemely low--$5,000--and it's not the only discrimination lawsuit in the history of the world (or Canada). It didn't get more than local mention, it appears. When are plaintiffs notable?--We do not have an article on the woman who received a 4.5 million dollar settlement for the Dalkon Shield, for example (nor would we call her a "human rights activist"). The article appears to have been written by a relative. I don't think mention should be in NRC, either, per due weight. A sentence or two could perhaps be merged into an article about Canadian discrimination lawsuits or something, if one exists.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 01:24, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> There need not be any N as a scientist. The articles is not about his physics, but about the discrimination lawsuit, which I think is sufficiently notable that the article should be kept. NRC Canada is a rather large organization &amp; the article is appropriately mostly an outline linking to the articles about the various component bodies. This material would not reasonable fit in there. The article seems objective enough, and it is sourcd, so I do not see that who wrote it is to the point. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:15, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've noticed that the notability guidelines for schools (it's only proposed, and this is more of my idea:) High schools and jr. highs are usually eligible, and others if of importance, but this is simply a very non-notable, lowly, elementary school with little encyclopedic importance. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReywas92_4c7c.html" title="User:Reywas92"><font style="background:#7FFF00"><b>Reywas92</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../r/e/y/User_talk%7EReywas92_aaca.html" title="User talk:Reywas92"><font style="background:#00ff7f"><b>Talk</b></font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReywas92_Autograph_Book_3e8b.html" title="User:Reywas92/Autograph Book"><font style="background:#BFFF00"><b>Sigs</b></font></a></sub> 02:20, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Right, there is no such policy. WP:Schools says <i>This proposal was <b>rejected</b> by the community. It has not gained consensus and seems unlikely to do so.</i> (It's not even "proposed"--it was proposed and has been rejected.

<li><s><b>Keep</b> Yeah, the lack of sources doesn't help the article much, but it was run in a newspaper for a good long while before it was a web-only comic.

<dd>Hmm, there appear to be varying and apparently inconsistent ways to manipulate the number of Googlits. For example, the search "beevnicks -wikipedia -site:beevnicks.com -site:youdamnkid.com" gets 116,000 hits,<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=beevnicks+-wikipedia+-site:beevnicks.com+-site:youdamnkid.com&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=beevnicks+-wikipedia+-site:beevnicks.com+-site:youdamnkid.com&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> even though there should be fewer than the 448 hits for "beevnicks -wikipedia". What this suggests to me is that the number of Google hits may not be a reliable determiner of notability. I guess my "Keep" argument has to come down to the fact that I believe there is public interest in webcomics like The Beevnicks, and Dunne does seem to have an audience. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_M_Baker_f6f9.html" title="User:John M Baker">John M Baker</a> 16:26, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> - I agree with Plymouths on this one - trim it down, keep a few references... It looks like the biggest problem is the sheer number of TV/cartoon appearances, which are verifiable if and only if someone decides to find and watch EVERY episode mentioned. Personally, if it's possible to find a number of print sources (magazines, books, articles, whatever) with specific page numbers added, it might be easier to confirm references. Otherwise we might need to start asking for series names, episode names, episode numbers, timecodes...&#160;:) --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 09:44, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> pure OR with no sources and based on authors opinion rather than fact.

<li><b>Merge</b> sourced portions selectively into <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghostbusters.html" title="Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a> as a section "Cultural References". Ghostbusters inspired numerous references in popular culture, and some of these need documentation in the main article. Such documentation could easily draw from this article. Prune out the references which consist entirely of original research and weasel words, such as "Luigi's Mansion ... is said to have been inspired partly by Ghostbusters". Leave only the ones with unmistakable references to Ghostbusters, such as the direct use of lines from the movie ("Who you gonna call?", "Don't cross the streams", "ain't afraid of no ghost"), or the references to "keymaster", "gatekeeper", and Zool/Zuul/XUL. Add specific episode references, not just "an episode of". This article needs help, not deletion. To aid in the merge, I would suggest putting a merge template at the top of References to Ghostbusters, but including a specific note in the template suggesting the need for selective merging. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Triplett_ebaa.html" title="User:Josh Triplett">Josh Triplett</a> 07:21, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment. Whilst it's true that a list can have a separate function from a category, that applies when the items in the list are items that <i>don't</i> have their own articles. In this case, the items in the list all have separate articles and are all included in the relevant category, and are listed in alphabetical order - hence it's just a duplicate. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 18:27, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Googling "James Donaldson" + designer gets some results, but only a write-up from his college is reliably <i>this</i> James Donaldson. Article cites no sources to demonstrate notability. While this person may very well be as revolutionary as the article says, I'd say the burden of proof is on the creator. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 23:37, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep (for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_BitTorrent_software_09df.html" title="Comparison of BitTorrent software">Comparison of BitTorrent software</a>)</b>. We're discussing 2 pages of differeing quality. The software comparison page is useful (it sums up important information about dozens of different BT clients), not original research (most of that data is available in changelogs, version descriptions, on the clients' hompages or even their respective WP articles) and well-maintained.

</ul>
<p>I Agree KEEP!! At least for now... This is a fairly new technology and very little independent (self serving) information seems to be available right now. Wiki whatever has become a constant companion tool for all types of research for the past year. As this technology grows and gets more attention, then deletion at a later date may be considered if necessary.</p>
