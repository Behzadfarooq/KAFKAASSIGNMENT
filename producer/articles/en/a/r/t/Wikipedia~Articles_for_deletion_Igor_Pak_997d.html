<p>The result was <b>Keep</b>. Claims of notability are at best weakly established and set out in the article, but better described here. Editors are encouraged to improve the stub. The Math departments bulletin (currently at the MIT Math department website linked in the article), notes a promotion to Associate Professor on page 2, right after a pair of tenure awards. At MIT this rank can be tenured or non-tenured, and in this context I interpret as not yet tenured, contrary to the IP editor's statement below. The MacTutor test is nowhere described as one of our standard tests.

<p>This mathematician does not appear to have sufficient notability. It was never the Wikipedia policy to include all faculty of all universities -- the university websites are sufficient for that purpose. I suggest to stick to really notable mathematicians, like Fields medals or important historical figures. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Nabla2006 (<a href="../../../n/a/b/User_talk%7ENabla2006_9599.html" title="User talk:Nabla2006">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nabla2006_0915.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nabla2006">contribs</a>) 20:32, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am not going to vote because I happen to be acquainted with the subject of the article. I however urge the voters to look up the nominator's contribs -- the deletion nomination is their 3rd edit on the wikipedia, which seems to be done out of spite following own unnotable article deleted. Somebody bit the newcomer too hard, maybe? In general, when somebody asserts non-notability, I'd expect some backing information, such as the number of citations of the AfD subject's works (clearly appropriate in a mathematician's case), some google testing, or whatever.else. Nevertheless, I think that there is no problem in evaluating any particular article's worthiness even if clearly less notable biographies are still present. Go ahead and see for yourself. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBACbKA_d1dc.html" title="User:BACbKA">BACbKA</a> 21:42, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> I'd rather abstain from a more definite opinion but as someone who is somewhat familiar with the research area of Igor Pak, let me make a few (hopefully helpful) comments. I'm concerned about the lack of reliable third-party coverage which would be our only chance to create a thorough article. On the other hand he's clearly an above average mathematician. I've heard his name a number of times (although I share some of his research interests so that might not be so indicative of wider notability) and he's <i>definitely</i> a productive researcher (very solid list of publications) and a respected authority in his subfield. He's a borderline case of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> however because it's difficult to find independent sources that specifically mention him as an <i>important</i> figure whatever "important" is supposed to mean. The situation looks like this: if we believe that Wikipedia should contain articles for every mathematician who makes solid contributions in his field, a few of which will likely still be remembered in 50 years, then we keep this article. If we believe that Wikipedia should only contain articles for mathematicians whose contributions have been central to the advances in mathematics, who will be regarded in fifty years time as key figures of their (mathematical) time, who are or are almost certain to soon be the primary subject of third-party works, who have garnered various mathematical distinctions, then we should delete this article. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 22:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_test.html" title="Google test">Google test</a>. I got 21,000 hits for "Igor Pak" and as far as I can tell they are all referring to the subject of the article. On the other hand, I should mention here that I personally know him. <a href="../../../m/h/y/User%7EMhym_f8c3.html" title="User:Mhym">Mhym</a> 23:48, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is a no-brainer. I'm a mathematician active in combinatorics. Pak is an enormously important combinatorialist, who has important publications across different subareas of combinatorics. I don't have hard data, but he's definitely cited much more than most mathematicians twice his age. I think he clearly meets the criteria outlined in <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. <a href="../../../d/k/o/User%7EDkostic_3483.html" title="User:Dkostic">Dkostic</a> 02:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per <a href="../../../d/k/o/User%7EDkostic_3483.html" title="User:Dkostic">Dkostic</a>. Combinatorial proof of the <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogers-Ramanujan_identities_d7d2.html" title="Rogers-Ramanujan identities">Rogers-Ramanujan identities</a> surely qualifies as "a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specifc field" as required by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Further evidence of notability is that papers that he has authored or co-authored are cited as references in at least 6 different Wikipedia mathematics articles. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandalf61_7a88.html" title="User:Gandalf61">Gandalf61</a> 16:16, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Conditional Delete</b> All of what the keep&#160;!votes say may well be true; but none of it's in the article. Delete unless there is a <i>sourced</i> assertion of notability - for example, a statement of what he's done in combinatorics, and in which papers - at the close of this discussion. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 18:39, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Andrews_b3c5.html" title="George Andrews">George Andrews</a>, leading authority in the field of integer partitions for over 30 years, said "The difficulty of describing a bijective explanation of the first Rogers-Ramanujan identity was recognised by the great peripatetic mathematician Paul Erdös ... it is still an open and exciting question whether a direct bijection explaining the first Rogers-Ramanujan identity can be described ... the original discoverers of all these partition identities - Euler, Rogers, Ramanujan, Schur - used methods of proof other than bijections" (Andrews, Eriksson, <i>Integer Partitions</i>, 2004, p41).

<dd><b>Comment</b> If a mathematician is in MacTutor, he or she is probably notable enough to be here. But absence from MacTutor should not be used to support a claim of non-notability. Last time I checked, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Robbins_eff1.html" title="Herbert Robbins">Herbert Robbins</a> was not in MacTutor. But no one would say he's not notable. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 02:27, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>:Your MacTutor test is very flawed. The MacTutor coverage is rather weak, e.g. note <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Gromov_76f3.html" title="Mikhail Gromov">Mikhail Gromov</a> does not have a bio! Of course, good reasons should always be given, regardless of whether it is for a keep, delete, or nomination. --67.172.164.179 13:19, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>:Looking through his publication list, it doesn't appear to have very much padding. A majority of the journals are very respectable (including Journal of the American Mathematical Society and Combinatorica). Just the handful of results from the very best on his publication list should be more than satisfactory, from what I've seen get kept on Wikipedia. He also managed to get tenure at MIT, which means what he has done is already fairly significant. --67.172.164.179 13:49, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Looking at the earlier comments, there seems to be a feeling that while other professions have to be notable, mathematicians have to be <i>very</i> notable. This is POV. . One standard is clearly, refered to in major works, and that has very clearly been met. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:26, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
