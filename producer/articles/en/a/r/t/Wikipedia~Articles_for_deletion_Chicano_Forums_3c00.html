<p>Spam; written by site's webmaster (Daniel Maldonado as <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualchicano_19fc.html" title="User:Virtualchicano">User:Virtualchicano</a>) for self-promotion – note the use of "we".

<li><b>My Reply</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly object to the term "self-promotion". I did write the article myself because I worried that the nativists and white supremacists would write the article first and fill the article with half-truths and mis-information. I have seen cases in Wikipedia where articles were written by writers from VDare.com and I was simply trying to avoid an article being written about us by them.</p>
<p>I sent an email to a Wikipedian who writes for the "Chicano" category requesting assistance on writing a successful article but I've yet to receive a reply.</p>
<p>I was informed last night to change the "we" in the article and that is what I came in to do when I read my article was marked for deletion.</p>
<p>The changes have been made.</p>
<p>Please reconsider.</p>
<p>In addition, the link to our news website was removed.</p>
<p>If anything, I am guilty of being clumsy and new to Wikipedia. I certainly meant no disrespect and I appoligise for the badly phrased article.</p>
<p>But my concerns remain valid and I prefer to write the article myself than to read a misleading article written by nativist groups.</p>

<p>It is highly unlikely you will ever find "verifiable third party coverage" due to the fact that the word "Aztlan" sends people rushing to silence us. Aztlan is a word that people love to hate. Aztlan is never given a chance to be explained for what it really is, the homeland of the Mexica people. Aztlan is most often used along with the words "myth" and "racist" in a deliberate attempt to discredit anyone who believes the Mexica are entitled to a homeland.</p>

<li>Daniel, no one is trying to silence you. This AfD is based entirely on whether or not your article complies with applicable Wikipedia policies and guidelines. The policies an guidelines here are very clear in their requirement that there be some verifiable level of independent notability about a topic before an article has a place here. There is none that we can find. Additionally, when the subject of an article (or the owner of the subject of an article, or someone who has a strong tie to the subject of the article) writes the article, it raises issues of conflict of interest. That in and of itself is not sufficient to delete an article but that combines with no verifiable notable third party coverage is. Should your forum become notable in the future, defined as being the subject of multiple published independent third party sources, it will become a welcome addition to Wikipedia provided that someone without your level of investment writes it. As it stands, the article doesn't belong. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:01, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>What interest does anyone have in writing an objective article about us? Surely you can see the catch-22 involved. What about the link to Urban Dictionary, will that not suffice? It is unlikely anyone will ever write "verifiable coverage" because they believe it would be furthering or cause. That's like asking the growers to write about the farm workers.</p>

<p>Please do not imply that I am paranoid. Even if you were a qualified professional to make this statement you still do not know me.</p>
<p>I am not paranoid and no qualified professional has ever made that diagnosis about me. I deeply resent this suggestion. Thank you.</p>
<p>As I previously stated, I've seen at least one article written by a member of VDare.com. This is what prompted me to write the article myself.</p>
<p>The Chicano Movement was fine but our community is more about a modern resurgence with a focus on aiding migrant workers.</p>
<p>Lastly, our community served as the main "hub" during last years migrant right's marches. Activists from from dozens of groups were using our site to keep thousands of people informed on upcoming events, throughout the nation, and they still do. I often post the information myself as a courtesy to academics, professionals and Latino community leaders.</p>
<p>The suggestion statement that no one has written about our site because no one has heard of it is mistaken and false.</p>

<li>I searched VDare and couldn't find anything about your site and no articles came up on a google search. If you can find the article, that would at least help your case although <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> requires <i>multiple</i> independent sources. To address one of your previous questions, no Urban Dictionary is not considered a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> because anyone can submit entries to it. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 18:00, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>My Reply</b></li>

<p>I did not say that VDare has written an article about us. I am saying that I was trying to avoid a occurance such as this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Mexican" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Mexican" rel="nofollow">Afro-Mexican</a> , please scroll down to "Admixture" and follow the link "1" in brackets. This link takes you to an article written by a writer for VDare. The problem is that there is no shred of physical or DNA proof that Emiliano Zapata was an Afro-Mexican. The writer makes a comment about his hair as proof. I have viewed the original image and his hair is straight. Also, some people claim that because his parents were from a town where there were Afro-Mexicans living that one can deduce that he was Afro-Mexican. That is also circumstantial, however, but the author leaves the reader believing Zapata was Afro-Mexican. He was not. My daughters were born in Los Angeles, CA where there is a large African American community, this does not make my daughters African American. Although there were and are Afro-Mexicans who deserve there rightfully earned place in Mexican history, Emiliano Zapata was an indigenous, Nahua speaking person.</p>
<p>I simply took the initiative to write the article myself before someone else came along to intentionally write an article that isn't accurate.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to add that we are separate from the above Chicano Nationalist article mentioned in that we do not espouse a "ethnocracy". We believe in a multi-cultural, democratic, center-left nation.</p>
<p>The article I wrote was still incomplete as I fully intended to address false notions of "reconquista" and so on.</p>

<li>You don't seem to get it. You can't just come up with whatever you want and write it on here (there are plenty of other sites that let you do that). Even if it's true, and I don't contend that anything written in the article isn't, it isn't verifiable by reliable sources. Since it is your site, it is natural to think that you would qualify as a reliable source for this information. But according to Wikipedia's policies, you don't. That you are afraid someone that someone will write an attack article about is none of our concern. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 21:55, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Although he does have a point that neither the <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emiliano_Zapata_0674.html" title="Emiliano Zapata">Emiliano Zapata</a> page or it's talk reference him as <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro-Mexican_bbf6.html" title="Afro-Mexican">Afro-Mexican</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStatic_Universe_4c86.html" title="User:Static Universe">Static Universe</a> 22:14, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, but it has nothing to do with whether this article should be kept or deleted: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, sure the article doesn't meet any of the policies; it doesn't even come close. But what you have to remember is that <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chewbacca_defense.html" title="Chewbacca defense">Emiliano Zapata was not Afro-Mexican</a>. He was an indigenous, Nahua speaker. So he's indigenous, not Afro-Mexican. Think about that. So, if Emiliano Zapata is not Afro-Mexican, you must keep.
