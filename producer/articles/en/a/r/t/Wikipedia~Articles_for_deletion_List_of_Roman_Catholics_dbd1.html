<p>This is an overly broad list, which leads to significant incompleteness in each subcategory. Many more narrowly defined lists of Catholics exist - see <a href="../../../r/o/m/Category%7ERoman_Catholics_04be.html" title="Category:Roman Catholics">Category:Roman Catholics</a>. Should be deleted as a list of loosely associated topics, or made a redirect to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Category%7ERoman_Catholics_04be.html" title="Category:Roman Catholics">Category:Roman Catholics</a> or some other such article. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green">NoSeptember</font></a> 17:58, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The list should be modified, but I'm not for deletion. As I said on the Talk page- it's about definition. Catholics are people once baptized in the Catholic Church who have not explicitely "crossed over" into some other faith. They may have become atheists or indifferent, but- this doesnt matter. Btw- was Luther a "Lutheran"&#160;? Or Marx a "marxist"&#160;? <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 18:15, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Use category instead. It's a controversial issue anyway, as a lot of people are Roman Catholic but aren't practicing. Even <a href="../../../e/m/i/Eminem.html" title="Eminem">Eminem</a> is allegedly, theoretically one, but he obviously doesn't practice. Not to mention the category is potentially huge, and would probably have to be broken up into "American Catholics," etc. -<a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewkai_5a1b.html" title="User:Newkai">newkai</a> | <a href="../../../n/e/w/User_talk%7ENewkai_0287.html" title="User talk:Newkai">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Newkai_916c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Newkai">contribs</a> 18:22, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Personally, I think any excuse to delete this list will be attempted! Why is that I wonder? It's not a "controversial" issue either. I have no problems with lists of Methodists and Baptists, Jews and Muslims. But if anyone dares to make a comprehensive list of Catholics the world's is somehow threatened!? I'm all for breaking up the list so that some of the bigger sub-sections can be their own pages. This page is still valid. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPitchka_b625.html" title="User:Pitchka">Dwain</a> 18:32, July 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li>The breaking up of this list as you describe is what <a href="../../../r/o/m/Category%7ERoman_Catholics_04be.html" title="Category:Roman Catholics">Category:Roman Catholics</a> already does. We can create an article for any subcategory on this list that does not already have one, but many subcategories already have their own article (so we are duplicating effort here). <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green">NoSeptember</font></a> 18:40, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Seems redundant with the cateogry and all, and open to anyone throwing their name in the list, particularly as, unlike some other lists, no one is famous just for being a Catholic. I think the same goes for other religion lists. Categories are better. <b>Delete.</b> -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:19, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Far too broad and unmaintainable. There is already Roman Catholics category (which in itself is too broad) and a number of R.C. subcategories. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 21:31, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this and also the categories, all of which are completely absurd. There are more than one billion catholics in the world, and that does not even include dead people. A large proportion of biography articles would have to be linked there and also be put into those categories. You could just as well make a list of men and a list of woman plus categories. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> 21:47, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

I don't think every religious affiliation list is going to be deleted and I don't see how this is different than the others. I do think it might be wise to break it up into sub-lists just as it is a sub-list of the Christians list <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 22:22, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

IS PRESENT, NOT THAT IT IS INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT!! (rms125a@hotmail.com) Addendum to previous message: I think that it would be best to simply place a moratorium on any new additions or edits to the "List of Roman Catholics", so that a division by category can be arranged. I did not realize that space would be such an issue for Wikipedia--as a near-computer illiterate, I thought cyberspace was unlimited, but I see there is a problem, so as of 12:01 A.M. (7/25/05), a MORATORIUM should be installed prohibiting any new additions, deletions, edits, etc., only permitting viewing. Thanks for your attention!! Robert Sieger (rms125a@hotmail.com)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>A moratorium is not necessary. The information in the list will be preserved, either in the current list, new subcategory lists, or in the category scheme (although there are a lot of red links), and it will be at least 5 days before any action is taken as a result of this vote. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green">NoSeptember</font></a> 23:41, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If I may give Mr. Sieger a piece of advice, I wouldn't recommend using Wikipedia as a "back up" or a personal storehouse for information (in fact the comments above nearly made me vote delete based upon the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_original_research.html" title="No original research">no original research</a> rule based upon the impression I got). Anything posted here can be deleted, altered, vandalized, or what have you at any time, and Wikipedia itself has a habit of becoming inaccessible with annoying regularity. If there is any research or information in any article that you've created that you really don't want to lose, I suggest making a back-up of it to either your hard drive or a printed hardcopy ASAP. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 00:52, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Having read the "delete answers", I've came to a unanimous (hehheh..) conclusion: the list <b>must be kept</b>. Arguments for deletion go something like this: <i>yeah, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslims_773b.html" title="List of Muslims">List of Muslims</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html" title="List of Jews">List of Jews</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buddhists_09ab.html" title="List of Buddhists">List of Buddhists</a>, .., too.</i>. It won't happen. These list will not be deleted. So- <b>either all or not a single one</b>. Since the former option is out of question- the RCC list must stay (albet radically modified in not a few features). Since I was the one who has been, initially, the most suspicious about the RCC list, I can ask with some authority: why is this list here at all&#160;? <b>Not accompanied by other fellow lists</b>&#160;? Now, the whole affair begins to smack of something...undesirable. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 07:48, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I'm having difficulty figuring out what encyclopedic purpose the list serves. Is it so that someone writing an article on the Church could use it as a source for "oh, and X, Y, &amp; Z are famous Catholics"? Aside from that (which could easily be handled through the category) I don't see a purpose for it. As much as I love to see new articles on the Church, I think this one has to be a <b>delete</b>. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> Â· <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 09:28, July 25, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I agree with a lot of what Essjay and RJH say but their objections could also be resolved by scaling back the list to the most prominent examples in the various categories.

Also, a person can easily reside in more than one subcategory and with much better visibity than in a list. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydnjo_a2ba.html" title="User:Hydnjo">hydnjo</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/User_talk%7EHydnjo_4abf.html" title="User talk:Hydnjo">talk</a> 22:01, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>To all concerned--I did put Bobby Fischer in as a misfit by mistake because I forgot that the issue was the religion (and he is not Catholic, although he IS a MISFIT) of the individual not the character; also I realized my mistake with Krasniqi and deleted it, but it was on my mind and I am planning to email the Attorney General and whoever else I can think of regarding this Florin Krasniqi who has been an arms trafficker for the past DECADE and it is not a secret that he wants to ethnically cleanse Kosovo of its remaining Serbs; this so bothered me that I posted him, but then realized that he is a Muslim and deleted it.

<li><b>Keep</b> This list is useful, even if it potentially duplicates much of the functionality of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Category%7ERoman_Catholics_04be.html" title="Category:Roman Catholics">Category:Roman Catholics</a>. Furthermore, it is unreasonable to propose it for deletion and not the dozens of other lists. If one really wants to delete this, one should first develop a concensus to Catergory-ify and delete _all_ lists, and begin executing that concensus on less-controversial lists.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> While I believe lists do not belong in an Encyclopedia, they are now an engrained part of Wikipedia. If any list has any right to exist, this one should. However, it mostly seems to be a list of famous or notable Roman Catholics. I vote keep, but I strongly encourage consideration of "Notable Roman Catholics".</li>

<dd>I think it is fairly obvious that this list will not be deleted. <b>But</b>- the point is how to arrange it&#160;? I guess it cannot stay in this form, so, to avoid possible "mammothing", it would be good to break it into a few lists. Just- I don't see how. If a division would be along national lines (Spanish, US, Dutch,..), it just creates more confusion. If it's vocational/professional (writers, scientists, politicians,..)- the naming is problematic (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Proust_9cf8.html" title="Marcel Proust">Marcel Proust</a> was an author who was, techically, a Catholic. But, he was not a "Catholic author".). I'd say the list has to be divided.

<li><b>Keep and break</b>. It's obviously not unmaintainable, as people have been maintaining itâit's hard to patrol for vandals and self-promoters, yes, but the alternative seems POV-ish. If there are lists of Lutherans, Jews, Muslims, and others, and the Catholic list is deleted, it seems as if Catholicism is the "default" religion here, and the other lists are deviations from it. While I have an opinion on this, I don't think it ought to be asserted as fact.&#160;:.) Breaking it up will ease patrolling the pages.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> The category does not give the reference info that this list maintains i.e. if the person was/is a politician, what office do they hold? This list lets you know without going to the individual entry. Big time saver! Camille</li>
