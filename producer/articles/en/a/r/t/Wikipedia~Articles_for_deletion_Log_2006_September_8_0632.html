<li><b>Delete</b> - There is no information about anything in this article, just an advertizement for a future CD release.

<p>There is already an entry for this company at RMAX (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_RMAX_7040.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/RMAX">AfD discussion</a>) which is the subject of a current AfD discussion (the creator of this page has voted on the AfD for RMAX, so he is aware of the existing page).

<li><b>Keep</b> I thought RMAX had been selected for deletion, so I used <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Door_Publications_6c7b.html" title="Dragon Door Publications">Dragon Door Publications</a>, which had never been contested, as a verbatim model so that it wouldn't cause anymore problems to create RMAX International. Now if you want to go ahead and contest <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Door_Publications_6c7b.html" title="Dragon Door Publications">Dragon Door Publications</a> for deletion which I did not create, then that seems fair enough for me to consider dialogue on the issue. However, since <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Door_Publications_6c7b.html" title="Dragon Door Publications">Dragon Door Publications</a> wasn't objected to, and RMAX International is just an inverse of that uncontested template, I fail to see what the problem is. B-ham 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The problem with the RMAX International page is spelled out quite clearly in the nomination above. In short, Wikipedia is not a forum for you to promote Scott Sonnon or related concerns, and you should not circumvent the AfD procedure by creating a new page for the same topic under a slightly different name. Also, this AfD nomination of RMAX International does not require you to agree to "consider dialogue". Incidentally, Dragon Door was previously <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Dragon_Door_5ed7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dragon Door">deleted through AfD</a>, so the fact that a new article has been created there hardly sets a good precedent to follow. You seem to assume that any existing page sets the bar for subsequent pages. However, there are always pages around that violate policies or procedure; the fact that nobody has contested them yet doesn't necessarily prove anything. <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 03:24, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Not "vanity" - I have no personal connection with Pride in Aberdeen whatsover. Possibly counts as "non-notable festival" - but I entered it as a stub partly because it is notable in being a Pride event in the middle of what has traditionally been a homophobic part of Scotland - it's something quite different from the Pride march/festival in Edinburgh and Glasgow - and partly because the LGBT culture in Scotland category looked empty without it. I meant to do the same kind of research on it as I did on Pride Scotia, but haven't had time - RL intervened, and I've only done miniwiki stuff since then. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonmei_2f1b.html" title="User:Yonmei">Yonmei</a> 16:49, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Rather than looking at Google hits: 5000 people came to Pride in Aberdeen this year. That's (about) 2.5% of the population of Aberdeen. Pride in Aberdeen is one of only two Pride festivals in Scotland: in Scotland, it <b>is</b> a notable festival, regardless of the opinions of the many Americans who have commented here saying that it isn't. Looking up Categories, I discover that there are only 174 wikipedians who identify as Scottish (me among them). Is wikipedia, then, an American encyclopedia, and not a global one? Is an event that is one of only two such annual events in an entire country "not notable" because, by American standards, it's a very small festival? <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonmei_2f1b.html" title="User:Yonmei">Yonmei</a> 08:33, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

One is a two paragraph announcement of a screening in Austin (on a city events type website not a newspaper).

<li><b>Comment</b>. Very entertaining stuff! Two things could greatly improve this article: 1) Some kind of popularity data indicating that people are actually paying attention to this video. Sales? Downloads? So far all we have are "testimonials" type stuff (referring to Matthew Bellamy and that other guy) which really proves nothing. Admittedly, I don't know where to get this data either, but if someone can show it has a lot of viewers, I'll gladly vote to keep. 2) Maybe it's just me, but the "Contents" section of the article seems jumbled and hard to follow. Anyway, I'd lean toward keeping this article, with a tad more evidence of notability. Of course, I think the ideas in the video are inane, but documenting influential conspiracy theories - no matter how inane - has always struck me as useful.

The film is very well discussed on the internet but of course paradoxically those sources are considered trivial by Wikipedia. I still believe that this is a notable film but i appreciate that this needs to be established under wiki guidelines. I dont have time to search for more references, I hope somone else can provide them. Or alternatively, perhaps we can consider the option that this is a notable film precisely becuase it is growing in fame despite having neither an IMDB reference nor a full cinematic release. <a href="../../../m/u/j/User%7EMujinga_2c8b.html" title="User:Mujinga">Mujinga</a> 12:56, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Could one of the <b>Keep</b>ists maybe provide evidence that he's been featured in a less obscure venue than the ones currently listed in the article?

<li>I think this is rescuable, with some work.

Given that the study of air quality in the UK by Calor (see <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1292524,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1292524,00.html" rel="nofollow">Guardian article</a>) identifies Oxford as the most polluted city in the UK, a concentration on Oxford seems ok.

<li><b>Comments from page author</b>:
<ul>
<li>Hi thanks Expresso Addict, I entirely agree. Please bare in mind I have only been writing this for a about 8 hours over 4 days. I also wrote the UK section in <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_pollution.html" title="Air pollution">Air pollution</a> and that was my intent to show how local conditions effect the management of air quality. Oxford is a good case study for many reasons, not least because it is one of the most polluted UK cities. The articles I reference are all local government documents and the reason I copied the Oxford air quality summary reports into wikipedia is because the county council keeps moving them, they are PDFs so difficult to reference precise sections and PDFs are also difficult to search. I don't believe there can be copyright issues because these are public documents that are readily available on the web (am I wrong here?) If I am not wrong on this copyright issue then could you remove the deletion marker on these too please. I'll have to attend to the article in the evenings this week so will need more than 5 days to sort it out. Also I am happy to merge with <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_pollution.html" title="Air pollution">Air pollution</a> but had the idea that this could be a template for other entries on air quality for different cities. It is very interesting to see how a wide range of parameters effect air quality. Finally, this is not a report it is just me pulling together lots of publicly available information into one place under the heading of air quality in oxford. i still have to put all the references i have used (they are in my 'delicous account' and I am as yet to work out how to reference effectively (i.e. syntax for constructing a citation list). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../h/n/o/User%7EHnoble32_035f.html" title="User:Hnoble32">Hnoble32</a> (<a href="../../../h/n/o/User_talk%7EHnoble32_4b26.html" title="User talk:Hnoble32">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hnoble32_af36.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hnoble32">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>References are very important to Wikipedia, so it's good to put them in first rather than at the end. Don't worry about the syntax, other people can help with that. Re the other articles, I don't know the copyright situation on local government documents in the UK, but I'd suspect they were copyright unless stated otherwise. It might be wisest to take them down and try to contact the council about the copyright situation. <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspresso_Addict_7f98.html" title="User:Espresso Addict">Espresso Addict</a> 09:26, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I will contact the council to ask how I can cite/ reference their reports. I am assuming since they are a government body I will be able to cite them freely.

So now I will just write here! In summary. I will tidy this article, clear the copyright with county council, and investigate whether it can be included in either <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> or <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_pollution.html" title="Air pollution">Air pollution</a>. My feeling now about merging is that it will be good for wikipedia to have a set of articles on air pollution by city i.e. managing air quality in Oxford is very different to London, Delhi, and any of the top 10 most polluted cities in the world 7 of which are all in China (recent UN report). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../h/n/o/User%7EHnoble32_035f.html" title="User:Hnoble32">Hnoble32</a> (<a href="../../../h/n/o/User_talk%7EHnoble32_4b26.html" title="User talk:Hnoble32">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hnoble32_af36.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hnoble32">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete —</b> I don't think that the air quality of one particular area is important or notable enough for wikipedia. Perhaps having articles on the air quality of a broader geographic scope would be suitable. So, I would merge to a broader page, provided we can get some sources, or just simply delete if there is no useful infomation or sources. This is a fairly large and detialed article, so I think that some of this infomation will be useful in another context. —— <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">ask me for <b>help</b></a>) 21:10, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> That's hardly a valid argument though. I, for one, am grateful for editors who take the time to dig out the cruft and bring it to AfD.

<li><b>Keep</b> Ganser has done important work in progressing a very important and underexamined area of 20th century history. His work is being cited increasingly on this controversial topic, including on the U. S. State Department website where he is accused of misinformation. If this entry is deleted it will be back as the importance of this writer, and the topics he has covered, becomes more evident. Wouldn't it be better to have something to build on, as in this entry. Or, perhaps, we need to make more room for C list porn stars on Wikipedia, in which case this should be deleted. "She" (Ganser) is a he, by the way.

What about noncommercial venues that are well established within the listener base for the genres it plays? <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversalMigrator_09e1.html" title="User:UniversalMigrator">UniversalMigrator</a> 03:54, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just Google progulus and one can see that lots of people art making note of Progulus. Many established bands send their fans to Progulus to listen to their music. It seems that according to your unreasonably strict guidlines that if something is noncommercial and so does not push its image out into the world actively enough to recieve recognition from the corporate world, then it is not noteworthy. This is a strange position for a free information source containing large amounts of user contributions to take, in my opinion. It would seem to me that the very purpose of such a forum would be to gather information of this sort. I suppose that in the end it doesn't matter to you, though. Not until Progulus has several "notable" articles written about it, featured in "noteworthy" newspapers and magazines. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversalMigrator_09e1.html" title="User:UniversalMigrator">UniversalMigrator</a> 04:48, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

Windsor Tribune, 2006-04-24. Seems pretty notable and verifiable to me. Do I need to wait until more articles are written about Progulus to be able to do this? This is not a promotional thing, I'm not even associated with the station operations, I just tune in from time to time. I looked it up on Wikipedia and found that there was no info, so I thought I'd try to put it up. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversalMigrator_09e1.html" title="User:UniversalMigrator">UniversalMigrator</a> 05:18, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>It says multiple non-trivial sources. This has nothing to do with the quality of the station, it's just that WP is for subjects that are already notable(and not for helping something become notable). It can always be re-created if/when it can meet one of those criteria. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 05:26, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, the dprp.net link is essentially a blog, despite it calling itself an "online newspaper". The Greeleytrib link is members-access-only. The windsortribune link is already on the Progulus Radio article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable radio show. Without proper sources for its claims, there is no verifiable evidence presented that the show is "a globally syndicated program", although by that they probably just mean webcasts. I'm also concerned that the "Stations that play the Canvas Prog Hour" section consists almost entirely of redlinks, and that most of them do not sound like radio stations ("Own Dog's Musical Journey"). How about providing call letters for these alleged stations, and their frequencies? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 03:35, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The links were red because they don't have Wikipedia articles, that doesn't mean they're not established stations. Most of the stations are webcasts, so I changed the links and labeled the stations as webcasts. Internet stations don't have call letters, so that answers that rediculous question. Furthermore, I don't know if this is what you're thinking, but I'm not involved at all with the production of this show. I felt that there was enough interest in this program, and that it was "notable" enough to have an article on here. The times are changing folks. Something doesn't have to have multiple articles written about it to have notability. Something can acquire notability through its reputation among its target audience. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversalMigrator_09e1.html" title="User:UniversalMigrator">UniversalMigrator</a> 04:37, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>In all seriousness, this is overkill on self-referencial content. To understand this, this is the place where new projects by the foundation go for testing before they get their own full section.

But this is just the testbed for new projects; they have to come from somewhere, yes, but giving too much into self-content will look bad.

<li>Defunct internet radio station, was notable and had many listeners <b>do not delete</b>. I am one of the programmers of the station and think the wikipedia entry should continue. I take great offense at the comment that this station was not notable. While our numbers were small we had a significant core audience that listened regularly. I would encourage others who liked the station to let their views be known. If this page ends up being deleted I will appeal that. Steven --User:RadioSteven 12:20 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - If I understand correctly, the web page indicates that they commonly reache hundreds of simultaneous listeners. I'm not sufficiently familiar with internet radio station listener stats to determine whether or not this is a high number, but it definitely claims more listeners than most of the internet radio stations that get deleted. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 03:41, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>What I feel is questionable about the articles (which are linked from the Erection index article) is that they have impressive sounding titles but are hosted on Web-based journals (at least I see nothing to suggest that they were in commonly available paper journals) of questionable quality and notability themselves. In addition, the articles were clearly not written with academic discussion in mind, but more like journalist musings, if even that. Further, I suspect the term "erection index" was deliberately used for shock value, which makes it even less likely that good faith academics will adopt the term.</li>
<li>Not only that, but as I wrote, the article itself is close to nonsense. I can perhaps accept the premise that over-building of massive construction projects may lead to an economic recession, but the building of a <i>single</i> huge structure leads to a world-wide economic recession? It's entirely illogical, and unless the "index" actually involves an analysis of world-wide building trends, it will never be anything more than nonsensical. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 16:13, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Subject is, in and of himself, non-notable. The only thing that makes him notable is an alleged revealing of his homosexuality by a non-notable blog, BlogActive, which in turn cites no sources. A New York Times article is suggested is a reference, but nobody can find it. If verification of his orientation by a notable source can be found or if notable media coverage of his outing can be found, then maybe we should keep it, but otherwise, let's let it die.

<p>"Bushism" is indeed exactly a neologism. Where did it come from? Who uses this term? Anyone notable? This article does not specify. The article indeed makes no claims to the notability of this term, whatsoever. It cites no credible references. It is speculative. It does contain a ton of quotes. And a poem. Thus, it's totally unencyclopedic. I suggest we move the quotes not already in Wikiquote to Wikiquote and bag the rest of it. <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwiki_de79.html" title="User:Dwiki">Dwiki</a> 05:29, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> as well-known term. The word was used as the title of at least five books (<i>More George W. Bushisms</i>, <i>Still More George W. Bushisms</i>, <i>George W. Bushisms V</i>, etc). Over 800,000 google hits, and numerous google news hits. The good folks at the <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog" class="external text" title="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog" rel="nofollow">Language Log</a> have referred to the word 37 times.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Bikeable (the books have even spawned desktop calendars). The term is well-defined and commonly used. I'd be behind a move to transfer all the "example" quotes after the first section to Wikiquote, leaving the ones in the "background" section there.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I think 6 years of very <i>active</i> use in a variety of mediums (the books, the calendars, there is even a couple audio CDs) as well as the press mentions has moved "Bushisms" beyond the realm of being a neologism. And as someone who has voted for him, I don't think this is a matter of Bush-hating.

<dd>It's unwarranted to infer from Bush's misspeakings that he's an idiot. Clumsy speakers aren't necessarily dumb. Personally, I think it's just the folksy way he talks. (But maybe I think that because I'm not a Bush detractor.) Or, maybe because it's actually kind of endearing, he does it on purpose (part of his political strategery). The point is that Bushisms are notable because they have engendered chatter from humorists and speculation from analysts. A balanced article should include comments both from Bush's detractors (like Molly Ivins who is already cited) and his defenders. And of course you're right that sentences like what you quoted are not appropriate. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 18:20, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete or Merge</b> As mentioned above, if there's a larger article for gaffes of politicians, maybe this could be moved there.

<li><b>Comment</b> Whether or not politics played a role in the creation of this term or article is simply not relevant.

<p>The result was: this is a tricky one. Articles on flash cartoons frequently generate numerous impassioned appeals for keep on the basis that it is 'popular' ('popular' meaning something different to what most people would take it to mean - the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_on_the_Clapham_omnibus_e84d.html" title="Man on the Clapham omnibus">man on the Clapham omnibus</a> having heard of this - instead referring to recognition among the geek subculture), with little actual verified evidence for notability. In this case we have much the same, at least for the flash cartoon. However, as has been pointed out, this is not just a flash cartoon but a song, played frequently by a notable DJ and partly created by <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Cicierega_969c.html" title="Neil Cicierega">Neil Cicierega</a> who has enough reliable press coverage to be considered notable himself. Generally, Wikipedia consensus considers artists to confer notability on their work - albums by notable artists are considered notable enough for articles, for example. Individual songs are generally not, but when they attract this sort of attention it becomes more in doubt than your average Flash video.</p>
<p>Despite the majority for keeping - even discounting single-purpose accounts - this isn't a vote and I'm not going to describe this as a keep result; there are simply too many 'votes' that even when not from single-purpose accounts, are empty assertions of 'this is popular' and 'definitely notable' with no supporting evidence (not even a 'per x'), and on the other hand there are still legitimate concerns about verification (e.g. the reliablility of the Demento chart and the 'passing mention' nature of the Toronto Star article as extensively discussed above). But if in doubt, we keep, and there's definitely enough doubt at the end of this AfD for this to be <b>no consensus</b>. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:38, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fortunately this isn't <i>Collection of things that impress everyone</i>, but an encyclopaedia. It is the case that the vast majority of editors recognise this as a spectacularly obvious keep. The nom only says "It isn't notable for being on Newgrounds" which is clearly true (WTF is Newgrounds?) but it is notable for a host of other reasons, which have been expounded here. Nobody has addressed them (partially because it's impossible, I would guess) and nobody will. Later we can all recall this when someone puts <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraguay.html" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a> up for deletion as non-notable, and laugh at the parallels to this case. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:13, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're welcome. It's actually pretty reasonable as both are "maximally encyclopaedic" and both have a "zero worthiness for deletion".

<dd>I'm fairly sure that's a reasonable paraphrase of <i>the online buzz about the music on Ultimate Showdown has generated so many Lemon Demon CD sales that he doesn't have to get a "real job."</i> - nor is <i>scant</i> an adjective that can reasonably be applied here. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:08, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not even <i>close</i> to a "reasonable paraphrase". Ask any PR agent, there's a world of difference between a "buzz" and a "large cult following", and you're still mixing up the song (and the CD it's on) with the flash animation anyway, they're two distinctly separate subjects which get rather blurred in this article. <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemon_Demon_9da7.html" title="Lemon Demon">Lemon Demon</a> don't even have their own article, so why should the video for one of their songs have one?

<li>On the Dr. Demento issue, and WP:WEB, let me reiterate what you so clearly ignored. From WP:WEB #3: <b>The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.</b> Demento certainly qualifies as a well known online (and real world) broadcaster, meeting the requirements for 'notability'. It isn't about where the item ranks on his charts. It's that fact that he is well known and distributing it, independent of the creators, on his show. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead">Sparkhead</a> 20:24, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Um, no, the intro says "The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny, often shortened to Ultimate Showdown, is a Flash animation and music video." Period. It goes on to talk about Dr.Demento playing it, of course, which is precisely why I say the article is confused. Is the tail wagging the dog, or vice versa? Scraping together scraps of attempted notability for the song with scraps of attempted notability for the video can't be put together to build a notable <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golem.html" title="Golem">Golem</a> out of its parts. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:43, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you're trying to suggest the music video is disconnected from the song, you'll have to try a little harder. The <i>internet phenomenon</i> originated with a flash animation/music video but spread to other formats (such as radio) To suggest the script Shakespeare wrote for Hamlet is a seperate thing from review of the play based on performances, and that you can't cobble these together to establish a single notability would be just as untenable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:00, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your logic gets fuzzier and fuzzier the more you try to stubbornly maintain. Should I bother to explain why "Song is to its Music Video" is not the same as "Script is to its review"? Nah.

<dd>I just made the point moot...since apparently the song is more notable than the video, I changes the focus of the article's introduction to the song rather than the video.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is a microcosm of Western pop culture: 3 or so minutes of music and/or video that encapsulates a very large chunk of (mostly) late 20th century pop culture. Even if USoUD turns out to be a flash in the pan and sinks without trace after a few months -- well, 9 months and counting to date -- it is significant for two reasons: firstly, by virtue of having that moment of fame, and secondly, because it reflects so much of pop culture.

<li><b>comment</b>: I came to this afd intending to close as keep since its rather unanimous, but I'm inclined to suspect that most of the keep votes are single purpose accounts.

There's a few, but the majority of the discussion has been with established accounts. Why would you be inclined to suspect differently? After all, it's not a vote anyway, right? If a spa comes in and makes a valid point, it's still a valid point.

<li>Bibliomaniac15, you shouldn't go voting on afd's if you have no idea of the article content or history. If you check the text above and history, you already voted this article a <i>keep</i> last week. Today you voted <i>delete</i>, then changed it to a <i>weak delete</i>.

<li>It's not that I enjoy changing votes just for the fun of it. I have checked the history and read the article several times.

Now that I look at it, it fails notability (no news about it), but only because of massive popularity and watches did I change it to a Weak Delete. Although eventually all people and articles run to bias, I strongly suggest that those who vote look at this issue from a neutral point of view, and not because of liking or disliking it. <i><b><a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibliomaniac15_4b0f.html" title="User:Bibliomaniac15">bibliomaniac15</a> 00:22, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</b></i>

However, its only significant content is an external link, which appears to be some kind of web-project by a group of university students. The notability of this scheme is questioned. A check through the external link shows various problems with the Romanisation scheme, and the scheme is very much a work in progress; the website in particular does not disclose any external recognition for this Romanisation scheme.

<li>I nominated this page for deletion, so this should be a foregone conclusion, but... <b>Delete</b>. User:MagicaLaurie is the one who created the article, which, aside from this page, is the user's sole contribution to Wikipedia. Claiming that her article should be kept because she's "a great magician" is entirely POV, and the article cites no sources establishing notability. As <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">User:Resolute</a> states below, being the operator of an internet forum on magic does not make one notable, and I daresay <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Theresa_07ef.html" title="Mother Theresa">Mother Theresa</a> was at least a little more hands-on in her approach. The article also claims that she is "known for her magical writings" and then links to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_conjuring_terms.html" title="List of conjuring terms">List of conjuring terms</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_magic.html" title="Timeline of magic">timeline of magic</a>.

<li><b>Reply</b>: if I would start a project of documenting all Belgian bakeries, would that be a reason to have three line articles on each and every bakery? While primary schools are slightly more important than bakeries, I fail to see how having someone who wants to document something is a reason to keep the articles. By that reasoning, <i>every</i> article shoudld be kept (except jokes and attacks), as they <i>all</i> try to document anything. Having a project, a category, ... is only a way of grouping things, but grouping unencyclopedic things does nnot make them any more encyclopedic or worthy of inclusion. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:45, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b>: I don't think that <i>being a stub</i> is a criteriopn for deletion, and I don't believe anything I said here reflects such extreme position. Articles that document subjects without any importance beyond their existence (i.e., they are a school) are directory articles. Nothing more of encyclopedic value can be said about them. Pointing out anything to the contrary (i.e. a reliable, reputable, verifiable source, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, asserting the importance of this particular school, would be a good argument against deletion. For now, all I have seen is the argument that all schools are inherently encyclopedic, which is equally unuseful to argue for keeping. The article is sourced, but that does not make it encyclopedic. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a directory, and that's policy. And sourced... well, let's take <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrick_Primary_School%2C_Warrenpoint_852a.html" title="Carrick Primary School, Warrenpoint">Carrick Primary School, Warrenpoint</a>: two directories (which Wikiepdia, again, is not), and an article in which it is mentioned in a list of 31 schools. The info given is correct (and I didn't claim otherwise), but of encyclopedic importance? Another one? <a href="../../../i/v/e/Iveagh_Primary_School_a430.html" title="Iveagh Primary School">Iveagh Primary School</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Mary%27s_Primary_School%2C_Ballyward_4760.html" title="St. Mary's Primary School, Ballyward">St. Mary's Primary School, Ballyward</a> are only sourced by two directories and are nothing more than directory entries themselves.

<dd>I am representing your argument accurately. To take the top school (why not, since they're listed together) there is some information here beyond <i>a directory</i> - not very much, because the article is a stub. The article does clearly not say "<b>Abercorn Primary School exists, and is a primary school</b>" which might qualify as a directory entry. It refers to published documents on the school, et cetera. When evaluating articles at AfD, it's essentially sufficient to ask <i>Is this article verifiable?</i> and <i>Is it encyclopaedic?</i> - in this case, both answers are yes. While there are exceptions to the evaluation I expounded (i.e. <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORKs</a>) it's generally accurate. The article is sourced, and its encyclopaedic. No argument has been presented for deletion that isn't false upon its face. Whether or not all schools are encyclopaedic, I have no idea (although obviously certain classes of things are invariably encyclopaedic) - nor is it really relevent here. Rather than say <i>In my opinion, is this important enough to be encyclopaedic?</i> (which almost always results in someone saying <i>Do I personally give a shit about this article?</i> I find it's far more useful to ask <i>Has some other source found it worthy of encyclopaedic type documentation and publishing?</i> which gives a far less biased result, (although it isn't useful for pushing any agenda). Here, the article is verifiable, encyclopaedic, sourced and the claims that they're directory entires (at least in the case of Abercorn) is just plain false. Evidentally <i>someone</i> has found it important enough to publish this kind of information, which I'll take to mean it is important over the dubious unsupported assertions here to the contrary. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:04, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Umm, the sources for Abercorn are not really of encyclopedic value: there is the school website, a directory service, and the school inspection report. So if I can find a bakery with a website, a listing in a directory, and a food inspection report, I can include it here as well? My arguments are not "false upon their face" and my assertions are not "unsupported", thank you. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:14, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not really sure what you mean by <i>Sources are of encyclopaedic value</i> - Many, if not most towns and cities have articles that are nothing but regurgitated census data created by a robot ... This seems to be almost identical in "source quality/nature" to the school evaluation reports, for instance. With respect to a bakery there are policies/guidelines that apply (i.e. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>) where none apply here. The argument you present remains false upon its face, and your assertions on reasons for deletion remain unsupported. Claiming otherwise will not change this. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:35, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I take issue with WilyD's assertion that the test <i>In my opinion, is this important enough to be encyclopaedic?</i> "almost always results in someone saying <i>Do I personally give a s**t about this article?</i>." I personally don't give a&#160;!@#$ about <a href="../../../v/i/n/VINSON_3f5c.html" title="VINSON">VINSON</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_ef58.html" title="American Idol">American Idol</a>, or <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparative_sociology.html" title="Comparative sociology">comparative sociology</a>, but I understand that these topics in voice encryption, trends in pop culture, and academic research are all ultimately relevant to everyone, and therefore encyclopedic. But the existence of a school called Abercorn in County Down isn't relevant, or potentially relevant, to anyone outside of County Down. If, for example, some kid at that school discovered a method for <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">cold fusion</a>, then it might be relevant. But no one is making any such claim.</p>
<p>I also think that it's obvious that the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_education.html" title="Primary education">institution of the primary school</a> is important and encyclopedic. But this doesn't imply that <i>every primary school</i> is encyclopedic, any more than the notability of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home.html" title="Home">Home</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grocery_store.html" title="Grocery store">Grocery store</a> implies that my house and the grocery store I go to are encyclopedic. The burden is on the other side to show why <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abercorn_Primary_School_7b51.html" title="Abercorn Primary School">Abercorn Primary School</a> et al are distinguishable, and assertions such "Abercorn 'provides a secure and stimulating environment for children ... emphasis is placed on children showing courtesy to classmates, teachers and visitors and all staff endeavour to relate work to the children's interests and daily lives'" just don't cut it.</p>
<p>Finally, proponents of including schools in Wikipedia often cite some characterization or other to the effect that encyclopedias are compendia of knowledge, info about a school is knowledge, therefore schools merit inclusion. To this I would respond that the nominated articles don't impart any meaningful knowledge at all. Everybody knows that there are primary schools in Northern Ireland (if not they could read <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_Northern_Ireland_bce2.html" title="Education in Northern Ireland">Education in Northern Ireland</a>), and knowing that one of them is called Abercorn, and it's in County Down, just isn't meaningful. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:10, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Take a stroll through AfD and really give it a look and you'll see it to be the case. Notability is used either as a euphanism for SPAM, or to say <i>Well, I don't care about it.</i> - As for the article, it remains sourced, encyclopaedic, verifiable and everything else you could reasonably ask of it. The main thrust of the argument for deletion is it's low information content (because it's a stub) but this isn't a criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:38, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(1) Others may use NN interchangeably with SPAM or "I don't care about it," but not me, and all the people voting "delete" in this debate have intelligent arguments that amount to a lot more than "I don't care about it." (2) I agree that the nominees are sourced and verifiable. The question is, are they encyclopedic? I argued above that they are patently unencyclopedic because they have no relevance or even potential relevance to anybody living outside of County Down. Now, can you say why the nominees deserve to exist on Wikipedia, but not the grocery store I go to, which enjoys news coverage from local business papers? Or local bakeries, which as Fram pointed out above, may have websites, and may be listed in directories and food inspection reports? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:12, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not really sure exactly how far the influence of something has to spread before it's "encyclopaedic". I am, however, fairly sure it's not "the whole globe". As for a bakery, a concensus exists with <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, no such equivilent exists for government institutions. I continued to stand by my position that it is preferable to use the judgement of the government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland about whether this school is notable than it is to use my own bias. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:19, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(1) By analogy with WP:CORP, which distinguishes notable from NN businesses, I would argue we need to distinguish between notable and NN schools. And whatever criterion consensus would come up with for judging notability of schools, these schools just wouldn't make the cut. (2) I don't think the gov't of the UK has made a judgment that these schools are, or are not, <i>notable</i>. The gov't of the UK accredits, funds, and, I suppose, may run these schools to some degree. That's why they list them in their directory of schools. That has nothing to do with encyclopedic notability. If it did, then my home would be encyclopedic and notable simply by virtue of being listed in my city and/or county register. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:27, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is a bad analogy because its a specific guideline - generalising from it is not really advisable (because it's a haphazard process of random guesses, essentially). No criterion concensus exists for schools, nor will one exist soon (if you see many schools in AfD, you'll know why), and to try to guess <i>anything</i> about how it'll turn out is simply impossible. The evaluation report is not simply a directory of schools, but a third party publication. At least until a <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOLs</a> guideline is set, trying to ram schools through AfD that pass every relevent criterion, policy and guideline is inappropriate. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:32, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>My point was that <i>any</i> nontrivial guideline for schools would have to exclude the nominees at issue. There is simply no distinguishing feature here. If these schools were kept per whatever guideline we eventually adopt for schools, then all schools would be admissible under that guideline. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:54, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I find myself reading them and asking, "What's important about this school?" My response is, "Nothing." Then I ask myself "What impact has this school had on society as a whole? What's unique about this school as opposed to all other primary schools in the world?" And again, the answer is nothing. We have an article on primary schools that should explain what goes on in these schools quite nicely. It boils down to the fact that there is nothing unique to say about any of these schools, so the entries all amount to, essentially, a directory listing. I'm sure the schools are important to the children that attend them, perhaps even the graduates and certainly the teachers and parents. However, they're not notable (yup, I said it, and what I mean by it <i>in this context</i> is: <b>important</b>) outside of their respective towns. There are a bare minimum of several hundred thousand primary schools in the world. These are just like all the rest. If someone can supply us with a famous alum or notorious incident that occurred at one of the schools, I'd change my "vote" to keep, but just for that one. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 18:55, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, "Information such as enrolment, date of foundation, class size etc" doesn't need its own article.

But second, Kappa, I really have to disagree with your assertion that this info "is encylopedic because it aids understanding of a topic people care about, i.e. it is knowledge." People who send their kids to schools in County Down care about it, and that's what local information sources are for. County Down parents aren't gonna come to WP to look for this info, nor should they. Above all, I urge a distinction between knowledge that is ultimately relevant to everybody like the info in the article on general <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_education.html" title="Primary education">Primary education</a>, vs. knowledge that has no relevance or meaning to anybody living outside of a certain locale. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:44, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>County Down parents <i>should</i> come to wikipedia for encylopedic treatments of local schools, because that's our job - being an encylopedia. By synthesizing multiple sources we can provide a service no-one else can (<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/eventually" class="extiw" title="m:eventually">eventually</a> in some cases) It's reasonable to make a distinction between general-interest knowledge and specialist-interest knowledge, but since we are promising everyone access to the "sum total of human knowledge", destroying all specialist-interest knowledge is the not the way to do it.

<dd><b>Reply</b>: What? In what way is this a disruptive nomination (borderline or not)? These articles are very similar, both in subject and in content. It would be ridiculous to Afd one of them and not the others (even in this AfD, the often misused argument "because unrelated article X is not deleted (yet), this one should stay to" is already used: imagine if the same could be said about a truly similar article!).</dd>
<dd>I'm amazed that some supporters of all school articles, no matter how uninformative, uninteresting, and unencyclopedic these articles are (and ever can be), feel the need to try to reason away the AfD by making borderline attacks instead of trying to defend the articles. All the defense we have until now is "the articles are correct" (true, but irrelevant), sourced (true, but irrelevant), and encyclopedic (untrue, but debatable). Most of these articles are only directory entries and thus fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> fair and square: the few that have an additional line of info are still utterly irrelevant for anyone outside the village they serve, and would be better as short sections in the articles of those villages. All of them can be deleted by Wp:NOT, which is a policy. No one has explained why we need "comprehensive coverage of education in County Down" to the level of listing the number of students, the address of the school, or the distance between the school and the town centre. Wouldn't it be better if we had an article or even a paragraph discussing "education in County Down" instead of a bunch of extremely similar, uninformative directory listings of all individual schools, if your aim truly was "comprehensive coverage of education in County Down". With the current articles, I know nothing about education there except that there are schools.

<dd>In the case of the nominees for deletion here, the "knowledge" they provide is meaningless and irrelevant to anyone outside County Down, and for those in County Down, it's directory info. Now, those who seek to learn more about primary schools in Northern Ireland, as Kappa does (and I respect Kappa for that desire, make no mistake), can read the article on <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_Northern_Ireland_bce2.html" title="Education in Northern Ireland">Education in Northern Ireland</a>. I fail to understand how Kappa and others' quest is satisfied by reading that there is a school called Abercorn in County Down, 500 students attend it, and it "provides a secure and stimulating environment for children ... emphasis is placed on children showing courtesy to classmates, teachers and visitors and all staff endeavour to relate work to the children's interests and daily lives." And as Fram pointed out, there is no one here who has any ideas on how this article or its fellow nominees can be expanded. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 22:38, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A school with 500 students is very different from a school with 100 students. A school which emphasises courtesy is different from a school which emphasizes achievement, or discipline, or independence. These things help readers to understand the school, hence they are encylopedic. What wouldn't help me to understand the school is its telephone number... that's the kind of thing I would look for in a directory. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:31, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I don't understand how you can learn anything about the school through that quote (the one about "provides a secure and stimulating environment..."). It sounds like it came from a brochure, and brochures, like advertisements, sometimes lie. In fact it sounds like it could have come from the brochure of <i>any</i> public primary school in the English-speaking world, including those schools of which it's not a true depiction. A definite knowledge of what a school is really like can only come from talking to people actually involved with the school, and as such talk is never published, alas, there's no way for that kind of info to make it onto Wikipedia without violating WP:OR or WP:V. Now, the gossip might get verified and published by reputable newspapers if the school was especially <i>notable</i> for some reason--that's why some of us here keep talking about notability--it really is essential to an encyclopedic article. But for non-notable, run-of-the-mill primary schools like these, there's just no way to get complete, sourced articles, which is sort of the point that Fram has making all along, much more ably than me. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:01, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Even if it could be verified that Abercorn practices the (unremarkable) philosophy espoused in that quote, I fail to see what significance that unremarkable fact can possibly have to anybody outside of County Down. As for the fact that there are 500 students--I fail to see, again, how that bit of trivia can have any meaning at all to anybody other than a County Down parent. What <i>would</i> be notable is an overall assessment of the different philosophies of all the schools in Northern Ireland, and overall statistics on school size in Northern Ireland, but such info belongs in a more general article, such as <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_Northern_Ireland_bce2.html" title="Education in Northern Ireland">Education in Northern Ireland</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:03, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I want know about a school, the first things I want are its size, how long it has been there and its philosophy (assuming philosophy varies by school, as in the UK, instead of by district, as in the US.) For Northern Ireland I'd also like to know its religious profile. If I have these things I feel I understand it, in a basic way. To me these things are knowledge. If you tell me I can't have these things, they are "not knowledge", that I should read education in Kyrgyzstan and draw my own conclusions... well I think that you have denied me something very precious. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:41, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OR/V is answered by government inspections and coverage in local newspapers and books about local history. These can be already be found online for most of these schools and will be available for all of them sooner or later. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:29, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but the notability issue persists. The gov't inspections and coverage in local newspapers talk about things that could be said about any school. They don't distinguish the school. And I am not persuaded that if you want to research the religious profile (as you said above) of schools in Northern Ireland, that you would be best served by reading one article for each of the thousands of primary schools in Northern Ireland. Far easier and more reliable would be to read something that discusses primary schools in Northern Ireland in general, for example <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_Northern_Ireland_bce2.html#Integrated_Education" title="Education in Northern Ireland">Education_in_Northern_Ireland#Integrated_Education</a> (which should expanded, by the way). One simply gains no more edification from understanding "in a basic way" a local primary school—one of thousands in Northern Ireland—than from understanding local grocery stores, pubs, or coffee shops. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:52, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep all</b> - schools are inherently notable, hence my desire to build a comprehensive listing and articles for all schools in Northern Ireland (not just County Down as the originator mistakenly seems to think). Frankly I am appalled at this debate at all - I was following the lead of Schools categories in Australia, Hong Kong and even England - are you suggesting all the primary and preparatory schools articles there should similarly be excised? Primary schools are indeed notable in their communities and in Northern Ireland and are vehicles to attract more readers and contributors to Wikipedia. This has been proved as the lists and my stub articles are now being added to by other new contributors. Most of the articles are stubs to be built upon, or have we lost that concept? I would suggest that schools are more notable than say porn stars, but you are not suggesting excising those articles.

<dd><b>Reply</b>, actually, they do meet the criteria of WP:NOT, as Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information (and these articles are just that), and Wikipedia is not a directory (and an article like <a href="../../../i/v/e/Iveagh_Primary_School_a430.html" title="Iveagh Primary School">Iveagh Primary School</a> is nothing but a directory entry). Can you give us an idea of what information, specific for any of these schools, would be added later on? You are basically saying that they are notable and interesting, but that that will only become clear when the article is expanded.

<dd><b>Reply</b>: like Pan Dan said (thank you)/ Take <a href="../../../i/v/e/Iveagh_Primary_School_a430.html" title="Iveagh Primary School">Iveagh Primary School</a>: the complete article comes from the link "Schools Web Directory", except the age of the pupils and the number of them (a whopping 50, or some 6 per year...). That info comes from the other link, the Good Schools Guide, which is nothing but a directory (the information you getr when you follow the link at least). This article is nothing but directory information. It contains no info on what makes this school notable, how it would be interesting to anyone outside Rathfriland, how the educational system of County Down works, etcetera. The only reason anyone can give to have this article is that for them, all schools are notable, even if there is no info available except the address and number of pupils. I don't have anything against that position, although I heavily disagree with it, but I don't get why most people seem so anxious to admit that that is their criterion, and try to find other reasons, or try to make this AfD look negative on principle. But since this AfD seems at first glance to be going to a no consensus, I suppose we'll have to see in a year or so if a) these articles are indeed vandal magnets (a primary school with 50 pupils? I would be surprised), and b) if they indeed will have improved in a year time. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 18:26, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I added the articles (specifically as stubs) to encourage other users (educationalists and professionals, not just school kids) to start to contribute and enter more information, particularly where I haven't been able to find a mass of starting information. Schools are a very good starting point to drive up interest in WP (surely one of the goals??) I thought WP was meant to be a collaborative effort and not about only adding fully and finally researched and completed articles - hence stubs - of which there is a vast volume in WP (and rightly so). Myself and other contributors will add more to the articles in time in the way that WP is supposed to be built up.

<dd><b>Reply</b>: No, I have not dismùissed or forgotten the concept of stubs. I refer here to the <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>, which talks about stubs (with potential), which should get expanded, not deleted. I considered these stubs as stubs without potential: you can write more about them (and it may be verifiable and sourced), but in my opinion, it would still be an example of indiscriminate, unimportant information. I come back to my bakery example: you can write a stub about a bakery, and probably someone can come along and write something more, with info out a local newspaper, a food inspection report, ... This would still be a perfect object for deletion via AfD, as the consensus (<a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>) is that these are not important enough to list. The problem is that no guideline on schools has been agreed on, so that we have to rely on our feeling of what is and what isn't notable enough. Being a stub that may be expandable is not an argument against deletion per se: if the expansion would not make the stub any more notable, then it would still be fit for deletion, unless you feel that all schools are per se notable. The arguments about them being stubs is a non-issue. Either they are stubs, in wich case I can't delete them because they will be expanded, or they are full articles, in which case I can't delete them because they contain lots of info and work. This is of course false: the real choice is that either they are about notable subjects (keep), or they are about non-notable subjects (delete). While for some of the articles more info has been added after the AfD started (which is good), none of them has made the school any more notable. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 21:00, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Above the case was made on the basis these articles violated the deletion policy by containing only "directory information". Now you are saying they contain only "non-notable" information because any information about a non-notable school is inherently non-notable.

A reading of <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> shows that it makes no reference to "stubs (with potential)" or otherwise, and Primary schools articles have lots of potential if you choose to see it. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> makes no mention at all that "the consensus is that these are not important enough to list". Both statements are entirely unsourced and seem to be merely one person's opinion. I would be happy to see the quoted references. Comparing bakeries to Primary schools is also illogical and spurious, how can educational establishments not be notable. Obviously Wikipedians in Australia and Hong Kong didn't find primary schools non-notable and set a valid and important precedent - you will have an interesting time suggesting deletion of all those articles (which of course would be consistent with your view). You also didn't answer my question posed so long ago about whether porn stars are more notable than Primary schools - yet WP is stuffed full of porn star articles. Let's get rid of them. What about all those airline stub articles for airlines with one plane - let's get rid of them, or what about comics, why are they more notable. This sort of argument is the road to making this an entirely non-encyclopedic encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 22:22, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reply</b> to "reply to user Fram", a few posts above: in the "Problem articles where deletion may not be needed" of <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>, there is an ecplicit reference to "stubs but with potential", which should not get deleted. I agree;, being a stub is not a reason for deletion per se, and contrary to what people seem to have read in my posts, I don't think I have ever used it. I have used two main arguments for deletion: some of the articles are nothing but directory articles, and all of the articles are about non notable subjects. The first is a policy, the second is a general way of looking at what should be included and what not, again in the spirit of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, the general rule that WP is not an indiscriminate collection of information. There is no notability guideline for schools, and that is a pity, but if you put your standard for inclusion higher than "all schools are notable" (which, I repeat it, is in itself a debatable and valid position), then many primary schools, for example the ones up for AfD here, would be the first to go. I hope we can all agree on that? Now, when you try to find comparable guidelines and situations, one you easily find is <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, which I used <i>not</i> to show that schools should be deleted (as <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> does not address schools), but that the arguments used that an article should not and can not be deleted because it is sourced and verifiable are invalid. A sourced and verifiable band, corporation, person, game, ... can all be deleted if they fail to reach the minimum standard for notability. Since there is no <i>fixed</i> minimum standard for schools, it is up to us, every AfD again, to decide individually what our standard is, and it is the right of the defenders of the articles to give as much information and sources as possible to make the articles pass the standards of more people. I hope that still everyone agrees? Now, the debate is about what your individual standard is, and if any of the articlss have given any info that would make them acceptable to more people than just those who think that all schools are notable. For me, none of the articls have done that, and as my standard is that a school is not notable for being a school, they all should be deleted. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 07:08, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Some of those schools in those categories look like they should be AfDed also while others actually have minimal claims of notability (and no, no matter how many times the claim is made, existence is not grounds for notability by itself).

<p><b>Merge</b> into articles about corresponding villages/towns. If high schools are notable then so are primary schools in my opinion. Just because the kids are younger and take fewer drugs shouldn't affect that criterion. However, I don't think that means there should be atomic articles for each primary school. Much more useful to have the primary school discussed in the context of it's village and general population IN the article about the village/town.

<p><b>Comment.</b> You know, I have read, somewhere in Wikipedia space, how the encyclopedia is <i>not</i> limited on space. I suspect that many rules (regarding <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> etc) were written at a time when space was a premium. Wikipedia has existed for a good number of years now (I remember when it was text-only), and start at a time when hard drive space was comparitively small and costly. Today one can buy a gigabyte of storage space on a handy USB keyring device quite cheaply. Hard drives cost less than 50p (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Sterling.html" title="Sterling">Sterling</a>) per <a href="../../../g/i/g/Gigabyte.html" title="Gigabyte">Gigabyte</a>. More importantly though, the size of hard discs is increasing almost exponentially. The first hard drive I bought was 20 <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megabyte.html" title="Megabyte">Mb</a>. My current <a href="../../../r/a/m/RAM_e536.html" title="RAM">memory</a> is 50 times bigger! The current average hard drive storage space is over 4,000 times bigger. The current article about Abercorn Primary School looks to me to be about 1 <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilobyte.html" title="Kilobyte">kb</a>. Two hundred of similar such articles would therefore take up 200k - less than 0.00025% of the average currently sold hard disc.. <i>in total</i>.<br />
I personally don't see the reason why Wikipedia cannot be an encyclopedia on everything: we are not confined by shelving space, portability or storage space.<br />
There are plenty of articles that exist already which are arguably less 'notable' than primary schools in a given region of the world. If an editor wishes to start an article on <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navel_lint.html" title="Navel lint">Navel lint</a>, I don't see why this should be prevented. In fact that particular article's existance could be defended as being 'notable' as most people of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_World_97bb.html" title="Western World">Western World</a> have been 'victim' to it! In summary, at the minute, I feel like we have plenty to be getting on with, and we don't appear to be running out of space in the forseeable future. The rules, which I assume were written some time ago now, are possibly out-dated (in relation to the reasons for their creation). --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 07:57, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(Edit conflict)Can you point me to all those articles on primary schools that have survived an AfD?

In fact, none of the articles in <a href="../../../s/c/h/Category%7ESchool_districts_in_Oregon_5b9e.html" title="Category:School districts in Oregon">Category:School districts in Oregon</a> have links to articles about elementary schools (and hardly any middle schools): only high schools get articles.

There are of course articles about primary schools (sadly), just like there are many, many other articles that have no place on an encyclopedia. I already get nasty remarks about nominating twelve related ones at once, so you can hardly expect me to nominate them all at once... But there aren't that many as you may think: 17 for the whole of Australia (<a href="../../../p/r/i/Category%7EPrimary_schools_in_Australia_cfe5.html" title="Category:Primary schools in Australia">Category:Primary schools in Australia</a>), or 1 for Lancastershire (<a href="../../../p/r/i/Category%7EPrimary_schools_in_Lancashire_a2a2.html" title="Category:Primary schools in Lancashire">Category:Primary schools in Lancashire</a>).

<li><b>Comment</b> "Uninteresting, interchangeable schools" - nice - people in Northern Ireland and in those communities would be so delighted to hear this, just as much as this author is delighted to hear it and authors in USA, Singapore etc etc etc will be delighted to hear it. You are of course entitled to your opinion, but I do have a problem when it is hampering work many of us feel is important however. As a result the frustration of <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> is, of course, nothing compared to my own.

<li>I would like to comment on BT Lizards use of the word spurious. Classing other peoples opinions as spurious purely due to a differing opinion is very self righteous. Just because it's different doesn't mean it is false or wrong. I think this statement proves that this entry and others like it should stay to ensure that there remains a balance of items for people with differing opinions. The majorities tastes and opinions do not necessary suit everyone who uses this site. I stumbled upon this entry whilst writing an essay on the increasing influence of American culture on British society. One such example of this is the increasing number of such fraternity/sorority groups and gangs in modern day British culture. I found this entry very useful indeed.</li>

There aren't very many cases of someones parachute risers being deliberately cut in a murder or suicide attempt. It did get a considerable amount of converage, and there were a few documentaries filmed about this story. The name Stephen Hilder is pretty well-known in the skydiving community.

<dd>It was a huge news story and definatly will be something people look back on in years to come especially as there was so much mystery surrounding what actually happened and what caused Stephens death or whom. There are many other articles on Wikpedia and some have not even been big news, therefore if this is deleted then I have a list of lesser events etc which I think should definatly be deleted too. Wikpedia should cover as much as it can so it has variety and can satisfy its readers and fufill there search needs and hence limit itself and the information which it provides.</dd>

<dd>To delete would be a mistake and it would be like censoring an historical event which happened, what will be next, who should decide what is worth mentioning and what is not&#160;? Freedom of speech is another factor, it was a huge story and people in the future deserve to be able to find out more details regarding what exactly happened. Hence posting would be a good idea. I think in time this story will get bigger as has happened with various events in history for example the Jack the Ripper murders was nowhere near as big an event at the time as it is looked back on today. However I more then welcome people adding too and expanding the story. But it definatly needs to be kept in my opinion...

<dd>If you give this article another chance, it WILL be expanded. Like I said earlier, there are entire documentaries about the Stephen Hilder investigation. This is a VERY notable news story. It would definetely be a huge mistake to delete an article about one of the most mysterious and disturbing skydiving accidents in recent times. I definetely think this article deserves a chance to be expanded and become more encyclopedic. I changed my earlier vote to "strong keep" after thinking about it for a while. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBennyD_5595.html" title="User:BennyD">BennyD</a> 18:02, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hello, I am the author of the article. Thank you for your interest, and I would like to address your concerns. I am curious about what it would take to verify the information in this link. I, along with a couple of others, wrote the original “Way of the Calyr” in the 1990’s. (I was the main contributor, and the copyright to the book is in my name.) We put the website up this year.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Otherkin.net site, (the largest otherkin site) the Calyr Church is listed as the fourth most popular link, even though it is fairly new. The Silver Elves, whom you have had an article about for a couple of years now, has listed the Calyr Church website as one of their special links (they only have around 8 or so, so they aren’t link mills). The Open Directory Project has deemed it worthy of inclusion in their list of religions.</p>
<p>I’m wondering what would warrant inclusion in your site, and whether I would be able to accomplish that to your satisfaction. Could you let me know what the specific problem is? Perhaps if you could explain why articles like the Silver Elves are acceptable, I would be able to update this article to conform to your specifications.</p>
<p>I have checked out quite a few of the new religions in your links, and there are several that I must admit, I am scratching my head to try to figure out why their links are not targetted for deletion if the Calyr Elves Church is. Please don’t take that the wrong way. I have to admit this is a learning process for me, so I would welcome your instruction. Sincere thanks, Freedomelf Freedomelf 15:05, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to add that the Way of the Calyr is being translated into Dutch on a totally independent site. In addition, it is set for re-publication in book form in early 2007. (A few copies were printed privately in 1998, but it will now be published commercially.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lupa, writer of "Fang and Fur, Blood and Bone" which is listed on Amazon and published by Immanion Press, has expressed interest in the religion and is including it in her next book about otherkin, targetted for completion this year. Considering the Calyr website is only a few months old and has generated no paid advertising of any kind, I believe it has achieved greater than expected interest.</p>
<p>Many otherkin have expressed relief at finally having a faith which relates to their spiritual needs. The Calyr Elves Church is the only organized religion for Elven otherkin. Without it, there is no way for them to address their spiritual needs at present. (And please note, we are the only religion that actually discourages donations on the website. We aren't in this for the money, but rather for the passion of our beliefs and to help Elven otherkin.)</p>
<p>I sincerely appreciate your equity in giving this topic due thought. Thank you! Freedomelf 18:26, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Who is "Scott Sonnon's crew"? I don't see anything spamming about this tool. Even Kleenex has a wiki page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleenex" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleenex" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleenex</a> B-ham 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm sure you think the Clubbell page isn't spam, since you created the page (and as has already been pointed out to you here and in other AfD's, you should disclose when you are the primary author of the page being discussed). I was referring to the flock of Sonnon-related pages you have created (which account for nearly all of your Wikipedia contributions) - <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Sonnon_0d35.html" title="Scott Sonnon">Scott Sonnon</a>, RMAX, RMAX International, Prasara, and Prasara Body-Flow. Except for the entry on Sonnon himself, all of these are essentially thinly disguised advertisements for interests which Sonnon is involved with. The appropriate guidelines relating to these types of entries have already been pointed out to you, here and elsewhere. <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 02:43, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. And WHO again is this "crew" of Dr. Sonnon's that you allude to? Conspiracies kill the brain.:) There was no "flock" of pages on Sonnon, there were only four: regarding the method of yoga he has shared with the world, the tool he created to help people become more fit, the community service organization which he has created philanthropically donating his time to thousands, and oh, a biography on who this humanitarian is. I offered them all to wikipedia, yes. Do you feel better? Go ahead and vote your heart out to have them deleted. You're only doing wiki researchers a disservice. Whatever.B-ham 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Who said anything about a conspiracy? You listed several of his colleagues / associates / business partners in the RMAX International article, so why are you now asking who these people are? Are you now suggesting that it's a one-man operation? And it's six pages, not four - the five I listed previously, plus Clubbell. <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 18:29, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. There weren't any separate pages listed for his teammates, who are each accomplished world champions in their respective sports: boxing, san shou, tai chi and MMA. There was no "crew" just a one line reference to others who are faculty for their team. I listed the tool he create to help people become fit - the "clubbell". <strike>Get over yourself and your conspiracies.</strike> B-ham 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Sorry, I thought I explained my previous statement clearly enough. The Wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crew.html" title="Crew">crew</a> starts with <i>A crew comprises a body or a class of people who work at a common activity, generally in a structured or hierarchical organization.</i> In any case, from your closing remark, it's clear that you need to read yet another part of <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>: <b>Don't make personal attacks against people who disagree with you.</b> Along with the other policies and guidelines that have already been suggested to you, you might also consider reading <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>.

<p>The result was <b>delete all</b>. {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}} was <i>not</i> added to the articles on the compilation albums, which makes the deletion of those articles somewhat tenuous - in the past, <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> has undeleted articles when they were deleted in group nominations but the AfD tag was not added, on the basis that the tag is there so everyone involved in the article can be properly informed. However, the notability of the albums is obviously dependant on the company, therefore deleting the main article and not the sub-articles would be nonsensical, and using PROD or another AfD would be an obvious waste of everyone's time. So I'm going to invoke <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> and delete them anyway. But please remember in future that all articles nominated for deletion must have an {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}} tag added, which can then be edited so it points to the group nomination. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 18:28, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> biographical article possibly written by the subject. There seems to be little information about him on the internet; a search for this name yields only 53 hits, dealing with at least <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22alex%20ferrone%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22alex%20ferrone%22" rel="nofollow">three different individuals</a> with this name. (A few of the top hits are about this person, though.) While the awards are commendable, school awards are irrelevant (in this case, the <i>Father Bressani DramaFest awards</i>). I think he may warrant an article in the future if he continues what he's doing, but it's still a little early to include him in WP now. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix"><font color="#8B4513">Mind</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindmatrix_738b.html" title="User talk:Mindmatrix"><font color="#EE8811">matrix</font></a> 13:33, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Ferrone definitely seems to be showing great promise, and may well eventually <i>be</i> notable enough for a Wikipedia bio, but he's not quite there yet. The main claim to fame is the Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association awards. However, the association is not in itself notable, as it has no Wikipedia page of its own, and is only mentioned (briefly) in two other articles <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Ontario+English+Catholic+Teachers+Association%22+site%3Awikipedia.org&amp;start=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Ontario+English+Catholic+Teachers+Association%22+site%3Awikipedia.org&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. If Ferrone continues amassing a body of work, and can achieve notability via other verifiable sources, such as coverage in a major media source, or via a more notable award, the article can be re-established. In the meantime, I recommend that instead of a Wikipedia bio, he establish his own website, blog, or even Myspace page, to promote and document his body of work and current awards. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 16:50, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> About sources, there 42 news sources mentioning RDA, so this is not quite unsourceable territory, but according to the "best" article on Newsbank, Arnott received a modicum of attention for a paper published in <i>Financial Analysts Journal</i> (not a peer-reviewed journal to my knowledge -- no record on ISI). That's about the coverage untenured assistant professors get, so I see him in a league with bishops, surgeons, and mid-ranking military officers.

Bogle, Bill Gross, Charles R. Schwab, Dr. Edward Yardeni, etc. He was also recently named as one of the 30 most influential finance visionaries by SmartMoney Magazine in its upcoming edition. As to the "trimming and humbling", I am certainly open to constructive criticism and if someone could point me to an appropriate template, I would be happy to follow it.

<li>I stand corrected on the <i>Fin Anal J</i>. It is in fact listed on ISI. Among specialized Finance journals it ranks 28th out of 40, with an impact factor of 0.542. The top-ranked journal, <i>Journal of Finance</i>, has a factor of 2.549. Top business and econ journal have an impact factor of 4 or 5. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:40, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And while I'm checking ISI, Arnott's best-cited article gets 16 cites total, of which 4 are self-cites. The others get single digits, mostly zeros, ones and threes. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 09:41, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My understanding is that the <i>Fin Anal J</i> is more of a 'practitioner' journal, not so much an academic journal, so its impact factor is not too surprising. Well know publications such as <i>The Wall St Journal</i> and <i>Barron's</i> would receive a citation index of 0 because no academics cite them.</li>

I mean jeez, what about the Kat von D article on here, what she got on a show for tatoos, she's doing that now, it's the same thing here, I want more discussion on this, the articles you cited have appeal clauses in them.

The prod tag (along with other cleanup tags) was recently removed by the same user who explained on the talk page why he thinks this should stay. My prod rationale read <i>"Well if David Kleist refuses to publish his work, I see little reason for Wikipedia to publish advertisement for him..."</i> and I stand by that comment. On the talk page David Kleist explains why he thinks a deletion would be unfair and this includes the argument that "had it existed in his time, Vicent Van Gogh never would have graced the Wikipedia's pages". Well I suppose I am ready to take the risk of being viewed in a hundred years' time as the imbecile who failed to see David Kleist's genius but in the meantime the content in there cannot be verified by reliable independent third-party sources. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 14:02, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>DO NOT DELETE: Despite repeatedly referencing verifiable sources (Who's Who Among American Teachers; Outstanding Young Americans, 31st Anniversary edition), Wikinazis below insist that this submission is unverifiable. I stand by MY claims that the article is NOT a vanity piece. Note that I explicitly state that I AM published (Christianity and Literature; Amaranth; The Rolling Coulter; The Manuscript; Pen and Ink; etc.). So-called little magazines have never been so villified as by you so-called encyclopedists. The so-called editors of Wikipdia apparently don't know how to closeread an article submission. I would call Pascal Tesson an imbecil in the PRESENT time, not in one hundred years. "Genius" is never invoked here; notability is the criteria of Wikipedia, Pascal. I maintain Who's Who Among American Teachers is a reliable independent third-party source and that my article, if deleted, will be expunged by petty demagogues. Again, PUBLISHED SOURCES HAVE CONSISTENTLY TAKEN NOTICE OF THE WORK OF DAVID KLEIST. And, of course, Van Gogh WAS notable during his lifetime, having been recognized by Gaughin and others while alive. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by David A.

For one thing it's not clear what criteria they use and they mostly try and evaluate an individual's qualities as a teacher, not as a poet. Now I may be a petty demagogue and an imbecile but I sure know <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a> when I see it. Let me remind you again that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a> and it should strike you as odd that in the month and a half that your article stood no one (besides yourself) has cared to edit it except to tag it as inappropriate.

<p>Advertising for non-notable style of martial arts developed in Texas. I'm no expert, but this doesn't appear to have spread very far beyond the inventor's own gym business. He's notable enough himself but that doesn't convince me about this article. Google hits are mostly on completely different subjects. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 15:09, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Remain</b>. This article was already here when I edited it a few days ago. I guess I have an interest in it, as I'm a student of Joe Lansdale and administer our website in my spare time and am disclosing that fact per wiki rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>People in martial arts circles are always asking what exactly is Shen Chuan. A few have advised to explain it in Wikipedia. I did not know what that was until coming here. So I came here to explain it, and found an existing article. I edited some with what little time I had, and came back today to take away the ranking and belt section as I felt it should not be there (it was there from the previous author).</p>
<p>As to the initial charge from Mereda, Joe Lansdale is quite well known in martial arts circles, by many well known martial artists, here in the states and abroad (England, Germany, Italy to name a few), Google hits notwithstanding. You may also Google Lansdale's Self Defense if more hits are desired. This was meant as an explanation of Shen Chuan (as in an encyclopedia) and not an advertisement.</p>
<p>Charge two from ColourBurst... As stated above, Joe Lansdale is notable in Martial Arts circles. As for the interpretation of Shen, I would ask you to type it the wiki search box to left and see if it does not also translate into spirit. Also, when forming the system the interpretation was posed to a Chinese Linguist (Professor actually) who had no problems with that translation.</p>
<p>In closing I hope that I followed wiki rules (I read everything I could in the short amount of time I had) and procedures, and I would ask the you reconsider deleting the page. If it crosses some wiki advertising boundry, I can understand. But the other arguments aren't holding water in my opinion. Sensei6 12 September 2006</p>

<li>In response to Ohconfucius - Chow Gar is not that obscure, there are hundreds of people that study it in the UK, and thousands worldwide. The Beijing police force also learn it for self defence. Also, it is not a competition style, so Chow Gar practitioners will not enter Karate / kickboxing competitions (unless fighting under different rules). One of the problems of references/sources with the less well known martial arts is that much of the information has been passed on verbally. Every written article has to start somewhere surely? My understanding (from what I read in the article on Wikipedia in teh Observer on Sunday) is that its purpose is to allow the more obscure facts and information to be shared. I am obviously biased as I study this style. If you read his biography though, you will see that he attained UK representative (i.e. Master) by living and training with the late Grandmaster of the style, Ip Shui, at his home in Hong Kong. This was after proving himself to be a worthy student after joining Ip Chee's (the current Grand Master) class in London when he first arrived i nthe UK. Oh, the style was also featured on a martial arts documentary series, I think it was called "Mind, Body and Kick Ass Moves". I did a Google test, the he got 1550 results. Has the Google Test criteria been expanded upon? Is there a minimum? <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonpaulwade_4772.html" title="User:Jonpaulwade">User:Jonpaulwade</a></li>

<p>Rather than a criticism of Dan Brown, this is basically a criticism of his books, each of which already have their own "criticism of" pages. How many pages did Dan Brown really deserve? Also, almost the entire page is a criticism saying that Angles and Demons and The Da Vinci Code has similar plots, considering every author that writes sequels uses a similar style, similar plot formulas, etc etc, there is nothing in this that is really unique to Dan Brown, so it does not justify its own page. A simple link from Dan Brown's page to criticisms of his books should be more than sufficient <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESad_mouse_6053.html" title="User:Sad mouse">Sad mouse</a> 16:36, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> or merge. There are many criticisms of this author's styles which are not related to a single book, so a central location is appropriate. I do agree that any criticism on the page should be carefully referenced to ensure that it is verifiable information from outside sources, and not just a random comment by a passing editor, but as long as that standard is met, the information is clearly notable and appropriate for Wikipedia. Indeed, on the talk page at <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Brown_5a02.html" title="Dan Brown">Dan Brown</a>, there are routinely comments from passing readers about why there <i>isn't</i> a "Criticism and controversy" section, since it's fairly obvious that Brown and his works have been among the most controversial subjects in the world over the last couple years. Accordingly, we are doing our readers a disservice if the biography article contains only positive information.

<p>The issue at hand is whether or not a magazine that has published exactly one issue meets notability standards.

<li><b>Del</b> The article is about an individual's political criticisms of a specific politician. A soapbox, basically. It makes no attempt at a NPOV (noting that critics are jealous doesn't make it NPOV). I thought Wikipedia wasn't a soapbox.

<p>"How come X gets an article when Y can't?" will get you nowhere on AFD. The editors of Wikipedia are working on article as they see them. We can't evaluate them all at once.

<li>One reason for making this article is because there are references to it Calling Fives, and not a lot of actual informaiton. If there is an article for calling fives, cooties, and the five second rule, this article should be equally considered. Members of the military use the term seat check countless times every day.

<p>This is not advertising as such. Instead it is an entry that records the existence of a community that has been in existence since 1994. Although a web-based community, there is an argument that a web-based community that has been in existence for over a decade is in fact as important as an actual geographical community, both in terms of how its members related to one another and its role in everyday life. There is indeed an external link, however, this is referring people to more info on the community. As such, I do not see how this is any different to a page on the City of London with say a link to the London tourist board. I would therefore strongly feel that this entry should not be deleted. I see nothing in the deletion policy that says this should be deleted -speedily or otherwise.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I spent years with Star Trek PbEMs. I ran a couple, even. I only <i>barely</i> heard of this group (and I'm not even certain I'm positively identifying them as being what I recall), and in the fairly exhaustive survey of the Star Trek fanbase that I have on hand (in <i>liquid metal: the science fiction film reader</i>; <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-903364-87-6</a>; particularly Henry Jenkins III's treatment in "<i>Star Trek</i> Rerun, Reread, Rewritten: Fan Writing as Textual Poaching"), it is not mentioned at all in the author's survey of the net community. As such, I can conclude fairly easily that this group has not made a substantial and lasting contribution within their field of influence, nor have they been recognized as an exemplar of the field.

<li><b>Comment</b> - It also remains the only Who novel to have been dramatised [<a href="http://www.iriswildthyme.thiswaydown.org/angelplay.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iriswildthyme.thiswaydown.org/angelplay.html" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>] and has generated at least one spin-off by a recognised and published author [<a href="http://www.infinitarian.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/cabinet.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infinitarian.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/cabinet.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>]
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not suggesting the information above is irrelevant - but let's be accurate. It would appear that the dramatisation of the novel, available for view on a fan site, has never been performed. The "spin-off" is a short story contained in a small press publication described as an "unofficial collection of wild variations on the theme of Doctor Who". Neither project would do much to strengthen the entry on Mr Hoad (indeed they aren't mentioned in what remains a very weak one sentence entry). That said, both pieces of information should be added to the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blue_Angel_%28Doctor_Who%29_5b1d.html" title="The Blue Angel (Doctor Who)">Blue Angel</a></i> article. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 18:03, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - while that's certainly all good notability for the book, I'm not sure it adds to the Hoad article. At the moment there's nothing in his single-line article that couldn't be covered with a note on the book's page. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 14:34, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I take your point and the book article could certainly do with being beefed up a bit (there's no mention of the fuss caused by the Doctor being portrayed as homosexual in the book for a start), but it would seem odd to put details about the author in the book article rather than in a linked article on the author (as with other authors).
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The point is that, unless he writes something more at some point or does something else of note, his article is unlikely ever to expand beyond the single line description currently there. Which frankly seems like a bit of a waste of time. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 18:01, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Is there a need for more than one book to qualify under <i><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a></i> - i.e "Published authors, [...]who received multiple independent reviews of [...] their work" - there have certainly been numerous independent reviews of the book and he may well write more in the future?
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Is there a need? Not at all. However, being the author (co-author, in this case) of a title that has been reviewed doesn't necessarily mean the subject is worthy of an article. After all, the above quotation from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is preceded by "People who satisfy at least one of the items below <i>may</i> merit their own Wikipedia articles..." (emphasis mine). I think it likely that the subject will write more books, but this is speculation and falls under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. That said, I recognize that <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blue_Angel_%28Doctor_Who%29_5b1d.html" title="The Blue Angel (Doctor Who)">Blue Angel</a></i> was published in September 1999. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 20:17, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Fair enough. I can't think of anything further to add - the popularity (as evinced by the fact that it has generated some form of spin-offery and conversion to another medium, as well as multiple reviews and general ongoing discussion) and notoriety of the book seem enough to qualify for inclusion of the author to me, (possibly also worth noting his publications with the National Postgraduate Council [<a href="http://www.npc.org.uk/essentials/postgraduates" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npc.org.uk/essentials/postgraduates" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>] about which, I admit, I know nothing other than their existence) but I may well be in a minority.<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Unless there's a general view that <i>Doctor Who</i> articles are proliferating out of hand, Hoad is notable for his contribution to the series' spinoff fiction, which as Stuart suggests is significant. The idea that the article be merged with the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Magrs_7030.html" title="Paul Magrs">Paul Magrs</a> or <i><a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Angel_fd42.html" title="Blue Angel">Blue Angel</a></i> articles tends to minimise the contribution that a co-author makes to a book: co-authorship is a very different process from ordinary writing, and Magrs has said that the two of them wrote every line together. As far as I'm aware it's Magrs's only such collaboration, which is arguably significant in itself given his profile outside the <i>Doctor Who</i> arena as a respected literary (and young adult) author, teacher of creative writing etc. I can see arguments for expanding both this and the <i>Blue Angel</i> article, but not for deleting Hoad now he's here. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_PH_b65a.html" title="User:Phil PH">Phil PH</a> 08:14, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> Co-writing one <i>Who</i> novel seems of marginal notability to me, but I like to err on the side of including articles and, heaven knows, there are literally &gt;100 <i>Doctor Who</i> articles on more obscure topics. However, there isn't much point in having a separate article if it is never going to grow beyond the current stub.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't want to appear difficult, but I am wondering what other publications are being referred to here. I see no sign that the subject has done more than co-author a seven year-old Dr Who novel. If he has indeed written other work, it is possible that there would never have been a nomination for deletion in the first place. Should they exist, I suggest that information on other books be added to the article - it can only serve to strengthen. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 18:38, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I suppose we can't really know to what <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> was referring. That said, I don't think co-written contributions to the website of the National Postgraduate Committee, "a charity to advance, in the public interest, postgraduate education in the UK", speak to notability. Mr Hoad's articles in <i>The Guardian</i> are few and far between (four short pieces on education since 2000). I'm afraid I cannot find any Hoad contributions to <i>The independent</i> or <i>The Times</i> (at least not archived at www.independent.co.uk and www.timesonline.co.uk). I think the issue of notabiility rests on the co-authorship of a Dr Who novel published seven years ago.

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. To the author and subject, our guidelines for notability are generally not satisfied by passing mentions in the media - articles should be directly focused on the subject if being used to satisfy <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. There are two links which were posted a couple of days ago and have not been discussed, but I don't feel that I'm compromising my summary with personal opinion by saying that both articles only make passing mentions of Enigma and are not sufficient to reverse the consensus for deletion here.</p>

<li>In regard to the PC Magazine article - it's about your SpyHunter <b>software</b> program, <b>not</b> your company. So there isn't even one published work in evidence, let alone multiple works. There are thousands (tens of thousands?) of publicly traded companies, which is why you don't see that in the criteria.

<li>The first article mentions Enigma in passing in a single sentence near the end. The second is a single paragraph about an ad campaign for SpyHunter. The third is again a single mention of Enigma in a single sentence near the end.

<ul>
<li>Valrith you are not being fair here, nor are you abiding by the very rules that you pointed out. According to the rules it is the publication that should not be trivial. The publications I referenced are not trivial they are major publications. Additionaly the rules go on to say that a trivial mention would be to "simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories". Again that is clearly not the case here. There is absolutely no rule that says the entire article has to be about the company. Our company clearly falls under wikipedia's criteria of a notable corporation under the first point. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmasoftwaregroup_3c69.html" title="User:Enigmasoftwaregroup">Enigmasoftwaregroup</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/i/User_talk%7EEnigmasoftwaregroup_9574.html" title="User talk:Enigmasoftwaregroup">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Enigmasoftwaregroup_6202.html" title="Special:Contributions/Enigmasoftwaregroup">contribs</a>) 23:08, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</small>

</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> with some of the following reasoning:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There is exactly one non-trivial publication, when WP:CORP explicitly states that multiple are required. The publication isn't even about the company though- it mentions it, but it's focused entirely on the product. Think about it this way: do the articles provide any information that will help keep the article neutral and informative? The LA Times piece says at the very end "oh, try this too." The about.com entry is one paragraph in a blog, which is overwhelmingly negative and only about the company's pop up ad, and the PC World article says "Enigma makes spyware detection software" at the end. In the end, while it has been mentioned several times in passing, no information about the company has actually been published except that it has a pop-up campaign. In fact, the majority of the information within the company article is about its product.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If there are more publications in the future about the company, I could see this article existing, but not with the current lack of third party information. The article currently reads very positively about the company, despite the only real information published being
<ol>
<li>It makes anti-spyware software</li>
<li>This software isn't particularly good</li>
<li>The company's ad campaign is very bad and misguided</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can see the product having an article, but not the company. Also, I would not recommend writing about a company you work for due to inherent bias- it kills me to see that the company I work for has had a one sentence stub for several months, but I leave it because I can only say positive things about it. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 23:34, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Very weak delete</b> 1. <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmasoftwaregroup_3c69.html" title="User:Enigmasoftwaregroup">User:Enigmasoftwaregroup</a> should read <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAuto_aa00.html" title="WP:Auto">Wikipedia's policy on autobiographical articles</a> to see why writing about your own company is a bad idea. 2. It seems to me that most of the published mentions about this company are more about the products than the company itself, and then the mentions are usually trivial. 3. The non-trivial mentions are very critical of the company's products, yet the article does not mention this criticism, thereby violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Wikipedia's policy on Neutral Points of View</a>. This in itself is <i>not a reason to delete</i>, articles violating NPOV should be cleaned-up, not deleted, but there's no point if the article is going to be deleted on notability grounds anyway. 4. Posting messages on other user's talk pages asking them to come vote on an AFD is considered impolite at best.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Like some of the other users, I can see the product having an article. Having read the product's article, it needs clean-up to reflect a neutral point of view, and it needs to be better sourced. However, having articles about both the company and the product seems a little much.</dd>
<dd>All of that said, I rarely support deletion in an AFD. I've found that for articles where I agree with delete, there are more than enough other people arguing delete that I'd just be one voice among many saying "delete per nom", so I just don't participate in those. I tend to be a bit of an inclusionist, and often jump into deletion debates on marginal articles saying "keep". If not for the message left on my talk page asking me to participate in this AFD, I probably would not have paid it any attention, or, if I did, I might have said weak keep instead of weak delete. This is just one of several reasons why it is a bad idea to spam user talk pages asking people to vote in an AFD. ~ <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</small> 13:49, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmasoftwaregroup_3c69.html" title="User:Enigmasoftwaregroup">User:enigmasoftwaregroup</a> again. I have read all of your comments and your input has been educational. While this process has been a little frustrating. I cannot argue that the way Wikipedia is edited works very effectively. It is a great portal, and this has been quite a learning experience.<br />
<br />
I have edited the article again. Being affiliated with the company it is impossible for me to have a Neutral Point of View. So in order to comply with that rule, I have reduced the entire article to a stub.<br />
<br />
To answer Charles A.L.'s comment: This page is was never intended as an advertisemtent for the company. The reason I disclosed that I was affiliated earlier was to comply with Wikipedia guidelines. There are a lot of guidelines here and I am new just learning the rules. Now that I am more familiar with them I will make sure our company abides by them.<br />
<br />
Now that the article should be compliant with NPOV. I think this page should stay as <a href="../../../s/p/y/SpyHunter_b300.html" title="SpyHunter">SpyHunter</a> definitely meets the guidelines for a notable product. And Enigma as the author of a notable product should have a minimum of a stub<br />
<br />
I feel that if the editors here determine that Enigma Software Group does not meet requirement 1 for a notable corporation from <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> that the editors here must then rewrite <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> guidelines. The guidelines of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> stated that listing shopping hours, or simply being in a directory did not count. There was nothing that said one or two sentences about the company didn't count, all stories ever written had to be positive, all editors had to like your product, or that talking about a companies products is not talking about a company.<br />
<br />
More Press on the company<br />

<li>Pretty much, except that I have applied for a license to use spiht for entropy coding. If I get it I shall change to that.</li>
<li>I don't know anyone else.</li>
<li>The most original part of libima is the transformation. It is multi-resolution analysis, which means it looks the same every time we zoom in or out by a factor of 2, unlike JPEG which has a hardwired factor of 8 in the DCT transformation. Yet it has the same computational complexity in time and memory when decompressing as JPEG. It also allows lossy and lossless compression to be done using the same integer transformation. This allows programmers to implement them both using the same API without making the codec bigger. In the <a href="../../../s/p/i/SPIHT_36ee.html" title="SPIHT">SPIHT</a> version, it implements the spiht algorithm using little ( O(log n) ) memory when decompressing by using recursion instead of lists and encoding bits in the inverse order they are read. The spiht version to which I don't have a license yet is here <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/media-player" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/media-player" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>. I have not seen this way of implementing spiht anywhere else. (libima does not implement the full wavelet transformation found in the spiht demonstration programs. Instead, it only uses spiht to encode coefficients by allocating less bits for small coefficients and more bits for large coefficients, also known as entropy coding).--<a href="../../../m/i/h/User%7EMihai_cartoaje_21f9.html" title="User:Mihai cartoaje">Mihai cartoaje</a> 03:24, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think we should keep and expand or merge it into Allen High School, but definetly do not delete. Although the article has no references, there is no proof of a bigger band. The escadrille is winner to the Sudler's Shield award, which makes this band honorable as it is only the fifth one in texas to get this award. This page does not need deletion, just more information and references which I could help with.</p>

<li>Well, who cares about anything, really? I'm the John Fleming the article is about. The Malcolm Hardee autobiography which I ghost wrote sold (I understand from Fourth Estate the publishers) around 7,000 copies. The Janey Godley autobiography which I edited was, in August 2006, listed for two weeks in the Sunday Times paperback bestseller list as No 10 in the general (ie non-fiction) section, selling around 5,000 copies each week and, yes, that is information available on line at the Sunday Times website. Can anyone tell me what sources need to be cited in this article? If anyone can tell me how apparently random (some but not all) "Star Trek" episodes are suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, perhaps I could understand the system better. What is the actual specific objection to this article on me (which I did not originate)? Is "who cares about it?" a carefully considered and balanced opinion? It's a bit wearisome. Can I just randomly object to some article too for no particular reason? I don't care about the Emperor Claudius. Can you erase that article, please? There seem to have been an awful lot of people adding things to this article and tinkering with it who did not object. So, come on, exactly what IS the objection?

<li>It sounds like vandalism to me. The first time this article was marked for deletion, it was by someone near Glasgow. where Janey Godley - who is very controversial - comes from. (I edited her autobiography) This second time it appears to have been marked for deletion on 31st August by someone who comes from Edinburgh, where I have just been writing Edinburgh Fringe reviews of shows from 6th-27th August and where I was co-ordinating three shows by Janey Godley. It was marked for deletion with no discussion page until I queried this. Then an additional bit was bunged on about no sources being cited. Then two links were removed from the article - to the websites of the late Malcolm Hardee and the living Janey Godley - the reason being that they were irrelevent although the references to the two autobiographies were left on the article's page. How relevent can you get in an encyclopaedia? The links were to websites giving more background information on the subjects of the autobiographies - and both websites include extracts from the books. This sounds like straight snotty vandalism to me. Is this page just going to be marked for deletion every four months? User:Thejohnfleming 16.29 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There has been a note on this Wikipedia entry for over a week saying "Some information in this article or section has not been verified and may not be reliable."

Can anybody tell me which sources should be cited and sources of what information? Or are these notes just being randomly attached to the page without any logic or actual practical point?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Wikipedia article "The Ontario general election of 1990" it is said that the election was held on September 6, I see no source cited for this. Presumably there are sources, but none are cited. It says Leonard Wood represented Cochrane North. I see no source cited for this. It says that, in Burlington South, a Don Pennell (FCP) received 1707 votes. I see no source cited for this. Why has no notice been put on that page saying that some of the political and statistical information may not be reliable and sources need to be cited? Why has the "John Fleming" page allegedly got unreliable information? Who says so? What unreliable information? I am the persan referred to. I can't see anything unreliable in the entry. Can anyone else? If so, what? If not, why was this note put there, who put it there and why does it continue to remain there? User:Thejohnfleming 07.27 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't really care either way, but will no-one actually tell me specifically what is actually being queried here and what sources are supposed to be cited? No-one has actually been specific about anything. It's all very well to say "I can't take any of the article's information just on his say-so" - Which information? The spelling of the name "Fleming"? The TV credits? (Get copies of the programmes) I have a legally-binding contract with (the late) Malcolm Hardee specifying the percentages we share for my writing his autobiography. What am I supposed to do? Send it by post to someone? If I didn't write the Malcolm Hardee book, why else is my name printed in it as co-author and on the copyright page as co-copyright owner? What does "claims bestseller status" mean? If "Handstands in the Dark" is printed in the Sunday Times bestseller list as one of their bestsellers, is that an unverified claim? - Sunday Times August 13th 2006 www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2102-2304534_2,00.html + Sunday Times, August 20th 2006 - www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2102-2314665_2,00.html The book "I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake" is, indeed (at the time of writing this) 445,738 on amazon.co.uk - and Evelyn Waugh's "Brideshead Revisited" is 815,071 on amazon.co.uk Presumably this means that the Wikipedia entry on "Brideshead Revisited" should be deleted as being not notable and an entry should be created for "I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake" as it is verifiably more notable - citing the sales figures as being objective. Amazon's verification of sales figures show the out of print Malcolm Hardee autobiography as being almost twice as notable as far as current readership numbers is concerned as the in print Evelyn Waugh novel. Please please please will someone actually specify what is being queried. User:Thejohnfleming 10.08 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Alright, you want some quotable verification..... I can only guess of what..... In the Malcolm Hardee obituary in the Guardian newspaper, 4th February 2005 <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1405432,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1405432,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1405432,00.html</a> are the references "in the autobiography he wrote with John Fleming in 1996" and "In 2003, again with John Fleming, Hardee edited Sit-Down Comedy, an acclaimed collection of prose by comics such as John Hegley and Stewart Lee"..... In the Malcolm Hardee obituary in the principal showbiz paper The Stage, 10th February 2005 <a href="http://www.thestage.co.uk/people/peoplestory.php/6392" class="external free" title="http://www.thestage.co.uk/people/peoplestory.php/6392" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestage.co.uk/people/peoplestory.php/6392</a> are the references "He wrote his autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury’s Birthday Cake with John Fleming in 1996... In 2003 he published Sit-Down Comedy - Stand-Ups Swap the Stage for the Page, a collection of short stories co-edited with Fleming from comics such as Dominic Holland, Arthur Smith and Stewart Lee"..... In the news item on Malcolm Hardee's death on BBC News Online, 2nd February 2005 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4230789.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4230789.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4230789.stm</a> there is a reference to "the book he wrote with John Fleming, Sit-Down Comedy"..... In fact, I wrote the "Freddie Mercury" book myself using taped interviews with Malcolm, all of which I have retained. If someone would like to sit through the 20 or 30 ninety-minute tapes tapes, they are more than welcome to. Now will someone please tell me what needs to be verified with what sort of citations and what is actually being queried? Please? I can only prove I exist with my birth certificate. To whom should I send this? User:Thejohnfleming 10.45 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>In the Acknowledgements (page vii) of Janey Godley's autobiography "Handstands in the Dark" (available for a bestseller price of £3.73 in Tescos and not available to read online) Janey acknowledges: "John Fleming, who saw me perform comedy , thought I would make a writer, then introduced me to Ebury and constantly encouraged me to write this book - he made me explore the language and enjoy the process". I also have a written contract with Ebury Press/Random House specifying that I edit the book. It is not available for you to see online. To whom would you like me to send this legal contract for verification? User:Thejohnfleming 11.14 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Respectfully, Mr. Fleming, that is not really how Wikipedia works. Wikipedia is designed to be an online encyclopedia, and thus serve as a tertiary reference source. A legal contract or other such document would constitute a primary information source. If, say, a New York Times reporter reviewed the document and referenced its contents in a printed story, then that Times story would constitute a secondary information source. Editors of Wikipedia could then use that secondary published source to update the article here. In fact, we are specifically <i>prohibited</i> from posting facts we have personally verified from the primary source by the policy <a href="../../../n/o/_/WP%7ENo_original_research_1420.html" title="WP:No original research">WP:No original research</a>.</dd>
<dd>As far as what secondary sources are appropriate to verify the specific facts stated in an article, they must be “credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.” Please see <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_sources_20af.html" title="WP:Reliable sources">WP:Reliable sources</a> for additional information and rationale.</dd>
<dd>Such requirements are the basis for notability standards in the first place. If the subject of an article is insufficiently notable, there is a dearth of secondary sources. Without sufficient secondary sources, it becomes difficult to ensure the article meets the criteria of official Wikipedia policies such as <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/WP%7ENo_original_research_1420.html" title="WP:No original research">WP:No original research</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/u/WP%7ENeutral_point_of_view_15f3.html" title="WP:Neutral point of view">WP:Neutral point of view</a>.</dd>
<dd>I realize that all of these rules and guidelines can be frustrating and confusing to someone who is just trying to verify facts about themselves. And I’m sure it is equally frustrating that other articles are out there that do not yet meet these standards, but have not yet been deleted or corrected (we get to them as we can). But if your bio article ends up being deleted, please do not take it personally. The volunteer editors here are simply trying to interpret and apply Wikipedia policies as best they can. Thank you for your time. Yours, <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatori_Son_533a.html" title="User:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 13:19, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Is it not a bit odd that Wikipedia is prohibited from verifying facts from primary sources but can only verify facts from the hearsay of respectable secondary sources? Can I refer you to the photograph on <a href="http://www.eagleton.rutgers.edu/e-gov/e-politicalarchive-1948election.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.eagleton.rutgers.edu/e-gov/e-politicalarchive-1948election.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.eagleton.rutgers.edu/e-gov/e-politicalarchive-1948election.htm</a> showing clearly that Truman lost the 1948 Presidential Election to Dewey? That is an example of a fact verified by a reliable source. I have actually written for a US desk encyclopaedia and I understand it is common practice for encyclopaedias to include at least one false entry to see if any other encyclopaedia is stealing their information. Because secondary sources are inherently unreliable. But what IS very frustrating is that even you (who seem a very helful and friendly chap) still do not say specifically what facts are being queried and may be unreliable in the Wikipedia entry on "John Fleming". If it is the use of the word "bestseller", then the Sunday Times confirms that (see above). If it is my authorship of the two earlier books, then the Guardian confirms that. If it is what I did on the latest book, then it is printed in the book itself by Random House Group, the largest publisher in the world. If it is, for example, the fact that I staged a 5-hour live show in London in 2006, then I refer you to the 4-star review it was given in The Times <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14936-2027809,00.html" class="external free" title="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14936-2027809,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14936-2027809,00.html</a> which confirms the show, the venue and even the duration of the show. There is also a review on the main British comedy industry website <a href="http://www.chortle.co.uk/standup/sufeatures/malcolm.php" class="external free" title="http://www.chortle.co.uk/standup/sufeatures/malcolm.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.chortle.co.uk/standup/sufeatures/malcolm.php</a> I am the contact for the 2007 show <a href="http://www.malcolmhardee.co.uk/show2007details" class="external free" title="http://www.malcolmhardee.co.uk/show2007details" rel="nofollow">http://www.malcolmhardee.co.uk/show2007details</a> which aims to spend anything from around £7,000-£15,000 sponsoring new acts - Admittedly the whole sprawling www.malcolmhardee.co.uk website might have been faked by me since February 2005 simply so that I can claim this in September 2006, but it's a tad unlikely. Chortle (the main British comedy industry website which supplies showbiz news to the BBC on a contract basis - ie the BBC use them as a primary source then repeat what they say as fact) also has an article written by me in 2003 explaining exactly what I did on the "Sit-Down Comedy" book <a href="http://www.chortle.co.uk/books/bkfeatures/fleming.html" class="external free" title="http://www.chortle.co.uk/books/bkfeatures/fleming.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chortle.co.uk/books/bkfeatures/fleming.html</a> and, in a 2003 news item, reported my involvement in the "Handstands in the Dark" book <a href="http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/nov03/godley.html" class="external free" title="http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/nov03/godley.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/nov03/godley.html</a> It is a tad difficult to verify facts if one is not told which facts you are supposed to verify. It seems to me that the person who marked this entry for deletion has never said why it was put up for deletion, did not start an article for deletion (that seems to have been done later when I complained there was no discussion anywhere) and he or she has not contributed to this discussion. If the person who marked the article for deletion has no specific reason why it should be deleted and can't be bothered to contribute, isn't that a bit odd? So I can only repeat yet again what EXACTLY and SPECIFICALLY is being queried as unverified on the "John Fleming" entry and what EXACTLY and SPECIFICALLY is required to verify it? You have, above, facts 'verified' as secondary sources by the Guardian (a major UK newspaper), The Stage (the main showbiz trade paper), the BBC (a large broadcaster), The Times (a major world newspaper).

<dd>P.S. My appologies if I'm using the wrong template here. This is the first time I've had to deal with re-proposing something for deletion. Also, please note that it appears that user Wellreadone has altered multiple revisions to this article with no discussion or reasoning in the edit history, including removing sections of the article and notability tags. This has left the article with almost no information verifying notability of the lawyer. So either the old information, if verifiable, needs to be reverted in, or the article should probably be deleted. Either way, it seemed prudent to reopen for discussion given how much the article has changed.<a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:30, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge and Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_locations_a597.html" title="RuneScape locations">RuneScape locations</a>, using information in this article to expand the appropriate section. That's what was likely going to happen anyway, as the same has happened to a lot of similar articles recently. Starting an AfD, if anything, slows this process down. It is worthy of inclusion, in the same way as <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mordor.html" title="Mordor">Mordor</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatooine.html" title="Tatooine">Tatooine</a> or <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamriel.html" title="Tamriel">Tamriel</a> (to name a few examples) as a highly significant fictional location, the article only looks like a game guide because of a large number of crufters, who are unfamiliar with policy and guidelines and ignore the large fancruft notice on the talkpage. However, I'm not sure if there is quite enough to be said about it to warrant a separate article; although a lot of action takes place there, as the name suggests, there is not very much to see there in comparison to other ingame areas (apart from rocks, hills, ruins and player killers). <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainVindaloo_b7ba.html" title="User:CaptainVindaloo">CaptainVindaloo</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainVindaloo_30b8.html" title="User talk:CaptainVindaloo">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CaptainVindaloo_0228.html" title="Special:Contributions/CaptainVindaloo">c</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CaptainVindaloo_40b4.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CaptainVindaloo">e</a></sup> 01:08, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Take a look at <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_locations_a597.html" title="RuneScape locations">RuneScape locations</a>. That article is already huge and unwieldy, and given that the Wilderness comprises roughly half the game, it can easily sustain its own article, using the following:
<ul>
<li>Skull - A key game mechanic, best handled in the area wherein it has relevance</li>
<li>A brief discussion of the advancing level limit (to answer questions from people who wonder "well what if I bring in a new character????") and referencing the free world limit.</li>
<li>Location of the area within the game world. Fairly self-explanatory; provides context, which is one of the strengths of wiki.</li>
<li>Key locations and key NPCs/monsters.</li>

<li>I think there's some misunderstanding of the section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> dealing with game guides. Look at the context: it's embedded within the "Instruction manuals" section. A key element that many deletionists miss, I think, is that this section is essentially saying "Say what, not how." This article, with the exception (to an extent) of the PvP section, describes what is there. Furthermore, the existence of other wikis should in no way define what is available on Wikipedia. Wikipedia's mission statement should define Wikipedia. Did we immediately remove all Star Trek content because of Memory Alpha? Hardly. Yes, instructions and prescriptions should be nuked on sight. But is this article offering up instructions and prescriptions? If you take two minutes to remove the instructions and prescriptions, is there still an article? Indeed, there is still an article, and a fairly substantial one at that. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 04:18, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - and pay attention to the comments (and refine the content to what, why but not howto). The Wilderness is a major feature in the game, particularly in the free version, as the main area where players can combat each other. There should easily be enough cruft-trimmed content to sustain an article. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Risk_7eea.html" title="User:Ace of Risk">Ace of Risk</a> 11:55, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> - for all the Keep reasons above. The Wilderness is not just a location in Gielinor; it is a completely different aspect of playing the game of <i>RuneScape</i>. As someone above said, it is the only place on the free worlds that players can combat each other. It is the only place on free and paying worlds where players can combat each other freely, with a "no-holds-barred" kind of fight. Yes, you can multi-combat in the fight arena. But you don't lose your items if you die. The duel arena has its rules and regulations. The Wilderness is a free-for-all, take your chances, get out there and battle to your hearts content area. The Wilderness is the main purpose for most clans, and that section could use some filling out (without listing clan names or game guide type information). There is a little bit that needs to go away. But the article is worthy to stay and is a positive part of the <i>RuneScape</i> series. It needs to stay. <a href="../../../x/e/l/User%7EXela_Yrag_73eb.html" title="User:Xela Yrag">Xela Yrag</a> 05:54, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Enclopedic description of a location which is highly notable within the game. Not an instruction manual, so the mention of "game guide" in WP:NOT doesn't apply (and needs to be reworded to stop this kind of misinterpretation). <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 09:13, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and Redirect</b>. Simply enough, it's not fancrufty enough to merit an AfD, but it does need a lot of cleaning up to do, and also should be placed in Locations.

The wilderness can doubtless be mentioned in Locations too, but the majority of what is here would be better suited to combat, with the Location article being updated later. Even with the material that was still present a few weeks ago ('notable' locations, non-prosificated NPC list), there wasn't enough to warrant a seperate article outside of combat. Whilst I'd echo views that listing more articles from the RS series for AFD -before- merging has taken place is swerving things all over the place, in the case of the wildy article, it's a copy and paste job. Nothing that would help readers understand just why the Wilderness is such an important aspect of RS will be lost by porting this info to combat, and Combat will be strengthened as a result. Since weapons and armour are now merging, combat needs more info or will itself be unsafe. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 23:01, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In fairness, I'd said I would oppose this article coming up for AFD. However, this is the last article out of the five articles which could be linked in with combat (combat itself, magic, weapons, armour and this article) left unaccounted for. Merging would result in pretty much every base being covered, I don't see how a particular aspect of RS automatically requires a seperate article if said aspect will quite happily fit in another. Seems like taking half the clean plates out of the cupboard and stuffing them in the tumble dryer 'just cos' to me. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 23:22, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> What worries me about the wilderness article is that up till now the 'experiment' of letting the articles run free had resulted in this article being stuffed to the roof with non-notable info, 'storytelling' wording and more focus on wandering NPCs than the nitty-gritty of what the wilderness -is-. The wilderness is two things, it's a very large location, a considerable slice of RS' map, it's also the only free-for-all PvP area of RS where players stand to lose most or all of what they're carrying. Those two sections, -in- their respective articles put some weight behind those articles and give a subject worthy of writing-up in detail. If the article should be kept, I see no outcome apart from two other articles being considerably weaker than possible and a whole article ready to be typed back into a non-notable mass. Regarding locations, it is now the last bastion of unchecked, just-like-mamma-used-to-make fancruft still present in the RS series. Should it be trimmed, I would be extremely surprised if it couldn't accomodate the relevant information. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 00:35, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There is one good reason for keeping these sham institutions: since Wikipedia has such a high google ranking, anyone looking for information can see the WP page and learnt that it is, indeed, an unaccredited diploma mill since it's page will appear as # 2 or 3 probably. They can then further find out what a <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mill.html" title="Diploma mill">Diploma mill</a> is by following the links and, if truly ambitious, discover the entire shady world of such "institutions." That said, Wikipedia is not here to provide <i>caveat emptor</i> services and this place should be expunged.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - This article is far too broad and biased toward certain publications. It is impossible to list all notable biology publications. This is an absurd idea.

<li><b>Comment</b> - It is the subject that is broad. The list of subcategories makes it workable.

<li><b>Move</b> to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_important_publications_in_biology.html" title="List of important publications in biology">List of important publications in biology</a> or something more specific. Personally I think its a great idea to attempt to list the most important publications in a field - I think it would be very useful to a lot of people. However, there need to be tougher inclusion criteria to prevent an overload of self-promotion. I'd suggest defining the inclusion criteria more strictly, eliminating the "Latest and greatest" option (since a "latest and greatest" idea should be inherently important otherwise and a separate listing may allow people to sneak in cruft because its new. Also, its probably a good idea to delete all the entries that don't establish why they're notable. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 00:33, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Making a page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_important_publications_in_biology.html" title="List of important publications in biology">List of important publications in biology</a> would violate <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> since you would be expressing your point of view on deciding which biology publications are important and which are not. And even if you could determine notability of all publications listing every single 'notable' publication is physically impossible. In my opinion, it would just be best to add a category of Biology publication/literature and then mark all biology literature pages with that category.

While it would be nice to have an annotated list of the key publication, these pages don't seem to do the job, ending up as a rag bag of books by peoples PhD advisiors. There might be a way to make such lists work by making them more specific and being vigriously monitored. Limiting the scope could work, say with one page for key historical works (say 100 years old or more), one for paradime shifting/breakthrough works, one for text books and one for popular science books. p.s. I've just removed all those entries which don't assert importance. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 14:38, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think it should stay, they could tighten up the criteria by including only publications that have merited an article for an author, the main theory purported or the book itself i.e Darwin's origin of species would count on all three, some of the others on this page would count on two counts as well. I still think this is an important page as a start for people, even if it doesn't conform to usual Wiki policy, although I think with my suggestion it gets closer. If absolutely necessary I'm sure we could get references that talk about science references in these sort of terms or even reviews in journals and newspapers. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerri_G_3a66.html" title="User:Terri G">Terri G</a> 14:01, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and possibly rename</b>. Could be of interest to someone looking to purchase a textbook in a particular area. As it's an extremely basic guide to a few key publications in various biological subjects, a large number of people should be able to verify the book/article's importance, reducing the inherent PoV problems. Renaming could be useful; I'd suggest 'basic' or 'fundamental' rather than 'important', as many of these are student texts. Alternatively, it could be split into textbooks and historically significant research articles. <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspresso_Addict_7f98.html" title="User:Espresso Addict">Espresso Addict</a> 19:38, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Was trying out and cut and pasted some text initially. I do not want to be self promoting or anything, wanted to have a page with a few facts only. Honestly I was surprised that corporations have pages in the wikipedia. and there are big corporations and corporations that I have never heard of. please delete this page if you think it's not appropriate, but please recosider all the other company pages in that case. I gues to be fair and ballanced is not a bad thing zoly@daxtechnologies.com</p>

<p>Hello mods, All your comments seem like you all are just for passtime here. Whatever your comments on my non-noticable forum are, i dont care. But according to wiki system, my entry is actuallky valid, because my entry is a real entity, maybe its new and starting right now, but its more real them much of listings here on wikipedia.</p>
<p>Please remember its not DMOZ or a directory listing its a wiki, you control here so that no fake content comes here, But dont try to make this your personal liking, and nobody cares if my article is listed here or not, even me myself.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. Content must be encyclopedic, and must conform to Wikipedia policies, particularly, in this case, the guidelines for notability.

The fact that this is a wiki, which allows anyone to edit, does not imply that any edit is automatically permissible.

<dd>^ Well you yourself saw the website, its an active community, being a clean and a complete attempt to make a dedicated community. What you pointed about users is true, we do have active and loyal users, and the facts you provided about posts is actually we have 4200+ messages in total. We are a 44 days old community of users came from various other forums and collectively worked here in IndiaFinest.</dd>
<dd>I doubt a lot why you compare with indiatimes community, They are different people with different aims, we are here for different purpose, Indiatimes blog is none of our category and they are highly commercialised people, But we are here not for any commercial purpose. I claim IndiaFinest community may have less usres and less messages, But i am sure we win when compared to indiatimes community in moral values, in culture values and we are NOT here to compromise with indian culture values, like all commercialised ventures do. To sum up, if you compare us with size, then I have a point that we are going through exceptional growth per day. And If you point content quality and vision, I must say we are the winner, because we are here only for quality community. I hope comparing an cultural community with a commercial one, and with least moral/cultural values one is not a good comparison, Because we are winner in both paces with good growth, and good quality. So i dont think anybody can think this article is amy sort of WP:SPAM category, because we are for real, we have clear objective and we DO have something to work on dedicatedly. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Indiafinest (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Indiafinest_055d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Indiafinest">contribs</a>) 19:46, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I tagged this article for improvement, because it is just a mess. Very little has been done to change it for the better. It is poorly written, sloppy, full of information that is irrelevant---e.g., the addition of the notable people who are dropouts from the same college, as though Mr. Yates becomes more notable by associating him with Mr. Redford, Mr. Wozniak, etc.---and, the tone is one of vanity and self-importance. That said, he does seem to have done a couple things that can be interpreted as notable. The article needs drastic improvement immediately. ---<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 03:11, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

What this article needs is to actually have main article like <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_expectancy.html" title="Life expectancy">Life expectancy</a> that can put the age of marriage into context (with various cultural norms, social and medical factors etc) which would have this list serve as an applicable content fork. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 16:02, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Some References to "Dark Knowledge" in theologies --</b></p>
<p>"Gregory P Rocca, OP, “The ‘Dark Knowledge of God’ and Our Worship of the Divine Mystery,” Nova et Vetera 3:4 (Fall 2005): 807-823. Aquinas’s theological epistemology of the divine names weaves together positive and negative theology in service of the liturgical language of worship. Such language is “iconic”: a mean between agnostic and idolatrous speech, balancing both true knowledge of God and insisting that it is also dark knowledge. Rocca analyzes various negative features of Aquinas theology, such as "<br />

<p><b>Critique --</b><br />
One critique of "Dark Knowledge" is that is assumes that knowledge exists independently of sentient beings. However, people like Hume, Kant, Piaget, present arguments in favor of knowledge (such as causality) being a creation and belief of the mind.</p>

<p>I see no evidence that this term is in wide use. The Google hit for instance finds <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Analysis+of+Competing+Hypotheses%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Analysis+of+Competing+Hypotheses%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">155 unique hits</a>. Well that's not good although it's not terribly bad either. Of course a number of these are wiki-related and there is also a problem because it's a very natural sentence to have without refering to the concept described in the article. However, proponents of this concept usually use the abbreviation ACH and if you search for both you get <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Analysis+of+Competing+Hypotheses%22+ACH&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=80&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Analysis+of+Competing+Hypotheses%22+ACH&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=80&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">62 unique hits</a>.

<p>Football cruft. Now I understand having an article about the season and so on but an exhaustive list of goal scorers? Now that is getting a tad ridiculous. Let me preempt the "it's verifiable knowledge and Wikipedia is the sum of all human knowledge" argument which is bound to pop up. While <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, I must admit, has no entry that says that Wikipedia is not a list of goal scorers of professional football league, I think this can be explained by the fact that no one in their right mind would see this as potentially contentious. I would respectfully add that this being the Honduras football league makes it even more obscure as the league is relatively weak. (Not that I would support keeping such a list for the English Premiership) <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 23:25, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

This form of argument only states everything is notable, since anything can be inserted into the second half of that argument, and it's already known that WP is not a collection of everything. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 02:05, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Only if those "anything"s are more notable than schools, which I believe malls to be. I recognize that this is my opinion, but I'm entitled to it on this issue. I never claimed it to be something everyone would have to agree with; I specifically said "I see no reason [they] shouldn't be [notable]", not "obviously [they] are [notable]." <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 23:59, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In any case, please note GRBerry's comments.

<li>Who's making things up? <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is admittedly just a proposed guideline, but it seems to have wide support.

<li>Since this is your first direct mention of a WP guideline, I can't see how I'm casting aspersions. And the mall would still fail notability standards. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 16:27, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Vague, vacuous, abstract prose like <i>Action research not only adds to general knowledge, but also plays a role in people's and organizations' development.

<li><b>Keep and merge with Developmental Action Inquiry under <i>Action Inquiry</i></b>. I have removed the advert link. The bigger question is what is the copyright status of the text and tables?

<li><b>KEEP</b>. Would be my suggestion/two-cents. I've added some preamble to give the piece some context. The article is distinct from published articles (I'm doing my PhD on this stuff) so is OK copyright-wise. I agree that some of the sentences are vague and (dare I say it) vacuous- but the entry is, after all trying to summarise a rich theory into a page or so. Hence unless you (say) read the HBR article (2005) by Torbert that's referenced, trying to 'get' the theory based on this entry alone won't be possible. I'd suggest that quantum physics is also gobbledygook when inferred from encyclopedic entries.70.59.17.138 Roger S.

<li>It's kind of disturbing, really, that I'm able to extract more meaning from that introduction than from the rest of the article combined. If Roger S. is willing and able to rewrite the rest of the article in this manner, then I'd wholeheartedly vote to keep the result (although it may belong at a more sensible title as well). <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 07:24, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
