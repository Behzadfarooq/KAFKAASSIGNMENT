<li><s><b>Speedy Keep</b> Significant and notable. Just because Afshar's paper has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal does not mean it is Original Research!

Afshar experiment has been published in Proc.

<dd>My apologies, then. I merely found it surprising that

<li>A first-time wikipedia editor would be seemingly knowledgable in the language and mechanisms of wikipedia.</li>
<li>That, out of the several thousand articles up for deletion, that a new editor would choose this article, and would do so within hours of its nomination.</li>
<li>That a new user's first (and so far only) action would be to dive headlong into a debate.</li>
<li>That this user's response to my accusation would be so immediate and timely, as if they were watching this page, but are not otherwse engaged in day-to-day WP activities.</li>

<dd>It is completely inappropriate that an individual should be involved in the maintenance of a page concerning his own work, and in debates about deleting that page.

<dl>
<dd>Dear Monroe, my involvement in the <a href="../../../a/f/s/Afshar_experiment.html" title="Afshar experiment">Afshar experiment</a> page has been limited to ensuring the accuracy of the reports regarding my work. It would be negligent of me not to do so. The recent John Seigenthaler incident (see <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4534712.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4534712.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4534712.stm</a>) is warning enough for any prudent person to ensure that inaccuracies (as well as malicious attacks) do not survive on Wiki pages. To that end, rest assured that I will keep a watchful eye on the <a href="../../../a/f/s/Afshar_experiment.html" title="Afshar experiment">Afshar experiment</a> page and its contents, given it survives your mysteriously sudden deletion request! Please note that I have not voted here, but simply been forced to respond to criticism, which frankly belongs to the discussion page rather than here! BTW/ my paper is stil under peer-review...

<dd>Linas, the IP you mentioned belongs to the colleague User:Physicsmonk with whom I worked and used his computer last year before I had set up my own Wiki account. After my recent discussions with you I asked him to obtain an account as well, which is exactly what he has done. He retracted the anonymous vote after he realized I had posted his vote for him (see below for the reason). Please stop these unsubstantiated remarks. Frankly, I am starting to think that Hunter Monroe is in fact your sockpuppet?! <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 23:18, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Dear Linas, You can't call anyone who supports my work a sockpuppet! User:Physicsmonkis certainly not a sockpuppet either, he is the Boston colleague I mentioned in my e-mail. I asked him to set up an account as you had suggested. He told me about the recent events with Monroe requesting a deletion and then you reinstating Monroe's attempt which I mistakenly understood as your own view. Sorry if I got confused on your vote! At any rate, User:Physicsmonk told me that for some reason he could not post his vote on the Wiki deletion page, which is what I did for him by copying and pasting his response to User:Hmonroe into the vote page. As you can see, I have not voted on the deletion issue myself as I deem that not to be ethical. I hope this clarifies the situation. BTW/ I have posted the e-mail I sent you a few days agao but was left unanswered in your talk page. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 21:15, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Point of order</b>. As a minimum of verifiability it seems that any valid vote must be posted from the account that signs it. I can't see how anyone could think otherwise, events in Florida notwithstanding. Thus I say the third vote from the top, signed by physicsmonk but posted by Afshar be <s>struck out</s> (not obliterated) and physicsmonk be allowed to cast a vote from his/her own account. (Then the argument may continue, as desired.) <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGangofOne_5411.html" title="User:GangofOne">GangofOne</a> 00:51, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This is not original research in the WP sense. It is a real controversy in the real world which has generated a rather extensive paper trail. Keeping it does <i>not</i> imply endorsing it, any more than the articles on <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">cold fusion</a> endorse the topics. Documenting recent disputes like this is an important way WP is valuable. Of course, it remains important that the article be NPOV, and that it not be given too much prominence in other parts of the WP, <i>e.g.</i> the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> article, with which it is only very tangentially related. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 23:21, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but it will be necessary to monitor this page closely owing to its peculiar history. I suggest strong disclaimers to alert the casual reader that Afshar's work cannot be considered established science. The many Speedy Keeps visible on this page are consistent with claims of sockpuppets. WP:Guide to deletion says "Speedy keep is rarely used. It implies that the user thinks the nomination was based on an obvious misunderstanding and that the deletion discussion can be closed early." Earlier versions of this page could easily be construed as original research, so deletion is at least a option worth thinking about. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Kielpinski_13b9.html" title="User:Dave Kielpinski">Dave Kielpinski</a> 05:41, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think it would be completely against the spirit of science to even consider this article for deletion. Though there hasn't been much news on it, has this experiment not been repeated twice? If there are problems with the scientific establishment so deep that something challenging established ideas is censured(this isn't the only instance) let's hope wikipedia can at least be more open minded. A better suggestion: delete the article on string theory, at least there is an "afshar experiment." If the experiment were held to the same standards as string speculation then it would be infinitely superior. -- Anon <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 63.254.142.215 (<a href="../../../6/3/2E/User_talk%7E63.254.142.215.html" title="User talk:63.254.142.215">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.254.142.215_a12e.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.254.142.215">contribs</a>) 16:58, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, with strong misgivings. This kind of page can be seriously misleading. In particular, the current page tends to give the impression that the results of this experiment are important - in fact, the results are exactly what anyone would have predicted. The only question is whether Afshar's interpretation of the experiment is compatible with his or others' understandings of the idea of complementarity. --<a href="../../../r/e/u/User%7EReuben_aaa3.html" title="User:Reuben">Reuben</a> 17:45, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would also recommend that the article be reduced substantially in length, unless Afshar himself can be persuaded to distance himself from it. The current article is tied far too strongly to his point of view. --<a href="../../../r/e/u/User%7EReuben_aaa3.html" title="User:Reuben">Reuben</a> 18:51, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have no problem with the article size reduction, but have every problem with not being able to at least clarify what I have done, or why. It would be charlatanism to ascribe to me what I have not claimed, without a recourse to correct the allegation. After all, if the experiment carries my name, I should be able to explain what it is, or correct mistakes others make in describing its content and my claims. I will avoid directly editing the page given I can communicate my corrections and updates to a responsible, and unbiased editor who would then objectively update the article. I do not see how it could be done otherwise. BTW there is a Crossed beam version of the experiment that is much easier to understand without the need to go into Fourier optics. Anybody who wishes to add that version please contact me in my user talk page. -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 18:59, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
