<p><b>Closer's notes</b><br />
It seems that this AfD was closed and then re-opened by some non-admins. Regardless of the propriety of that or otherwise, the AfD has now been open for long enough to attract plenty of participation (following an initial nomination and a DRV; four-and-a-half days total open time) and it's time to close.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> is, sadly, a vote. There is no consensus for this - just a simple majority. The nomination is therefore incorrect in this aspect. Additionally, to stick my neck out, the "votes" above are citing "verifibility" as a reason to keep. My arse is verifiable - independently and with citations, lucky me - but doesn't belong on Wikipedia by any stretch of the imagination. Until something has a greater reason to be kept here than my arse, it shouldn't be kept here automatically.

<li>Well, Sir, may I congratulate you on having such a well-publicised hind quarter, and may it serve you well! However, this discussion deals with notability, and whether such claims of notability previously made are verifiable, which they are. Good day, <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a>&#160;<small>•</small>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 21:05, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uh, yeah, but the above&#160;!votes aren't saying that. They're saying that there are <i>two</i> reasons to keep - notability <b>and</b> verifibility. Notability (if established in the article - you might like to edit it to make it clear as it isn't obvious to a lay reader as it stands) is, to a degree, subjective. Verifibility is, however, something that can be measured <b>but</b> is meaningless here. All manner of crap can be verified. All manner of nonsense can be verified. In the <i>Independent</i> UK newspaper last week, a picture had a caption that read "ASDFGHJKLASDFGHJKL ASDFGHJKL". Do we create an article called ASDFGHJKLASDFGHJKL ASDFGHJKL? Coz I can verify it immediately! As I say, I can provide independent, citable sources for my arse. That doesn't allow it to be given as a reason for keeping an article.

<li>Redvers, people went on and on in the DRV about how there were no independent sources, so I really don't see the harm of people pointing out that there now are sources. Besides, everyone has also used the word "notable" in some form, and that *is* a reason to keep. I'm going to just assume that WP:V is your pet peeve and you felt the need to rant. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 22:06, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Redvers, what are you going on about? I respect you and usually agree with you but I truly can't figure out what you mean here or why you commented. Notability has also been established and this isn't any less notable than articles on obscure Pokemon. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 21:41, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Notability and independent sources showing this have been established with the re-write of the article. "procedural relisting" is a bunch of crap considering the outcome of the DRV and the obviousness of the notability. A wonderful example of process wonkism at its best (and a massive waste of time).<a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 21:41, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>See above (I edit conflicted with you on posting it). In short: people here are saying that this article should be kept because it is verifiable. That alone is not enough - as I say, my bum is verifiable, sadly. I have no issue on the notability of the subject (I haven't&#160;!voted here at all), I just have an issue with the <small>downright stupid</small> idea that verifibility is a reason (or an additional reason) to keep an article. I'll keep my bum, but I don't want Wikipedia to do so. Really. Really really. No, really.&#160;;o) And, yeah, you're right: so far we've never disagreed on an AfD and (including this one) we haven't. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 21:55, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok I get your point. WP:V is a pet peeve of yours.&#160;:) It kind of sounded like you didn't realize that people were also mentioning notability, but ok since everyone ALSO used the word "notable" in some form, that is a reason to keep. What happened here is that on the DRV, one of the reasons people said it should stay deleted was lack of WP:V so forgive the comments here, they are only in reaction to the rant there. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 22:06, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Another AfD is a reliable source for that statement, is it?

<li>That was the intention. One article cites trade papers like <i>Accountancy Age</i> and <i>Computer Partner</i>, the other doesn't. One product got the vendor an export award, and an <a href="http://www.zdnet.be/print.cfm?id=54024" class="external text" title="http://www.zdnet.be/print.cfm?id=54024" rel="nofollow">interview on ZDNet.be</a> with the co-founder, the other appears not to have. I think it's clear which is the more reported-on. Granted "group-office" is a pretty common term, but web ghits for "group-office +intermesh" look largely self-referential. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 09:44, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll just repeat myself here then from the previous discussion, as the idea that OSNews.com is a reliable source doesn't seem to have established itself. First of all, their instructions for authors are just like those of peer-reviewed papers, which to me makes the case that their quality might be higher than that of "established journals", who have a set of editors who basically write what they feel writing about, and a set of authors, who need to satisfy the tastes of the editors. Secondly, the particular author writing that review has written 28 reviews for OSNews.com, so he is actually quite experienced. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a>&#160;<small>•</small>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 13:17, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>While the <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">software inclusion</a> guideline is only proposed at this stage, it is largely consistant with other notability guidelines, and requires non-trivial coverage. There are many claims to notability above, however barring Diez2's none of these do have <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falsifiability.html" title="Falsifiability">falsifiability</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">testimony from wikipedia editors is not a reliable source</a>.

<li>As nicely as possible, this comment really doesn't move the discussion forward. <i>Why</i> do you say it's notable, based upon what evidence, etc. I've clearly outlined <i>my</i> reasoning as to why I think it's not, and this is not a vote.<br />
