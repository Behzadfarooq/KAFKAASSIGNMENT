<p>The result of the debate was <b>15 to delete</b>, <b>3 to keep</b> and <b>7 to merge</b> (including the vote to Keep but rename or merge). Those who support merge argue well, but there is no agreement on where to merge. There are also some voices to rename and rewrite the article. A better written and less POV article under a different title will certainly be started. The votes to delete are plenty and well argued, so I close this AfD as <b>delete</b>.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> (<a href="../../../e/z/e/User_talk%7EEzeu_81a8.html" title="User talk:Ezeu">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ezeu_fe4c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ezeu">contribs</a>) 12:56, 30 May 2006 (UTC+10 hours)</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi Guys, since my post of 02:56, 23 May 2006 (UTC) below, I've done quite a few hours work on the article. We are now looking at quite a different beast. Would appreciate your revised input. Does anyone have the Des Ball article? Thanks. <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMccready_a493.html" title="User:Mccready">Mccready</a> 08:53, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but rename or merge. As is, this is not an article. It needs to be pulled together under a stronger common theme with a different name, or perhaps merged to another page. Maybe one of the people/reports referenced on this page might qualify. But at the same time it doesn't seem to be OR, and the material covered does seem to be encyclopedic. There are plenty of other wikipedia pages that do deal with allegations - so long as the allegations are serious enough and at least potentially true, that's OK. POV is reason to cleanup, not reason to delete an article. Finally, I remind people that AFD is not a vote. It may be 'obvious' to you that the article is/is not worth keeping, but that is not a useful comment in our attempt to reach consensus. Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 09:40, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Is there anything in the article that is actually untrue? I don't think so. Certain questions have been raised by certain people and these people are senior whistle blowers. A suicide is involved. Certainly more work is required, but such is the nature of the Wikipedian beast. Yes the article is problematic but these issues have yet a long way to go before a clear view can be had. Deleting the article will only frustrate future researchers. The references are all quite valuable. The article can be utilized in building a clearer picture of this history. Deleting it amounts to suppression of information. --<a href="../../../w/m/_/User%7EWm_3eec.html" title="User:Wm">Wm</a> 12:28, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I've been reluctant to reach a final conclusion on this because although it has been a POV problem in the past, and probably still is, it does cover some stuff that should be covered (Lance Collins, for example, who was widely covered in the media, is currently covered nowhere else on WP but here). I think in the end however that it would be better to start again from the ground up and not have to work off the legacy of this article. Some users have volunteered to help with working on this, I'd like to add my name to the list but invite them to start from scratch rather than trying to fix this article. As per the old <a href="../../../a/w/n/WP%7EAWNB_94e7.html" title="WP:AWNB">AWNB</a> discussion, it would be more appropriate at somewhere like foreign relations of Australia with East Timor, to tie in with the main article <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Australia_a509.html" title="Foreign relations of Australia">foreign relations of Australia</a>. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 13:11, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I really can't believe wikipedia is giving over an entire article to such unfounded allegations. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 15:02, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: soapboxing. Pecher <sup><a href="../../../p/e/c/User_talk%7EPecher_4b24.html" title="User talk:Pecher">Talk</a></sup> 19:44, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The problem with the article is not that the writer has a POV (that's generally a given and <i>not</i> grounds to delete). The problem is that the article is more about the people who have made accusations, than about the accusations. It's more of a list than an article. Assuming that all these allegations are to do with <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Timorese_Declaration_of_Independence_1fb8.html" title="East Timorese Declaration of Independence">East Timorese Declaration of Independence</a> (currently a redirect to <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Timor_c0fb.html" title="East Timor">East Timor</a>) perhaps that article should be resurrected and expanded and these allegations be dealt with there. Alternately, they could be dealt with in the East Timor article itself, but that wouldn't feel right to me - just a little off topic. As I said above, this material may be uncomfortable for some people, but that is not a reason to delete it. Yes, it's POV and soapboxing and yes, it should be cleaned up so it deals with the issues (independance/genocide/cover up) and mentions the accusers, rather than the other way around, but none of that is not an excuse to delete it either.

<li><b>Merge</b> as per Ben Aveling above or develop more fully. Article could explain the history of the allegations, the arguments put forth, and the responses by nay-sayers. Other allegations and conspiracy theories are covered here and can be done well (<a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemtrail.html" title="Chemtrail">chemtrail</a> for example, is a perfectly acceptable article). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Deres_9546.html" title="User:Matt Deres">Matt Deres</a> 19:05, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

If the article is cleaned up, and better explained then weak keep. The sources don't appear bad at first glance. And just because alleged is in the title does not make a topic unencyclopedic. A move would be nice however. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalphin_2def.html" title="User:Falphin">Falphin</a> 19:45, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> or <b>Rename</b> somewhere!

A less-POV title than "cover-up" and a more descriptive and neutral treatment of the subject is absolutely necessary. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font>iggurat</a> 00:30, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
