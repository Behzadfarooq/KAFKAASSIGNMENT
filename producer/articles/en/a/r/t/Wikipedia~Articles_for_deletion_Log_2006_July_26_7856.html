<p>Delete: This article is total rubbish. It has been set up by a user who has done this thing before. He makes things up and posts them on various internet message boards (mainly Digitalspy and TV Forum) and sometimes sets up Wikipedia articles based on these, or modifies other articles to fit. He has done this numerous times before, and I'm suprised his Wikipedia account hasn't been deactivated. Many of his message board posts recently have been based around Matt Baker, and he has mentoned this "talk show" (which doesn't exist) several times recently. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames2001_2059.html" title="User:James2001">James2001</a> 19:43, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about what this list is; it uses a precise definition of "charismatic leader." Setting this aside, there still seems to be some disagreement whether it's possible to categorically describe a person as a "charismatic leader" even by the dictates of that precise definition. It may help to add some prose explaining how each entry on this list meets that definition. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:38, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

While the article is in need of attention and should clarify the distinction between charismatic, legal, and traditional authority to avoid confusion, this is not reason enough to remove the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> You still seem to be missing the point. There is no POV. Charismatic authority describes the method of gaining and/or holding power through rallying public suppot as opposed to other methods such as being part of a hereditary ruling class or elected majority, it has nothing to do with anyone's personal opinion of a leader or his/her actual or perceived level of charisma of competence. --<a href="../../../n/e/m/User%7ENEMT_33ce.html" title="User:NEMT">NEMT</a> 21:51, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> While I don't doubt the legitimacy of a list detailing those described under Weber's definition, the title of this article implies anything but. He does not have a monopoly on the use of the term "charismatic leader", and I don't think it's enough to mention this condition in the intro. Almost any reader would interpret the title as it stands to be a general (and POV) description, and people could (quite rightly) dispute why Weber's definition was the only one selected for such a generic topic.

By the way, as a professional historian influenced by Weberian political sociology, I must say that I strongly disagree with the classification of many leaders of Western liberal democracies as examples of "charismatic" authority.

<li><b>Comment</b> No, no 172 - This list is not original research it is sourced - or at least it should be sourced - to political science analysis. Anyone who has spent any time reading or listening to political philosophers debate examples of various leaders and how they relate to concepts of the three forms of legitimacy would testify to the legitimacy of the need for <i>examples</i>. The title should be "List of leaders described as examples of charismatic authority" or something similar.

<li>No, no Zleitzen - Just because something happens to be "sourced" does not mean it is not original research. Political scientists disagree on these classifications considerably. At present, any Wikipedia editor can dig up something by any author describing any random leader as "charismatic," regardless of whether or not the "source" happens to be a serious scholar of Weberian political sociology.

<li>Scholars do not necessarily interpret and apply the work of Max Weber in a consistent way. The very selection of whom we cite in this entry is an act of original research and imposing a POV in itslef. While I make a career of doing so off Wikipedia, my own original research and POV is no more appropriate than that of any other Wikipedia editor on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>, per Phr, I suppose, but it's not much to merge. Until the article on communications in Afghanistan has a great deal of bulk, it doesn't have that many viewers/users, and until then few people will be searching for a single consortium there. Therefore, there is little utility for a stand-alone article, and the information will be <i>less available</i> in isolation. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:25, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../r/o/s/Roshan_%28Telecom%29_17c0.html" title="Roshan (Telecom)">Roshan (Telecom)</a> should be added to this afd. I think the merge should consist basically of adding an external link, maybe pointing at <a href="http://www.roshan.af" class="external free" title="http://www.roshan.af" rel="nofollow">http://www.roshan.af</a> if there's no TDCA site. I'm indifferent to whether there's also a redirect made. Normally such a link would be spam, but this subject is so sparse that readers probably want all the info they can get. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 05:39, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The list of criteria for companies warranting articles is biased towards the more-developed countries. A large, private company that garners little press in a country with a different model for corporations or without a significant stock exchange is still encyclopedic. Our criteria are extremely <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_288a.html" title="First World">First World</a> centric and should be changed. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg</a> 01:38, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think there's anything wrong with our criteria; or if anything, they're too lax. But we're allowed to make exceptions when there's a reason to do so. If there were more info in the article I could entertain the idea that this is such a case. Right now I think the main use for retaining the info is we might have some readers (e.g. US armed forces) who are going to Afghanistan for some reason and want to know what the phone situation is there. The first article they'd look at is <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, which has a subsection with a link to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communications_in_Afghanistan_c446.html" title="Communications in Afghanistan">Communications in Afghanistan</a>, so that's the logical place to put the info. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 03:04, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: per williamborg, I see no harm in this article and developing countries definately have alot of what we do, it simply isn't reported.--<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusaabdulrashid_7bae.html" title="User:Musaabdulrashid">Musaabdulrashid</a> 03:29, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Anyone can perform the redirect at any time, but it's courteous to let the nomination stand for at least 24 hours before doing so. Since a redirect is non-destructive, anyone <i>can</i> look into the history, if assessing.

</ul>
<p>Response to the above: From <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> "The software has been verifiably the subject of non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the software developer, such as a major media news piece..." Author felt that Wall Street Journal met that criterion. "A single such publication that is specifically about the software is sufficient." Ghits were to establish significance of the general area of mind mapping. Will rework. 3D being a new approach to mind and concept mapping, this seems to represent innovative software. 3D is not to provide eye candy but to solve a problem of scalability with 2D mind maps. Will rework to bring in line with 'guide to writing better articles'.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The above 6 Keep votes are from probable sockpuppets, they all voted in a brief period of time, all have no other edits besides this article, and they altered the times listed in their signatures to make it look as if they voted at different times of the day than they actually did. It is likely they are the sockpuppets of the same person who was vandalizing the following article which I was involved in, and that they came to this one once the first one was Protected: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lentil_%28slur%29_18bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lentil (slur)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lentil (slur)</a> --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 11:05, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It doesn't really matter as per policy on WP:GD - users who have no previous edits can be regarded as socks and "may be discounted during the closing process".

<li><b>Delete</b> - very honest, they say 'The first animation published on Newgrounds.com. Animation was very shoddy, the plot uninspiring, and it was, in the opinion of Alex, more than worthy of the blam vote.' I am afraid they get the blam vote (whatever that might be) here unless they can demonstrate notability which I don't see yet. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 04:57, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - While their first animations weren't very good, their more recent stuff is of notable quality. Trigger Happy, and Back in the USSR have excellent graphics, A Marxmas Special, No Child Left Behind, and Halo vs Counter Strike are all very humorous with witty humor. They got off to a rocky start, yes, but so do most people. Just look at Sean Connery's shoddy acting in his early career. LTH have developed a large fan base, produced many animations, and are now very recognized in the online community. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocialist_Freak_Boy_f876.html" title="User:Socialist Freak Boy">Socialist Freak Boy</a> 05:20, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: It's hard to ignore those sock puppets: they tend to show up like funeral flies. However, the point here is that this is a vanity article on animators whose external references are simply Newgrounds. That's web mentioning web, which doesn't count, as far as I'm concerned, as validation.

<li><b>Keep/Comment</b> - I fail to see how this is a vanity article. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> It's not promoting any of their animations, nor does it seem to portray them in a shining light. It has no external links to a website which they own, it's not promoting merchandise, it merely talks about the origins and possible direction of their work and studio. Furthermore, while they're not the most famous animators to hit the scene, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> they have a very large base of viewers and a smaller--but still large--base of dedicated fans. That should seem to be some semblance of notability. Even if it isn't, it flat out states on the page that "<b>notability is not formal policy (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious)</b>" I feel this article is approached from a neutral perspective, and can continue to grow as their organization's recognition and filmography grows. They meet notability under <b>Large Fan Base</b> and <b>Name Recognition</b> under the people section. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> As for web content, Los Tres Hermanos is being featured in an interview for a magazine titled Blue and Gold about their opinions on the upcoming next gen. systems, showing their animations are wide spread enough to get them recognized. Halo vs Counter Strike won the Daily 3rd Place Award and got Weekly 12th Place out of hundreds of thousands of animations submitted every week on newgrounds, which means they must be doing something right and are good at what they do. The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators. Los Tres Hermanos &amp; Co's animations meet all the qualifications for notable web content, Los Tres Hermanos &amp; Co themselves meet many of the qualifications for notable people. I will admit they do not meet <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> standards, and they are not an organization according to wiki-standards, but I feel they're not an organization either. They are simply some people who make animations--they're good at what they do, they're getting recognized for it, but they're not an organization. They're an animation team, not a company/organization/corporation. I see no reason to delete this article. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocialist_Freak_Boy_f876.html" title="User:Socialist Freak Boy">Socialist Freak Boy</a> 03:53, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Note</b> that this was not so much a vote as a further explanation as to why I feel it should be kept. Besides, this is not decided by "votes" as you put them, but by the argument therein.

In the future, I suggest taking copyright violations to <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>. Just blank the article and slap on the {{<a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopyvio_c034.html" title="Template:Copyvio">copyvio</a>}} template. Then list the article on the Copyright Problems subpage of the day, which is linked to on the template after you save the article. That is all you have to do. After 7 days, if no one asserts that the article is not a copyright violation, the article will be deleted without discussion. The vast majority of articles are deleted. Perhaps one or two articles out of the dozens submitted each day are kept. It is significantly less work than AfD and the copyright violation is only visible in the history before it is deleted, unlike AfD which displays the article's content so that editors can decide its fate. Finally, if the AfD decision is to keep the article, you'll have to either rewrite the article or take it to copyright problems. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 04:08, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey there, I am the author of these articles. I'm new to adding material to this site, and because I read a bunch of the pre-post information, i didn't think i was doing anything wrong... I realize citing is important, and I could go through and do it given the abundance of press each topic has received, but I just don't have the time to make this a reality. If that makes the topics moot, then so be it, I just thought people might want to know about the subject of these articles. The band I manage, <a href="../../../y/o/u/You_Say_Party%21_We_Say_Die%21_29b2.html" title="You Say Party! We Say Die!">You Say Party!

<li><b>Keep All</b> – I moved from Toronto to Vancouver one year ago, and have been an active participant (on stage and in the audience) in the independent music scene in Canada since 1996. I can say for certain that, in the Vancouver indie scene, there is no production company larger or more prolific than Sealed With a Kiss. A vote against the inclusion of Sealed With a Kiss is a vote against the inclusion of independent music in Vancouver. According to the city's most popular concert tracker, <a href="http://livevan.com" class="external text" title="http://livevan.com" rel="nofollow">Live Music Vancouver</a>, Sealed With a Kiss currently has 22 shows booked, and 159 in the back catalog <a href="http://livevan.com/index.php?resid=3680&amp;res_action=info&amp;PHPSESSID=dac529bf8084e0aac973a00fc59e913a" class="external autonumber" title="http://livevan.com/index.php?resid=3680&amp;res_action=info&amp;PHPSESSID=dac529bf8084e0aac973a00fc59e913a" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, a record that <a href="http://livevan.com/index.php?restore_state_manually=1&amp;restore_state_manually=1&amp;action=resources_by_type&amp;service_id=10&amp;no_limit=true#no_limit_form" class="external text" title="http://livevan.com/index.php?restore_state_manually=1&amp;restore_state_manually=1&amp;action=resources_by_type&amp;service_id=10&amp;no_limit=true#no_limit_form" rel="nofollow">few of these</a> production companies can boast. Further to my vote to keep the Sealed With a Kiss entry, I believe that the contribution that Jason Lajeunesse and Dani Vachon have made to Sealed With a Kiss, and independent music in Vancouver in general, should qualify their articles for retention. Somewhat lacking in style and structure, however, they could use some editing... --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveluscher_9272.html" title="User:Steveluscher">Steveluscher</a> 06:31, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The AfD discussion is about <i>notability</i> and whether an article is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia, not about whether the subject of the article is generally worthwhile. Statements like "A vote against the inclusion of Sealed With a Kiss is a vote against the inclusion of independent music in Vancouver" are a both emotive and specious in this context; the question of whether an article should be kept or deleted should be based on WP policies and guidelines. The lineup of artists listed is certainly significant and most, if not all, of them are notable. It's not clear to me whether a concert production company involved with them becomes notable or not, so at this point I <b>abstain</b>. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../p/a/d/User_talk%7EPaddles_d91c.html" title="User talk:Paddles">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paddles_cfed.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paddles">C</a></sub> 14:47, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I suggest review and possible AfD of the Dennis Lyxzen and Frank Kozik articles as well.

<li>Curious --I checked the other fandom type of related sites, as I didn't want to post something only to get it deleted (no purpose in that) and found some more obscure entries than mine, thinking it would be acceptable. I should say, sorry for deleting the tags the first time, but I didn't know how else to get to the attention of whoever tagged it (I'm new). Point is, why is this objectionable when sites like "The lurkers guide to babylon 5" and glarkware as well as blogs like realityreel and fandomwank are permissable? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ravenem (<a href="../../../r/a/v/User_talk%7ERavenem_3cf2.html" title="User talk:Ravenem">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ravenem_ee70.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ravenem">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><s><b>Weak Keep</b></s><i>changed below</i> and rewrite. They have 15 chapters, which I suppose is enough for an article.

I'll contact the posters and see if they hold copyright and can properly relicense.

<li>I know that a low number of contributers isn't rationale for deletion, but as I don't even know about Lambda Tau Omega, I figured it might just be something the creator made up, or that it might be something unnotable. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 19:31, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, it took me five minutes on their website to confirm that this isn't something made-up (there are several chapter websites and it's listed on <a href="http://www.kean.edu/resident_sororities.html" class="external text" title="http://www.kean.edu/resident_sororities.html" rel="nofollow">a university's website</a>). You might research this first on the web before making an AfD nom. Notability is another matter. 15 chapters isn't very many, so I may change my vote to delete if arguments sway me.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 19:45, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Exists, but doesn't appear particularly notable to me.

<li><b>Delete</b> I looked at a couple of other Greek org pages. Many of them have hundreds of chapters, but one had as few as <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigma_Sigma_Sigma_e951.html" title="Sigma Sigma Sigma">107</a>. I'm not sure where the bright line should be, so I'm not going to try to draw it. The only other distinction I see is that this organization's webpage is on geocities, instead of their own domain, which isn't really a bright line, either. However, the lack of sources and the copyright issues push this over the edge, so I'm changing my vote to delete.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 21:52, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: This is an old debate. Individual chapters are not individual articles.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Any building, company, or person merely doing its job is, by its nature, not set apart from the rest, not "notable." This church sounds like a fine place serving the Lord, but it has nothing really that sets it apart, that marks it as special, from all the other churches. Further, the article indicates that it is non-denominational, but that <i>seems</i> to mean Congregational rather than ecumenical. Such wobbly terminology is distinctly unhelpful. The church is expanding, which is nice, but not really significant. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:32, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Prod removed. Page is better since then (was empty), but this still doesn't warrant it's own page. These characters are not even mentioned on the show's page, so they hardly need their own. If someone more familiar with the show thinks anything here is worth merging, I wouldn't object, except that most of this writing is rather pov anyway. I'm assuming since they aren't even listed under characters on that page now, they probably aren't very major, but I don't know the show.-<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 00:40, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm a fan of the show too, even when I nominated the above article for deletion. Now I see it's better to have a big article for all the mamodo characters. Looking back, it seems that some editor had originally created a bunch of mamodo/bookkeeper pair articles, and they all got merged into one.

</li>
<li>I really don't think they should be deleted because there is enough info on them for them to have an article. I also think characters like Kido and Dr. Riddles, Bari and Gustav, Ted and Jeed, Laila and Albert, Earth and Elly, Penny and Uri, and Kolulu and Lori should their own page because they play MAJOR important roles in the series. -</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>I haven't seen the entire series yet, but I think you're overplaying the importance of these characters, especially Kolulu (she only appears in one episode, just because she's the reason Zatch wants to become king doesn't make her major). The characters that presently have articles have enough information on them to warrant an article. Out of the mamodo/bookkeeper pairs you listed, the only one that I believe warrants their own article is Kido/Dr. Riddles, and I've been in fact thinking about doing that, but I don't know enough first-hand information to do that yet. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 23:53, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well for Kido and Dr. Riddles, you can start with their stats, mention the majestic twelve, use references from episodes 49-50, watch the show during the devolo ruins saga (ep. 58-?), or use info from these sites:</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: These are negative results. Rhinos are very, very hard to breed in captivity. One that survives to mating age would be notable. The furore created over the efforts to save the baby's life are now ancient history, and there is no indication that it has had a lasting effect. Delete for that reason: the subject is not inherently notable, and the stir caused has not left a mark. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:42, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The media coverage was in Swedish, and unless you search using Swedish keywords, you won't find anything (or not much anyway). Try replacing "rhinoceros" with one of the words "noshörning", "noshörningen", "noshörningsunge", or "noshörningsungen". <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 08:34, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Tups, I am absolutely sure that you're right. The question is whether this is a good article for the .en Wikipedia. Since the rationale boils down, at this point, to "was a major cultural happening," it's a fair question to look for effects of that furore, to ask if it passed from "in the news" to "historical event." It's therefore somewhat fair to ask if English references exist to justify an entry in an English language encyclopedia. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:06, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I disagree in principle. In my view, Wikipedia should have a global scope regardless of language version. And the lack of English-language sources (or at least easily available or googlable sources) is actually a problem with many obscurish topics of real historical importance. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 12:19, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> per nom. Random events is just a list, whilst I can see that they should be mentioned somewhere, listing every random event and detailing what actually happens does not seem useful to someone trying to get a feel for the game. The other articles are examples of scrappy stubs which IMHO don't need individual pages and encourage fancruft padding. I'd suggest that the wiki editors repeat the success of the main RS page by concentrating on the larger pages (IE skills, combat etc.), nailing them down with relevant information, then standing back and looking at what can be split off into seperate articles. Considering that the main page apparently suffers constant revisions, yet still looks so good, repeating that with the larger pages would stop this 'divide and conquer' effect and give those who've slogged away for hours a bit of a break. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 09:59, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I would normally vote delete, as I believe these articles are unencyclopedic and contain mostly unverifiable information and doesn't use reliable sources. However, I would like to see some of the proposed merging take place and then see what the RuneScape article landscape looks like. I would <i>not</i> like to see a speedy keep take place, but would like to see this nomination withdrawn for now. It would be far better to have a proper AFD, rather than one filled with comments saying that they haven't had time to complete planned merges and saying keep on the ground of a recent "no consesus". <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 15:42, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> - work in progress... As for the points: 1. Disgree with the "guide" argument, as most of the howto and full lists, for instance, have been slashed. 2. Relevance, no more or less relevant to non gamers, than the detail on many other topics is to non-whatevers. I'd question if there is enough WP-relevant comtent to support individual skill articles though, but maybe enough that skills needs to be split in some way to avoid being over-large .. not a guide, but more than the most minimalistic overview.

Also, I really don't see how a passing, mispronounced reference on a television show automatically qualifies it as notable. <a href="../../../b/l/u/Super_Mario%7E_Blue_Twilight_DX_390c.html" title="Super Mario: Blue Twilight DX">Super Mario: Blue Twilight DX</a> is certainly notable; however, MFGG is simply a website that Blaze posted it at. If being on television is of itself proof of notability, then every person ever on a game show or making funny faces at the local news TV camera behind the news anchor is notable, and that's simply not the case. Now, if the author can show us a multitude of shows referencing the website, or a ton of press coverage, instead of one single instance, that would be a different matter and I'd gladly consider changing my opinion. -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysticEsper_07d5.html" title="User:MysticEsper">MysticEsper</a> 07:54, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Both this site and SFGHQ have been around for a very long time and without them, I don't think Mario fangaming or Sonic fangaming would have ever done near as well.

<li><b>Delete</b>, fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>; a single passing reference does not give notability, and the article's claims of incredible traffic are hardly supported by the (admittedly flawed) tools we have available to assess that: for example, the site's Alexa ranking is just 348,298, while Google returns fewer than 250 results when you search for the site's name.

<li>Although I'm probably biased since I'm the administrator, <b>Keep, but clean up clean up clean up</b>. The site has about 3000 members on it and consumes somewhere in the range of 200 GB of bandwidth a month, which is a ton. The reason searching for the actual site name doesn't bring up that many results is that it's almost always referred to by its abbreviation: MFGG. I think the site is significant enough. If things like this can go completely unchecked, I see no reason why a website like this can't be included. As for the G4 mention, when the same story was reposted on the Attack of the Show website, it primarily mentioned the MFGG website instead of the Blue Twlight Game. A lot of this article needs to be improved though. Right now, the article only makes sense to those who are really involved in the website, especially with the terminology. The site is definitely signifcant enough to warrant its own article, but I would suggest a complete re-write. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowMan1od_7e39.html" title="User:ShadowMan1od">ShadowMan1od</a> 00:55, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Only about 10 (at the most) of the results on the first 3 pages are related to this site.

<li><b>Comment doesn't matter</b> Because notability is in the eye of the beholder, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is an essay, it isn't even a guideline. (Essays are the furthest that articles in the Wikipedia namespace can get from policy.) Besides, GHits can only be used to rule in, not to rule out.

I suggest the article be considered on its technical potential for an encylopedic article, which is why I'm firm in the belief that {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} was needed instead of {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}}. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHOzAu_f632.html" title="User:DavidHOzAu">DavidHOzAu</a> 02:36, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment (found it)</b> Despite the somewhat questionable grounds of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, deleting on notabilty alone is clearly argumentum ad google (<a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_populum.html" title="Argumentum ad populum">argumentum ad populum</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a> in one), with the intent to generate an argument for deletion based on <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> grounds. (This is why I am forced to question all WP:WEBs where I notice that the rationale is based on fallacious arguments.) Also, saying "there's no search hits therefore it isn't notable" is like saying "<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html" title="Black hole">Black holes</a> don't exist because I can't see them." IMHO, AfD could function a lot better if were based on the <i>technical content</i> of the article (words, structure, style, etc.) instead of what is being talked about, which as I mentioned is <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">the offical policy</a>. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHOzAu_f632.html" title="User:DavidHOzAu">DavidHOzAu</a> 02:55, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep But Rewrite</b> - Fangaming is a very notable phenomenon (and even has its <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fangame.html" title="Fangame">own article</a>). Mario fangaming is particularly prevelent, and as the most undeniably comprehensive source of Mario fangames and fangaming resources, MFGG is certainly notable. In fact, MFGG is notable for historic reasons; namely, it was one of the first fangaming sites to survive for several years. That said, this article should be heavily rewritten to focus more on how significant MFGG is to the fangaming community, which I am willing to do. Also, as noted by DavidHOzAu, WP:N is <b>not official policy.</b> While WP:WEB is an official guideline, <a href="../../../p/a/g/WP%7EPAG_9804.html" title="WP:PAG">WP:PAG</a> states that <i>Guidelines are not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception.</i> Therefore, it is entirely possible (and, given the importance of MFGG to the fangaming community, probable) that MFGG may be exempt from WP:WEB. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Silvers_da83.html" title="User:Jeff Silvers">Jeff Silvers</a> 03:43, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The fact that the site focuses on a notable subject and has been around for a long time does not make it notable, though. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 23:01, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Not neccessarily, though. I can prove this by counterexample: the most prominent site for information on the TOC2 protocol was originally a (relatively) obscure html file on an utterly non-notable site. The TOC2 protocol itself is notable, but the site that was the leading authority on it was not. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 03:09, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think the difference would be that while the site would be the leading authority on TOC2, TOC2 is essentially just a system. This is a community instead of just a function that you can document. Mario fangaming is fairly widespread, and MFGG is essentially the hub for all of it (especially for fangaming in general too). <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowMan1od_7e39.html" title="User:ShadowMan1od">ShadowMan1od</a> 04:48, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> TOC2 is (along with OSCAR) the primary protocol for AOL Instant Messenger, so it's actually more widespread than Mario fangaming. Getting back to the main point, there is no notability by proxy. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 05:36, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment again</b> I didn't mean it as in "MARIO FANGAMING IS REALLY IMPORTANT GUYS", its just the "main site" aspect. While that site wasn't notable, it was more of something that you could make write-ups and documents on rather than being a growing community that requires a main hub. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowMan1od_7e39.html" title="User:ShadowMan1od">ShadowMan1od</a> 22:47, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I, admittedly, know nothing whatsoever about wrestling. As a general rule, IMO, professional and semi-pro sports leagues (NFL, AFL, AF2, and the analagous organizations in other sports) are notable. The ad agency for the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Redskins_17e9.html" title="Washington Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> is not. My understanding from looking at this article is that it is more like the ad agency for the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Redskins_17e9.html" title="Washington Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>. Am I incorrect? I saw the PCW article and assumed it was the pro or semi-pro league itself and thus generally accepted as notable. I don't know anything about it either way and am just going off of what the article said it was and g-hits. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 13:22, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The key to the deletion of this article is whether or not it is actually gone for good after the loss of the Tattersalls sponsorship. Debating as to whether or not this promotion is professional is privy to opening a rather large can of worms in relation to the other promotions in this country (as previously mentioned - and not just PCW and AWF either). If this article is deleted it must be for a specific reason exclusive to this article.
<ul>
<li>Well in that case I think we should wait until if the death of the promotion is decisive before we go deleting it. <font color="#CD2626">Normy</font><i><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENormy132_a3cf.html" title="User talk:Normy132"><font color="#2020C0">132</font></a></i> 10:52, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

My Boy Scout troop made the local paper once when I was growing up - I don't think anyone calls us notable. Also, the original version listed the members of this organization and it was something like 10-12 members.

<p>Part of me doesn't want to do this to someone who wanted to contribute science articles, but Manoj Prajwal has created two pages - DNA - The Ladder of Life and Post-translational Modifications of proteins - that are entirely redundant with <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-translational_modification.html" title="Post-translational modification">post-translational modification</a> respectively. I left him a note to that effect on his talk page on the 22nd but he hasn't edited since then, and unfortunately, these really aren't useful to keep around.</p>
<p>The articles are unsourced and poorly formatted, the user signed his name to them, and one has an enormous and obviously copyvio image on it. The text itself doesn't seem to be copyvio, but the articles were created with a very small number of edits for such large blocks of text - I suspect these are someone's school papers. There's really nothing to merge to our more complete existing articles and the titles are such unlikely search terms that a redirect is unnecessary.</p>
<p>(I've nominated a third article created by this user, Role of Dendritic cell apoptosis in Autoimmune disorders, separately, since it was less redundant than these two.) <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 04:58, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

This article is on a very narrow topic, contains many inaccurate or overly certain-sounding statements, and was signed by the creator. It's not exactly original research, since I doubt the article creator actually did these experiments, but it's an outline for such - as I said on the other AfD, I suspect these are school papers or assignments turned into articles. I've already included a mention of this phenomenon in the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autoimmune_disorder.html" title="Autoimmune disorder">autoimmune disorder</a> page, but there really isn't enough sourced and accurate material here for a real merge, and the article title is an unlikely search term that doesn't need a redirect. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 05:10, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Why not just include a brief explication of the concept in a subsection under the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consequentialism.html" title="Consequentialism">consequentialism</a> article then? I agree that the sentiment has attracted philosophical attention, but it has a name: "the ends justify the means" is not the name of the concept but an aphorism or slogan. As such, it could be defined in a dictionary of idiom, but the proper place for a discussion dealing with the philosophical implications of the doctrine, as the article in question tries to do, is in the article on consequentialism. And the piece as it is written is positively riddled with moralistic undertones, even though a vague attempt at scholarly detachment has been made. It is virtually irredeemable without a complete rewrite, I think, and I don't see that being justified in this case. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 11:04, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is the "<a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">common name</a>" for a <i>doctrine</i> that has many more implications than just the philosophical ones. It is not just a "slogan", just like "<a href="../../../d/o/_/Do_No_Harm_40e1.html" title="Do No Harm">Do No Harm</a>" is not just a slogan, but a slogan <i>representing a doctrine</i>. Should we refer to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergey_Nechayev_3ac9.html" title="Sergey Nechayev">Sergey Nechayev</a> in the article <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consequentialism.html" title="Consequentialism">Consequentialism</a>? I don't think much of him as a philosopher (and I guess he would have agreed, as he did not think much of philosophers in general but regarded himself highly). To me, consequentialism is armchair philosophy that can be used to lend a semblance of legitimacy to the practice of committing atrocities in name of the "higher good", which is what "the ends justify the means" is about. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:16, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I fail to see what implications of an ethical doctrine would not be philosophical in nature, but I suppose this is the place to debate neither that nor whether the doctrine in question is about committing atrocities for a higher good (which I also dispute). I wouldn't call consequentialism "armchair philosophy", either, unless we are to write off such eminent thinkers as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stuart_Mill_d597.html" title="John Stuart Mill">John Stuart Mill</a> as mere "armchair philosophers". I can grant that sermonising about the end justifying the means is armchair philosophy, however, and Wikipedia is not a place to play host to that, I don't believe. The name for the concept, I maintain, is consequentialism: are we to have an article entitled "Always act in such a manner that bla bla bla" with a bit of vague rambling about Kant's ethics and then still have another, more scholarly one on the "<a href="../../../c/a/t/Categorical_imperative.html" title="Categorical imperative">categorical imperative</a>"?

<li><b>Comment</b> There is clearly a need to establish what constitutes a neighborhood. Most of the neighborhood articles that I have read do not establish notability, even those that are in my mind notable e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Italy%2C_Manhattan_064e.html" title="Little Italy, Manhattan">Little Italy, Manhattan</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/e/Noe_Valley%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California_ebfd.html" title="Noe Valley, San Francisco, California">Noe Valley, San Francisco, California</a>. It is also true that unincorporated places are clear keepers on wikipedia. These neighborhoods do not seem notable to me and it is unclear to me that they are neighborhoods at all. Nonetheless it seems that true neighborhoods would always be notable, as they are often deliniated on maps etc. I don't think that suburban gated communities or subdivisions constitute a neighborhood.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 17:41, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>non-notable family name.

The creator has the same initials as the surname that is the subject of this article. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not for genealogical entries</a>. In a prior version, the creator of the article used a "source" that linked to a person in the editor's hometown with the same surname as in the article. There had been a {{<a href="../../../l/i/n/Template%7ELinkless_f9ea.html" title="Template:Linkless">linkless</a>}} tag, and the creator of the article connected it or created articles to link to it. The edit that made me notice the similarity of the initials of the editor to the surname of the article was when the creator of this article edited <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVincentV_e6c3.html" title="User:VincentV">User:VincentV</a> to include a link to the article.

<p>NN software/plugin. Basically, this is a plugin for a forum software; while the software itself is notable, third-party plugins for them rarely are and should be subject to closer scrutiny of their notability. The article has an extensive section about this plugin's history and motivations, but, no offense to the article authors intended, I fail to see how anyone whould be interested about that stuff when reading an encyclopaedia. If you'd rewrite the article, you'd basically get "One of the plugins that rewrites vBulletin URLs so they're more search-engine friendly, for example, foo → bar." and that's about as far as it could be extended. That doesn't sound very impressive to me. At most, this is worth an external link.

There is nothing remarkable about this dormitory that is highlighted by the article. The creator of the article has been asking for time to flesh out this article (and a number of other articles from the La Salle University Campus). The inception of this article was a week ago. That's enough time. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 12:16, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I admit that while I did generate the article a week ago, I really haven't worked on it until yesterday. I would like more time to complete it.</li>
<li>Also, the picture <i>was</i> a copyright violation (I'm fairly new in regards to pictures, sorry), but it has been removed and hopefully I'll put a new (legal) one up soon.</li>
<li>This article was certainly <b>not</b> copy/pasted. I did take information from the site Durin mentions, but those are the facts of the structure. You can't do anything about that.</li>
<li>There is precedence for this article, as many universities have buildings listed on Wikipedia. I understand that doesn't necessarily make it right, but it's at least of note. Ther are <b>a lot</b> of residence halls on this site.</li>
<li>I have already received some feedback in support of others on my talk page. Durin HIMSELF actually noted previously (and I think this is an important point), "My own personal take is that if we can have articles on obscure <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="Pokémon">Pokémon</a> characters, certainly it is worthwhile to have articles on buildings where literally thousands of people have lived over the years, such as residence halls." <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">user:Uppland</a> added "I have nothing against good articles about buildings at your campus provided they are of some historical or architectural interest".</li>
<li>What Durin is not grasping, in his move to make this an AFD, is that to students, alumni, and prospective students, this complex is very important and has a long history. Even more importantly, people involved (or who want to be involved) with these buildings can <b>find this information extremely helpful and relevant</b>. Just because individuals outside the univeristy/city don't <i>KNOW</i> of the building, doesn't mean that it isn't notable or important.</li>

<li><b>COMMENT</b>You are also misinterpreting me. I am not asserting that <i>since</i> we have article on minor Pokémon characters, we can have articles on non-notable residence halls. I don't think we should have individual articles on minor Pokémon characters either. This also goes to what you mentioned above; the mere presence of other articles on Wikipedia of similar nature or of articles with subjectively less importance does not grant status to the existence of another article in a similar vein.</li>
<li>Further, you can state facts about a place, but you are not permitted to use direct verbiage from a copyright holder to represent those facts. Taking the St. Albert Hall element of the article we're discussing, I'll bold all text that is a direct copy of <a href="http://www.lasalle.edu/admiss/dorms_albert.php?sect=fresh" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lasalle.edu/admiss/dorms_albert.php?sect=fresh" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>:</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: but rename to La Salle university! Because more than one university has a north dorms. I mentioned this in the discussion page (which has already been deleted, thank you so much). <b>Moderator:</b> As for the paraphrased context and stolen pictures, simply revert these additions that got the article into some scrutiny. I do live in the area and would be more than willing to upload some pictures that are not in violation of any copyright. <b>Lasallefan:</b> why ADD content that is already summarized on other websites? I don't think it's what wikipedia is about, to imitate already existing websites, pictures and text and all. If not illegal, it certainly is not constructive. It serves no purpose. If you rely less on the copy and paste functions, and more on the creative side, your pages will not be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> It has not been any of the editors of this article that have edited Charles I. We have tirelessly worked on this article for a whole day. If you think it's a hoax, CHECK THE REFERENCES. Mohit DOES appear in there, and not in a minimal role either. We don't much appreciate users who say delete without any reason, AKA Tintin and Coredesat. If you honestly believe that this article is a hoax, which it is not, please state some conflicting evidence instead of saying "delete as a hoax". Every single word in that article is true, and we should be receiving praise about writing such a detailed account of an important sage's life instead of being vilified for it.</li>

<li>Ah, sorry, didn't remember that, it was my first contribution and I was playing around at school, I'd only just learned of Mohit when we were studying ancient India in World History, and we looked him up on Wikipedia for a paper but he wasn't there, leading to the creation of this article. I was pretty ticked at his absence from this site, so I edited some nonsense, but the content of this article remains true, as you can see from the absence of Charles I anywhere.

<li><b>Keep</b>Undisputable garbage? We live in a country where one is innocent until proven guilty. So, too is it conceivable that a man should be accepted as existing unless proven contrariwise. It is far easier to prove a man exists than to prove the opposite. Herein lies considerable evidence that the man in question did in fact exist, and held deeply considered beliefs in his respective fields of philosophy. Perhaps he is obscure, but consider the following: Gravity is only a theory. It is a set of beliefs which seem to hold true in all circumstances. We believe we know how it functions, but we cannot claim to know why. We cannot see or comprehend it, but only witness its influences.

Also, the article claims as fact the baptism of Constantine by Silvester I, which is generally accepted to be fiction. The supposed book cover is a blatant bit of Photoshopping.

<p>Okay... bear with me here. This is a very long article that obviously some people have put a lot of time into. It describes a supposed "sociological experiment" in Baltimore, Maryland that ran from 2001 to 2003. The problem is... as far as I can tell the article is fiction, or at least describes something that has not been mentioned in print (or even blogs apparently). It lists 3 references, none of which mention this project, that I can tell. The names of the 3 academics who supposedly conducted it get no Google results outside Wikipedia <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Miranda+Spertzburg%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Miranda+Spertzburg%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Brinton+Hadley%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Brinton+Hadley%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Miles+Schot%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Miles+Schot%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> as hoax. Two of the references cited are blogs which have nothing to do with the article content, and the other reference only supports one tangential sentence in the article and makes no reference to the sociological experiment.

<dd>Factiva and the Aus NZ Reference Centre don't have any significant results for his name.

<li>The comment that the website does not "look like the website of an accomplished, notable journo" seems to bring into contention whether Baird was a journalist at all based on non-appearance on the internet.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The comparison to the geographic band names list is an excellent one and provides real AfD precedent for keeping this list. This list should stay because it is an interesting list useful to all who seek topical band name data. People who seek that information are a relatively large group.

<li><b>Delete</b> We can't take chances on hoaxes. A Google search for "James Mock" comes up with several people, none which seem to match the one described in the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> omg! There's more than one of you! Darwin got it wrong! This article is not a hoax. You have two of us on the discussion page stating a knowledge of James Mock(as a poet who wrote about John Thompson). I have looked at the policies of wikipedia and found the rather ridiculous policy on non-verifibility. I find it odd that what appears to be an accomplished and researched article can have it's references declared unsatisfactory by ONE POMPOUS, ARROGANT DOUCHEBAG(a classification into which you ALL fall). FYI, referring to someone as such is not a defence of an article, it is an apt description of said LOSER. I feel that the references should be double checked if you want wikipedia to have any credibility. I also suggest that the parish records for births/baptisms in Kirkliston be checked. This would confirm what TWO sources have stated, i.e. that James Mock was indeed a historical figure. I am worried that perhaps the fact that James mock is GAY is what is speeding this witchhunt along. Is Pat Gallacher HOMOPHOBIC and a total loser? I find it interesting that Andrew Lenahan manages to look up google to verify the article, yet Pat only went as far as supposedly checking one book in a library, also, apparently only checking the index and not bothering to read it. I think due to the nature of the material, i.e. that it isn't a well known subject matter, should allow it's continued presence here - sources will be few and much of the man's life and background will be from word of mouth or personal knowledge of him. I also expect that it is verifiable when not looked at by homophobes. Until the references are at least double checked and a more thorough investigation into the content is undertaken then the article should remain. When you all get back from burning books with your fellow nazi luddites you should perhaps consider this... and perhaps also get jobs, lives, girlfriends, laid, etc.</li>

<p>P.S. You guys suck ass and so does wikipedia... and stop calling me a 'defender'... we're not playing D&amp;G at your place jackass.

<li><b>Comment</b> Some comments above claim that the information in the article is verifiable.

Where are the third-party sources that back up the various claims in the article?

<li><b>Keep</b> because this is a perfectly acceptable article for a (Jewish) school of which there are thousands (of non-Jewish) similar ones listed on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>- I disagree entirely. If by your above argument you mean that we should have either no or extremely lax standards that we should hold articles containing information, that defeats the purpose of having a level of encyclopedicness to the project. If having a standard, however, means that some articles aren't up to it, perhaps that implies that the subject is not appropriate for this encyclopedic project. To address the second issue, notability of a subject can indeed vary from group to group, and please take notice that in the essay on <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, the fundamental policy is cited that one must have been the subject of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">independant verifiable scrutiny</a>, which this subject cannot claim- its verifiable source (the NCES information) mentions it only in passing and cannot be claimed to be solely a study on this subject alone. I agree with you that many of the subjects in the Schools category have a shaky claim to inclusion. If you feel this is the case then I encourage you to go through the proper processes and nominate the questionable articles for deletion. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 14:25, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I must disagree on strong terms with most of what you say. If you hold the opinion that this article is being included while inappropriate less-notable subject are not, then I remind you that the AFD process is every bit as available to those other subjects as it is to this one. Further, I would like to remind you, after reading your accusations of this article being "left in the hands of deletionists who will vote to delete anything with which they are unfamiliar or uninterested", and how this is "deletecruft", of one of the Wikipedia guidelines regarding <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> of editors who disagree, and additionally the possibility that people who disagree with you might merely have different standards for what they perceive to be a subject about which an encyclopedic article may be written. There is a gulf of difference in the idea that there's some secret brotherhood of deletionists out to get all of the valuable articles, and the idea that a large portion of the editor community does not thing that a primary school with no claim to notability is not appropriate material for a Wikipedia article (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, namely "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.) --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 17:49, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I guess I have to remind you yet again to assume good faith. Your constant assumption of bad faith and policy violation on the part of the authors of school related articles is troublesome, and frankly, you should know better. It is a patent assumption of bad faith to categorically state the author of an article about this school is somehow "...a business announcing the availability of services..." Since I am fairly certain that you are not suggesting that the school itself somehow wrote the article, I can only guess that you are talking about its' author. Please provide evidence that the author is "advertising" on behalf of the school, rather than simply creating an article about a school which is like THOUSANDS of others to be found on wikipedia. Unless you have such evidence, this accusation is offensive and uncivil.

<li>The intent of the author isn't really in question.

<p>This list is entirely subjective and does not define what "notable" means in this context. In fact, it <i>can't</i> define what notable means. The list is essentially an attempt to group together the best 20 or so orchestras in the world, but this simply cannot be done without defined parameters, and any attempt to group them together would be original research, or at least personal opinion. So, perhaps this page could be moved to "list of Orchestras", but there is already a category in existence for this very reason ("Category:Orchestras") <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 15:02, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Another comment</b>Given the recent revalation of the above mentioned article, I'm going to go ahead and prod it because I cannot foresee any objections, and I doubt that a consensus will be reached because of the lack of activity.

<dd>Mark, could you expand on your comment about "this is not how it works" a bit? The article is wholly without sources, provides opinions on how to play the game ("good return on investment"), and lacks both context (which is fixable) and relevance (it's too specific). The latter isn't policy, but our First Pillar seems to apply here. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 16:11, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What I meant was, nobody seemed to have bothered making the comments you've just made. The overwhelming impression I've received has been, "Whether I like this article or not, my interpretation of policy says it needs to go", which is (as you know) Not How Wikipedia Works. You're right that the article is unsourced; I ought to rephrase my original statement. I've <i>no objection</i> to a <i>sourced</i> article on this subject.

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>, and thus <b>keep</b>. While the claims of not meeting WP:BIO are true enough on their face, WP:BIO itself is a only a guideline - even if it is to be used, a weak but real argument can be made for meeting it. The fact that this AFD was not closed after five days (indeed, it is now over ten) indicates that this is a tough decision, and I'm going to lean towards no consensus/keep. Keeping the page around does no harm, and while not as notable a person as Paris Hilton, it does seem likely that someone may come to Wikipedia one day looking for information about this person. The information is verifiable, it is not original research, and it adheres to a nuetral point of view. Were any of those three even remotely in doubt, a stronger case could be made for deletion, but the page as it exists seems to violate none of these. (P.S. The existence of suspicious sockpuppety "Keep" voters duly noted). <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 05:35, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Upon primary perusal, this entry seemed to be more appropriate for UCLAwiki (if such a thing exists). And after rereading the specifics of WP:BIO, he doesn't quite seem to fit any of the standards. However, the way the standards are written, activists would only fit into the "politics" category, which exclude local activists (many of whom already have Wikipedia articles) and others whose influence never extended beyond their own communities. For example, I'd hate to see my article on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Zinzun_562d.html" title="Michael Zinzun">Michael Zinzun</a>, who never held any office at all, deleted just because he was only active in Los Angeles. These types of figures seldom receive the media coverage they deserve, especially when they are more <i>eminences grises</i>, like Montserrat was, than politicians. The way the standards are written, they favor the "dominant history" and even worse, pop icons who have no lasting influence on society, just because they have a "cult following".

I think that it is appropriate to leave the article. More importantly, I think that articles like this, and the process that admins use to get rid of articles is shortsighted and unfair. This article may be short and limited in scope, but after reviewing the notability standards, I think it just squeaks by.

<li><b>Comment</b> both of the articles you've mentioned would constitute a "trivial mention" per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, the other source was a blog by the mayor he worked for, which isn't a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> in my estimation and is also trivial. Also, he does not have 2 buildings named after him. He has one building named after him and one "dedicated" to him. Regardless, having a building named after you does not satisfy <i>any</i> of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would disagree with you on the first and second point because I think from all the links provided here (and what I've found looking around) all the mentions of Mr. Monserratt would be clasified as trivial. The newpaper articles mention him in passing or are obituary in nature. I don't see anything that establishes that he has achieved renown for newsworthy events. As for the Google Test/Verifiability... these are so called "Alternate tests" that have not gained any community consensus. Personally I don't think they have any value at all (the Google Test in particular is a rather poor marker of "notability") and as such are not a good indicator of "notabilty" or lack thereof.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

The subject of this biographical entry certainly received press coverage during his lifetime, but would have received much more had his personal mission and style not been to work behind the scenes supporting and influencing others. It would be a shame to exclude him because he wasn't a publicity hound. Measured in terms of his impact on others and, through them, on politics and the quality of life in Los Angeles and elsewhere in California, Monserratt's impact was enormous. No doubt future Wikipedia entries relating to the people he worked with and inspired will mention Monserratt's role in their lives, and it would be helpful to be able to cross-reference those entries with this one.--<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Cocreatordude (<a href="../../../c/o/c/User_talk%7ECocreatordude_f536.html" title="User talk:Cocreatordude">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cocreatordude_8095.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cocreatordude">contribs</a>).</small> 09:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Furthermore, the <s>inter</s>national tour should credit thier notability alone, espically considering it was not as a supporting band.-<span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: normal"><a href="../../../%28/c/h/User%7E%28chubbstar%29.html" title="User:(chubbstar)"><font style="border: solid 1px orange; background-color:#991199" color="white">(chubbstar)</font></a></span> <sup><small>— <a href="../../../%28/c/h/User_talk%7E%28chubbstar%29.html" title="User talk:(chubbstar)"><font color="#FF4F00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_%28chubbstar%29_19f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/(chubbstar)"><font color="#FF4F00">contrib</font></a> | <font color="#CD00CD">16:58, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</font></small></sup></li>

In addition, the article doesn't even assert the notability that their own web site does, and of the first 30 hits from Parssssel's (BTW, nice to see you again) search, more than half are unrelated to the band. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 16:39, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Lismore is a well established band that deserves a page on an encyclopedia. Besides, even though they have 619 listeners on Last.fm, it might be possible that the target market of the website does not include people that enjoy that specific genre considering electronic music has never really gotten a high level of interest on last.fm, for the exception of a few very popular bands. In addition, take <a href="../../../w/y/n/Wynton_Marsalis_e25e.html" title="Wynton Marsalis">Wynton Marsalis</a> for an example, his quartet only has 759 listeners on last.fm and yet he holds a page on this encyclopedia site.

<p>I haven't been involved with the site since 1999! <i>Hello!</i> Look at the merits of the argument before jumping to conclusions! The Doctor Who Web Guide ranks it as the <a href="http://www.doctorwhowebguide.net/rankings.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.doctorwhowebguide.net/rankings.shtml" rel="nofollow">11th most popular site</a> amongst DW fans and earned a 'Web Guide Gold' honor. As far as daily web hits go, we could ask Robert Smith? for some data. Any site where several thousand collaborators contribute to create an original work is noteworthy in itself. To say it's just a "fan" site would be comparing it to a site where at most 30 people have contributed. Also, there is no more comprehensive DW review site on the Internet. Is this not above and beyond the normal 'fan site'? As for notability: <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mack_Swain_e45e.html" title="Mack Swain">Mack Swain</a> is not a name that most people recognize, yet there's his WP site. The same argument can be made for articles on <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Henry_Brackenridge_b935.html" title="Hugh Henry Brackenridge">Hugh Henry Brackenridge</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geodesic.html" title="Geodesic">geodesic</a>, or even <a href="../../../p/h/o/Pho.html" title="Pho">pho</a>.

<p><b>Comment:</b> proteus71, if you can show that this website is worthwhile to have an article, I would say keep it, however, I can not find any other websites which are not related to Doctor Who that mention this one. As for your suggestion that the <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outpost_Gallifrey_f1f8.html" title="Outpost Gallifrey">Outpost Gallifrey</a> article also be deleted, you are missing what makes Outpost Gallifrey notable. Outpost Gallifrey has been mentioned in independent sources that are not centered on Doctor Who. Show us where the Doctor Who Ratings Guide has been mentioned outside of Whovian fandom, and it may be kept. Until then, I won't speak for or against deletion.</p>
<p>As an aside, I like Doctor Who, and love the 9th Doctor. - <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELady_Aleena_2b68.html" title="User:Lady Aleena">LA</a> @ 18:41, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Lady Aleena. The fact is from what the article shows right now: it's not notable. I definately know that the Guide has thousands of reviews since I myself have posted nearly every review link to the corresponding episode, audio or book.. And that one <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_-_The_Ultimate_Adventure_b3b1.html" title="Doctor Who - The Ultimate Adventure">stage-play</a>...</dd>
<dd>Though, a few or couple I've noticed are the same as posted on <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outpost_Gallifrey_f1f8.html" title="Outpost Gallifrey">Outpost Gallifrey</a>'s review section (which is pretty understandable as to why however: the reviewers submitted to both fan-sites). All in all, it still lacks notability as forementioned above and rather randomly, I say, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geodesic.html" title="Geodesic">geodesic</a> is notable as your other examples..</dd>

However, we don't believe in contact notability, as the spouse of a notable person is not thereby notability (and the spouse of a notable person is much more intimately connected to that person and more likely to be significant to them, than a building is to the current use of it. So the argument that being in the Presidio generates notability for the school is wrong. It does mean that we could put a sentence into the article on the Presidio about a high school being opened there. The other potential claim to notability I saw was being an "independent" school. I'm not certain what that means in California. I take it to mean that it is structurally and financially independent of the local school district - which means that the school is effectively a private company, generating spamvertisement concerns. Those concerns offset any reason for keeping it generated by being independent. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 01:54, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article itself claims that <a href="../../../v/o/o/Voon.html" title="Voon">Voon</a> was invented in June 2006. The only references it cites are vanity web pages such as the obviously bogus <a href="http://www.v00n.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.v00n.com" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> which was registered on 21 July 2006. Perhaps Voon is well-known to an Aussie: some of the commenters above claim this, but their claims don't match the article. The article specifically claims that someone (evidently the author) invented the drink at a party last month. As the article stands, it is original research, vanity, made up one day, and non-notable. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Balsam_1bd3.html" title="User:Derek Balsam">Derek Balsam</a> 13:47, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The google test <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=voon" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=voon" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> reveals no usage of the word "voon" as an alcoholic beverage. Google turns up results for the surname "Voon", for the Dutch word "voon", for an unrelated slang term in the Urban Dictionary, etc.. A google search for "voon australia", "voon drink", and "voon alcohol" are similarly fruitless. Note that I'm not claiming "voon" does not exist. I have no idea if it does or doesn't. What I'm saying is, as a neutral reader of Wikipedia with no prior knowledge of any "voon", I would have to assume from an NPOV that the article as written was a bogus, vanity article. The reason I nominated the article for deletion is that there is no evidence given in the article that it does exist, and no independent evidence of any kind anywhere, including google, that it really exists.<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Balsam_1bd3.html" title="User:Derek Balsam">Derek Balsam</a> 02:59, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The google test, whilst one metric of a subject's notability, is not in and of itself a reliable test of anything other than google's ability to index the web. How many web pages does something need in order to be verifiable? Voon is falsifiable, in the sense that you can mix it yourself and compare your experience with the subject matter of the article; it is also obviously not merely something 'made up in school one day', as the number of people posting here would tend to indicate. Perhaps the article needs work to reflect the considerable exposure that those voting here have to this beverage, but I would suggest that deleting this article due to the non-notability of its subject is akin to slicing off your nose because googling 'derek balsam's nose' would spite your face. -Sidless 05:16, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> You misunderstand - it's not notability that's at issue here. It's that the article constitutes clear original research and verifiability problems. Simply find good sources and rewrite the article and the debate will be finished with the article staying. Remember that Wikipedia is not about facts, it's about verifiable information. If there are no sources, and if it is impossible to find sources to document its existence, then this article should go. It can be easily rewritten once it becomes notable enough to be written about in an alcoholic beverages magazine or documented in a news program. But it must first be documented. Additionally, and this has nothing to do with AFD in my opinion but more with cleanup, there are some NPOV problems. Statements like, "tastes better than the sum of its parts", and introduced to a "skeptical world" have no place in an encylopedia. I'll remove those now as part of cleanup, but it still doesn't pass the verifiability test. 129.61.46.16 13:45, 28 July 2006 (UTC)Josh</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but rename (the use of quotes and parens are non-standard) and mark for clean-up. This controversy is very real and well-documented among bee-researchers. See, for example, the extensive discussion and the multitude of articles referenced in the <a href="http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/cgi-bin/wa?S1=bee-l" class="external text" title="http://listserv.albany.edu:8080/cgi-bin/wa?S1=bee-l" rel="nofollow">BEE-L archives</a> on this topic. While I believe the presentation of facts in this article are one-sided and do not reflect the current scientific consensus of bee researchers, none of the facts presented in the page qualify as original research because they have been previously published in at least one peer-reviewed journal. In fact as articles go, this is already better referenced than most Wikipedia pages. The author several times cited texts and articles relevant to this controversy. The editorial comments in the page should be edited out but that's a clean-up problem, not a deletion problem.<br />
It is not a copyright violation because the person who posted it is the same person who made the post in the discussion list. Authors have free rights to rerelease their own writings into GFDL.

<li>The assertion that this is not a copyright violation because it is the same person is not built on any solid foundation. We don't have a statement from either person even claiming that they are the same, let alone confirmation of that.

<li>I'm sorry, I should have laid out my evidence more clearly. 1) The user's chosen name (Rosinbio) is identical with the email account prefix which was used to make that particular post to the discussion forum. 2) The user's chosen name the same as the email prefix commonly used by Ruth Rosin on BEE-L discussions and other bee-research related forums (where a person with the same signature has made very similar arguments, presented similar evidence and uses the same tone and style of language). 3) This same text was largely cut-and-pasted into <a href="../../../b/e/e/Talk%7EBee_learning_and_communication_18b0.html" title="Talk:Bee learning and communication">Talk:Bee learning and communication</a> but with a header and some minor changes which are again consistent with this person's observed pattern of edits when reusing material across other discussion fora. I agree that it would be helpful if the user would return and explicitly confirm her identity and the rerelease of this content under GFDL and have asked her to do so but in the meantime, I think the circumstantial evidence is quite strong that this is more likely to be the same person than not. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 13:05, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>yeah bro i removed the Prod because it said "remove this if you don't think this is right" or something to that effect. but yeah anyway I hope this doesn't get deleted because it was fun to write, doesn't hurt anyone, and personally I think WB:WEB's criteria for notability are bogus and over-exclusive.

<dd>Just to add this even though the point of the deletion is not for factual reasons; I read that UNHCR page and it seems the poster above is correct, Ruchiraw what you claim to be UNHCR statments on these attacks are taken from a letter sent to the UNHCR by the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the Centre for Human Rights, i.e. these are just the claims of one party to the conflict, the GoSL, and not any sort of endorsment by the UNHCR that these claims are factual nor can they be considered to be NPOV.</dd>

<dd>I don't want to get into the details of the items listed here, we can discuss the facts on the 'notable attacks' page if this is settled. The point of this delete request is that this article is redundant, as for copyright you are probably correct if that is public domain then so be it, that was not my main point for requesting a delete anyway. As for the items themselves, as a party to the conflict, we cannot accept the GoSL’s statements as fact any more nor any less than we can accept statements from the LTTE without proof from non-interested third parties. Thus you are being quite disingenuous by trying to pass off the list of attacks as something endorsed and accepted by the UNHCR, when it was just a letter sent to them by the GoSL. So no one is accusing the UNHCR of posting lies, since it is clearly stated that they are only posting a copy of a letter sent to them, this should not be passed off as something that it is not.--<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealstarslayer_f0b8.html" title="User:Realstarslayer">Realstarslayer</a> 05:04, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In any case it contains a lot of information that is not included in the notable attacks page which I think is worth preserving.<br />
It could be argued that both pages be merged with each other / with the <a href="../../../l/t/t/LTTE_021c.html" title="LTTE">LTTE</a> page, but that will make it unwieldy and quite hard to navigate.<br />
I also don't think it can be labeled POV since most information is from the UNHCR website and from BBC, CNN etc. Besides POV is not a normal reason for nomination for deletion. --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4">snowolfd4</a> 09:03, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think it may be best to have just one article List of attacks attributed to the LTTE, with the sections <i>Attacks on civilian targets</i> and <i>Attacks on military targets</i>, with each divided into sections listing attacks <i>proved</i> to have been by the LTTE and attacks only <i>attributed</i> to the LTTE with no conclusive proof. This will avoid issues with verifiability, and also the problem that if the word "terrorist" is included in the title the article will not be NPOV. -- <a href="../../../p/o/n/User%7EPonnampalam_c484.html" title="User:Ponnampalam">Ponnampalam</a> 12:51, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just because the SL Government says so doesn't mean it happened. The credibility of this document is minimal if its coming from the SL Government (government of a failed state, with a dysfunctional democracy, abhorent human rights record etc. etc..) If there is citation from Amnesty for a particular incident then it has weight.. otherwise it doesn't mean that it didn't happen but it is just that the source is not credible. If the SL government's fairy tales are to be believed, then we might as well add items from LTTE peace secretariat as well. Trincomanb 04:02, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sri Lanka has the second highest number of disappearances after Iraq.. this includes a lot of Sinhalese missing since the JVP insurrection which some have comfortably forgotten. Democracy for who, everyone or just Sinhala Budhists&#160;? The fact of the matter is that world has threatened to impose sanctions on both parties and very soon send some of those that give you orders to the criminal court for war crimes. LTTE's proxy the TNA is by far the most popular party in the North-East. Why would you want to participate in flawed, decaying democracy such as Sri Lanka&#160;? There maybe many citations of events that occured, but you are using that to sneak in govt. fairy tales as well, thinking the rest of us dim enough not to notice it. Reputable sources are careful not point the finger without proof and most of the incidents have not been proven to be comitted by the LTTE. Wikipedia is not a place to speculate.

Which members of the Sri Lankan government are wanted by Interpol. I believe Japan is also contemplating banning the LTTE. The US has also promised substantial military help to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is a world recognised government. The governments of 1.5 billion people have benned LTTE as a terrorsit group. Where is the proof Al Quaeda committed teh Twin Tower bombigs. Perhaps you deny that as well. Sri Lanka is a vibrant democracy. As I mention again it is the responsibility of the government to find out who is massacring its civilians. <a href="../../../r/u/c/User%7ERuchiraw_fe8e.html" title="User:Ruchiraw">Ruchiraw</a> 22:30, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Ruchiraw, I think you stated it quite well: <i>There is no point to include hundreds of minor terrorist attacks and thousands of minor military attacks into this page</i>. This is why I started the deletion request for this page, the notable attacks page is more than enough to cover the main attacks and we can discuss any others that you feel should be included and do so when a consensus is reached, otherwise we are going to have a myriad of pages for all sorts of things. Should we start a page for all GoSL human rights violations? The Human Rights Commission of SL just recently decided to abandoned 2000 cases because of pressure from the president, in their own words; further investigation would require the government to pay out compensation <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/statements/mainfile.php/2006statements/646/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ahrchk.net/statements/mainfile.php/2006statements/646/" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>? So should we start a page and list each one of those 2,000 cases? And that is 2,000 out of more than 16,000 cases still pending? So should we have an entry for each one of those 16,000 cases?--<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealstarslayer_f0b8.html" title="User:Realstarslayer">Realstarslayer</a> 02:57, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Then they compleately took off that part from the main LTTE page and opened up a new page to avoid readers to see these attacks. I dont think that this page should be deleted and I vote to keep it.

<dd>The fact is that this article is a POVFork and so should be deleted, that is all (BTW you should read the discussion before going back to that 'its listed by the UNHCR' stuff, since it has been clearly shown that it was nothing more than a letter sent to the UNHCR by the GoSL) .--<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealstarslayer_f0b8.html" title="User:Realstarslayer">Realstarslayer</a> 03:36, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is listed In MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Basethat LTTE is a terrorist Group and its listed that the attacks below was carried out by the LTTE in UNHCHR UNHCHR.So I dont see any problem in listing these as "notable attacks" by LTTE.As a matter of fact we are all trying to give the true picture to the world not mislead them.----RavenS 03:22, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>RavenS, I'm really not sure what you are going on about, I did not make any comment as to the collective intelligence of the UNHCR. Some interested parties were trying to pass off that list as having been compiled by the UNHCR when it wasn't. It is <b>only</b> a letter sent to the UNHCR by the GoSL and thus not a valid citation for these attacks, as they are one of the parties to the ethnic conflict and so cannot be considered as an independent non interested third party. Those are just the facts no matter how much you may wish it otherwise. --<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealstarslayer_f0b8.html" title="User:Realstarslayer">Realstarslayer</a> 15:47, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, if the only <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> verification is catholicrevolution.org above, then clearly (to me) this article fails WP:V.63.197.134.218</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, whilst the group is small, it 'is' functional and the website has changed; if only being, chopped down. If the entry is being deleted due the group not being functional, I would like to see varifiable evidance of this?</li>
</ul>
<p>The entry is valid due to context to <a href="../../../z/e/e/Zeena_Schreck_b4a8.html" title="Zeena Schreck">Zeena Schreck</a> and her place in the history of the western left hand path occult movement. Further, as her husbands Nikolas Scherck book 'Demons of the Flesh' is proving to be a seminal work within its field and the nature of their split from Temple of Set on theological and philosophical grounds, the entry is relevent to the history and development of the western occult world.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- granted Zeena and Nikolas are significant footnotes to developments of the western occult world, I don't see any evidence that this organization is. It certainly warrants a paragraph or two in an article on Zeena and/or Nikolas, but given the lack of WP:V and the lack of significance of the organization itself, if there's any organization to be found 2-3 years after its creation, I vote for Delete. 207.11.78.94</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>Again can you give any evidence, that the orgaisation is not? The website has changed, and there is communication avalible, though only through postal contact-If one sends return postage, one does get a reply. However, if lack of communication through email or a small website constitutes an organisation being non-existance, then yes it should be deleated. Though if Wikipeda is a medium for information gathering, then it a valid entry. Unless one happens to have prejudice towards the Storm and the Schrecks, which would not be a neutral opinion.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It seems to be at least as notable and verifiable as the World Intelligence Network. <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 18:55, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Rather than the time to the event, I suggest concentrating on the "nothing can be said about them that is verifiable and not original research". Other than the fact that it's the 150th anniversary, what other sourced information can be added at this point? Plans? Controversies? Published speculation?

<p>The result was <b>delete</b> as original research. This is a tough one, and I'm frankly not completely comfortable closing it at all. But if I shy away from the tough decisions, then I'm not very useful as an admin. If you treat this AfD as a vote, it is clearly no consensus or keep: discounting participants with less than 100 edits, I see nearly twice the number of editors advocating keep vs. delete. I'm making that clear up front so that when this is inevitably brought to deletion review, no one will accuse me of trying to play games with numbers. The problem is that those advocating keep — with the exception of a single commenter, who cited a comment on jumptheshark.com — are not at all responsive to the central claim. Summarizing broadly (and I apologize in advance to anyone who feels I am unfairly paraphrasing their words), three voters say that the articles should stay because they are interesting. Seven say that they have a personal belief that the article is accurate and the term is "well known" or in wide use, but do not provide any verifiable source. One keep comment is a complete nonsequiteur.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">deletion guidelines for administrators</a> say:</p>
<pre>
Note also that the three key policies, which warrant that articles and information be verifiable, 
avoid being original research, and be written from a neutral point of view are held to be non-negotiable 
and cannot be superseded by any other guidelines or by editors' consensus. A closing admin must
determine whether any article violates such policies, and where it is impossible that an article on any topic
can exist without breaching these three policies, such policies must again be respected above other opinions.
</pre>
<p>Given that, I am deleting this article because the arguments that it is original research are persuasive. As written, the article is original research along two axes: first, it is original research in the sense that no source is cited that demonstrates that the term was established in common usage outside of Wikipedia. It is also original research in terms of the long list of examples (by which I mean, if Roger Ebert says "Madeleine Kahn disappearing in the <i>Cosby</i> show is an example of "Chuck Cunningham Syndrome", that is not original research, but when a Wikipedia editor makes the same inference, it is.) <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 00:42, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>No, you haven't. You've posted a link to someone asking whether a character was "a victim of Chuck Cunningham syndrome". The question doesn't explain what "Chuck Cunningham syndrome" actually is in that context. There's no way to know that it is the syndrome described in this article, and it <i>certainly</i> doesn't constitute a source to support the content of this article. Five days ago, I asked for a source that (a) describes what Chuck Cunningham syndrome is in detail and (b) isn't derived from this Wikipedia article. No-one has yet cited any such source.

<li>Yes, but after giving it some thought, I've decided that a new title that refers to "continuity issues" is just as much a cruftmagnet and a <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> violation, because what constitutes a continuity error is often in the eye of the beholder and a matter of personal opinion. If a new article was to be created that revolved around a similar concept to this one, it would have to find a way to be very specific about what it is supposed to be a list of, and would have to be cited and sourced. Either way, renaming this article solves nothing because the text would still be inherently POV and OR. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:46, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you go back deep in Wikipediatrix's contribs, you'll find she was actually a major contributor to the article at one point (early June of this year, about), as well as to all these other articles she's waging a <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">jihad</a> against lately. It seems that with her usual complete lack of tact, she went and deleted whole hog sections without first trying to discuss it on the talk page. This upset people, and they reverted, and she reverted back until she just got tired of it, it seems.
<p>So, obviously, since the other editors couldn't see what a genius she was, the article needs to be deleted. Clearly within the deletion criteria. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 21:44, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That appears to be entirely false. I've been through the history of this article, and I find exactly one contribution from <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">User:Wikipediatrix</a> in June 2006 — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome&amp;diff=61314458&amp;oldid=61313338" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome&amp;diff=61314458&amp;oldid=61313338" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, making the very assertion that this article is original research that xe is making in this deletion nomination, followed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61419033" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61419033" rel="nofollow">this attempt to discuss the matter on the talk page</a>. Those belie any assertion that xe didn't try to discuss this first. Xyr removal of unsourced material and repeated requests for sources followed that, the next month.

<li>First, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome&amp;offset=20060718085852&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome&amp;offset=20060718085852&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">this section of the history</a>; I meant July 2006 (sorry). There's quite a bit of editing there.</li>
<li>Yes, I do insist on sources and have planted {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitation_needed_0ed6.html" title="Template:Citation needed">citation needed</a>}} on quite a few pages that I otherwise have nothing to do with myself (see <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Diamond_99db.html" title="Neil Diamond">Neil Diamond</a>). I also believe that with doing so comes a need for <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civility</a> (which you have demonstrated quite amply here and elsewhere, I should add). That means you bring up things like this on talk pages (as I did <a href="../../../n/e/i/Talk%7ENeil_Diamond_896a.html#POV-statement" title="Talk:Neil Diamond">with the Neil Diamond article</a>). It's part of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a>.</li>
<li>Wikipediatrix's discussions on the CCS talk page go from what's qualified for inclusion to whether the name is justified (both legitimate questions IMO) and generally seem to favor keeping the article. BlueMoose then more or less dares her to nominate the article for deletion and, without even responding on the talk page, she calls his bluff (at least with the subpages like Lazarus Cunningham, Reverse Cunningham and then here. I think it merited more discussion on the talk page as to why deletion, a rather drastic step IMO, was necessary for an article that had been on Wikipedia for longer than Wikipediatrix herself, and the development of some <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a> as to that step.</li>
<li>As it is, taking it here strikes me more as akin to responding to a losing chess position by knocking all the pieces off the board. Not behavior we should encourage. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 03:55, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>So it needs to be cleaned up quite a bit and have all the entries sourced.

<li>Hear hear. Ninety-nine percent of Wikipediatrix's edits are either planting {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">citation needed</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} on pages, removing unsourced material and similar things which are a lot easier to do than create original content (or, God forbid, look up sources herself and put them in the article), but tend to start edit wars (and when she does bother to create an article, it's something like Dessarae Bradford whose sources themselves do not always support the assertions made in the article and are of dubious notability (I doubt it will survive its pending deletion vote).

<li>I do and I will insist on sources when the lists I'd like to see in support of the Continuity issues with characters in episodic media article, when it exists. But Wikipediatrix seems to believe that attempting to maintain standards <i>even with strict sourcing requirements enforced</i> will be impossible. I know from experience that it is not. It will be a lot of work for some people willing to put it on their watchlists. But it is not impossible.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> - Well, "Chuck Cunningham syndrome" does seem to be in relatively moderate usage around the interwebternet at least. Its certainly more used than "Fonzie syndrome", though the article on CC syndrome certainly appear to almost entirely original research and cites no reliable sources.

<li>I have left a message on the original creator's blog (he hasn't edited here in five months) asking where he got the term from. If it isn't a reliable source then there's no doubt the name isn't encyclopedic (Which of course sets up a conundrum: Suppose we rename it yet the other links keep using the term.

<dd>OK. After reading through the deletion discussions on the various subpages, and this, I looked at the history. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedfarmer_d952.html" title="User:Redfarmer">redfarmer</a> created the page back on December 23, 2004; obviously we should ask him where he heard this term. I doubt that will elicit a reply as he has not edited since last November.
<p>However, in another sense it doesn't really matter anymore. Standards here were a little more loosely enforced back then (believe me). If he did indeed use Wikipedia to create reality and seed his own term, there is nothing we can do about it over a year and a half later. Whether it came from here or not, it's now out there on Google and is part of the reality Wikipedia must reflect. Renaming this article cannot put that particular genie back in the bottle. We can only all agree to be that much more careful and diligent in the future.</p>
<p>I therefore submit that this whole debate in this subsection is moot.</p>

But then it only finds 12 uses at all, most of them in the last year. The Cunningham disappearance itself rates an entire section in <i>What Were They Thinking?: The 100 Dumbest Events In Television History</i> (2004) -- thus notable in the context of <i>Happy Days</i> -- but not the term. It may be TV writer jargon as well as online TV fan jargon, but probably not. I don't think the article as it's constituted is notable. A restructured article, however, might be -- I think this is more interesting than Articles for deletion/List of bands named after food listcruft.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article itself, the main definition and the reference to Chuck Cunningham I believe should stay, however the page needs significant modifications. It is a pop-culture neologism that does seem to be used in real life, but that real life usage has a sketchy and nebulous definition, and this article should reflect that. What should definitely be deleted is the long list of other shows, all of which can easily be rolled into the specific articles on those shows. There is no meaningful reason why these various character departures are grouped in this way, and this grouping and the inherent decisions about inclusion <i>is</i> original research. Anyway many entries in the list seem to break some aspect of the criteria of the syndrome as described by the article (eg the character's departure <i>is</i> briefly mentioned later). Of course that criteria is sketchy because the entire concept cannot be pegged to an concise external real-life definition, so this article cannot contain the multi-examples. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 08:07, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. If these syndrome articles don't get deleted (and they should), I propose we remove the long unnecessary lists of opinionated/subjective examples from each of them, and add some sort of infobox that notes "This is NOT a list" or some such language, hopefully discouraging other editors from turning it back into the cruftmagnet <b>"how many more examples can you think of?"</b> parlor game. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 14:13, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Although it's been asserted by many that I created my own reality on Wikipedia, I did not. In the early television forums on the Internet, frequently questions would be asked like, "What happened to the youngest daughter from <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Matters_da6e.html" title="Family Matters">Family Matters</a>" or some such question. The short answer was: <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome_4787.html" title="Chuck Cunningham syndrome">Chuck Cunningham syndrome</a>. I will be the first to admit that this term hasn't caught on as well as <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumping_the_shark.html" title="Jumping the shark">jumping the shark</a>. However, if you look at the early versions of the entry that I edited, they did refer to it as a slang term. I see that since I've become inactive on Wiki, the entry has blossomed into a virtual clone of the jump the shark article.

If you have heard of the syndrome outside of Wikipedia, you should be able to cite sources. <b>Please cite sources.</b> No sources have yet been cited for this syndrome, despite all the editors who are arguing that this is not original research being asked several times to cite some. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:25, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's original research because there's no evidence that the notion of this syndrome exists independently of Wikipedia, given that the only sources that can be found that discuss it all refer back to this article as <i>their</i> source. There's no evidence that this wasn't simply made up in Wikipedia. The creator has been asked to cite sources, but as yet all that we have are assertions and <i>no sources</i> to give them foundation. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:25, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Having the list of shows (where someone - a WP editor - makes a personal decision about what might or might not be a case of CCS) is also original research. I'm happy to have an article if an external source exists and can be referenced.

<li>If you saw them both, then why did you write "<i>there's no evidence that this wasn't simply made up in Wikipedia</i>" when it so clearly wasn't? They are both sources.

And the 1997 one is fairly descriptive - "this character has disappeared and the rest of them are acting like he didn't exist" "that's called Chuck Cunningham Syndrome, after the character in Happy Days".

<li><b>Keep</b> Not to defend or glorify binge drinking, but it is my contention that this article is being singled out because of a gray area in wikipedia's rules and intentions. I agree that the scholarly literature of this variation of speed quarters is limited, but perhaps this is not the game's fault, but rather a reflection on the lack of scholarly literature about college drinking games in general. Now, this dearth of literature should not be taken as evidence that the game does not exist, it should be balanced against the fact that scholarly literature tends to overlook "soft" subjects such as drinking games.
<p>To clarify, a quick look at many other drinking games shows a similar lack of citations (Mr. Three, Land Mine, One Fat Hen, Captain Paf, and GreenMonster, among others). However, does this mean that they are not played by the general public? Does it mean that these games do not have an impact on many people's lives? Does it mean that these games do not exist? Of course not. However, if wikipedia maintains its reliance on scholarly materials these postings would need to be deleted as well, which would be counter to the mission of wikipedia, which from what I interpret it to be, is to extend all types of knowledge and information to the world.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There was a concerted effort back in May to clear these out. Pretty much every one we had was nominated for deletion, and most were deleted. Only a handful, which could be clearly verified as common and widely documented, were kept. Even though external sources may not have been added to the articles, they were referenced in the AFD's for the ones that were kept.

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is the most legitimate argument against this article. Mangojuice is correct that a Google Search for “Rage Cage” brings up many similarly-named topics unrelated to this drinking game. It’s worth noting that the game is often simply called “Speed Quarters” – this is actually a predecessor that already exists in WP and results in numerous Google hits. Many of these hits describe the variant that this article calls “Rage Cage.” Of course, Google is not the final arbiter of notability.
<p>The game is widely played in a specific region. This regional predominance is correctly noted by Porqin. Whether or not this constitutes non-notability is up to the admins. As I live in the region where the game is relevant, I think it is notable. Wikipedia would lose much of its relevance to casual users if national and/or international recognition became a necessary condition for inclusion. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is a critical rule, but I believe it’s too ephemeral and subjective to be the sole factor for elimination here.</p>
<p>Please follow the link to an MLA formatting guide for a defense to the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> assertion.<a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/557/02/" class="external autonumber" title="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/557/02/" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> MLA dictates that “You do not need to give sources for familiar proverbs, well-known quotations or common knowledge. Remember, this is a rhetorical choice, based on audience” (scroll down to the “When a Citation is not Needed” header). I am admittedly new enough to Wikipedia that I don’t know the generally-accepted citation rules, but I presume that the rules that apply to academic papers would also suffice here. In browsing through other well-developed WP articles, it seems that the stardards are perhaps even more lenient than that.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> assertion is poorly informed. It’s understandable those unfamiliar with the topic would attribute their unfamiliarity to WP:NFT. However, the game is widely played, albeit in a regional setting. As with most informal competitions, and nearly all drinking games, its origins are impossible to document, but its proponents would assert that the game has undoubtedly existed for more than a decade.</p>
<p>This article needs cleanup, and contributions from outside of the San Francisco area are necessary. However, I don’t agree that it should be deleted. I do value this discussion, and look forward to your comments. S myrick 22:23, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is the only issue. The problem isn't that <i>"Google Search for “Rage Cage” brings up many similarly-named topics unrelated to this drinking game."</i> The problem is that Google fails to bring up results that <i>are</i> relevant. The only relevant result I can find is the Stanford "Beerlympics" piece cited in the article. So, it is not "common knowledge" that this is a widespread game, even in a local area. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> does apply, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> citations from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> are needed to establish that this is not just <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">something made up in school</a>. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 23:10, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply to Fan-1967</b> You are correct that reliable sources are needed to establish that this is "not just something made up in school." The <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> page that you linked to includes the following:
<dl>
<dd><i>The right way for things made up in school one day to get into Wikipedia:</i></dd>
<dd>School crazes, fads, and fashions can end up in Wikipedia. But only if someone first sits down and researches them, and publishes a book, an academic paper, or a magazine/journal article detailing that research. Then the subject becomes eligible for Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>For example, Catherine Gewertz has written an article, published in Education Week in 2001, about the school craze of freak dancing, which makes freak dancing a valid topic for a Wikipedia article. It's verifiable, the research has already been done (and peer reviewed and fact checked) outside of Wikipedia, and the world at large already knows about the craze from the Education Week article.</dd>
<dd><i>What you should do:</i></dd>
<dd>Only succumb to the temptation to write Wikipedia articles about what was made up in school one day if you can and do cite sources. Reliable sources do not include people writing in web logs or posting pseudonymously on discussion forums.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This standard indicates that only a single fact-checked, published source is necessary for a subject's inclusion in Wikipedia - <i>even if</i> the subject was just something made up in school (which this subject is not). The Rage Cage article links to such a source (The Stanford Daily). So, I'm going to reframe the WP:NFT debate from "Is this something made up in school at some point?" to "Is the Stanford Daily a legitimate publication with acceptable fact-checking procedures?" If not, you're establishing a "legitimacy line" somewhere between the Stanford Daily and Education Week, and I will respectfully ask that you elucidate that line. But, as per the WP:NFT policy, that's the issue at hand. S myrick 00:30, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I wouldn't say there's a "legitimacy line" but clearly Stanford-related culture is going to receive a lot more attention in the Stanford Daily than it would in a clearly independent source like, say, the LA Times. That's not to say that the Stanford Daily article would mean nothing (although I couldn't load it), but it doesn't rise to the level of the freak dancing example; Education Week is a national magazine on education. What I'd look for is independence. I don't believe anyone could insert a mention of their favorite home-made drinking game into the New York Times, but I'm not sure if I believe that about a college newspaper... if that is the one and only source, I'm not inclined to trust it. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 01:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Full disclosure: this is my first editation, having created a username for the express purpose of commenting here. I can assure skeptics that I live across the country from Stanford, am not familiar with this article's author, and therefore am not a "sockpuppet." Regarding independent sources: I have seen "rage cage" referenced in print newspapers in my area. This presents a quandary, since though I am familiar with the game and have seen it referenced in sources independent from the Stanford Daily, these articles are not online and therefore are not available for quotation to support this site. I am therefore forced to reject this article per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Topics such as drinking games fall into a difficult middle ground-- though the subjects and terms themselves are often well-known across wide varieties of groups, they are only rarely referenced in print, and when referenced are published in papers or magazines which are localized by area (such as college campuses, which in many cases would fall prey to the independence requirement) or topic (such as city arts and entertainment papers, which are often not posted online). Such bias therefore precludes them from wiki inclusion, even if their widely acknowledged existence falls within the "spirit" of wikipedia. If it comes to a choice of spirit vs. rules, I vote spirit. I would keep this article based on my own experience and intiution that this topic deserves inclusion under the spirit of wikipedia, despite its arguable violation of one of its rules.Robkit 05:11, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree with you that the middle ground is difficult. But I have no problem excluding it in order to stick to the important principles. We have to abandon that middle ground to do a good job covering drinking games, (or, more importantly <a href="../../../m/e/m/WP%7EMEME_0b58.html" title="WP:MEME">internet memes</a>) but I think that signals an area we shouldn't be covering, rather than a reason to stretch the rules. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:31, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said, let me assert that “local” does not mean “non-notable.” This is especially true for articles that document culture, or cultural activities. In fact, the ability to document local culture is a particular strength of Wikipedia – Britannica can only document such things after they have been homogenized through widespread proliferation, which is of dubious value. I’ll let someone else claim that a drinking game can not constitute culture or a cultural activity – to which I will have to spend all day writing a 2000-word defense of the (correct) broad definition of culture. In other words, please don’t&#160;:) S myrick 17:38, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>This needs to be a bigger discussion</b> It seems like there’s an emerging theme among the “delete” proponents that drinking games don’t belong on Wikipedia at all – or perhaps that only the very most common warrant inclusion. The latter would be a difficult policy, as drinking games (even the most common) are non-centralized and subject to huge regional variation. To include drinking games at all is to include a diverse array of customs and variations.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Should drinking games be included at all?</i> Though that is a worthwhile discussion to have, it’s a discussion that should take place in a community forum, or <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Village Pump</a>, rather than on this AfD page. That discussion would hinge largely on interpretations of Wikipedia rules, as both sides have acknowledged that we are in a “gray area” or “middle ground.”</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Until that discussion takes place, however, I believe that we should revert to Wikipedia precedent. As it currently stands, <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drinking_games.html" title="Drinking games">drinking games</a> are a series in English Wikipedia, and separate entries exist for many dozens – perhaps hundreds – of games. I realize that the “delete” proponents would make the same deletion arguments for many those entries. However, that’s a discussion that should take place on a larger scale. Citing precedent, and for the sake of consistency and coherent policy, the Rage Cage entry should stand until a larger policy discussion can occur. S myrick 18:19, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> You write very well, and I certainly hope you decide to continue to contribute to Wikipedia, but let's face it, you're trying to argue that a drinking game at one college should be documented as a notable cultural activity. Do you have any idea how many universities there are? Guess what. They all have students who drink, and invent new ways to do it, and terms for how they do it.

<li><b>Review of Precedent</b> I appreciate the kind words - I've gained a lot of respect for Wikipedia's processes in this discussion. Of course, with those processes in mind I still believe that this article is valid. I've replied to Mangojuice's list of precedents on this debate's talk page with my own. Feel free to click over - but the short version is that there <i>was</i> a concerted effort in May 2006 to delete a number of drinking games (stemming from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Circle_of_Death_%28drinking_game%29_40db.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Circle of Death (drinking game)">this AfD</a>). 37 games were individually listed for deletion, of which 32 were kept, 4 were deleted, and 1 was redirected. I believe this is a strong - and recent - precedent. Many of the games that were kept were, I would contend, less notable than Rage Cage. Of course, you're welcome to go through and relist all of them, but that would probably violate <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>&#160;:) S myrick 21:25, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Being Real</b> One Fat Hen and Green Monster are two games that I believe to be less notable than Rage Cage that have no documentation. And no, stuff confined to one campus, even though rage cage is clearly not confined to one campus (I do not live at Stanford, and yet I play Rage Cage), can be notable. See "Full Moon on the Quad" for that precedent. And really, the hierarchy of notability should go something like Nation&gt;State&gt;City&gt;Campus&gt;Class&gt;House&gt;Group&gt;Person&gt;Not Existing At All.

<li><b>Comment</b> Counting google hits is a very different thing than looking at the actual results. Seems a lot of people in Phoenix are selling cars with plenty of trunk space. Or they're looking for a ride share and have or need trunk space. Paging through the results finds a huge number of irrelevant entries. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 20:05, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's why I used qualifiers like "art" and "music" in the search.

<li>You mean like <i>"Limited <b>trunk space</b>, ie: 2 bags per person. Open to <b>music</b> selection"</i>?

<li>No one ever claimed it was a hoax. A lot of the hits do not relate to this plae at all, and the ones that do seem to be simply listings ("appearing 8:00 Thursday the 5th at Trunk Space").

<li>The article contains <b>no verifiable sources</b> thus it fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. NPOV doesn't really relate to SPAM, although they can go hand in hand. Articles with NPOV can be SPAM, and articles with NPOV may not be SPAM. The defining characteristic of SPAM is that Wikipedia is being used to promote something, rather than document something. Lots of establishments and venues pass <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> because they're worthy of an encyclopaedia article, which this is not. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:08, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First off, you are <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming bad faith</a> by accusing me of writing the article to promote something.

<ul>
<li>This remains untrue. I've assumed nothing about you - I judged the article on it's own merits, and made some inferences from what was presented. As the article has <b>no references</b>, it fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and shows numerous characteristics of being spam, which I cautioned I was not certain of. But that's a usual inference from the fact that it appears to fail <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. To be perfectly frank, the ad hominem attacks here only further convince me that it's spam. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:21, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>You have, in fact, accused me of assuming bad faith and accused the nominator of making a bad faith nomination. Both of these are ad hominem attacks because they're arguments based upon the person making the argument, rather than the central issue of this discussion, whether some random art house is deserving of an article. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

Citing someone for <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith</a> is not in of itself <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">acting in bad faith</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> The edit war has been resolved for the time being, via <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html#Homosexuality" title="WP:RFPP"><b>semi-protection</b> of Homosexuality</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not convinced it's over, the anon seemed pretty agitated by the numerous repostings. It will probably crop up elsewhere at some point. The other issue, is no a summary doesn't violate copyright law. There are many examples of this. If your summary of a 100 page book, is itself 100 pages, that probably is a violation. But if its 10 pages, you're fine. I mean, just imagine an article in the New York Times, not being able to state what the summary of a book was. They do it all the time. On you point that it's a position paper, that's the point. That's why the article is "John Corvino" on Homosexuality, instead of "a bunch of people" on Homosexuality... Are you saying position papers, or dissertations, don't belong on wikipedia? <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 21:03, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That is an oversimplification of the issue. I honestly do not feel that I even need to read Corvino's essay after reading the summary (it's a pretty exhaustive explanation of his arguments). To me that says that the summary is using the "heart" of the work, and is encroaching upon Corvion's potential market. Additionally, I don't think the summary is commenting on Corvinos essay or using it as part of a larger work. It is merely a summary, and the purpose of the summary appears to be merely to convey Corvino's arguments to the reader. If you examine the four fair use considerations at <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a>, I think my concerns about the severity of the derivation are warranted. Secondly — a position paper is a text which advocates a particular position; that is exactly what <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> aims to prevent. A dissertation (in the academic sense) is necessarily <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Neither of these are permissible under current Wikipedia policy or guidelines. --<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">Ptkfgs</a> 21:19, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Everything is original research at some point. Relativity was original research when Einstein did it. That doesn't prevent us from having an article about it.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I had an employee with retinitis pigmentosa that was being overtaken by macular degeneration. Needless to say, she was losing her ability to see peripherally and centrally. Because of this program, I was able to keep her working for more than three years. This may not sound like a lot to us, but it was the difference between life and no life for her. This product was suggested to us by the Association for the Blind and was provided at no cost to us. Most of the blind and those looking for information on it, have heard about it by name. I would have no problem with linking it with other magnifyers, but it would be nice for them to get unbiased info for it on wikipedia as well as on product websites. The article does need work though.--<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDematt_b080.html" title="User:Dematt">Dematt</a> 02:41, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - So you are saying that the fact that the 17 states listed on the Complete <b>listing of U.S. concert venues</b> are the only states with U.S. concert venus out of all the 50 states makes sense to you? Or would you consider that list might be somewhat skewed by the promotional and management agency listed at the end of some of those lists? It's not strange to you that 33 states have no concert venues at all, while Phoenix has almost as many as New Yourk City? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 23:46, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>No. I am saying Wikipedia does not come complete. It is organic, it is growing. Someone needs to include those 33 states. Someone needs to write articles about the venues from each of those states. You can not fault one editor for writing an article about something he or she is interested in just because other editors have not written corresponding articles for their areas. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 23:52, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Another Comment</b> According to the article this is not the same game as kickball. In Kickball the pitcher rolls the ball to the batter and you throw the ball at the guy to get him out, while in this game everything is done by kicking the ball. So a redirect would seem to not fit if indeed one believes that this form of the game does exist. On that note I promise never to discuss the rules on Kickball again unless my two year old niece asks me. <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrunkenSmurf_f5fc.html" title="User:DrunkenSmurf">DrunkenSmurf</a> 02:31, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: To say that primary schools are non-notable is nonsense - if so articles about all other schools must similarly be non-notable. This is an encyclopedia for goodness sake - it should have every school with articles on them. I was developing a list of primary schools in Northern Ireland - anyone who has developed lists knows that it will not fully be populated with articles for some time, but is meant to encourage articles. It is the same with these disambig - to prove the point - with regard to Edenderry Primary School - someone added an article as a result - I rest my case (please`remove the deletion proposal from this and others - thank you). <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 20:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete. I know "Marie Flagg" personally. That is not her real name. It is a name she used for a short time in Canada in the early 1980's when she was actually involved in making a couple of pornographic movies. They were pretty badly filmed, one on one things she shot together with a professor of hers who was into that sort of thing. I dont know if I can use the word here - but the rest of the bullshit that whoever wrote here is just that - bullshit. I dont thnik Marie would be very pleased with having these things attributed to her. She has no problems with her past but this thing is almost all lies.

<li>Well, I guess that's up to the powers that be, I won't argue back or forth. If it's deleted however, I suppose there should also be a deletion for the redirect from [ACFI].

<ul>
<li>Well... in case, say, the alleged ACFI did step ashore in the area Ladonia in some way, and it at least made local headlines, would that make the article worthy of existence, by the principle that it might not be interesting to everyone in the world, but to at least a number of people (Ladonia is a popular subject among artists not only in Sweden, and happenings involving it would create interest - same definately goes for stuff involving the Pirate Bay)? Bare also in mind that the concept is quite new. //Thaum
<ul>
<li>Well, I'd say it'd be notable if it made some local newspapers, and you could cite them in the article, but everyone's opinion of what is or isn't notable varies. It actually sounds quite interesting to me, but as of now there are only 3 places that even mention it online, and none that I've heard of before. <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">tlka</a></sup> 00:36, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> The article does not comply with Wikipedia's high standards for quality. Additionally it is riddled with original research and/or is cited by unreliable sources. There is not enough useful or verified information to justify keeping this article. If someone is willing to do an extensive cleanup of the article, that would be great. Until then, it is best to delete the article as to avoid the spread of misinformation. --<a href="../../../e/p/s/User%7EEpsilonsa_e022.html" title="User:Epsilonsa">Epsilonsa</a> 09:39, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>May I just pause you for a second here. Wikipedia's "High standard of quality" is about as solid as a dog turd in a washing machine. The Wiki is full of complete rubbish, implausible opinions based on speculation, and worst of all, utter lies generally being called direct facts by nitwits who know nothing. The Wiki has been ridiculed from lands a far for having articles pertaining to many many subjects that are just downright wrong, and even one of the top blokes originally part of the creation of the Wiki has admitted it has serious flaws as far as factual truth go. I decided to see if I could get away with writting rubbish, so I edited an article on here to prove a point back in May, with complete gibberish cooked up in one minute, and it has yet to be removed. In fact I expect some poor bastard probably uses the information on a daily basis to prove his or her own points, and little do they know it is made up by me. Just think, if I can do it, millions of others can. And have. So, before you go crapping out this rubbish about this article not being in keeping with the Wiki's high quality standards, might I suggest you take a look at every other page on the Wiki, because chances are 9 times out fo 10 if you knew what the hell you were going on about you'd realise this entire site is a complete farce. That is all. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.47.168.197 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.47.168.197_effe.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.47.168.197">contribs</a>) 2006-07-27 10:33:04 (UTC)</small>

<li>I must actually give an opinion here, even if I orginitaed this article and all flaws in it should be mine (no contribs have been made to it as of yet): So Wiki is ridiculed for lack of accuracy and correctness and so on. No matter if this is true or not, the best way to counter such things, is to clean up the bad seeds and water the good ones, wouldn't you agree? If this is a completey non-sensical article, as some seem to believe, and if it does not reach up to the policies of Wiki, no matter what individuals think of these policies, this should be adhered to, and this everyone making a login on wiki agreed to comply to from the get-go. Better to improve a bad article, than to maintain it in a sad shape just to protest the site's policies if they are not to one's satisfaction. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaum1el_a0da.html" title="User:Thaum1el">Thaum1el</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThaum1el_594d.html" title="User talk:Thaum1el">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thaum1el_8829.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thaum1el">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>I suppose you did not detect the irony of me giving a well tailored reason for deleting this ridiculously low quality article. I know I laughed when I wrote it. I either overestimated your sense of humor or overestimated the amount of humor others would find in my response. In either case, the argument is as valid as it is funny (not saying much, apparently), and your article has got to be deleted. Tough break, son. Maybe try not to berate the merits of your own article next time.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../e/p/s/User%7EEpsilonsa_e022.html" title="User:Epsilonsa">Epsilonsa</a> (<a href="../../../e/p/s/User_talk%7EEpsilonsa_935a.html" title="User talk:Epsilonsa">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Epsilonsa_5f8a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Epsilonsa">contribs</a>).</small>¨
<ul>
<li>Think you got something wrong here. I created the article, and if people seriously want to take it away, please do. I will hardly be upset about the thing, as I have not been upset about someone giving a motivation for wanting the deletion, humorous or not. If it has to go it has to go. However, you must have confused me with the unsigned long argument upstairs. As you might notice I argued against the rant about the Wiki policies on deletion, claiming that if it doesn't meet the Wiki standards it must of course go.&#160;;)--<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaum1el_a0da.html" title="User:Thaum1el">Thaum1el</a> 19:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

That doesn't mean that she's actually on television, or doing anything else notable.

<li><b>Keep for a few days</b>. I don't believe this article was used for advertising, It has come about though a discussion on a morning breakfast show, people have picked up the idea and are having fun with the concept. While I understand that the academic value of the content is low, it is an interesting case study on the creation of an "in joke". Wikipedia contains much esoteric information, and I think that as long as this article is not harming wikipedia as a whole, it should be left.
<p>I also believe that this has spread the influence of wikipedia, as more people discover wikipedia for the first time. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Netbogan (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Netbogan_d1dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Netbogan">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep for a few weeks</b> I concur. Many themes and ideas from radio shows have long-standing Wikipedia pages. Including many from the Jay and the Doctor show (check the Jay and the Doctor Wiki pages for examples). Triple J is an Australian government-owned radio station, they don't have advertisements, so no commercial advangage can be gained from the page. Rather, their audience will be exposed to the world of Wikipedia. If anything, perhaps the link to the merchandising site, not related to Triple J but commercial nonetheless, could be pulled. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.2.218.145 (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.2.218.145.html" title="User talk:203.2.218.145">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.2.218.145_c5a1.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.2.218.145">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is an entry for Space_Goat - I guess the difference is that is a serial whereas the Mini Mammoth is a topic of discussion. Would you be happier if that article made it clear that is just a topic of discussion, or if the article was transformed to be more of a discussion of the joke that includes some information on the joke itself? If it doesn't get any more airplay in a couple of weeks, I won't be sad to say it go - but I'm sure space goat had it's critics when it was starting out, so why not what and see?

<li><b>Keep for a few weeks</b> The origin and fictional nature of the concept is stated at the outset. The article could do with a good edit, but it is clear that the discussion of the concept is satirical and comic. I refer to the <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster_3e86.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monster">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a> article for an example of a comic concept that has taken on a life of its own. As such, both concepts are appropriate subjects for Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep for a few weeks</b> I've added it to the category Fictional species - if the non-existence of the animal is grounds for deletion you need to take out the whole category. There are many species from books and video games in there - the radio is just as valid a form of media, especially now podcasts exist making the medium potentially as persistent as books or video games. It might be more appropriate for placement on uncylcopedia, but as Papertiger said, if the Flying Spaghetti Monster gets a page, the Mini Mammoth has the right to a page. As an observation the mention on JJJ increases the exposure of wikipedia to the general public, and the multiple deletes and repostings would make wikipedia sound fairly unprofessional and disorganised to people hearing about it for the first time. I'll be watching the process carefully. Edit: used 3 tildes rather than 4 - oops. DaveAU 01:26, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm now undecided - Kinu made the good point that the article is astroturfing the joke. I don't have a strong preference either way - I've just been trying to point out pertinent things like the commercial side of it being a hijack, the origin being a news article and existence of other articles on fictional animals. Even if it's just a running joke, there's a discussion of the use of 'Hot grits' as a running joke in the slashdot article. But the astroturfing is a grave concern. And I don't think they're sock puppets coming in - they're probably listeners who only heard about wikipedia this morning - they'll also be aware if people are recommending deletion without having the facts... I won't lose any sleep if it's deleted immediately for astroturfing or if it hangs around to see if it lasts. Actually, if it can be called astroturfing it probably falls short of the original research criteria... DaveAU 03:23, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep it</b> Firstly, as has already been stated, there does not appear to yet be a satisfactory reason for the entire deletion of the Mini Mammoth article. The article could be perhaps modified to meet general Wikipedia standards. NetBogan makes a few pertinent points, including the potential for such an article to increase the audience and scope of the Wikipedia project. This is important, and allows the number of sources of information for Wikipedia articles to increase. I would like to further express the potential for this to be "an interesting case study on the creation of an 'in joke'" and a way to explore the potential for fictitious characters to evolve and become 'real' with continuing discussion. As a biological scientist, I would also like to point out that there is a basis to state that scientific research is never conclusive - according to the null hypothesis method, a scientist, in research, should essentially set out to disprove a theory - so that, in reality, science never really <i>proves</i> anything. So, there is really no way to prove that the Mini Mammoth does not already exist or, furthermore, that it will not exist in the future. Finally, why is this page being classed as <i>original research</i>? I do not find there to be anything that may be considered as scientific research within the Mini Mammoth entry. In addition, the idea is not entirely original, as DaveAU points out - the idea of the Mini Mammoth evolved from a current news item. --<a href="../../../b/a/u/User%7EBauhinia_9fa2.html" title="User:Bauhinia">Bauhinia</a> 02:47, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

With THAT being said....Wikipedia is NOT a crystal ball, if this term/idea dies out in the next few days or weeks, we'll have to go through this process AGAIN to have the article removed. My point is this, remove the article for now, and IF this continues to be a notable fad, then by all means restore the article. A new running joke on a radio show does not warrant enough for an article on Wikipedia, but as I said if this has any staying power, by all means replace the article. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 04:21, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>So if a Wikipedia entry is created more or less directly from a culture with a strong <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_tradition.html" title="Oral tradition">oral tradition</a>, would that be considered invalid due to lack of documentation? Yes, I'm aware it's not exactly the same thing, but I would appreciate some clarification on this. Next, if the Mini Mammoth becomes a "cultural phenomenon" in the next couple of weeks, appearing in magazines and such, would the page be allowed to be un-deleted? Culture is fluid, and moves quickly in modern society. Also, as an aside, Wikipedia's "Feature Article" for today is <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a>.

<li>Bulbasaur is part of a MAJOR franchise for one. This again is a joke from a radio show. I can think of NUMEROUS gags from radios shows that don't have articles, why should this one.

<li>Frankly, <b>if</b> this phenomenon became a cultural phenomenon, I would support the article's existence. But WP is not a crystal ball.

Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. If you read the <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drop_Bear_e4da.html" title="Drop Bear">Drop Bear</a> article, you can see that the creature has been mentioned in a 1988 books by Terry Pratchett (a famous writer), a commercial, and has been the namesake for a band in the early '80s. None of this can be said for the "Mini Mammoth". Drop Bears are notable. Mini Mammoths are not. Your "logic" seems to be: The Drop Bear is a fictional Australian creature; so is the Mini Mammoth. The Drop Bear has a Wikipedia article; so should the Mini Mammoth.

<li>Ok, I'm going to contradict myself here - I don't actually think this article is a hoax, because it is not a genuine attempt to deceive people. It's just a joke. It's obviously a joke. Perhaps if we had a tag that said: "This article is a JOKE. It should not be taken seriously in any way." this might solve the problem - everyone would be happy. Joke articles should not be subject to the same standards of vandalism as other pages. In fact, if they attract vandals away from the serious pages, all the better. Think of it like a graffiti wall.

<li><b>Retain, for a while</b> I was listening to this play out on TripleJ yesterday, and it was clear that the joke was not the hoax itself, but the fact that the wikipedia could apparently be manipulated so easily, and still appear to be a 'legitimate source' to the uninformed. As such, it probably belongs in something like <a href="http://www.encyclopediadamatica.com" class="external text" title="http://www.encyclopediadamatica.com" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia Damatica</a> rather than the Wikipedia. I was unable to hear what the comments were this morning, however I think a speedy deletion would just confirm that the joke worked. Keeping it as is (for a while) shows that while spurious material <b>can</b> turn up in the wikipedia, there is also a review process at work as well - <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELauraSeabrook_2642.html" title="User:LauraSeabrook">User:LauraSeabrook</a> 8:34pm 28 July 2006 (GMT+11)
