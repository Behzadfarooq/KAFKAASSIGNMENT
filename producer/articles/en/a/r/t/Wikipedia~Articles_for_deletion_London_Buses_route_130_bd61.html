<li><b>Delete</b>. Though I disagree, I lost a fight about bus routes in Toronto, therefore these should be deleted as well. <a href="../../../n/l/s/User%7ENlsanand_c56d.html" title="User:Nlsanand">Nlsanand</a> 07:04, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Note</b>. A lot of arguments appear to be based on a dislike of public transit. Highways, get articles, therefore so should bus routes (my opinion, not policy) and more especially train lines (yes, this is policy). If your only reason for voting delete is due to a lack of belief in the importance of public transit, your views are irrelevant to this debate. <a href="../../../n/l/s/User%7ENlsanand_c56d.html" title="User:Nlsanand">Nlsanand</a> 22:51, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Get rid of this. We are not a bus schedule and this appears to be a completely arbitrary bus route. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 07:52, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Why aren't bus routes inherently notable? Anyway, the discussion here <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_London_Buses_route_1_5c19.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/London Buses route 1">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/London Buses route 1</a> where this was already dealt with at some length is of relevance. The bus routes often document the growth of London in a different way and help to understand periods such as the Second World War and its aftermath as they are part and a result of shifting population patterns. <a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegan123_9441.html" title="User:Regan123">Regan123</a> 09:47, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Again, we don't seem to have any trouble with train lines. How is a bus route different? <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 12:58, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The whole "train lines all deserve articles" is currently under challenge too. The big problem here is the same as with most of those-primary source use only, no secondary source use. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 20:42, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Route 130 dates all the way back to 2003, apparently, but for some reason I find it hard to consider that a claim to historic notability. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:36, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - nothing notable about this bus route, so delete it. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayden54_117a.html" title="User:Jayden54">Jayden54</a> 17:11, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> One of 100+ articles. Verifiable content. Not sensibly mergable. More notable than much of Wikipedia's adolescent pop culture content, thereby increasing the breach of its appeal and the average age of its audience. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathanian_528e.html" title="User:Nathanian">Nathanian</a> 20:24, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I haven't seen too many bus route articles, but these are excellent models that cover a detailed history of the routes and service. This is not a bus schedule, a directory OR a collection of indiscriminate information. Unfortunately <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is far too often abused to mean "anything I think doesn't belong on Wikipedia". It would help if relevant references to a Wikipedia criteria or guideline would be included, as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, does NOT fly in this case. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 20:35, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How about <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> (source mentions must be nontrivial and <i>secondary</i>?) I don't see that with any of these, just some primary sourcing. I think that's certainly relevant. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 20:44, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> No secondary sources in evidence. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 09:42, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If we deleted every article without secondary sources listed Wikipedia would be about 1/3 of its size. <a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegan123_9441.html" title="User:Regan123">Regan123</a> 14:23, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That might be an improvement. But I didn't say "no secondary sources listed," I said "no secondary sources in evidence." Different thing. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 20:05, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> These articles do not contain any timetable information at all (why do people keep saying that they do?) These articles are really in-depth and part of London's history and infrastructure. They also survive deletion again and again. There is a reason for that. <a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMRSC_7aab.html" title="User:MRSC">MRSC</a> • <a href="../../../m/r/s/User_talk%7EMRSC_d090.html" title="User talk:MRSC">Talk</a> 15:27, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per my comment on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_London_Buses_route_157_2c3d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/London Buses route 157">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/London Buses route 157</a>. --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User%7ENE2_ab1c.html" title="User:NE2">NE2</a> 16:30, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
