<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. The expansion of the article since the AfD began only contains one additional claim to notability, and that is a trivial mention on TV news. Non-trivial independent coverage has not been shown, which is what would be required to negate the consensus for deletion here, and the presence of editors continuing to argue for deletion following expansion gives me no reason to think that those who argued for deletion before it have failed to revisit the article; and if they had, would have changed their minds. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:21, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b>Do Not Delete</b></p>
<p><br />
This is my argument for not deleting The WiseGuys Wikipedia article</p>
<p>The WiseGuys meet the Wikipedia:Notability (comedy) in the following ways:</p>
<p>1) There are multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person/group/show and its creators/producers, such as articles in The Commercial Appeal and the Memphis Flyer. They have also performed on local television news/entertainment programs.</p>

<p>2) One of the troupe members, Larry Clark, is a world-renowned clown and magician. He was most recently seen on television's "America's Got Talent" which was seen worldwide. Larry Clark has also toured with Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus, Cirque Du Soliel, Cirque Magnifique, Jim Rose Circus Sideshow Jim Rose Circus Sideshow, all of which are internationally touring shows.</p>

<p>3) Though it was it's first year, the SouthEastern Comedy Arts Festival was a "major comedy show" in that there were troupes from four different states in attendance.</p>

Very low returns for a "major comedy show" - also hard to classify something that was held for the first time this year as major. Given that the festival was apparently held in Starksville, MS, near where three states come together, I also don't find the "four states" qualifier to be much of a help. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 15:35, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>4) The award, "best shortform improv troupe", won at the above mentioned festival, was accomplished by beating seven of the best and brightest improv companies in the southeast region.</p>

<p>As one of only three improvisational theater companies in Memphis, Tn, The WiseGuys have been a major feature in the growing comedy community. They are a feature at the new Comedy, TN Comedy Club and perform out of the city as well.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - "Major feature" is a subjective term, and does not appear to be borne out by the available information. I'm sure it's an important group to you (since you appear to be connected to them), but it's not notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. This is not an advertising platform for you. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 15:35, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"<b>Response</b>" - In every article that can be found about improv in Memphis, it states that The WiseGuys is only one of either two or three shows of its kind in Memphis. As one of three companies of its kind in the local scene that perform the notable style (i.e. short form improv), The WiseGuys meet the above mentioned <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28comedy%29_49d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (comedy)">Wikipedia:Notability (comedy)</a> requirement.</dd>

<p>They are "prominent", as is easily verified by looking at the number of shows they perform.</p>
<p>Also, please remember, from the guidelines:</p>
<p>Please note that <b>the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted</b>; likewise, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. These are merely rules of thumb which some editors choose to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to keep an article that is on articles for deletion.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Well, the article is clearly from The Commercial Appeal. The paper's archive does not include all articles. A simple review of the article hosted on The Wiseguys site shows it is an actual newspaper article, including a byline from Lawrence Buser, whose work can be found on numerous articles in the Appeal.--Lawcomic 15:45, 16 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - Most paper's web archives do tend to keep all articles these days, especially one as recent as 2003.

<li><s><b>Rewrite and Fast</b></s> the article as it stands needs to be deleted. It makes no claim to notability. But if the stuff above is added to make a claim to notability, then I'll support as a Strong Keep.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 23:09, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Keep</b> Article has been improved significantly since nominated. I'm inclined to keep articles where people are willing to work on them. Two comments on the article, watch out for peacock terms---eg things that look good by have no real meaning, EG the comment about the group having a long run. Also, the members of the group should be pared down. It looks as if there might be two people who are notable. The rest should be deleted or (at most) listed side by side because most groups are subject to change, which means that you should state, "as of November 2006 the group consisted of..."<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 16:42, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Only reference is an award for wining the <i>Best One-Liner</i> which was <i>Nothing dirty touches my car, unless it’s a girl.</i> &amp; <i>Best Shortform Improv Troupe</i>(best of that festival mind you). Also the title is right off a poster, <i>Comedy You Can't refuse</i>, blatent advertising. I say delete it, if proper references can be provided then I may support the recreation, but this is no start. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 01:37, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Please see the new and improved entry and comment on what, if anything else, can be done differently to ensure acceptance in Wikipedia. For example, is there a way to change the name of the article to get rid of the "comedy you can't refuse" tagline?</b></p>

<p><b>Strong KEEP</b>: Every improv comedy festival hands out awards, and each of those awards goes to the "best of that festival". Go figure. The point is, the SouthEastern Comedy Arts Festival was held in October, 2006 on the campus of Mississippi State University and The Wiseguys were named Best Short-Form Improv Troupe (<a href="http://www.secaa.org/wordpress/" class="external free" title="http://www.secaa.org/wordpress/" rel="nofollow">http://www.secaa.org/wordpress/</a>).

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - the group's only legitimate claim to notability that I see is the presence of Larry Clark. It's difficult to gauge just how notable Clark is, however. Wikipedia does not have an article for Larry Clark (clown), and it's difficult to use Google as a gauge of his notability because there is another very famous <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Clark_aa1d.html" title="Larry Clark">Larry Clark</a> - the director of <i>Kids</i>. Clark has certainly toured with some impressive circuses, but I'm unclear about the magnitude of his contribution to those circuses. By analogy, I'd argue that not every backup dancer who tours with a major star necessarily absorbs the notability of that star. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 21:02, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I am just trying to make the entry conform to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28comedy%29_49d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (comedy)">Wikipedia:Notability (comedy)</a> requirements. Nothing in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28comedy%29_49d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (comedy)">Wikipedia:Notability (comedy)</a> states that the person "who was once a part of or later joined a group or show that is otherwise notable" needs to have a large "magnitude of his contribution".

<dd><b>Comment</b> - As Hyperbole mentioned, LOTS of people have toured with Ringling Bros. and the other shows - that doesn't make them inherently notable, especially since we have no way of knowing how long they toured, what kind of status, if any, they had in those groups, the reasons for their departure, etc. As to Clark's appearance on <i>America's Got Talent</i>, it does appear that he was on the show, but based on several accounts <a href="http://popculturejunkies.com/2006/07/20/rewind-recap-regurgitate-americas-got-talent-the-results-show-2/" class="external autonumber" title="http://popculturejunkies.com/2006/07/20/rewind-recap-regurgitate-americas-got-talent-the-results-show-2/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.realitynewsonline.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&amp;article=article6276.art&amp;page=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.realitynewsonline.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&amp;article=article6276.art&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://community.tvguide.com/forum.jspa?forumID=700005901" class="external autonumber" title="http://community.tvguide.com/forum.jspa?forumID=700005901" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.realitytvcalendar.com/recaps/americasgottalent/jd-agt-ep07-p2.html?submit=Continued+On+Page+2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.realitytvcalendar.com/recaps/americasgottalent/jd-agt-ep07-p2.html?submit=Continued+On+Page+2" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, it seems he did very poorly and only appeared once. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 14:26, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b> - Not to split hairs, but the requirement, according to the guidelines of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28comedy%29_49d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (comedy)">Wikipedia:Notability (comedy)</a> is not that the person joining the group be a main feature in a nationally touring show or that he be particualarly good (in fact, is it not possible to be notable for being bad at what you do?), just that he "was once a part of or later joined a group or show that is otherwise notable". I still contend that, according to the wording of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28comedy%29_49d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (comedy)">Wikipedia:Notability (comedy)</a>, this entry meets the requirements set for notablity.Apatronoftruth 18:09, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So, activity seems to have quieted down on the debate over this entry's fate. It seems the opinions are pretty well evenly matched. I will say that after the revamped edit of the entry, it seems two people changed their minds to support keeping the entry. And since the person who nominated the entry for deletion has made edits to the entry to help it comply with standards, I can only assume he supports keeping it as well.</p>
<p>Anyone care to tell me what happens now? Apatronoftruth 05:48, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>YES</b>: I think it should also be noted that Wiseguys founder, Joe Leibovich, hosted an episode of the very notable TV show "America, Apparently, Never Reads a Book". This episode featured the hilarious reactions of St. Louis Zoo patrons watching desert tortoises mate as well as the surprised responses of people using a drinking fountain that dispensed root beer.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nomination. Even with article cleanup, group lacks notability. Most the media mentions seem trivial, in that they mention the Wiseguys along with other groups - the group is not the focus of the articles. As to the comment above about the "very notable TV show" <i>America, Apparently, Never Reads a Book</i>, a Google search on that terms brings up zero hits. Notable, right. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRealFennShysa_6315.html" title="User:TheRealFennShysa">TheRealFennShysa</a> 20:43, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep as previous + comment</b>: There is no consensus, so I'd ask an admin to have this closed out and labeled "NO CONSENSUS, DEFAULTING TO KEEP". In the future, it can be revisited but some who agreed it should be deleted never cared to revisit the article after it was expanded upon - so we have biased votes within this tabulation. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 23:38, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
