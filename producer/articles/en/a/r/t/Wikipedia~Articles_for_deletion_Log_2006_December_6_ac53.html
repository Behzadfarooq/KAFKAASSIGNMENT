<p>This article, like its predecessor List of automobiles that were commercial failures, suffers from dealing with a completely undefined concept. There are no definitions of what constitutes a failure and the article will inherently be prone to speculation and POV conflicts. Unfortunately there is no way to deal with this concept in a manner appropriate for Wikipedia. For the deletion of the preceeding article see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_automobiles_that_were_commercial_failures_cc5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of automobiles that were commercial failures">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of automobiles that were commercial failures</a>-The rational for deleting this article is the same as that of its predecessor. <b><a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendelSignature_e03b.html" title="User:BrendelSignature"><font face="Arial" color="#1F860E">Signature</font></a><font color="#20038A"><sup><a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendelSignature_e03b.html" title="User:BrendelSignature">brendel</a></sup></font></b><small><a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">HAPPY HOLIDAYS</a></small> 05:18, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>delete</b>This is largely identical to the prior list and suffers from the same problem, mainly that it is inherently NOT-NPOV, which means that the list can NEVER be NPOV, and so it must go. This isn't merely a clean-up issue, it is subjective as to what can be considered a "failure" and thus, will never be neutral.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The cited point from WP:MUSIC also states that it is 'often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such,' and since this group never even released a recording, I think that applies here. As there are no incoming links and the article is at such an odd location, I don't personally see any need for a redirect, either, although I wouldn't dispute if one were created.

<li>Yes, it has notable members, but no notability on its own, which is why WP:MUSIC seems to recommend redirecting in a situation like this one.

<p>The record company of <a href="../../../r/a/v/Raven-Symon%C3%A9_84af.html" title="Raven-Symoné">Raven-Symoné</a>, Hollywood Records, has not confirmed that this will be the next single on Raven's yet to be released album, nor have they confirmed that the song in question even exists. No track listing has been announced, and it is quite apparent that this page was created by someone with very limited knowledge in the subject area, most notably by the fact that they didn't even spell Raven-Symoné's name correctly.

<li><b>Keep</b>. (1) Some people find information easier to process in list form, others in categories. An encyclopedia is all about access - how to find the information you want, and these lists enable list-readers to find their information. (2) I don't know what a "text dump" is, but the lists in question are simply titles which link to the articles for the films. I don't see how listing that information is a copyvio. (3) Does this mean all the other lists by country or nationality are next?

Year made and Country or Origin are not discriminating factors about a subject, and thus should not be the sole basis for the creation of a list. List of Top-100 Grossing Finnish Films or List of Award Winning Finnish Films, if appropriately referened, WOULD make good list articles, as they contain <i>descriminating</i> qualities. Broad categorizations like these are better managed through CATAGORIES and not LISTS, since categories CAN be this general. As always, utility of the information is NOT really a keepable criteria. The fact that some users don't know how to use categories is no reason to keep these lists. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 07:20, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

A list is more inclusive. It even lists films that are not yet on IMDb. To me, it is encyclopedic. I would expect notable films from all the countries to be covered. And what I'm getting a whiff of in the above debate is that "foreign" films aren't notable, which, frankly, is disturbing to me. — <b><a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisekwai_3dd2.html" title="User:Wisekwai">Wise</a></b><i><a href="../../../w/i/s/User_talk%7EWisekwai_5593.html" title="User talk:Wisekwai">Kwai</a></i> 07:26, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> They <i>"seem"</i> to come from the IMDb, meaning this mass deletion is based on a broad generalization. Copyright violation is a heavy charge and should be dealt with specifically in a case by case basis and not brandied about in a McCathian manner. The only way categories could rival a list of all the notable films from any given country would be the creation of thousands of stubs which is not in keeping with policy. Lists don't mean more stubs, rather categories <b>necessitate</b> stubs <i>en masse</i>. The charge that the lists "go on forever" is ridiculous, everything goes on indefinitely. We should cut off the list of American presidents after 2008 maybe? What say we chop eras, mammals and stars too? Way too many of all of those already. To my mind <a href="../../../c/s/l/WP%7ECSL_69ec.html" title="WP:CSL">WP:CSL</a> supports these lists. Again, it would be impossible to do this in category form. The films can be added to the lists without creating stubs. The lists nominated here are all new and with proper maintenance will certainly be a valuable resource. Country is arguably more important than year seeing as it provides an overview of that culture. Obviously it's a huge project, as is Wikipedia itself, and it needs some time.

It would allow the work to continue within the scope of the project that created them, where they DO serve a purpose, and where they wouldn't clutter up the mainspace with indiscriminate info. Also, they could be recreated or moved back to the mainspace if a clear method of discrimination was used, such as List of Top 25 Grossing Finnish Films by Year or some such change that assured that this lists were finite and managable and verifiable and notable by their very title.

<li><b>Additional comment</b> It should be noted that almost all of the pages listed here are still empty—as they were only created yesterday—and do not violate anything. And the lists are going to end up looking mighty similar to the IMDb as that's the standard method of listing films, <i>Title</i> (Year) (Additional information), and is not exclusive to the IMDb. Personally, I like Year: <i>English title</i> (<i>Original language title Romanization if necessary</i>) but that's just me. I don't see why they should be moved to a different name space or why this project is in anymore of a rush to be certified than any other articles on this site. They need to be seen so that as many film buffs as possible can find and enhance them. Wikipedia has a lot more room than any corporeal dictionary and these (big) lists most definitely contribute to a comprehensive knowledge of world cinema. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctor_Sunshine_63d5.html" title="User:Doctor Sunshine">Doctor Sunshine</a> 19:36, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete all</b> I strongly believe that this would be viewed better and easier to keep up with/navigate in a category.

<li><b>Keep</b> - lists of movies by country fall within Wikipedia's encyclopedic scope, and they deserve to be kept. Any text that is copyvio should be removed, but the lists themselves should remain. Also, by being in list form, these lists present the opportunity to add various enhancements later, such as annotations (brief description, directors' names, year of release, etc.). &#160;<i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th<font color="blue">e Tr<font color="#9ACD32">ans<font color="#FFCC00">hu<font color="orange">man<font color="red">ist</font> &#160;&#160;</font></font></font></font></font></a></b></i>09:30, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Strong keep</b> can't anyone see how useful this navigation box is in learning about global film. Obviously for list of American films there will be a redirect to Category@American films. Not every film will be listed. Mostly notable ones which will eventually become articles in the future. The lists will just act ad navigation points to diferent articles on world film. What is the problem with this. Also the lists ar enot endless and can be managed. Look I just want to get on with it rather than waiting and debating <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 09:48, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey I have an excellent idea. Why not just keep the navigation box never delete this it is brilliant but for the countries that have a great number of films and that already have agreat number of articles on wikipedia redirect to category. E.g List of American films there is no point in creating a new list when catwegory has listed most of them automativally anyway. I suggest placing the navigatin box in the categories of country films. However for the countries that as yet do not have entries aor many films yet on wikipedia I suggest kepping these lists. Then once the films develop and a fuller list is created then redirect to categories. Look beleive it or not I would rather not have to create lists unneccesaarily I have redircted both American and British films but i really do think the serve as a start for foreign films which are not on wikipedia. Even for Finnish films once the articles develop and becomes fuller then delete the lists and redirect to categories. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 09:56, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>However most countries as yet do not have the majority of notable films covered so I suggest the lists are drawn up for most of them and once they develop redirect to categories and remove the unotable films and then delete the lists. American films and British films I have already redirected to category and maybe french film. I will also be drawing uo naviagation boxes of Film by genre and List of actors and List of Film Directors by country and on that I will be redirecting to the categories. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 10:22, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As for the lists of films by year I suggest that from 1940 to present a redirect is made to categories but the lists again identify what is misssing by year. All of the nominated deletion articles so far are barely covered in the categories<a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 10:37, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but only if the lists are pruned according to notability, not kept as a text dump from IMDb. Once the pruning has been done, most lists could probably fit on one page.

<p>Pleas see my comments on the main Wikiproject film talk page. I propose that rather than creat A-z lists of films by country and date that they are changed into chronological order in order of date and year of release. List of films by year would be listed from January 1st to december 31st in order of release and List of films by country in order of date of release which List of thai films and others have very usefully done. Eventually you would have an extrmeely useful timeline of films in chronoligal order by year and country. However a start I think they need to be listed alphatically, unotable films removed and then sorted by order of release. I have no objections if everybody would like the bulk of the listing to be done behind the main space. Definately do not delete them yet I know thety have a potentially very encylopedic purpose. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 16:47, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>How about the list of films that are notable are drawn up first on pages like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Films_List_of_missing_Bulgarian_Films_d1fd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Films/List of missing Bulgarian Films">Wikipedia:WikiProject Films/List of missing Bulgarian Films</a> and Wikipedia:WikiProject Films/List of missing Finnish Films and then only the notable ones created. Then at a later date the List of films can be sorted by year and date of release <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 17:29, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I'd prefer the films just be categorized, but if the lists were to be handled properly, such as in a WikiProjet, then I don't have a major problem with this.

(Fine Gael are the main opposition party to Fianna Fail in Ireland.) The KBC article seems to be of good quality and has a relatively long edit list. I went to UCD myself KBC is certainly notable within the context of UCD societies. If there is a Wikipedia policy in place regarding college societies it should be linked and we should make our minds up based on that.

<li><b>Re: Blorgs's Comment</b>. Because of Blorgs comments I think I'll have to give some background. I'm from a <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianna_F%C3%A1il_a8d8.html" title="Fianna Fáil">Fianna Fáil</a> voting family. I am friendly with a lot of people in <a href="../../../y/f/g/YFG_14a3.html" title="YFG">YFG</a>. I'm not sure who I would vote for in a general election, but I'm leaning twords the Green Party. Anyway I noticed in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_College_Dublin_8b39.html" title="University College Dublin">University College Dublin</a> article that the Kevin Barry Cumann had an article on wikipedia and out of boredom I wrote an article on UCD YFG. The information on this was got from their website. It is the only article I've ever written and in the process I edited one or two others making links to the UCD YFG article. The UCD YFG article was later deleted apparently due to non-notablity and previous precedent. I personally think Wikipedia should change their policy on this but it's up to them. I think this article should be deleted and the relevant bits merged with <a href="../../../%C3%B3/g/r/%C3%93gra_Fianna_F%C3%A1il_3cef.html" title="Ógra Fianna Fáil">Ógra Fianna Fáil</a> in a new section say, 'notable branches of'. I understand this would create a precedent of its own and while it would work in Ireland it would lead to an overload of information on articles like <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Democrats_f24b.html" title="Young Democrats">Young Democrats</a> in the US or any other party. It's up to Wikipedia. Blorg is accusing me of being partisan but you could look at the other side of the coin and accuse Wikipedia of having double standards. In any case I suggest a <b>MERGE</b> of the more relevant bits of the article -stephenh2312 17:31, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comments</b> (1) To show notability you have to look for <i>external</i> sources that have written about PocketGPSWorld. That's why you need to exclude the sites pocketgpsworld.com and pocketgpsworld.co.uk from your search. (2) Even once you've done the right Google search, you can't just cite the number of hits to show notability. You have to actually find reliable non-trivial sources among those hits. (3) Re: "confirm the existence" -- no one denies that this company &amp; website, and its services, <i>exist</i>. The question is, does it pass <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>?

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Delete all</b>. There is always a danger of too much indiscriminate information being collected about sports figures by rapid fans, and this is Exhibit A. I accept that standards of notability are notoriously lax for sport (who else can explain why we have articles on reserve goalkeepers for English second division teams?), but this really is a bridge too far. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegis_951c.html" title="User:Legis">Legis</a> 15:55, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Abbreviated Merge</b> Same as <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a>. Nakamura is Japan's David Beckham, so there are a lot of people who would disagree that his goals aren't notable (especially if you've seem some of his goals...). But it is kind of ridiculous. Either merge them into Nakamura's main article or create one article for all his goals. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptkrob_3e4f.html" title="User:Captkrob">Captkrob</a> 17:48, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is far more detail than RSSSF.com and most sports almanacs have. We should reduce the data to total goals scored each season, merge it in Nakamura's article, and get rid of the rest. We shouldn't set a precedent leading to databases of every single goal scored by Pele, Maradona, and every other notable footballer. <a href="../../../d/j/c/User%7EDjcastel_4413.html" title="User:Djcastel">Djcastel</a> 18:41, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>merge all</b> to their respective locales. I'd like to note that the contention that a WikiProject and not this AfD should decide this issue is contrary to both <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> and the <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion policy</a>, which characterises AfD as a <i>public</i> debate. On the other hand, most of those that support deletion seem not to mind a merger very much, so that's probably the most consensual outcome.</p>
<p>As is usual with mass AfDs, yours truly is kindly requesting the community to carry out the decision - i.e., merge the content and turn the article into a redirect. Please link to this AfD in the redirect edit summary and leave the AfD tags on until the merge/redirect is done.

If we leave out the information on circulation and number of cardholders, all that is left to merge is the name of the library and a link to its website. Is that worth merging?

<li><b>Keep and allow the Project team to decide</b> - As this is a part of WikiProject Ohio, I would STRONGLY suggest that the folks from that project team be made aware of this deletion effort ASAP, and do not take any action until that project team has a chance to thoroughly discuss this. Deleting stuff that is maintained by a project team without their consent is against the spirit of these teams.

<li>I certainly agree that in matters that involve a significant amount of special expertise, the team involved should be consulted and have a large say (although perhaps not the final word). In this case, I think that most of us possess the knowledge to evaluate the notabiility of stub articles about small to medium-sized library systems. I think it would also be different if the articles were brand new, but they are mostly at least a month old, as I remember, and some older - the team must have been aware of them, since they are tagged as part of the project, and chose to leave them in place. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 17:34, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Merge all</b> per Shimeru. Is there really anything more than a sentence or two about any of these? As an alternative (or in addition to) merging into each locale's page, could merge all into Ohio Public Libraries. A unified article covering them all might be a viable article...more useful ("where are the libraries?" instead of "tell me about a library if I know which one I want (by name, not location!)"). And would provide more likely notability and opportunity for content beyond a mere directory listing (history of libraries in the state, interesting/unique policies, features or collections, etc). <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 17:39, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Personally, I would object to a "list of Ohio public libraries" article - to me, a list of non-notable things is almost as bad as individual articles. Wikipedia is not a directory. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 18:07, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>True, but such an article could be more than a list. Presuming reliable independent sources are found, a discussion of the state library system including (and not limited to) a list would be encyclopedic. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 22:24, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My impression of how libraries are organized is that most areas started with local libraries, and only much later developed regional and state systems - and often only to provide services such as inter-library loan. You could certainly talk about the history of libraries in a particular state, but there would be a lot of broad generalizations, and discussing them as a 'system' might be rather stretching it. Nine tenths of the funding, control, and activity is still on the local level. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 23:23, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep and allow the Project team to decide</b>- I say let the WikiProject Ohio team decide how to handle this. They may opt for a more consolidated article or merging the article with an article about the location the library is in. That aside, the WikiProject Ohio team <i>did</i> request that this article (and several others) be written, so obviously not everyone views this as "non-notable." I would prefer to see the articles remain and expanded with more history and background. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonRidinger_3a67.html" title="User:JonRidinger">JonRidinger</a> 01:13, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b>, this is a perfect example of a correct mass nomination (very similar articles about very similar subjects), so no need to make individual AfD's. No indication of notability as would be indicated by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources. I don't mind if this is made by an individual editor or by the members of a project: while the project members are perfectly free to defend the articles by showing that they are notable by providing us good sources to indicate that these libraries have any distinguishing features beyond existing, there is no reason to keep articles only because they are made by the members of a project. On the contarry, they may well lack the impartiality and distance needed to look at these articles and subjects on an AfD.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Being a stub is not a reason for deletion. Every library is unique, and the fact that published references are missing from these articles does not mean that such references do not exist. Libraries often have collections about their communities or specific topics which are not duplicated elsewhere, such as Mount Allison University's collection of 19th-century and early 20th-century high school trigonometry textbooks, or the Toronto Reference Library's impressive Sherlock Holmes collection. In some cases, such a collection was built by a private collector and was later donated or bequeathed to the library, and bears the donor's name.

<p>In general, I think that Wikipedia deletion process throws away a lot of good, or at least salvageable, articles, and that the damage to the encyclopedia and to the morale of individual editors caused mass deletions does outweighs any benefit. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 02:06, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wrong on both accounts: mass nominations are accepted standard procedure, and a project doesn't decide which articles are kept and which deleted (although their input as to why they feel any particular article should be kept can of course be valuable).

<dd>I disagree that an article on this train is redundant. The Ordinary Express actually had a longer lifetime than the Northerner, so I don't see why it should be relegated to a history section of the Northerner. There is probably plenty to say about it - one of us just needs to get out some books and work on it. My previous offer stands: if there is a chance this article can be saved, I will put work into expanding it. - <a href="../../../a/x/v/User%7EAxver_42e9.html" title="User:Axver">Axver</a> 00:32, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Have you looked at the requirements of the standard? "Web-specific content[3] is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria." Three different example have been cited to satisify criteria two "he website or content has won a notable independent award from either a publication or organisation." First the Play Boy award, second the Weblog Award, third being a featured blog at a major political conference. There is a fourth the Wampum Award that they have also won that I'm trying to find a good source for. So given these 3 example and given that I only need one how does this fail the test?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Every library is different. The Chandler library has been involved with an innovative program to promote literacy and library use among people who live in public housing, for example. Maintaining a separate article for a library makes it easier to find information on the library by searching from a list or category of public libraries. Some libraries serve multiple municipalities and therefore don't merge well into a single town's article. In general, libraries have collections of books and other materials about their local areas that are not duplicated elsewhere, and the Chandler library presumably has a significant amount of information related to Chandler that may represent a notable collection, and as well a resource that a Wikipedian living in Chandler could draw upon to create articles based on print sources which are unavailable online. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 04:38, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge or delete</b>, whichever seems most appropriate. I don't really get what TruthbringerToronto tries to say here. Because someone in the Chandler region may use the library (or more specifically, some books, magazines, ... in the library) to compose articles for Wikipedia, we should keep the library article? I thought our policies indicated that subjects had to be the subjects of multiple verifiable sources by reputable publishers, not that the subject only had to be useful (or "different": every person is different, every snowflake is different, that's no reason to have an article). The sources added are interesting, but for me still too weak to keep this as a separate article (the first one is a very short mention, and the second is more of a directory entry, the Chandler public library being one of the more than 600 repositories in Arizona indexed on this site). While this library is more important than the usual village library, it still is not verifiably important enough to have its own article. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:58, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I was referring specifically to the library's special collections of local material that could not be easily located elsewhere, such as local history materials and hard-copy or microfilmed back volumes of local newspapers. Most libraries have such collections. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 23:52, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree: every city and town (of some size) has a public library, and almost all of them feature collections of material on local subjects. Every town also has telephone directories, published by the local phone company (and, in recent years, other companies)... should we have special articles on them, or should that info be merged to the local articles so that Wikipedia researchers can find them? I would argue that these sort of things are so common and similar from town to town as to be non notable. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 00:20, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> . No, the special collections of each library are unique and not purely local, such as Mount Allison University's collection of 19th-century and early 20th-century high school trigonometry textbooks, or the Toronto Reference Library's impressive Sherlock Holmes collection. In some cases, such a collection was built by a private collector and was later donated or bequeathed to the library, and bears the donor's name. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 15:38, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>If no one has talked about the collection in any detail in non-trivial sources it is very hard to see it as having any significiant notability.

<dd>It's no longer verbatim. I created this article as a split from the <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii.html" title="Wii">Wii</a> article to reduce the size of the Wii article. So far I have brought the size of the Wii article down to 47kb from 58kb. It would be nice to be able to keep this data in a seperate article while limiting the Wii article to the data on English-speaking countries.

<li><b>Comment</b> We don't need separate articles, but by separating them reduces clutter on the Wii article.

<p><b>Delete.</b> Quite apart from the obvious unencyclopaedic purpose of this article- to promote what can only be an extreme minority viewpoint even among Muslim communities, namely that Islam had a presence in the Americas pre-Columbus- this article is misconceived as well as misinformed. Islam is a religion not a language, and it is no more sensible to claim that placenames are etymologically "Islamic" than it would be to claim they are Christian, Jewish, Taoist, Animist or whatever. The cited "source" drawn upon for the article hardly seems to be (and is not represented as) a credible one for this 'research', and as such the contents are indicative of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">OR</a>. <a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 09:36, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He does not argue, and certainly not rationally, he presents clearly controversial research by one fringe researcher as uncontradicted fact. He doesn't establish that the placenames are either "islamic" or even that they are precolumbian (there is a town called Hell does that prove diabolical presence in preocolumbian ameria?) And he doesn't cite any complementary sources or accepted etymologies.

<dd>Considering that we have <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">Flat Earth</a>, this clearly shows that this article could very well exist. As for NPOV and other editoria issues as "presenting theories as facts" and such, those are not grounds for afd, its only grounds for editing. Regarding sources, the given article indeed is about this topic. I also missed it, but if you scroll down a bit to the <a href="http://www.zaman.com/?bl=aksiyon&amp;trh=20060415&amp;alt=&amp;syf=butun" class="external text" title="http://www.zaman.com/?bl=aksiyon&amp;trh=20060415&amp;alt=&amp;syf=butun" rel="nofollow">First Immigrants of the New World</a> section, you will see it.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Barry Fell (1917 - 1994), British-born and <b>distinguished Harvard professor of marine biology</b>, wrote "Saga America" one year after his retirement in 1980, which proves the existence of Muslims in America.</i></dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So the article is clearly sourced and makes claims of notability. So far, the above disscussion (this is not a vote) has been regarding this being a minority view and having NPOV issues, and i have referred to policy and <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">precedence</a> to prove that those are not grounds for deleting.

<dd>Neither Fell nor Yucel are reliable sources (Feel was a marine biologist dabbling in the esoteric, Yucel is a moslem religious specialist, neither are hisorians nor are their theories even discussed by historians, this does indeed constitute a very small minority view - probably more people believe the earth is flat). None of the claims of references are verifiable the way they are quoted, and if they were verifiable it would only be in nonreliable sources.

<dd>Um, which Harvard Professor? <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Fell_bbe2.html" title="Barry Fell">Barry Fell</a>? Despite what the messageboard linked to proclaims, he has nothing whatsover to do with the contents of this list, nor anything really to do with 'establishing' pre-Columbian Islamic presence in the Americas. That source is quite evidently bandying his name about in a misguided attempt to associate some academic credentials behind all this. While Prof. Fell did indeed make a number of claims to have identified petroglyphs in the Americas as having non-American origins, such as in North African and (mainly) Celtic (<a href="../../../o/g/h/Ogham.html" title="Ogham">Ogham</a>) scripts, his ideas in this regard are assessed by the academic community as being outlandish, eccentric and are not seriously contemplated. He did not AFAIK ever claim or set out to claim Islamic presence, though.</dd>
<dd>Instead, the sole source behind this "research" seems to be a rather obscure figure associated with a mosque in inner Sydney, Australia, with absolutely no demonstration of any credentials, of any kind, whatsoever. This source is reportedly (and <i>reportedly</i> since we've only the word of the original messageboard poster to go by) claiming that not only are these localities in some sense "Islamic" -and per my nominating comments this makes no linguistic sense- ,but also that these localities had these names already, ie before European settlement came along, and thus the "proof" that there was Islamic presence pre-Columbus.</dd>
<dd>So we are being asked to believe that, for example, <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina%2C_Washington_37ee.html" title="Medina, Washington">Medina, Washington</a> is so named because that is what it was called long before European settlers ever got there. However, even cursory research will show that in this case the township was only established in the late 19th C., and the town's historical society gives a rather different account has to <a href="http://www.medina-wa.gov/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC={0EF1CA38-E35B-489B-8446-8B309737C420}" class="external text" title="http://www.medina-wa.gov/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC={0EF1CA38-E35B-489B-8446-8B309737C420}" rel="nofollow">how its name came about</a>- to quote: <i>"A community meeting was held and three women were appointed to select a name for the community. Mrs. Flora Beloti’s choice was the name selected. She had decided on the name “Medeena”, after a popular Arabian city."</i> (and this was in 1891, not 1291).</dd>
<dd>Clearly, it and presumably the other Medinas in the US were named after the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">original in Saudi Arabia</a>, but <i>not</i> by any Muslims who were there pre-1492.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 07:38, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Dr. Barry Fell (Harvard University) introduced in his book Saga America - 1980 solid scientific evidence supporting the arrival, centuries before Columbus, of Muslims from North and West Africa. Dr. Fell discovered the existence of Muslim schools at Valley of Fire, Allan Springs, Logomarsino, Keyhole Canyon, Washoe and Hickison Summit Pass (Nevada), Mesa Verde (Colorado), Mimbres Valley (New Mexico) and Tipper Canoe (Indiana) dating back to 700-800 CE. Engraved on rocks in the old western US, he found texts, diagrams and charts representing the last surviving fragments of what was once a system of schools - at both an elementary and higher levels. The language of instruction was North African Arabic written with old Kufic Arabic script. The subjects of instruction included writing, reading, arithmetic, religion, history, geography, mathematics, astronomy and sea navigation. The descendants of the Muslim visitors of North America are members of the present Iroquois, Algonquin, Anasazi, Hohokam and Olmec native people.

<li>- 62.129.121.63: on the contrary, it is your comments which give the appearance of unfamiliarity with the current standing of pre-Columbian historical research. To say "...these discourses are becoming increasingly acceptable amonst reputable Historians" is demonstrably false, at best misleading. Any readings done outside of the same material you have quoted (which is spammed and duplicated across a number of afrocentrist and other miscellaneous messageboards) -say, any peer-reviewed academic journal, <i>Archaeology</i>, <i>Science</i>, etc- would show that these ideas have no acceptance by mainstream historians.</li>

Their publications cited have not undergone any peer-reviewed academic process (which is what "academic publication" means), but instead are popularly published and are no more deserving of an 'academic' label than other well-known fringe/pseudoscientific writers like Erich von Daniken and Zecharia Sitchin.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 02:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

While these folks have indeed published works which postulate pre-Columbian African or Islamic presence, they are only mentioned by the messageboard site this material is taken from as being sources which are supportive of the general concept, and not the specific claim. There is <i>no demonstration</i> that any of these "academics" have made the connection on these placenames in their works. At all. The <u><i>only</i></u> attributed source for the claim on which this article is based -that all the Medina etc placenames in US are "Islamic"- is the Redfern mosque attendee Salih Yucel, and furthermore we only have the messageboard poster's word for it. Frankly, this is a very poor demonstration of any notable, "researched theory", and on the face of it is barely distinguishable from a hoax.

<li>reply to CJLL Firstly lets not denegrate Yucel as the Redfern Mosque Attendee, as he was a Doctorate student At Harvard and one of his professors was Harvard Professor Fell. His research referenced and detailed these half a dozen harvard and other notable academics works on the subjects. As yet You have failed to produce ANY evidence that the Acedemic circles reject these theories or that it is widespread, or that the research did not undergo Peer review. Yet the arguments for the inclusion of this article have consistantly give sound references of the Harvard historians support of this field of study.</li>

<p>Yucel then traveled to the US to pursue his doctoral degree in "Religion and Mental Health" at the University of Boston; he is currently a preacher at the School of Medicine Hospital of Harvard as well as a member of the religious affairs planning committee of these hospitals. In addition to being on the administration of the Boston Dialogue Foundation, Yucel has researched the traces of Islam on the American Continent for years. The most important findings he notes also concur with the research of his former professor and member of the US Science and Art Academy faculty, Professor Barry Fell.</p>

<p>However this all acedemic as it is abundantly clear that this is a acedemic viewpoint that is backed up by half a dozen Harvard Professors as well as other Acedemics, and is contained in several Acedemic Books (which have been listed).

<dd>It is most certainly not clear. It is not our task to prove that the viewpoints haven't undergone peer reiew. It is the task of the article creator to refer to reliable sources something which he fails to do. Even if fivehundred harvard proffessos think the theory is sound it is of no importance untill one of them publishes a book about it or an artcile in a peerreviewed journal. The article links to a message board not to any artciles or books. Also being an academic doesn't mean that thei viewpoint hold any leverage at all - the are biologists and theologists not historians. Their statements about history or linguistics hold about as much value as bold claims I might make about quantum physics. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">Maunus</a> 11:17, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>A similar article to this, Notable YouTube memes, was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Notable_YouTube_memes_d615.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Notable YouTube memes">deleted via AfD</a> in October. This article actually pre-dates that one, so it doesn't really qualify for CSD G4. Tried tagging it anyway, but it was removed by an admin, so I'm bringing it here. Essentially, having a list article like this isn't necessary, as there already exists a "Notable YouTube users" list in the main <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> article, and it isn't large enough to require splitting-off. And I contend that the AfD decision made for the later Notable YouTube memes list article applies to this one as well. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 09:54, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> (and <s><b>Keep</b></s>) The list was deleted in August when it was replaced by a category. After the category was deleted, the list was restored. Since then, no one knew this existed, so it is out of date. Instead, many users have edited the individual articles of YouTube users to include lists of people (up to 15 or so I think) in the individual articles of each YouTube user with an article. This has led to constant excessive reverts as articles which are soon speedied are added then removed from each page. I was the one who pointed to this again last night, raising the awareness, and therefore opening up for the new deletion request. I had hoped that people would instead update the list and that the main article could point to this as well, leading to only one place where changes occurr. The nominator redirected all of the links to the main <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> article specifically to the section with the list. The section was renamed shortly thereafter, which will now require changing all of the links again. It seems that a separate list article is warranted to me...

<p>This site is undeniably popular, although not in the same league as Daily Kos, ranking just outside 70,000 on Alexa while Kos is inside the 2,000 mark, but the problem I have here is that I cannot find good sources to remedy the multiple "unsourced" tags on the article. It scores well on a Google search, but this is partly the result of rampant spamming (including to Wikipedia, where it has been linked as a source for numerous rumours in biographies - last I heard blogs were not a good source for such, but that's an aside). However, it scores only four passing mentions in Google News and seven on Factiva, which also appear to be passing mentions ("according to politics1, <i>blah</i>", where <i>blah</i> is a single sentence). All the content appears to be referenced to the primary source, and there is a lot of editorialising going on. I';m certainly not averse to keeping it <i>if</i> we can demonstrate that credible third party sources exist for the content - i.e. substantial critical review of the site, rather than just proof of existence - and we can clean it up to be properly neutral. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:57, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Its a big list of sites and doesn't really go into deeper then "Thorough and smoothly laid out"... and The other Tribune article is more of the same... infact the title says it directly -- sites you might want to checkout.

<dd>First, Toast, I am not upset about you editing my references, I kept them and even cleaned them up a little further. My request came because I had just noticed Patrick's page, and per the rules, it's not the kind of content Wikipedia hosts. Also, Patrick does own savannahcat.com and the yahoo groups linked to from that site, I assume, since the contact e-mail for both is the same. Also, it <b>is</b> an autobiography, even if it has referenced sources; if you follow the <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> link, you'll note the definition is when someone comes to Wikipedia and creates an article about themselves, and why we frown upon that. Finally, you may want to review Wiki policy on <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry</a>. Your first 20 or so edits here at Wikipedia were to add links to Patrick Kelley's breeding site, darkeggs.com, and the next 15 or so to add information about Patrick Kelley in various places and removing spam cleanup tags. I highly suggest reading more at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_Portal_6a3c.html#Departments" title="Wikipedia:Community Portal">Wikipedia:Community_Portal#Departments</a>, because many of your contributions to-date look like spam. <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFiniteyoda_3a20.html" title="User:Finiteyoda">Finiteyoda</a> 23:49, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFiniteyoda_3a20.html" title="User:Finiteyoda">Finiteyoda</a> the Parick Kelley article has ONE link to a site that is owned by him (not TWO as you accused the article of having in your request for deletion). Obviously you said "two" because you thought nobody would check. I mean come on...you have researched every nusance of this article and you are an old pro on Wikipedia. Huge difference between 1 and 2. That said, the one site in question is recongnized by the majority of us as the breed site for Savannahs. Not spam. I have contacted Patrick Kelley about this article and he says he did not write it. I certainly believe him over you because...well..you lie. However your passion for Wikipedia and the Savannah breed are obvious and if this article is deleted I'm sure you and I can work hand in hand and write a new article on Patrick Kelley (and Joyce Sroufe for that matter) that is better suited for Wikepidea.Toast222 09:54, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I apologize if it's one site instead of two, but it doesn't change the argument any. Also, if Patrick Kelley is not user Pfkelley, you might want to tell him that someone on Wikipedia is impersonating him. --<a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFiniteyoda_3a20.html" title="User:Finiteyoda">Finiteyoda</a> 23:20, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Here we go again. Expect to see every article in the Japanese pornography category targeted for deletion because it doesn't meet <i>American</i> standards of notability. The Japanese and American pornography industries are different and to ignore those differences is to create cultural bias at Wikipedia. To put things in perspective, consider a Japanese pornographic superstar like Hitomi Kobayashi. "...long hailed as Japan's Queen of Adult Video...

<ol>
<li>"Performer has been a Playboy Playmate (of the Year or Month) or a Penthouse Pet (of the Year or Month), or similar titles in other major magazines." she has been featured in <i>Bachelor</i> magazine, a premier big-bust adult magazine in japan. <i>Bachelor</i> has consistently featured well-known western models like chloe vevrier and linsey dawn mckenzie, and is similar to <i>Score</i> in north america.</li>
<li>"Performer has been notable or prolific within a specific genre niche" shoko goto has had high output in the big-bust genre of videos despite being in the business for only two years. as verified by the number of her videos on amazon japan (a mainstream outlet that does not list all of her work), as dekkappai has already demonstrated.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> AFAIK notable enough in the Japanese porn scene.

The latter of those would probably be simplest. Considering not very many people outside of Asia, or possibly outside of just Japan, may know how big/established/notable/etc. <i>Bachelor</i> magazine is, it would probably save you a lot of headaches having to justify your keep votes. <tt><a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a></tt>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 03:10, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I apologize if I was a bit cranky up there, Dismas. You were probably unaware of the history behind this-- Earlier in the year, a certain editor who has expressed hostility to this subject on numerous occasions, nominated an extensive "List of Japanese Female Porn Actors" for deletion, edit-warred it down into only blue-links, claimed its function would be served by a category, and then succeeded in having it deleted. He then proceeded to begin systematically nominating for deletion every article in the remaining category. In other words, using underhanded means, he was attempting to censor Wikipedia of any meaningful coverage of the Japanese adult entertainment field. My limited Internet time has, since then, mostly been spent in re-working that list-- extensive sourcing, research, etc. It should be ready for presentation before very long. Once it is up, I fully intend to work on these articles, and make sure they're up to standard. I'll try to work on this particular one later today. If there was a discussion as to guidelines/notability standards in the pornography field, I missed it probably because I don't monitor the entire field, but just the Japanese subjects, which interest me.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is a very useful navigation aid, actually. Isms are often key terms in broader subjects, such as philosophy, medicine, politics, etc. And because these subjects are often very scholastic or esoteric in nature, remembering these terms can be very difficult. So what does one do when he can't quite remember an ism? He tries to look it up. Unfortunately, entering "ism" into Wikipedia's search box only turns up entries in which ism is separated by a space or punctuation mark; it does not return unpunctuated words in which "ism" is part of the spelling. Powers of recognition are much stronger than powers of recall, so being able to look at a list like this would be valuable because the reader may recognize the term he has forgotten once he sees it, thereby curing him of the dreadful <b><a href="../../../t/i/p/Tip_of_the_tongue.html" title="Tip of the tongue">tip of the tongue phenomenon</a></b>. Don't you just hate when that happens? It's like right there, but you just can't quite think of the word. This is especially stressful if it is a subject you need to learn more about for a school or work assignment. This type of list is a Godsend for people suffering from this affliction, and we all do, from time to time. And because the entries are linked, you can check to see if you've recognized the term correctly by clicking on the link and reading its introduction. It's a harmless list which has at least one good use, so there's no harm in keeping it around. And who knows, someone may come up with ways to improve this list in the future, such as sorting it by type of ism. Just some ideas. I hope these help.

<p>Neologism. Article has been criticized heavily for its poor content, degenerating to "electrokinesis in the role-playing game GURPS", which is totally not notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and neologism policy. The term <i>electrokinesis</i> is used in almost none of the fiction that has been referred (which you don't see presently because I previously deleted most of it, although some people keep wanting to reinsert the list of electro-powered characters). Therefore, this is a simple infliction of a neologism in violation of Wikipedia guidelines. The use of it to refer to a superpower has nothing to do with the scientific use of the word, so this is effectively a homynym and still neologism. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 08:43, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I tried to find third party, reputable sources, and it seems as if the hospital at least exists: <a href="http://www.wanganuichronicle.co.nz/localnews/storydisplay.cfm?storyID=3690622&amp;thesection=localnews&amp;thesubsection=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wanganuichronicle.co.nz/localnews/storydisplay.cfm?storyID=3690622&amp;thesection=localnews&amp;thesubsection=" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. However, I couldn't find anything to verify the salacious elements of the article that would make it notable. Without them, it's just another former hospital. It could be, though, that my Google skills are just not what the used to be.&#160;:) <a href="../../../g/z/k/User%7EGzkn_c916.html" title="User:Gzkn">Gzkn</a> 13:58, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The events that are described in the article are real I think, because I found several sources to back up these claims, e.g. <a href="http://www.meactionuk.org.uk/What_Is_It_About_Psychiatry.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.meactionuk.org.uk/What_Is_It_About_Psychiatry.htm" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=204&amp;objectid=10405360" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=204&amp;objectid=10405360" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> and <a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/6-11-14/48163.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/6-11-14/48163.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayden54_117a.html" title="User:Jayden54">Jayden54</a> 14:07, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> as libel toward hospital staff, in that it makes completely unsourced claims that staff physically abused and raped children who were patients. This is a gross violation of WP:BLP. I would have blanked the article except that it is up for deletion. Such claims must be carefully sourced to multiple reliable, verifiable, and independent sources. This article has been around for 6 weeks or so without any references. I don't know if the crimes claimed occurred as described. If someone cares to find newspapers or court records substantiating abuses, a new article could be created, or the present one could be trashed and a new one written. The title should be changed to the actual name of the hospital. Citations should be referenced in the article, not listed here. The cites may not be to lurid blogs telling of "screams during ECT torture." They might yell beforehand, but people are knocked out by electroconvulsive therapy. The actual NZ papers or court records should be carefully cited, not the selective clips from the blog in the first link found by Jayden54. The second link does mention payouts to former patients. The third link I could not get to open. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:56, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A small and now defunct extreme-right Tory political group. Google excluding Wikipedia and forums yields about 40 unique hits, and that includes the Wikitruth version of the Gregory Lauder-Frost article we deleted. Being defunct since the early 90s there is nothing on Google News, also nothing on Factiva, one mention in JSTOR (and that only because <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clive_Derby-Lewis_e31a.html" title="Clive Derby-Lewis">Clive Derby-Lewis</a> is mentioned in tangentially in an article in the Journal of Southern African Studies, and he was a patron of WGI - that is the extent of the mention). The few external sources cited are not about WGI but about Derby-Lewis. The entire article appears to be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">puff</a> and <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamcruftisement</a>, and my review of the sources I was going to use to rewrite this abysmally biased and excessive article leads me to believe that (a) the <i>are</i> no real sources and (b) even if there were the group probably falls below the notability threshold. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 14:20, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm quite certain this magazine is notable as it comes up first in a Google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=DELA,DELA:2006-04,DELA:en&amp;q=drum" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=DELA,DELA:2006-04,DELA:en&amp;q=drum" rel="nofollow">drum</a>, but the article as is doesn't even assert notability. This means there is no prejudice against creation of a <i>sourced</i> article on the magazine. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:53, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Almost no information has been put into this article. All I can get is that there is a magazine that currently exists, that caters to drummers. I don't think that this article would be going anywhere seeing that it was tagged with importance since June. Also, the only reference there is in the article is the magazine's web site. The Wikipedia article comes up 4th when you google it. I say <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiez2_aaaf.html" title="User:Diez2">Diez2</a> 14:36, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes but we are saying that unless more infomation is placed down about the magazine it will more than likely be deleted. Also even in the article there is a comment that is a little POV ('Drum features many intresting sections' is a POV).

<li><b>Delete</b>: redundant.

<li><b>Delete</b> but don't redirect. Disambig. page needed.

<li>I agree that there should be no redirect as there are many different uses for "hero" and many different lists associated with them. The first sentence of the nom is what I meant to say; the last sentence wasn't supposed to be left in, and I have removed it.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I didn't know i was over capitalization, also i would like it if we rename the page and get everyone's option and also we'll need this list because of the new story arc "are you on the list" since the the list is a new story arc we need this to know who is on the list<a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeafGreen_Ranger_2e10.html" title="User:LeafGreen Ranger">LeafGreen Ranger</a> 11:32, 13 December 2006 (UTC)<a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeafGreen_Ranger_2e10.html" title="User:LeafGreen Ranger">LeafGreen Ranger</a> 11:32, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: The insinuations are kind of insulting, but oh well. If it was my suggestions that was the over capitalization, it is because I copied the name from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_List_%28My_Name_Is_Earl%29_6320.html" title="The List (My Name Is Earl)">The List (My Name Is Earl)</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Your right. It <i>should</i> be sourcable, but guess what, after TWO AfDs, there are still no sources to establish to notability of these mods. You'd have thought after two AfDs they might have considered it an important issue.

<li><b>comment</b> Sources should be added, but AFD is not the proper venue for that. <i>Not currently having sources</i> (as opposed to being <i>unverifiable</i>) is not a deletion criterion. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 04:25, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Because, like with any article, finding sources is a tedious process and there is a shortage of editors who go through Wikipedia and perform tedious tasks. Just see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_backlog_317c.html" title="Category:Wikipedia backlog">Category:Wikipedia backlog</a>! (Most Wikipedia articles are not currently sourced!)

<li>But people MUST have complained about lack of sources. It would be in the keep&#160;!voters' best interests to provide sources.

<li>- I'll repost this from further down the discussion because it's relevant here too: "And yet, it's been kept twice and completely failed to be cleaned up. Unless your goingh to do it yourself, it's not going to happen. You all say 'Keep and clean up' yet none of you ever have any intention of actually being one of the people to clean up the article.

<li>I appreciate your position, but disagree with it.

<li><b>Comment</b> While every battle in say, world war 2 is not notable for a 'pedia' that limits its scope like wikipedia, a listing of all the battle could easily be. This allows the few battles which had articles to be put in perspective in the pedia. In the same way, while most of these mods may not have articles, they provide the encylopedic context for the ones that do. <a href="../../../b/f/e/User%7EBfelite_e603.html" title="User:Bfelite">Bfelite</a> 22:49, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>However, there isn't a list of battle avoided in WW2, nor is there a list of ww2 battles there are nearly done. Nor is there a list of ww2 battles that have been cancelled or could have happened if something had changed. Yet this list contains games that can be clumsely put into those groups (I say clumsily due to the poor comparison of WW2 and computer game mods). And before some smart-ass say 'well clean up all the dead/cnacelled etc mods' I'm going to say 'I'm not doing it' Polcies compel people wishing to see an article kept to clean it up. After 2 AfDs it wasn't cleaned up. We are what, 5-6 days, into this AfD and no-one has touched it.

<li>Simple, I don't think the article should be kept. I'm not helping clean up an article I think should be deleted, and the policies compel people wishing to keep it to do so, not people who think it should be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but needs cleanup. The argument that "If a mod isn't notable enough to have it's own article on Wikipedia, then why is it notable enough to be included on a list in Wikipedia?" is flawed.

An item does not need the same degree of notability to be included in a list as it does to merit its own article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Here's an idea: how about people get together and create a wiki specifically created for mods? I know that some people may argue that ModDB is already out there, but frankly ModDB is just not as user-friendly as wikis are, and often has pitifully little information about each mod. By making an openly editable wiki just for mods, both the PC gaming aficionados and the super-psycho-relevance-police (jk, guys) can be happy.

<li>Does being a reporter for BBC News and LA Times assert notability (unless there is a notable achievement)? The persecution claim does account for a case of notability. There are about 2000 Ghits for the search "Mubashir Zaidi". Many include news reports written by the subject of the article himself which are available online. The links related to persecution claims, come from a single incident reported in news stories which was not even mentioned in the article. The article is started and mainly contributed by the user with the same name as the subject of the article. <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoldemortuet_673c.html" title="User:Voldemortuet">voldemortuet</a> 20:21, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think a reporter for major news outlets such as those, not to mention a producer for a major network in one of the most populous countries on earth, is a major assertion of notablility. Of course we'll find articles written by the subject because he's a reporter who write articles. Yes, it appears that the subject might have written this article himself, but that doesn't mean the subject isn't notable. And the persecution claim orginates from <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Rights_Commission_of_Pakistan_f859.html" title="Human Rights Commission of Pakistan">Human Rights Commission of Pakistan</a>, which is independent of this person. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 23:07, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'll regard a journalist from these outlets notable only if he/she has got some notable achievements. Although autobiography doesn't account for deletion but it does show conflict of interest. The main notability about the subject (to which I agree)is the persecution incident which is perhaps one of the few things about the article that are verifiable. Although persecution claim is a part of a long series of events related to persecution of journalists in Pakistan<a href="http://www.hrcp-web.org/pdf/ar_2004/3-3.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hrcp-web.org/pdf/ar_2004/3-3.pdf" rel="nofollow">[47]</a><a href="http://hrcp-web.org/freedom_media.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://hrcp-web.org/freedom_media.cfm" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>. Unless reliable sources are found to validate the whole article, it remains a potential candidate for deletion. As an alternative I suggest to stub the article focussing on the subject as a target of persecution in Pakistan till the whole contents in the article are verified and sourced. I would also like to hear from some experienced wikipedian on the notability of journalists. <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoldemortuet_673c.html" title="User:Voldemortuet">voldemortuet</a> 16:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That is very interesting. Two journalists with the same name who are or have been stationed in Pakistan. Who would've thought? I know the name might be common in south Asia, but still...

<li>Thanks a lot to all of you who took interest in this article. Yes I created my page myself. If you think it should be deleted, then please do it. I have no objection. Mr. Mubashir Zaidi, reporter of Los Angeles Times is a Islamabad based journalist and we haven't met. My home town is Karachi but I am living in Sharjah and working for Geo TV. I would be happy if someone like to contact me mubashirzaidi@hotmail.com... Mubashir Zaidi 5:02, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I have read articles of Mubashir Zaidi in daily Jang and sports magazines. I can remember that he won a TV Quiz ten years ago. I recognized him by his photograph on this page. He is surely that Quiz master. It was a news for me that he is now a TV Producer. Wow... Don't delete his page because we admire him. Humaazeem</p>

<li>I am feeling sorry to take part in this debate. Mubashir Zaidi was a contributor of daily Jang, daily The News, weekly Sports Times, daily Public, monthly Cricketer and many other newspapers at a time. Actually he was a cricket statistician and also compiled a book. I have a copy of 1996 edition of Wisden (people say it cricketer's bible) and I can see his name there. nasrrullah 8 December 2006</li>

<p>A little bit of research goes a long way NawlinWiki. In view of this, your feedback was nonsense. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStathis_Psaltis_bc15.html" title="User:Stathis Psaltis">Stathis Psaltis</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStathis_Psaltis_968d.html" title="User talk:Stathis Psaltis">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stathis_Psaltis_b1cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stathis Psaltis">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Please refer to the link to the Thessaloniki International Film Festival for information on the credibility of this award. Furthermore, your policy on deleting material that you are not familiar with is very discriminatory and limits the beauty of Wiki. My comments on your research, NawlinWiki in particular, are justified considering the intention on deleting this entry without having researched it satisfactorily. I will respond to you with the same level of respect / disrespect that you show me. The world is bigger than what we all will ever know and I suggest you are not so quick to delete articles which have some credibility attached. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStathis_Psaltis_bc15.html" title="User:Stathis Psaltis">Stathis Psaltis</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStathis_Psaltis_968d.html" title="User talk:Stathis Psaltis">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stathis_Psaltis_b1cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stathis Psaltis">contribs</a>) 16:28, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>How many third party published sources would make you content to maintain this entry? Please clarify as there are thousands of wiki entries with 1 or none third party sources. It has been established that this film is a legitimate film, has won awards domestically at Greece's most prestigious film awards and has been played in foreign cinemas around the world. Please justify your motivation to delete this entry and explain with at least some detail what issues you are having in accepting this article. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStathis_Psaltis_bc15.html" title="User:Stathis Psaltis">Stathis Psaltis</a> 00:04, 14 December 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStathis_Psaltis_bc15.html" title="User:Stathis Psaltis">Stathis Psaltis</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStathis_Psaltis_968d.html" title="User talk:Stathis Psaltis">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stathis_Psaltis_b1cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stathis Psaltis">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Also, the reference I provided is not from a press pack. Please check the information. This was easily found on a previous occasion by another editor on the IMDB website. That is a neutral site and is not associated with the film in any manner. As far as further references are concerned, dont be concerned, there are several notable references for this film available on the net. A simple google search can show you this. All references provide a very similar short summary of the film. For example;</p>

All this article intends on doing is stating the existance of this film, and all the above references reinforce the fact that it does exist despite any perceived short fallings of each reference you may have.</p>
<p>The link was to the Greek film festival of Ausrtalia. Spirtokouto featured nationally in every Australian capital city as part of the festival.</p>
<p>The information is not the producers blurb, I have that and I can provide it if you wish. However, based on your feedback I had made further changes to Spirtokouto to make the entry even more neutral.</p>
<p>The intention is only meant to be a simple entry stating the films existance and the existance of this film is beyond any doubt. Keep this is mind. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStathis_Psaltis_bc15.html" title="User:Stathis Psaltis">Stathis Psaltis</a> 03:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not enough that the film exists - it has to be notable, and verifiably so. My Grandmother exists. I could prove it if I had to (with independent web links, including newspaper articles). She's a lovely lady, but she's by no means <i>notable</i>.</dd>
<dd>I have never questioned the existence of the film named Spirtokouto. I merely question it's notability.</dd>
<dd>From my own searches, I accept that the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thessaloniki_Film_Festival_3a2c.html" title="Thessaloniki Film Festival">Thessaloniki Film Festival</a> is notable (although <i>its</i> article needs improvement). I accept that the Golden Alexander award at the festival is significant, and its winners are notable. I accept that Spirtokouto won the Greek Film Critics Association Award (based on <a href="http://www.filmfestival.gr/2003/uk/44filmfest_archive_item.rhtml?id=285" class="external text" title="http://www.filmfestival.gr/2003/uk/44filmfest_archive_item.rhtml?id=285" rel="nofollow">this link</a>). I do not feel any evidence has been put forward to indicate the Greek Film Critics Association Award is a notable acheivement.

<dd>That's quite a big difference of opinion in the matter. Can someone of authority offer some clarity as to what the guidelines are for Parlimentary Candidates? I'd imagine that many article's fates ride on the decision. If it is allowed, then I think the article's importance overweighs any 'vanity' issues, and I would be inclined to vote for 'keep'. It is important to note, most of User:antonylittle 's edits have been to remove inappropriate content. Reverieuk 18:26, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>At the moment there is no authoritative policy or guideline. My comment above is my personal opinion, with which other Wikipedians disagree. Use your judgment. Over time, a consensus policy or guideline may emerge from the process of many people using their judgment on many specific articles.

<p>"Keep" Follow me was a popular english course from the BBC that you would buy in a set of Video Cassettes in Colombia where it was well known. I was trying to find references in internet about this program because I just remember one of its funny musical didactical scenes</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I found several references to the show, including <a href="http://www.crystalreference.com/DC_articles/English104.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.crystalreference.com/DC_articles/English104.pdf" rel="nofollow">this article (middle of page 2)</a> which asserts that 100 million Chinese people watched.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i> 17:08, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's another passing reference, it does comment that the program was widely viewed in China but does not cover the subject in depth sufficient to support an article. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChondrite_3324.html" title="User:Chondrite">Chondrite</a> 06:12, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>True. I guess my point is that if 100 million Chinese watched the show, then it must be notable. So, I think it is worth keeping as a stub and giving people a chance to flesh it out and find information and sources.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i> 14:40, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

Towers below 400m are relatively common in the USA, and none of the towers that I am nominating are notable in any way whatsoever, as far as I can tell.

<li><b>Delete all</b>I can't see that just because something exists it needs an article in this encyclopedia. These articles seem to be spews from other online databases: find a database, make hundreds of articles from it. No effort is apparently made to show how any is notable. All we get are a bunch of stale copies of someone else's data base. Are they all uniquely designed an built, or do they just come out of a factory assembly-line style? Why not create a meaningful article about the styles, manufacturers and assembly methods of towers, how they evolved over the decades, and how the height affects the signal strength and reception area? <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 22:05, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> First off none of them are notable. KVLY channel 11, the NBC television affiliate based in Fargo, North Dakota, uses the <b>tallest above-ground structure in the world for broadcasting its signal</b>. The KVLY-TV mast rises 2,063 feet (628.8 m) high, and set the standard for current height limitations in the United States. The steel tower is <i>taller than the</i> <b>combined height</b> <i>of the Great Pyramid Khufu at Giza, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and the Washington Monument</i>...and THAT tower is just mentioned as part of the channels' article.

<li><b>Comment</b> the article has just recently gone under a <i>major</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Los_Angeles_street_gangs&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=92904905" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Los_Angeles_street_gangs&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=92904905" rel="nofollow">attrition</a>. When it was brought to AFD, it was a huge, unverifiable mess.

<li>The point I was making initially, was that if the article is pared down to just the list of notable gangs (as it is now), the article is still not worth keeping.

<li><b>Delete</b>. There's already a category system for gangs, including a subcategory for Gangs by location, so a list of only bluelinks is redundant.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. While I'm generally of the opinion that articles such as this would be much better as a category, there are a couple of regular editors who are making efforts to sort through the redlinks making stubs for the worthy and removing the non-notable.

<dd>One and a half years old and the article has grown to become a <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7EListcruft_3123.html" title="WP:Listcruft">Listcrufty</a> red linked directory of backup software which is of interest to a very limited number of people. From the points you mentioned above, it sounds like your trying to create either a directory or comparisons of backup software. We all agree <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>, so Why not remove it as you did last February with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_accounting_software" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_accounting_software" rel="nofollow">List of accounting software</a>, and create <i>comparison of backup software</i> (That would make for an encyclopedic read), Untill then, implement this directory into a catagory.</dd>

<dd>For <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_accounting_software.html" title="List of accounting software">List of accounting software</a>, I merged the list into the comparison before deletion. If a comparison page is made that is a superset of this list (or at least contained all blue linked products), I'd agree with deletion. (Furthermore, list of accounting software had only a list of blue links in alphabetical order--there was no categorization or potentially notable products to write stubs for.)</dd>
<dd>But there isn't yet a comparison &amp; so deletion is premature. This list doesn't exist ONLY to describe services offered.

<ul>
<li>Any index that contains almost 50% empty articles (30 blue 27 red, excuding uncategorized) hardly serves its purpose as an index. Editing efforts would be much better spent placing this drectory into its own catagory and developing the 30 current articles to their full potential. <a href="../../../h/u/1/User%7EHu12_d0ca.html" title="User:Hu12">Hu12</a> 02:12, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>So what ratio would you define as the cutoff? The redlinks are one reason why we can't merely create a cat--these are requested articles. The largest problem, I think, is with the "Managed backup service providers" section that was merged in. It has fewer blue links than red links and is the source for ~60% of the red links in the article. I think we need a semi-objective way to cleanup that particular section. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 17:39, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> this seems like a fair list of software, and it's not just a bunch of external links. There is real content here. I don't see a reason to delete.

<li>FWIW, my filtering rubric is remove all redlinks that are up for longer than six months &amp; remove anything that has had an article deleted from WP. GraemeL and I have compromised that there will be no external links to commercial and proprietary products, but that the URLs will appear in HTML comments so that subs can be created. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 00:49, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>FWIW</b>is that links are of a lesser degree of criteria for notability and non-commercial, and so on than articles, and the appropriate thing to do with a dubiously notable article about a product is to make it a link. And that red links is the source of future growth. But Karnesky &amp; I take opposite positions on almost all aspects of this. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 08:30, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>These two appear to be characters in a book called "The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray" which doesn't even have its own article. I think it suffices to say that they fail <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> in a big way. I prodded Thaniel Fox a few days ago and it was removed by the article's author with the reason "I think its unfair that my article is going to be deleted when others such as dinosaur planet and many of the comic book character pages remain even though mine is much better written." <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 21:06, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. And I still think its a good reason. Removing it simply because YOU don't think its noteworthy is a personal opinion and unfair as their are countless, even shorter articles, about even more obscure characters that remain here regardless. Nubula 09:32, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The existence of other articles does not justify this one. It only means that I have not seen those articles and therefore have assessed them as to their notability. If they truly are more obscure and less notable, I can assure you that they will be listed for deletion as well. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 22:04, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. And if your major complaint is the fact that The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray doesn't have its own page then fine, I'll go ahead and write it. Happy? Nubula 09:59, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You seem to be missing the point. These characters are not notable, which is a fact, not an opinion. The book's notability is an entirely different question and you may want to look at <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> for that. These character pages are entirely not notable enough for their own pages, however, because they can easily be included in the main article's page under a "Characters" section. A problem many new editors have is the compulsion to create character articles for every character in their favorite book. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 22:04, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Personaly I think, even if you remove the biography, their is still far to much information about this character to just slip it in on the main page. Nubula 11:30, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Also, now I think about it, your claim that this characters lacks notability is just an opinion, and not a fact, unless you can back it up with evidence in some way. Have you conducted a vervifiable poll or have some other form evidence to prove the character has no signifigant following? Nubula 15:50, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> article asserts notability, is carefully referenced and supported by reliable sources, and possesses a neutral point of view. The central argument in favour of deletion is that Zanta fails notability.

However <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is not an exclusionary list, and Zanta should be considered an actor who has had numerous media appearances.

Because we non-Canadians didn't hear about Zanta before doesn't make him less notable, it just means we didn't know about him. There is a cultural issue here as well, as odd as Zanta may be, since deleting Zanta would appear to be the removal of a Toronto Pop Icon from the Wikipedia, which means all other pop icons are suspect (such as <a href="../../../n/a/k/Naked_Cowboy_dd1b.html" title="Naked Cowboy">Naked Cowboy</a>, who was only elevated in status to support publicity). Not everyone lives in the United States, and not everyone has the same influences. That said, having read the article I find it appears to be factual, and establishes notoriety to a fair degree. In this regard, he passes the grandchildren test: If you see him, you would probably tell your grandchildren (and they would probably look it up). While not something I see as a valuable resource, I see no harm in keeping it as a part of a large and rich world culture. However, if it is selected for deletion I do expect to see Naked Cowboy in queue for deletion with this entry's result as a precedent. If it's good for the goose, it's good for the Naked Gander. --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaranRampersad_d7aa.html" title="User:TaranRampersad">TaranRampersad</a> 16:50, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> The self-referential aspect of the whole thing is problematic. On the other hand, there has been a little bit of media attention and maybe enough for a small article. Maybe delete voters would be more comfortable with keeping if there were added references and if it did not feel so much like an article written as self-promotion by people involved in the project. The question we should ask is: would we be keeping this article if it was about a selection of Encarta articles somehow freely distributed by some NGO? I believe we would. But we also have to realize that we would delete the unreferenced details and the same should be done in this case. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 00:14, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>If it was an article about Encarta, and there were multiple reliable sources discussing the selection, then yes, I'd probably&#160;!vote keep.

<li>I would find it helpful for my general education if some can point me at something explaining self-reference in the context of reliability versus in the context of notability. There is a bit of Catch 22 because (in the lost edit history) initially it didn't link to or discuss the project pages at all but we were told we needed reliable references. Also were told (see talk) that the page had to mention as yet unpublished WP projects to avoid NPOV (I didn't like this). I will have a go at removing self-reference anyway and put in a couple of review comments to see if it can be improved. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 09:44, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Please note that we remove many such articles that relate to Wikipedia from the mainspace, and this is not a different example. Please also note that higher notability of a Wikipedia-releated subject is still not a reason to move it to the mainspace; for instance, it is expected that the the term "Wikipedian" might also have a lot of notability established by Google hits and publications, yet still does not have its own mainspace article. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 17:54, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

The notability of the subject is also a potential issue, although one that is directly related to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>—if adequate verification can be provided, it is likely that the notability issue will also be addressed. I see that there has been some effort towards finding references as discussed on the article's talk page. As there is active effort with some promise of being fruitful on fixing the primary issue with the article, I'm closing this now as no consensus.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but move to concert t-shirt. The title is indeed inapropriate, and the article itself mentions that there are other colours. I think that everyone agrees that most bands sell T-shirts during their tours (black or otherwise); therefore how is it non-notable? It is a source of income for bands, a common type of clothing for music fans (there is a section about this type of clothing on the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_fashion.html" title="Heavy metal fashion">heavy metal fashion</a> article for example). I agree that there are reasons to delete this article, but non-encyclopedic is not one of them.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Article was nominated for deletion due to un-encyclopedic nature. This is very clearly a fashion trend, of which there are thousands of other wikipedia articles. Fashion trends that are written about in news papers and magazines are clearly encyclopedic. The specific black color is probably the most common, or commonly thought of, color for rock concert T's, which is why the article is so titled. The black color is a trend by itself separate from concert T's in general. There are now 3 different references. Having a main article called Concert T-shirt is not required for this article to exist. What this article needs most is more content and references specifically written about the topic rather than just mentioning the topic. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattarata_b773.html" title="User:Mattarata">Mattarata</a> 15:44, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, there is already a section in both those articles about this item. It seems to me that if two seperate articles need to mention it then it's notable, right? Otherwise it wouldn't be mentionned anywhere else, and definitely not have a whole section in both cases. What's more, take a look at <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocker_jacket.html" title="Rocker jacket">rocker jacket</a> and <a href="../../../k/u/t/Kutte.html" title="Kutte">kutte</a>. Why are these clothing items more notable? Neither of them even has a single reference, whereas this article has one and two external links. However, as mentionned on the talk page of this article, I support moving this to a broader title, like band T-shirt (which is <i>at least</i> as notable as a torn denim jacket with patches, cf <a href="../../../k/u/t/Kutte.html" title="Kutte">kutte</a>). <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>Iron</b></a><a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_Esperanza_81b2.html" title="User:IronChris/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>C</b></font></a><a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>hris</b></a> | <a href="../../../i/r/o/User_talk%7EIronChris_59e6.html" title="User talk:IronChris">(talk)</a> 18:08, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The other articles aren't up for debate here. This can be more than adequately represented in the existing articles which keeps all the information in one place, rather than forked into an unnecessary article called "Black concert T-shirt".

<li><b>Comment</b> WP:NOT is irrelevant because this list is not an indiscriminate collection of information; rather, the criteria for inclusion are quite specific, and all items in the list are clearly related by geography and line of business. Nor is this a directory, since the list includes no contact information. WP:V does not apply; every establishment has a sign or mailbox or directory listing which is a published record of its existence and makes it verifiable. WP:LOCAL is irrelevant, since this is the fashion district for the country, making the shops and their culture of nationwide interest. "Seems wholly irrelevant" is not a basis for deletion. Notability is not a criterion for inclusion in the article; whether or not the individual shops are notable doesn't matter. Notability is a criterion for the subject of the article; this subject is definitely notable. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 01:22, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Indifferent</b>. I began and wrote most of the article back in March. At the time, I thought it was important. It's not the best of my work. Still, Sendagaya, Shibuya remains the fashion design centre for Japan and if anyone knows anything about fashion, what those teenage shoppers buy in Shibuya, the world gets a year later. This is a list of shops - as in ateliers - not places for shoppers to <i>buy</i> clothes but for designers, suppliers, writers, media, modeling agencies and <b>buyers</b> to come together. Still, if the article was merged into the Sendagaya or Shibuya article or an article about fashion/design in Tokyo/Japan, I'd be cool with that. I won't be the one to do it, however. Bigger fish to fry. (P.S. Thanks Fg2 for the valiant defence.) (I noticed I didn't sign earlier today when I wrote in.

<p>To clarify, I am <i>not</i> relisting World of Warcraft terminology because of a question of usefulness or value in the information (ie "fancruft"). Rather, I am relisting it because, even months after the original nomination and having been tagged and discussed on the talk page, the article still contains no verifiable references. The article was originally kept under the assumption that the information within is verifiable. However, those references have not been provided. Even the original author of the article has conceded on the talk page that he is constantly deleting unverified and often probably inaccurate terminology, and was himself considering deletion. I recommend that either the article receive at least SOME citations for verifiable terms, or if nothing is verified during this afd discussion then the article be deleted and only reconstructed when proper citations can be provided. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:41, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>P.S. I'd suggest refraining from bringing up issues of being "unencyclopedic" or "fancruft", etc. Those issues were discussed in depth in the original afd discussion and were apprently rejected. Thus I'd suggest remaining focussed here solely on the question of verifiability and references, to avoid confusing the issue.

<dd>The fact that nobody will be playing in 25 years (even if that's true, which I'm tending to doubt considering the massive appeal of the game, UO's survived about 10 years now after all...) doesn't make it less relevent. Pop culture is pop culture.

<dd>I agree with Ryan above. The "cruft" issue has already been debated in detail in the previous afd discussion, so this nomination works under the assumption that the article <i>does</i> have useful information for readers. The problem is that none of the information is referenced or verified, and has been so for a long time, which means that as a policy matter it should be deleted if that can't be rectified (articles need to use only information verified by external published sources). <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:52, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You know, I kind of dislike it when people wave around lack of sources as the only deletion reason. But this article shows the exact opposite: Just because some <i>fact</i> is well sourced, it doesn't mean it can be included. (It can be included if it's <i>relevant</i>.) And it certainly doesn't mean it should be created as <i>an article of its own</i>. This article has relevant, sourced facts, yes, but creating an <i>individual article</i> about the facts is completely needless. This is merge material at best, and if the article on the players involved already has the material, then it's delete material at worst. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 16:48, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It appears you don't know the primary reason why AfD exists: we're here to determine whether or not the article's subject warrants an article of its own. There's <i>every</i> reason to bring the article to AfD if there's a doubt that it doesn't; every editor who's familiar with what material Wikipedia tends to keep would take one look at the article and think "should this be deleted or merged?"... the nominator went "I'm kind of leaning toward delete, let's ask what others say." Pretty much no one would think that this has potential as a stand-alone article; it's merge or bust.

<li><b>Delete</b>, as per above - there are only two "Late Night with" shows; Conan's has an extensive page which already covers the history of the post-Dave transformation, and Dave's covers the history of the ending of his show and moving to CBS (Late Show is more of a continuation of Dave's Late Night than Conan's Late Night). I would say this page should actually redirect to <a href="../../../l/a/t/Late_Night_1820.html" title="Late Night">Late Night</a>. Another way of looking at it is that the production company that produced the Dave's Late Night moved on to produce Late Show. Lorne Michaels was brought in to produce a totally new show. The only retention was the name, and the format of a talk show. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 21:43, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Having once had a difference of opinion with someone is not reason enough to ignore sense in what he says, especially when backed by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">wikipedia policy</a>. <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> has correctly pointed out that in many cases, apparent notability often turns up as google-bombing upon further investigation.

<p><strike>Prod removed. This article has two citations, one noting Donald Trump's regular salary and the other his fee for speaking engagements. The article, however, contains a mathematical formula (not cited) that is either OR, a joke, or both. Also, the title "Trump Rate" appears to be a neologism.

It would solve the current problem of having a page on Trilby and 5 Days, but not one on 7 Days (which was previously deleted as a result of AfD).

Neither of these are very satisfying, but as long as the indiviual games have redirects to the main article, its not vitally important.

<li>I've decided to post a list to help you on your deletion crusade.

<p>These aren't notable so delete this article: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_amateur_adventure_games.html" title="List of amateur adventure games">List of amateur adventure games</a></p>
<p>Why bother? Amateur developers aren't commercial and that makes them unimportant. Not notable: <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_adventure_game.html" title="Amateur adventure game">Amateur adventure game</a>.</p>
<p>These are what allow people to create their own games and not make a profit so I don't think anyone needs to know about these: <a href="../../../a/d/v/Category%7EAdventure_game_engines_7dcb.html" title="Category:Adventure game engines">Category:Adventure game engines</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Category%7EText_adventure_game_engines_2bd3.html" title="Category:Text adventure game engines">Category:Text adventure game engines</a></p>

<ul>
<li>I have already tagged many such pages for deletion. However, it has nothing to do with being commercial. <i>Software is notable if it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.</i> As it happens, very few games created by amateurs using game creation software can make that claim. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 03:45, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>To elaborate: it's clear to me that, say, <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cave_Story_6d82.html" title="Cave Story">Cave Story</a>, is quite notable, despite being noncommercial, due to the great deal of critical coverage in independent, notable, reliable sources. However, Ben Croshaw's titles do not have this sort of critical recognition. Not that I feel that they are without merit because they are obscure, but that they are simply not suited for a general purpose encyclopedia due to notability requirements. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 03:53, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Seriously, how can the notable quality of Ben Croshaw even be worth of discussion? The guy won innumerous awards for his games, check out their pages:
<ul>
<li>www.fullyramblomatic.com/5days</li>
<li>www.fullyramblomatic.com/7days</li>

<p>Also, he'd been featured in many specialized magazines (I'm sorry I don't know links to prove this, but I've seen such magazines.</p>
<p>And one more thing, to prove the man capabilities, he have been working on a fairly well known australian games mag to write for it (if you also don't belive this, buy a mag and see it for yourself)</p>

<li>I'm not asking for sources for specific claims, I'm saying that I've looked for multiple nontrivial sources, none exist, and therefore the topic is not notable. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 21:38, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If your saying it needs a source then the right action I think is to put a request for it on page. If you mean you want a specific source saying its notable, the existing ones provide that- given the current notability guidlines for video and computer games. <a href="../../../b/f/e/User%7EBfelite_e603.html" title="User:Bfelite">Bfelite</a> 22:00, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They certainly do not. The current sources are the official site, a specialized abandonware website, a wiki created by users of the AGS software, and a download page. Of those, only the Abandonia Reloaded link is potentially a notable one, and even that's arguable. We need multiple, non-trivial sources. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 22:09, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Most historical games do not have multiple non-trivial web-sources that can be found on the web. A link to a online magazine or paper magazine would be better, I agree. However, im not sure thats grounds for deletion. <a href="../../../b/f/e/User%7EBfelite_e603.html" title="User:Bfelite">Bfelite</a> 22:56, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I never said the links have to be on the web. They can be print sources. Also, this game is hardly historical, it's from 2004. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 22:59, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't say they had to be on the web either, I agree that print sources would be good. The main issue is if the need for sources means it should be deleted. Articles are usually given various tags rather then AFD when this is the case. <a href="../../../b/f/e/User%7EBfelite_e603.html" title="User:Bfelite">Bfelite</a> 23:03, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not the need for sources but the need for proof of notability. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 23:24, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would still recomend adding tags for sources rather then AFD. Opinions about notability vary on the wikipedia, as do opinions about what sources establish notablity. If your basis for non-notablity is the quality of sources (not merely that there sources exist), then the solution is to request more sources. <a href="../../../b/f/e/User%7EBfelite_e603.html" title="User:Bfelite">Bfelite</a> 00:00, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Funny how the press coverage only occured over a couple of days... Heck, lets give everyone and everything an article just for appearing on television! (detect sarcasm) We didn't even know about the pig until it died, and now the media has forgotten about it. And wow, he lived 4 years beyond his life expectancy... so by your definition we should give all cancer patients articles if they live beyond the timeframe biologically expected for them.

<p>Original essay, for a term which only gets 15 Google hits (and 1 in Google Books and 5 in Google Scholar).

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. I'm actually interested in information technology-related rhetoric myself, but there doesn't seem to be evidence that this term is in wide circulation. Some scholars may be excited about this but apparently there isn't much published using this term yet. Wikipedia should not be used as a platform for promoting new academic terms or other neologisms - to allows this would lead to conflicts of interest or even spam (see the disputes over Loughborough "colonization" (my term) of an article over at <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_city.html" title="Global city">Global city</a> for instance). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:34, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup and wikify. This is exactly what Wikipedia is for, to synthesize information from diverse sources. Its not a neologism if its been published, now its a word in use, although obscure.

<dd>Being published may involve the public coining of a term, but it doesn't turn a neologism into a widely accepted term. Obscure terms may be notable, but not if they're so obscure that they have very little published material to back them up even in their own field. Neologisms constructed from synthesis (or out of whole cloth) are being made all the time - especially in academia, where a main activity is discussing concepts, critiquing them and forming new ones - and publishing them. That's a key way for academics to develop a reputation for oneself or one's research group. Not every published new idea is encyclopedically notable or even significantly influential in its own field however. Wikipedia is <i>not</i> for the promotion of new ideas, original research and neologisms.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I found the article informative, enlightening, and consistent with other articles on Wikipedia related to <a href="../../../p/o/s/Posthumanism.html" title="Posthumanism">posthumanism</a>. That the human condition is beginning to blur is just another sign that we are approaching <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technological_singularity.html" title="Technological singularity">technological singularity</a>. Wikipedia is supposed to be a repository of all human knowledge, with Jimbo being quoted on that issue many times. If someone comes across the title of a book with "Posthuman Rhetoric" in it, they may very well look it up on Wikipedia to find out what the heck that means. An article should be waiting here for them. Two of the scholars mentioned are notable in their fields, and all three are educators, which means they have students. If this article can help those students, then I'm all for it. Their reaction might be, "wow, Wikipedia has just about <i>everything!</i>" That's what being encyclopedic is all about. They may also see the value of collaborating through a centralized entity like Wikipedia, and join the community. &#160;<i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th<font color="blue">e Tr<font color="#9ACD32">ans<font color="#FFCC00">hu<font color="orange">man<font color="red">ist</font> &#160;&#160;</font></font></font></font></font></a></b></i>10:06, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Rhetorical flourishes by Jimbo doesn't change that.
