<p>Before anyone asks, yes, this is this articles 4th visit to VFD/AFD, which I assume is a record. <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_notable_eccentrics_ba07.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of notable eccentrics">the second trip can be found here</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_people_widely_considered_eccentric_8d46.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of people widely considered eccentric">the third trip here</a>, and apparently the first occurred <a href="../../../a/r/c/Wikipedia%7EArchived_delete_debates_2003_18d1.html" title="Wikipedia:Archived delete debates/2003">before Wikipedia even had archiving for delete debates!</a>. So, needless to say, this article has been around the block a few timesdue in large part to a few reasons. <s>Despite this record, this article also probably is close to the record for the most reverts and the most NPOV notices (excluding <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.

<li>Who defines eccentricity? What is considered eccentric? And by who's authority and viewpoint? The closest I've known anyone ever coming to this would be in the <a href="../../../d/s/m/DSM_IV_2543.html" title="DSM IV">DSM IV</a>, but even those definitions are fairly generalized and subjective, which leads me to my next point.</li>
<li>Unlike most articles, this one could eventually become a breeding ground for <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> violations. One user might consider another user "eccentric" or "wierd" and place them on there.</li>
<li>What defines "widely"? That's another fairly subjective term, "widely" to one person can be entirely different than "widely" to someone else. If anyone has a precedent on what that actually is (I have a viewpoint on my user page, but that's just a viewpoint and not binding towards anything other than that), please let me know.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the very least, this article needs to be renamed, and drastically cleaned up, perhaps to the point of where it would need to become a <a href="../../../c/o/t/WP%7ECOTW_227d.html" title="WP:COTW">Collaboration of the Week</a> for it to be fixed. Otherwise, it'll probably be back here again and again, like it has in the past.

<li>Yes, he could have been, if any significant groups had tried to paint his unusual activities as "eccentric" rather than either "holy and righteous" or "dangerously subversive". But since none did, he doesn't belong on the "list of people widely considered eccentric". This list is not about people who <i>are</i> eccentric, it's about people who have been <i>considered</i> eccentric. Hence even if Jesus shares some traits with people on this list, it doesn't matter as long as few, if any, would associate him with eccentricity. This page is as much about popular opinion as about the people listed themselves; it would even be appropriate to list someone who a smear campaign tried to label as "eccentric", as long as that view has become a very dominant one. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:40, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You could say the same thing about almost hundreds of perfectly good lists on Wikipedia. Almost all Wikipedia lists have as an unstated policy that only people who are already noteworthy enough to have their own article on Wikipedia merit inclusion on the list.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - The list may have some POV entrees in its currently, but that does not imply that the list is <i>inherently</i> POV, and if it's at all fixable, even if it would require months of work, it doesn't fit the standards for deletion. If <i>you</i> don't feel like putting the effort in to try to clean up the article and bring it up to standards, then don't bother; but don't prevent <i>others</i> from working on improving it by voting to delete it, unless you truly think that it's totally unsalvagable. The fact that a topic is disputable does not imply that it is impossible to write about; just because different people have conceptions of what is or isn't eccentric doesn't mean that there <i>aren't</i> people who are widely considered eccentric. Additionally, "eccentric" is hardly comparable to "list of fat people" or "list of stupid people", as it's a very specific term, is certainly not strictly pejorative, and, even if it isn't <i>universally</i> conceived of in a singular, exact way, it's still certainly <i>very widely</i> conceived of as having a certain set of noteworthy traits. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:00, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Also, merging this article into <a href="../../../e/c/c/Eccentricity_%28behavior%29.html" title="Eccentricity (behavior)">eccentricity (behavior)</a>, even in the smallest of ways, also isn't a good idea, as the list would either dominate a very small article, or be trimmed down enormously without us having had time to discuss any changes—instead, let's trim <i>this article</i> down by removing all people on the list who <i>aren't</i> widely considered eccentric, and myabe <i>someday</i>, a few years down the line, when the list is at a managable level and the "eccentric behavior" article is several pages long, the two can be merged. Whether we shorten it or keep it at the same size, merging it into that eccentric behavior article would just make the page less useful for everyone. The fact that many people on the list specifically <i>say</i> in their article that they are widely considered eccentric, some even mentioning it in the opening paragraph(!), shows that claims of the term's total subjectivity are inconsistent with its usage throughout Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:00, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Seeing as how the list tells WHY they are considered eccentric, this page may not have complete NPOV, but still allows the reader to make up thier own minds.

<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree entirely with Rarr's description of this as a "valid article", Comic's statement that there is "no harm in keeping it, but we lose something if we don't," and it has nothing to do with the POV red herring. No one has yet said anything about <i>why this list ever should have been started to begin with,</i> and I do believe that list writers have to meet a burden of proof to show that. What purpose does putting ~150 people's names into a list serve? How can this list expand anyone's understanding of the concept of <a href="../../../e/c/c/Eccentricity_%28behavior%29.html" title="Eccentricity (behavior)">eccentricity</a>, or expand someone's knowledge about any of the listed people? I contend that it cannot, and as such, <i>the list makes no positive contribution to Wikipedia and two negative ones</i>: it wastes server space and adds clutter, and worse, it furthers the false and detrimental attitude that vapid, unproductive, lists are permissible. I believe that this is a vapid, unproductive list, and will continue to do so until someone convinces me not that we <i>can</i> build an objective list of eccentrics, but that we <b>should</b> build such a list. Until such time, I strongly urge all editors to join me in calling for this entry's deletion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 01:47, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There are several figures in history who are mostly noted for being eccentric. Several books and documentaries of eccentric people have been done. A list allows you to easily get to articles concerning such people without the same kind of groping a category or nothing would do. Now the list as it currently stands is poor, but you can strongly urge something without being right. If it is to be deleted I hope there is in least a category for eccentrics to replace it unless there is such a category already.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>As you've noticed, there is a Category:Notable eccentrics. However, don't rush off to add people to that category quite yet: if this deletion succeeds, that one will inevitably follow very quickly, as there's even <i>more</i> of a case for deleting the category than the article (i.e. the category is genuinely POV because it specifically says that the people listed <i>are</i> "eccentrics"; the page is not inherently POV, because it says "people <i>widely considered</i> eccentric": it's <i>about</i> POVs, it's not POVed itself). Personally, I'd support keeping both the category (though rename the category to "People widely considered eccentric"; the "noteworthy" is unnecessary, both because it's POV and because anyone noteworthy enough to be on Wikipedia is already noteworthy enough to be in the category, hence redundant) <i>and</i> the list. Or, if I had to choose one or the other, I'd probably choose: the list. Why? Consider:
<ol>
<li>Lists are maintained on a single page that anyone can easily monitor and check on the validity of each new addition to the page, while also ensuring that noone who belongs on the page gets removed. Categories, being based on edits to hundreds of distinct articles, are next to impossible to keep clean of bogus additions, especially when they get large. The easiest way to maintain the category would be to have both the category and the list, and simply once in a while go through the category with the list in hand and check to see if there's anyone on the list who's not on the category, or vice versa; then investigate why the discrepency exists, and correct it (either by removing the person from one or adding the person to the other).</li>
<li>With a list, it's possible to list <i>explanations</i> next to each person to specify <i>why</i> they're considered eccentric. Even if you think that the current way the LoPWCE handles descriptions is poor (I certainly do), it's <i>improvable</i> and could eventually be quite valuable, whereas with a category there will never be an efficient way to explain <i>why</i> each person is on the list; it's nothing but a big alphabetized list of names, no more useful to someone not familiar with the individuals than if the page was total gibberish. If we had both the list and the category, the category could be the quick, easy, shorthand version of the list, providing the brief alphabetized archive, whereas the list would be more expansive and informative, providing further subdivisions to make exploration easier—whereas the category makes it easier to find a <i>single person</i> who you already know of and are looking for, which I'd say is less important than the list's role, because if you already know the guy's name you can just do a Search for him anyway. Descriptions, on the other hand, highlight perceived eccentric behavior, occupation, nationality, etc. and give people much more to work with.</li>
<li>Criticize the current list if you want for not being cited (I added a NOR tag to it, incidentally, so we can get started on the long-term mission of adding sources for all the claims eventually), but keep in mind that it's at least eventually <i>possible</i> to have a fully-cited, expansive, high-quality article named "List of people widely considered eccentric", even if that's not a practical likelihood (though I think it is!). Categories make citation impossible; we just have to accept the people included as gospel, and centralizing debate over which people to include and which not to include will be <i>nightmarish</i> without an article page, as much of the discussion of who is and isn't "widely considered eccentric" will end up centering on the pages of the individual people described, making consistency a huge issue! Having both list and category gives us the best of both worlds, tying everything into a single article but <i>also</i> involving each individual article in the article by putting the category at the bottom of their pages. Win-win.</li>

<dd>Anyway, sorry for the length of that. It's not like this article is a pet project of mine; I only recently stumbled onto it, and had just barely begun to make changes to it at all, when the AfD notice abruptly appeared after my first edit. Very disheartening, but the last few votes have given me a little hope that people are willing to give this article a fourth chance, and see what can be made of it. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 03:22, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> and possibly <b>rename</b>. The current name arose from the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_notable_eccentrics_ba07.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of notable eccentrics">second deletion debate</a> back in December 2004. A number of users have brought up concerns about the term "widely", and I agree. In the second debate. the original proposed name was "List of individuals who are famous for being widely considered to be eccentric". I cut it down to "List of people widely considered to be eccentric", and soon another user moved it to its current title, without the "to be" (which was a big <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elements_of_Style_aa68.html" title="Elements of Style">Elements of Style</a> blunder on my part&#160;:-) ). Looking back on the original title, I think the "famous" part was more important than the now-disputed "widely" part, mostly because I think it's a good idea to keep this to people famous for their eccentricity, perhaps among other things. So, how about this for a new title: List of people famous for being considered eccentric. Anyway, now I'll try to get off that tangent... We'll never agree on an <i>absolute</i> place to draw the line between "eccentric" and "normal", but I think most of the people on this list do belong here. Who would argue that, say, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Hughes_c1be.html" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> isn't enough of a weirdo for this list? How about <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua_A._Norton_8e48.html" title="Joshua A. Norton">Norton I of the United States</a>? Another important point: we're not asserting that the people on this list <i>are</i> eccentric, only that they're <i>perceived</i> as such. But isn't such a judgment unverifiable and subject to bias and original research? Not necessarily. How much dispute can there be, from contemporary accounts and elsewhere, that a lot of people think it's really, really weird to <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Winchester_2c5e.html" title="Sarah Winchester">build a house for 38 years to confuse the spirits</a> or <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Wilson_47c4.html" title="Brian Wilson">spend years doing nothing but lying around in bed</a>? <a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak"><font color="green"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">sɪzlæk</span></font></a> [ <a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak">+t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Szyslak_7616.html" title="Special:Contributions/Szyslak">+c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Szyslak_1b31.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Szyslak">+m</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">+e</font></a> ] 09:44, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not a bad idea, but I think that would cause new problems with many of the people on the list. For example, could we keep Albert Einstein on the list? He's famous for being eccentric, but only because he's <i>already</i> much for famous for other, unrelated things. Furthermore, it doesn't do anything at all to solve the main problem people have had with the current wording: that there's no solid, definite line to draw between "widely considered" and "not widely considered". I don't see a big problem with this myself, since I expect that only a few cases will have disputes over whether or not they're "widely considered" enough, and the rest will be pretty obvious one way or the other, but for those who do object on these grounds, adding "famous" has the exact same problem: where do you draw the line between "famous" and "not famous"? How "famous" do you have to be, and how "eccentric", and how "widely considered"? Personally, I think the ideal way to implement the concept of "people who are famous for being widely considered eccentric" vs. "famous people who are widely considered eccentric" is to keep the list where it is, but have some extra marker, like an asterisk, to denote people who are famous chiefly or entirely <i>because</i> of their eccentricity (as many on the list are), vs. famous historical figures who happen to also be widely considered eccentric. Of course, this line isn't the easiest one to draw in some situations either, since there are a lot of "kind of noteworthy" people who might have a Wikipedia article without their bizarre quirk, but are enormously <i>more</i> noteworthy for it. So.. tricky. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 10:06, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>But what's the point?</i> Yes, Sarah Winchester, Brian Wilson, Norton I, and Howard Hughes may well all be widely considered eccentrics, or famous for their eccentricity, or widely notable people who are or have been regarded as eccentric by a proportionally significant percentage of the population, or whatever you want to call the list. What I <i>don't</i> understand is what reason there is for putting all those people together in a list. Is it just for the amusement of people like Clapaucius? Or the convenience of his hypothetical researcher? Or Silence's claims that it's better than a category? Those aren't good enough for me. Besides, eccentricity is an encyclopedic concept, but that only justifies eccentricity. The listed people may be encyclopedic, but that only justifies their individual articles. Neither justifies the list. As far as I can tell, <i>there is no reason that this list, in any form, by any title, with any inclusionary criteria, should remain on Wikipedia as an independent entry.</i> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 14:54, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I did not base my "keep" vote on the fact that it's better than a category; that argument came later, in response to T. Anthony finding that category and assuming that it would be used if this list was deleted we would simply switch to the category, when I believe that ideally we should use both. While I disagree with the people who have voted to delete this page, I at least <i>understand</i> those who have voted to delete it on the basis that it's unsalvageably biased (though it's not <i>inherently</i> biased, contrary to some votes above) or who think that it should be cut down to only a handful of people and merged into the eccentric behavior article. However, if you base your "strong delete" vote (the only one on the whole page so far) on the fact that you personally simply aren't interested in the topic (which your latest comments have led me to believe; do correct me if I am mistaken) and hence it's "listcruft" to you, I'd take issue with that (though of course you have the right to vote as you wish). The fact that <i>you</i> would never use a page like this doesn't mean that noone else would have a legitimate reason to research noteworthy people who have been considered eccentric throughout history. Additionally, the fact is, while perhaps most of the people on the list of eccentric people currently are also famous for something other than their perceived eccentricity, a large number <i>aren't</i> really noteworthy for anything (or much) other than their unusual, eccentric behavior or qualities. Those sorts of people would not be listed anywhere else on Wikipedia where a person would find their articles while casually browsing, and thus many high-quality, interesting, informative, useful articles on significant topics would almost never be read, even by people with a special interest in eccentrics. Lists and categories like this, disputable and hard to maintain though they may be, are beyond a shadow of a doubt <i>useful</i> to many people, as there are many people who are very interested in and study people throughout history who have defied social norms and established themselves as "eccentrics". And that is the purpose of this page. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 10:36, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
