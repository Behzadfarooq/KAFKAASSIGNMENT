I have voted to delete lists a number of times (usually either due to triviality or the fact that they can better handled through categories), but I think the only effect of removing this list would be to make navigation on topics related to Australian individuals more difficult.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Does a list help navigation if it is not comprehensive and is unlikely to ever be comprehensive? As the nominator observed there is no clear criteria for inclusion or exclusion. If you have a look at the politics sub section for example there is a scattering of prime ministers but not all, the inclusions are definitely random and a very small proportion of Australian politicians which have wikipedia articles are listed.--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 20:39, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your detailed response. I think it would be appropriate to merge this list into a number of smaller, more targeted, and thus more maintainable lists (e.g., List of Australian musicians, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australian_politicians_22c1.html" title="List of Australian politicians">List of Australian politicians</a>, etc.), and then to rename this list <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Australians_a5aa.html" title="Lists of Australians">Lists of Australians</a>, leaving it with links to all of the List of Australian "profession" articles. In response to your points:
<ul>
<li>Although the list (and thus any list based on it) is incomplete, I think it can be made comprehensive by looking through <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralians_01c8.html" title="Category:Australians">Category:Australians</a>.</li>
<li>The current inclusion criteria of "people born in Australia" should obviously probably "notable people born in Australia"--we do not want a directory of millions of Australians. WP probably has articles on a few thousand Australians <i>at most</i>. Once they are distributed over 10 or more articles, their maintenance should be far less problematic.</li>
<li>I think changing it to "<i>notable</i> (per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) and born in Australia" would make it an unambigous and quite exclusionary membership criterion. We could add a hidden note to the article that only individuals who have WP articles should be listed (all of the "Year" pages (e.g., <a href="../../../1/5/2/1526.html" title="1526">1526</a>) do so.</li>
<li>I want to make 2 points regarding references. First, the article links themselves constitute "soft" references (the same is true of including individuals in a category). Second, the requirement for living persons only applies for "negative material" and, I don't think country of birth qualifies under this.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If I can get your support, I am willing to go ahead and split the article myself, add the specific inclusion criterion (notable, Australian, and politician; notable, Australian, and musician; etc.), and try to make them as comprehensive as possible (by adding notable Australians who are on WP)--of course, it would take several days and I would certainly appreciate any help&#160;;-). I look forward to your comments. Cheers, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:12, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Changing the lead to "<i>notable</i> (per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) and born in Australia" would make it a <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">self reference</a> which is generally frowned on. Making a hidden comment about only adding entries for people already on Wikipedia destroys the suggestion that the list is important <i>because</i> it contains redlinks (a comment below). --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 22:22, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I actually meant changing the lead to "notable and born in Australia" -- I did not intend that we should put "per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>" in the article itself, but rather to clarify what I meant as notable. Also, I don't really buy the argument of importance <i>because</i> of redlinks--I think the value of the list lies in aiding navigation and being informative. In fact, I think all redlinks should be removed (either completely deleted or un-linked and left as black text <i>only if</i> there is additional <i>cited</i> information about that person). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:30, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. After looking at this, it really comes down to case of redundant info.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The problem with categories is that the subject has to have an article. In the "Science and Technology" section there are 15 redlinks, all for people or objects or organisations that should have an article. There is much larger number of redlinks there than other sections, reflecting the poor covereage of Australian Scientists in WP.

<dd><b>Comment in response:</b> the red links for scientists are mainly from the article on the <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wentworth_Group_of_Concerned_Scientists_8199.html" title="Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists">Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists</a> and are replicated there - a more useful concise list explaining criteria for inclusion .... Graeme Clark should surely be mentioned in the article on the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cochlear_implant.html" title="Cochlear implant">Cochlear implant</a> - he isn't&#160;?!? - does that mean he wasn't a significant contributor or that the Cochlear implant article is incomplete? I am sure he would be much more interested in having his achievements included in the relevant article than a random list. Similarly the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stump-jump_plough.html" title="Stump-jump plough">Stump-jump plough</a> should be updated to include the Smith brothers, inclusion on the list is no substitute for not making sure the article which is the focus of their achievement is more adequate. The only other orphaned red link is Nathaniel Szymczak - in my ignorance I have never heard of him, he is not linked anywhere - it may be that he should have an article but a red link on a list that fails to explain why he is notable is no solution!--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 20:52, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Further comment</b>: the inclusion of Nathaniel Szymczak would appear to be a joke - he is a 2002 graduate of the University of Illinois <a href="http://chemistry.uiuc.edu/news/BS-02.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://chemistry.uiuc.edu/news/BS-02.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>I haven't voted either way - and I'm not going to.</dd>
<dd>If I am looking for information about an Australian - I probably already know who they are and can just type their name.</dd>
<dd>If I am looking for information about an American - I am probably looking for information about "who was the XXX when YYY happened" or something, and for this I would go to a list of... article like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_dd89.html" title="List of Presidents of the United States">List of Presidents of the United States</a>.</dd>
<dd>I guess, Americans are in the reverse situation so a List of Australians is more useful to non-Australians than it is to Australians.</dd>

<dd>List of lists supported by me - no problem eminently sensible, as discussed by Longhair above. Each list would be judged on its own merits but hopefully have adequate criteria for inclusion.

<dd>Actually, although I can easily create new lists, I'm wondering as to value of a List of Australian academics or aviators that contains only 5 or so names. I have removed all names from the "Architecture", "Politics", and "Sports" sections (leaving only links to the main articles). How about renaming this page <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Australians_a5aa.html" title="Lists of Australians">Lists of Australians</a> and spinning it off into separate lists where possible, but leaving in particularly short sections? This would leave in sections like "Academia" and "Law", which would later be turned into unique lists of their own once WP gathered more articles on Australian academics and jurists, respectively. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It would not be too difficult to add more academics.

<dd>I have no trouble in creating a new page lists of lists, but I think the debate about this list of Australians should be allowed to run its course, otherwise the two issues might get confused.

<dd>I am open to the possibility of a list of lists of people. Some of those lists will be fine, but some will likely suffer the same problems as this list - unclear inclusion criteria. I support the lists complying with <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> that have objective, citable references for membership and a realistic chance of being complete and maintained (such as <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_minister_of_Australia_1ffb.html#List_of_Prime_Ministers" title="Prime minister of Australia">prime minister of Australia#List of Prime Ministers</a>). I don't support lists where membership is based on some subjective estimate of notability or on the existence of a Wikipedia article. "List of Australian aviators" could include every <a href="../../../q/a/n/Qantas.html" title="Qantas">Qantas</a> or <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Blue_630c.html" title="Virgin Blue">Virgin Blue</a> pilot, which makes it unsuitable as a list unless we honestly believe they should all be in it. "List of pioneer aviators in Australia" could be defined to only include people who were pilots before World War I started, for example, which makes it a closed list with a defined membership criteria that makes every member notable. An academics list must require a higher standard than "Has a Ph.D. and is employed by a university". Some of the subheadings will be easy to make suitable criteria for. Most will be hard or impossible.--<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 13:55, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think you are being a bit too literal in your interpretation. A "List of Australians" should not include every Australian who ever lived no more than <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_people_4823.html" title="Category:Australian people">Category:Australian people</a> should. Lists on WP are assumed to be about subjects who are notable (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Lists_of_people" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)#Lists of people</a>). The lead sentence itself states that "this is a list of <i>notable</i> people", so you've automatically excluded anyone who does not belong in WP. Is every Australian pilot notable? Of course not! So, naturally, they won't be included. I really don't see what's wrong with having a list of notable Australians. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although I'm not opposed to a "List of lists" (and think it can be worked out), I don't see why "notable Australian" is particularly controversial: it's simply an Australian who meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>.
