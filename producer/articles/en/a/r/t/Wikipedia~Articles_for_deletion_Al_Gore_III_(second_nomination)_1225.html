<p>This article was nominated for deletion a few years back, with a result of no consensus, but with a majority voting to delete or redirect to <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>. I think it deserves more discussion. I'm concerned that there is not enough verifiable information about Gore for a fair article on him to exist right now. He has been ticketed by police a few times, which made the news. But that's the only thing beyond his early childhood that's verifiable, because Gore has assiduously maintained his privacy. As far as I know, he has yet to answer a question from a reporter or make a public statement in his life. Keep-voters in the old VfD argued an analogy with the Bush daughters and Chelsea Clinton, but this seems like a false analogy, because these people have given high-profile interviews and speeches, a point that was not raised in the VfD. <a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 20:30, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>An entire chapter of the new book <i>Inconvenient Truth</i> is devoted to Albert Gore III, including details of his accident, medical diagnoses, and subsequent recovery. There are also multiple references to him and other photos from other points in his life throughout the book. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 22:09, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I haven't read the whole book yet, but I read that section after you posted this. It's four pages long, and the book doesn't seem to have anything it calls chapters. Gore Jr. writes little, if anything, about Gore III as a person. Instead, Gore Jr. focuses on the facts of the accident and recovery and their impact on his own thinking about the importance of global climate change. As before, what you say is technically true, but subjectively I see things differently. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 23:25, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>Resource problem was fixed. How difficult was it to do a search on CNN? He being a politician’s son does not necessarily gives him status but his arrests gives him notoriety that people want to know about. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.103.129.49 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.103.129.49_ea44.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.103.129.49">contribs</a>)  22:07, July 27, 2006.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. He's still notable enough to be in the press (for example, an L.A. Times article <a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/magazine/west/la-tm-goldhirsh30jul23,0,3430054.story?coll=la-home-magazine" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.latimes.com/features/magazine/west/la-tm-goldhirsh30jul23,0,3430054.story?coll=la-home-magazine" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). He's also being referred to in a current movie, his dad's <i>Inconvenient Truth</i>. Those, plus his own notoriety via the legal problems, are sufficient for me. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 00:32, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I respect your opinion; and I can't deny that you have, technically, given an example of Gore being in the press. But I would like to point out that the author of that L.A. Times article spends two sentences in a long feature identifying Gore as an intern working for the subject of the article. He even says explicitly that Gore's identity is "incidental". --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 00:59, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Right, it's not <i>about</i> Gore, but I bring it up as an indication that he's famous enough to be mentioned in an article, even if he's doing nothing more than sitting on a couch. &#160;;) I think the mention in the documentary is more indicative of name recognition. Having said that though, I wouldn't be strongly opposed to a merge, and I do agree that the nomination is thoughtful and well-written. But given a choice, my own vote would still be to keep. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 01:20, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Clinton and Bush were in the news because they gave interviews and speeches; Gore was in the news because he got pulled over by police. Not saying you're wrong, but that's why <i>I'd</i> not delete the articles on Clinton or Bush. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 23:25, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Irrespective of the avolitional nature of his notoriety (toward which Allen properly and persuasively adduces the counterexamples of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea_Clinton_376a.html" title="Chelsea Clinton">Chelsea Clinton</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_P._Bush_3484.html" title="George P. Bush">George P. Bush</a>), that notability exists, if only in view of the sundry legal problems that have arisen (I assume arguendo that Allen didn't mean to suggest that the fact of the subject's ostensibly having undertaken to be a private person is at all relevant to whether we ought to have an article apropos of him; such suggestions have surely been refuted at, inter al., <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_EVIL_85b9.html" title="WP:NOT EVIL">WP:NOT EVIL</a>, the several <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> <a href="../../../d/a/n/Talk%7EDaniel_Brandt_eca9.html" title="Talk:Daniel Brandt">AfDs</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a>). Were he a biographical subject only in view of his being related to a notable personnage, I'd likely think deletion (or redirection to <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>) appropriate (as I did, for example, at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Suri_Cruise_ba87.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Suri Cruise">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Suri Cruise</a>), if only because of what we'd expect to be an attendant dearth of biographical information. Sad though I am that the youngest Gore has experienced legal troubles—after all, I volunteered a great deal on his father's 1996 VP and 2000 Pres campaigns, during the latter of which I had occasion to meet Gore—those troubles have made him, à la <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Dellums_4840.html" title="Michael Dellums">Michael Dellums</a> (a good analogue, I think), notable. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:33, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Arguendo; there's a new word for me. Your assumption is correct in reality as well as arguendo; Gore's attempts to remain a private person are only relevant insofar as they are successful. The Michael Dellums comparison is interesting. My impulse is to argue that murderers make the news even if they aren't politicians' kids, while DUIs don't (not counting the police blotter). But I haven't thought about it enough to feel sure. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 20:44, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> In disagreement with <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a>, I believe that the legal troubles have only made the news because of his relationship to his father, and thus that he is a "biographical subject only in view of his being related to a notable personnage". We do not believe in notability by relationship, so he is not therby notable. I see no evidence that he is notable at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards; I judge the legal stories trivial. I could support a <b>smerge</b> and <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>, noting that his accident's impact on the campaign is already in that article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 13:46, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete and redirect.</b> It would be much better if there was a part of Al Gore's article dedicated to him. As stated earlier, unless Gore becomes president or Al Gore III becomes a polician/speaker/something else, this article isn't too significant. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 15:03, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
