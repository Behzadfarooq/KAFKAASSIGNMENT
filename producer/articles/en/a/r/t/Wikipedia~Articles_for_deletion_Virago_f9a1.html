<li>This is the writer of the second part of the article. I suggest a compromise.Let us write a good article together in which all opinions are represented. You can add your ideas and I can mine. As I wrote to Brazzy, general deletion is not a typical way for scientific dispute. Other articles in the wikipedia show that a more conservative biological view and a more progressive sociological view can coexist in harmony (e.g.,wikipedia "race". Please take note of the fact that I got discontended when Brazzy deleted lengthy parts of the article without a serious discussion just as he cancelled Dr. Christoph Neumann's contribution concerning the sexuality of the Nadeshiko Yamato.But sexuality is an important aspect of the Japanese conservative female archetype. It is very easy to label someone a racist who strongly claims that he is none, e.g. all my statements about Blacks and Asians are positive ones: the high efficiency of Asian societies; the freedom of Chinese anthropology where b o t h the Boasian and the conservative view can be discussed; the "womanly" looks of Indonesians and Filipinas on average concerning anthropometrical measures no-one can seriously deny. My part of the article is descriptive and I never suggested any actions against any group of people I mentioned. I respect all the groups and authorities in the article.I never evaluated them ("good","bad" etc.) That some people consider some statements as not flattering does not mean that I did not like or respect any of the mentioned groups or authorities.I am a professor of anthropology and I my contribution to other anthropological articles in the English wikipedia were explicitly welcomed by others (e.g.concerning the direct involvement of the AAA in secret service activities). So let us together build a new article.
<ul>
<li>If you're a professor of anthropology, you should be easily able to provide us with some good <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> references for the views you advocate... right? <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> 14:10, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi Haeleth, I will provide you with good references of course:</li>
</ul>
<p>1.)Knußmann,Rainer, Handbuch der vergleichenden Anthropologie und Humangenetik,1996, 2.ed.; there are more male and more female-paedomorphous races; higher aggressiveness of bigger, heavier women;virago recent beauty ideal; viragines seek female men as mates 2.) Baker,John Randal, Race, Oxford University Press,1974;there are significant racial intelligence differences;some races are more female-paedomorphous than others; there is no orthogenesis towards civilization,phylogenesis is not identical with ontogenesis, only 4 Europid societies reached independently the stage of civilization, the Sinic is uncertain, the Mayas and Incas had a significantly lower culture not being civilizations 3.)Lynn,Richard,IQ and the wealth of nations,2002;African Blacks have an IQ of about 70 4.) MacDonald,Kevin B., A people that shall dwell alone, Separation and its discontents,The Culture of Critique, the hidden Jewish agenda behind Boasian anthropology and multiculturalism 5.) Langdon,Kevin passim for big differences of male and female IQ 6.)Bem;Sandra, inluential theory of androgynity (or better viraginity)promoting the interests of the viragines in the name of minimizing violence in society;doubtful because viragines are more aggressive than normal women 7.)Johnston, Caryl, American sociologist, making allegations of a primarily Jewish background of modern feminism on her website 8.) Lieberman et. al. studying the attitudes towards race and conservative biological explanations throughout the world. Please study these works and the website carefully as a basis for a serious discussion. An overwhelming amount of information is given supporting my view.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It's important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There is plenty of room for a good article on this sociosexual phenomenon, and I believe that the pre-truncated article was a good start. Clearly we are dealing with some racist overtones here - any mention of a "hidden Jewish agenda" rightfully deserves to be greeted with hoots of disdainful laughter, and is not appropriate in the context of this discussion even if it were legitimate. However, this is a legitimate topic and deserving of more than just a dicdef. I'm really choking over those "references" though - I can't believe that some of them represent anything like mainstream thought. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:02, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us take Boasianism.Boas invented Boasianism nearly alone, he had a strong Jewish identification, nearly all of his mainly Jewish students became deans and influential anthropologists at American universities, Boasianism first controlled the USA making mass immigration possible, after 1945 it controlled the world except China (s.Lieberman,Littlefield, Reynolds). There were no other important factors that facilitated mass immigration to the US. Boas and his students were the key factor with a 90% responsibility if someone would like to have a number. "Disdainfulful laughter" about the truth is I think inappropriate.If you can show that the above statements are wrong, then you might laugh. Have you examined all books in my bibliography carefully? I don't think so, so please do this first.You write that you are a "disciplined deletionist", maybe you become a "serious reader and scientist",too.E.g. John Randal Baker is dealt with in the wikipedia article "race", too,as an important contribution to anthropology, Littlefield, Lieberman and Reynold wrote primarily a documentation.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> and clean-up. Topic is broader than a dicdef, but needs a more <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> treatment. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 02:47, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
