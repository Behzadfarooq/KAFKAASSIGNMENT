<p>Apparently, this character is a fan invention and doesn't actually appear in any of the official star wars publications through two characters with similar names (Vodo-Siosk Baas, Bodo Baas) have appeared in the Star Wars comics.

<p>- Note: Could it be POSSIBLE that not all the SITH are covered in the COMICS? Where was Ajunta Pall? Where was Tuluk Hord? I've NEVER seen a mention of them in anything other than KOTOR I. How about Darth Sion, or Revan? Revan apparently defeated Mandalore. Mandalore is a well known character in the star wars universe, noted in comics, books, etc. He even started a new cult called Mandalorians, of which Boba Fett and Jango Fett's characters have taken ideas off. And yet, some how this Revan person comes along and destroys him just like that. Revan is ONLY a character in KOTOR.</p>
<p>I have also done a google search and nothing pointed to wikipedia when I looked up Konar Siosk-Baas. Why does the fact that one character exists that was not yet known by you affect you so? Searches never seem to pick up the name and it appears that one would have to be intentionally LOOKING for the specific Konar Siosk-Baas name to pick it up on wikipedia.</p>
<p>By point concluded; I do not think the requests are valid enough to warrent deleation of the page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Note: Could it be POSSIBLE that not all the SITH are covered in the COMICS?"
<dl>
<dd>Of course. It just so happens that Konar Sios-Baask isn't covered anywhere. Because he doesn't exist.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"Revan apparently defeated Mandalore. Mandalore is a well known character in the star wars universe, noted in comics, books, etc. He even started a new cult called Mandalorians, of which Boba Fett and Jango Fett's characters have taken ideas off."
<dl>
<dd>Mandalore is the title given to the leader of the Mandalorians. There have been several throughout history. The particular one Revan killed was called Mandalore the Ultimate. There have also been Mandalores the First, Indomitable, and Resurrector, among others. Mandalore the Resurrector was the one who restarted the Mandalorian tradition after it was destroyed by the Jedi. This was the group to which Boba Fett belonged; Jango belonged to the aforementioned destroyed incarnation of the Mandalorians, which had existed since before the formation of the Old Republic.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"And yet, some how this Revan person comes along and destroys him just like that. Revan is ONLY a character in KOTOR."
<dl>
<dd>Revan was one of the greatest military commanders and warriors in the history of the Jedi Order and one of the most powerful, feared, and intelligent Dark Lords of the Sith of all time. What is your point, and what has it to do with the nonexistent Konar Siosk-Baas?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"Why does the fact that one character exists that was not yet known by you affect you so?"
<dl>
<dd>You are obviously unfamiliar with Star Wars. Not only does Konar Siosk-Baas not appear in any existing sources, his history as presented in his fraudulent article is completely and utterly impossible; only three named Sith Lords have appeared since the Battle of Endor, and he is not one of them.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"By point concluded; I do not think the requests are valid enough to warrent deleation of the page."
<dl>
<dd>Sure they are, as he doesn't exist. Not in the comics, not in the video games, not in the books, not in the movies. Not anywhere. He's not a real Star Wars character. At all.&#160;:)

<p>- Sorry George Lucas (by this I imply you because you seem to know so much about Star Wars you clearly must be uncle George), but if you happen to know so much about Star Wars, (a) what is the point in looking it up on a Google search directory? (b) why is there a limit to the future of the Star Wars universe? (clearly time has no end, so just like time, Star Wars doesn't end after the war between the Alliance and the Yuuzhan Vong) (c) what's to say the Siosk-Baas family ended after the death of Vodo? Surely Vodo had parents. - Perhaps they had another child. (d) Jedi's are not one off's. Just like the Adam/Eve Theory, the jedi started, had babies and produced more jedi. Surely some surnames would have been kept (they don't just wipe their surnames because they've been used by their parents), so what's to say Konar isn't one of the descendants? (e) Why not wipe out the Aborigines because they're just as usless to you as the character Konar Siosk-Baas and you want to wipe him out?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Terribly sorry to disappoint, but I'm not really George Lucas. I tend to get that a lot, though. Must be the flannel. In any case, you seem to be confused about a few things (I'd never <i>dream</i> that you're the person who wrote that article, naturally), so I'll do my best to try and set you straight.</dd>
<dd>(a) I didn't need to check Google, as I already knew Konar doesn't exist.</dd>
<dd>(b) There is no limit to the future of Star Wars. There is a limit to the number of stories set in Star Wars. None of them currently involve a Konar Siosk-Baas. Sorry.</dd>
<dd>(c) Well, that's the thing, isn't it. You'll note that the article claims that Konar's species is half-human and half-Twi'lek. Now, not only are these two different species genetically incompatible, but I fail to see how a line known to consist only of Krevaaki could produce such an improbable half-breed.</dd>
<dd>(d) First of all, as I just said, neither of two species that Konar reputedly belongs to are the same species as Vodo and Bodo. Secondly, you seem to be forgetting a little thing called the "Jedi Purge." In case you're not familiar with it, that was when Darth Vader and his minions drove the Jedi to virtual extinction. Only a handful are known to have survived, and none of them were named Baas.</dd>
<dd>(e) What are you talking about?</dd>
<dd>In any case, your logic is deeply flawed, my friend. Konar Siosk-Baas does not currently exist anywhere in any Star Wars universe. You seem to be arguing that his article should be kept because one day he might. Sadly, not only can his history as it is given in the article never come to be because of a hilarious amount of continuity errors and ridiculously obvious fanfiction, neither can he, as LFL writers are forbidden to use fan creations in their works because of possible copyright infringement. In short: Luke Skywalker isn't dead. There are no stories set 88 ABY. The only Dark Lords of the Sith who rose to power after the Battle of Endor were Lady Lumiya, Lord Flint, and Carnor Jax. Krevaaki, humans, and Twi'leks are not genetically compatible. Konar Siosk-Baas doesn't exist. Sorry.&#160;:)

</dl>
<p>"Luke Skywalker isn't dead." Ah. So I get it. Luke is an uber Jedi. He can't die because he is immortal. Damn! Why didn't they underline that in any of the scripts? We assume that Luke is human (natually because he not only looks human but they say that he is human), and all humans are mortal. So naturally, eventually Luke must die. And Konar's life is set after the death of Luke Skywalker. Yes, I know the dates are wrong and don't coincide with the fact, but they will be fixed in due course.</p>
<p>"Krevaaki, humans, and Twi'leks are not genetically compatible" Where was this stated? I have never read that they are not genetically compatible anywhere. Please provide a link or a story which states this and I will endeavour to read it.</p>
<p>"In any case, your logic is deeply flawed, my friend" No, you are not the emperor. So please desist in trying to sound like him.</p>
<p>"I didn't need to check Google, as I already knew Konar doesn't exist" Oh. So you've read every single starwars comic, book, played every video game, made a collection of all the action figures and wrote your own book about starwars because clearly you know so much about it. - How did you manage to pass school if you spent all the time it'd take to learn starwars off by heart while you were supposed to be attending classes?</p>
<p>"Only a handful are known to have survived, and none of them were named Baas" Again you are making assumptions. If so few survived, the Jedi probably died out soon after the purge.- Going by the logic of your logic</p>
<p>"I fail to see how a line known to consist only of Krevaaki could produce such an improbable half-breed." You ever heard of a thing called sex? People have it from time to time, and if appropriate procautions are not taken a baby is born. Say you had a great grand father who was completely black. He marries a white woman and has a child with her. The child [when old enough] marries a white man and has a child with him. And so on and so forth. Eventually the descendant has no visible black in him. In the case with Konar Siosk-Baas, the crustaceous Vodo's parents had another son, who married and had another child. That child married a Twi'lek, who had a child with a human, and so on a so forth. Eventually the descendant is no longer crustacean, but is a cross-between Twi-lek and Human. Also note that the descendant has had many thousands of years to change in form, as Vodo Siosk-Baas is evidently much much older that his descendant, Konar.</p>
<p>- To conclude, I'm still missing the proof that this is fan fiction, and I don't accept your 'so called' knowledge of the Star Wars universe as proof. If I thought you were right, I would obviously support you. But as it is, you still haven't properly backed up your arguments, other than convinced me that the dates are chronologically wrong which I am already aware of. They will be fixed in due course, but until the real proof comes (and I mean, not what your opinion on the matter is), this character will remain.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hey 203.61.240.131/203.61.243.164 while you are at it mind explaining why you added a bunch of fan fiction (Brotherhood of Dark Jedi, Sons of Sadow) to the Sith Article at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sith&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12835518" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sith&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12835518" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sith&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12835518</a> that someone had the unfortunate task of cleaning up and reverting? And by the way you aren't by any chance the author of this article considering that your edits to the Sith Article are also derived from the Dark Brotherhood Site. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimon_08ae.html" title="User:Timon">Timon</a> 03:54, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"Ah. So I get it. Luke is an uber Jedi."
<dl>
<dd>Yup.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"He can't die because he is immortal."
<dl>
<dd>Nope. Don't be silly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"We assume that Luke is human (natually because he not only looks human but they say that he is human), and all humans are mortal. So naturally, eventually Luke must die."
<dl>
<dd>Now you're getting it. Key word: <i>eventually</i>. As of now—AKA this moment—AKA April 30, 2005—Luke Skywalker hasn't died in any canonical Star Wars story.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"I have never read that they are not genetically compatible anywhere."
<dl>
<dd>Use some common sense. They're entirely different species.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"Please provide a link or a story which states this and I will endeavour to read it."
<dl>
<dd>Now there's an idea. Please provide a link or a story which states that Konar Siosk-Baas exists and I'll concede. If you are unable to provide said link or story, I wholly expect the concession to be yours.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"No, you are not the emperor. So please desist in trying to sound like him."
<dl>
<dd>Aw, shucks, I can't have any fun.&#160;:(</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"Oh. So you've read every single starwars comic, book, played every video game, made a collection of all the action figures and wrote your own book about starwars because clearly you know so much about it."
<dl>
<dd>I'm moderately certain I never made such a claim, but if you believe it, why don't you concede?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"How did you manage to pass school if you spent all the time it'd take to learn starwars off by heart while you were supposed to be attending classes?"
<dl>
<dd>I didn't inhale.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"Again you are making assumptions. If so few survived, the Jedi probably died out soon after the purge.- Going by the logic of your logic"
<dl>
<dd>Once again, you prove your lack of familiarity with the Star Wars Universe, my friend. Luke Skywalker founded a new Jedi Order after the final death of the Emperor. It seems like you're trying to say the Jedi who survived the Purge rebuilt their order. That is not so; it was all Luke. "When I am gone, the last of the Jedi will you be." Not quite, but, for all intents and purposes, correct.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"You ever heard of a thing called sex? People have it from time to time, and if appropriate procautions are not taken a baby is born."
<dl>
<dd>Gee, now you're just making stuff up.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"Say you had a great grand father who was completely black. He marries a white woman and has a child with her. The child [when old enough] marries a white man and has a child with him. And so on and so forth. Eventually the descendant has no visible black in him."
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, except, oh, gee, look at that: <i>they're all the same species</i>. Tell me what would happen if that black great-grandfather mated with a dolphin and you may have something.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"In the case with Konar Siosk-Baas, the crustaceous Vodo's parents had another son, who married and had another child. That child married a Twi'lek, who had a child with a human, and so on a so forth. Eventually the descendant is no longer crustacean, but is a cross-between Twi-lek and Human."
<dl>
<dd>Please at least pretend to prove it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"To conclude, I'm still missing the proof that this is fan fiction…"
<dl>
<dd>To conclude, I'm still missing the proof that this isn't fanfiction.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"…and I don't accept your 'so called' knowledge of the Star Wars universe as proof."</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Man, I feel really, <i>really</i> bad now…</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"If I thought you were right, I would obviously support you."
<dl>
<dd>Obviously.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"But as it is, you still haven't properly backed up your arguments, other than convinced me that the dates are chronologically wrong which I am already aware of."
<dl>
<dd>I can't present a nonpresence. Give me ONE canonical source that states Konar Siosk-Baas exists in the Star Wars Universe as the character presented in the article, and I will concede. Prove me wrong. <i>Please.</i>&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"They will be fixed in due course, but until the real proof comes (and I mean, not what your opinion on the matter is), this character will remain."
<dl>
<dd>You can't prove it, can you? I mean, I know you can't, because he doesn't exist, but <i>you</i> do know you can't, right?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Look, I have nothing against fanfiction (good fanfiction, at least), but it's not a part of Star Wars canon, and, as such, doesn't belong here. Prove Konar is canon, or concede.
