<p>Axiomatik is an Edmonton-based band. axiomatik is an alchemy of raw rock perfection and tender artistik expression.</p>
<p>amplified by shawn lamble (vox/gtr), kris flajs (vox/bass), august flajs (drums), and kris hodgson (cello), collectively as axiomatik, they create a confluence of emotional energy through sonic beauty.</p>
<p>they've all been a part of the local music landscape for the past decade, assuming the rock 'n roll visions of sanguine ('95), pornCzar ('99), and sonicism ('00-'01).</p>
<p>their sound is both unique yet familiar. the band's influences include radiohead, jane's addiction, and silverchair to name a few.</p>
<p>your audio generals are multi-instrumentalists and frequently switch instruments and will even incorporate unconventional instrumentation during their electrik live performances.</p>
<p>we invite you to experience the inarguable truth that is axiomatik. www.axiomatik.net, www.myspace.com/axiomatikrocks</p>

<p>Supporting Game Music and Musicians Everywhere</p>
<br />
<br />
<h2>The Introduction</h2>
<p>Sakari is a music web site dedicated mostly to the genre of video game music. Musicians that write game music from around the world are always welcomed to submit their original music to the site, chat in the forums, and become Local Musicians to the site.</p>
<h2>The History</h2>
<p>Sakari is a Japanese word that, in essence, means “at one’s peak”, or “at one’s best”. This name was chosen because the content would be no less than the best someone could produce at that very moment.</p>
<p>Sakari has been around for longer than most people realize. Sakari first started as a personal web site to one David Schooley. He posted original and remixed songs onto the site, free for anyone to download. This initial site was built in 1999. Later, in 2001, it developed into a much larger site and was registered under the domain www.sakari.org, which contained 200+ arrangements from Final Fantasy, Parasite Eve, and other popular video games.</p>
<p>The site hit its peak in the winter of 2004 with over one thousand members and more than 400 combined arranged and original songs. However, shortly after, Mr. Schooley closed down the site due to lack of funding (as there were never any ads on the site), and lack of time to put towards the site (as he was the only staff member). The site traffic slowed, the forum posts became fewer and fewer, and eventually the domain expired. Shortly afterwards, the domain was purchased by DotaCom Corporation, who purchased it simply to own it.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2005, whispers about Sakari started making their way around the gaming and game making worlds. Since the original domain, sakari.org, was no longer available, a new and creative domain was registered for Sakari. The site would also no longer be a simple site containing video game arrangements; it would be one that contained original music. The music would be free to anyone, and it would come from individual composers, not companies. The new domain is <a href="http://www.sakari-infinity.net" class="external free" title="http://www.sakari-infinity.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.sakari-infinity.net</a>, and it has become a home for many amateur game music composers.</p>
<h2>The Concept</h2>
<p>On their own, amateur composers can produce entire CDs of music, and even become THE composer for independent game making groups / communities. However, that is where it usually stops... Their names are obscured, their music is lost, and they often-times fade away.</p>
<p>What were to happen, though, if there existed an entire community of game musicians? What if a web site devoted itself to hosting and showcasing their music, and for free no less? This is what Sakari has become. Any registered member of the Sakari site can upload their music to the site for review. Once a member of the Sakari staff reviews the music, it is added to the site and categorized.</p>
<h2>The Members</h2>
<p>Sakari prides itself on its members. Among the names in the forums and on the site are many unknown musicians, and some more well-known musicians. Musicians from other forums, where they were one of possibly 2 or 3 total, have drifted eventually over to Sakari where they have found themselves in the presence of many more peers who are also musicians. Even though not all the members are musicians, everyone there appreciates the music of their peers.</p>
<h2>The Staff</h2>
<p>The staff members at Sakari are all musicians by background and training, and have the musical and technical know-how to give flowering musicians the information and feedback they need to become better composers.</p>
<p>As of the posting date of this article, there are 3 Staff members at Sakari. They include the owner and administrator: David Schooley (illustrationism), and friends and musicians Joseph Aleman (ominouschaos) and Dave O’Boyle (SickAndWretched). <a name="The_Events" id="The_Events"></a></p>

<p>Sakari holds monthly music competitions. Typically, on the first of the month, a theme and rules are given and submissions are accepted. Submissions are only accepted through the 24th of that month. Pieces are judged, scored, and critiqued; then results are returned and awards are given. The awards, rules, themes, and submission dates vary from month to month, but usually stay similar. These competitions have become popular, drawing in sometimes a dozen interested musicians.</p>

<p>Nope. Sakari has been back for a year, to date (8/19/06), and it’s still growing rapidly. Musicians, gamers, game makers, and music appreciators have all started hearing about the site, and even a few professional musicians have started taking interest in the site... Who knows what the future will bring, but for now we can all enjoy the myriad of music that we can find on this site.</p>

The profit pod is a device created by Dave and Carolee Ellison, as a way of monitoring arcade machines. This device specifically allows owners of arcades to gain information about the number of sales that have been made without neccassarily needing to open the machine up and physically counting the number of tokens/tickets left in the machine.</p>

<p>jMusic is a music programming library written in the Java programming langauge. jMusic was written by Andrew Sorensen and Andrew Brown and released publicly in November 1998. It is designed to assist composers and music software developers by providing support for music data structures, modifications, and input/output to various file formats. jMusic has a data structure that is based on a musical score metaphor, and consists of a hierarchy of notes, phrases, parts and score. jMusic also has a sound synthesis architecture and "instruments" can be created from a chain of "audio objects" (similar to unit generators in other languages). A jMusic score can be rendered with jMusic instruments to an audio file. More information and extensive tutorials on jMusic are available at the jMusic web site <a href="http://jmusic.ci.qut.edu.au" class="external free" title="http://jmusic.ci.qut.edu.au" rel="nofollow">http://jmusic.ci.qut.edu.au</a>.</p>

The significance and dominance of the path of the community that can generally be found, are the principal foundation of the community, warm family, the strength of community that can rally on itself. There is the study in the way of its community continually. The way of life of the community is base on the adequate foundation. All of these have impacted to the peaceable and the happy livelihood of the community.</p>
<p><b>Case study of Mong community</b></p>
<p>The case study of Mong community at Luang Prabang region Democratic People’s Republic of Laos and Tai Lua people in The Specially Governing Territory of Sib-Song-Pan-Na, People’s Republic of Laos. There were the way of the community that adjusted themselves to live with the resources and environment which generally found the high mountains because the Mong have believing, learning and inheriting from the ancestor that living on the high mountain will make them close and enable to contract with their respected tribe’s spirit.</p>
<p>Farming that the Mong did, have to use plenty of lands where could be seen that the forest area along the valley had been grated and deforested in order to cultivating crops for consuming such as rice, vegetables and economical crops such as Pineapple, Para-rubber and teak. The outcomes in doing these were, the surrounding resources had been destroyed, deteriorated soil not suitable and unoccupied soil for agriculturing.</p>
<p>The Mong lack of the modern Knowledge about stable agriculture and the method of soil nourishing by using fertilizer to increase the soil abundantly, but used the method by looking for a new piece of land on the new mountain that more fertile to carry on agriculturing and leaving the old land to be unoccupied and waited for recovering. After recovering, the Mong will come back and farm the same land.</p>
<p>The learning of Mong that inherited to their young generation which can be observed from the living behavior, parents and their children will leave their house to their farm to clear and keep an eye on their farm, gathered the forest’s products such as grass’s flowers to make broom, firewood as such everyday. Giving the Mong’s children have learning as their ancestor which maintain their believing conducts to be inherited that difficult to change and still have effected to the resources and environment which commonly found on both at Ban Song ja and the nearby areas. Laos Government have some policies for Highland Laos by assigning the land for settling and living to the Mong to live together. Laos Government let the Mong develop themselves that was assigned by the goal of Laos Government, that is staying with the resources and environment as relying. By providing the basic necessity to the community such as school, community police station, community health care, etc. In order to giving the good way to the community that still live together with the nature as more dwelling place than as it be at present.</p>
<p>The Mong were related to the outside by using wireless communications such as receiving information, knowledge from the satellite dish’s technology, from news. The knowledge had made the Mong to adjust and change part of their way of live and found that moving, transporting and vehicle using have to rely on the energy of the fuel and using of goods depend on the technology knowledge from outside community etc.</p>
<p>From the things found at Ban Song Ja, this community had been dwelled, according to the administrative system to be section. There is a leader to govern the house. There is the police that will keep and maintain the safety of the community and have the division that still be found, was the deforested behavior for moveable farming in the assigned areas were still remaining, still accepting and learning the modern farming as a single land. There is maintaining, nourishing and rotating crops cultivation that consist of the farm land for the economical crops such as Para-rubber. The Mong need more adjusting in their way of life from self – relying on the resources and environment which they are living and the career that needs to increase incomes, then bring that income back to provide the necessities of life but rely on the outside. After the adjusting way of life were extend longer, it may cause them not be able to continue their self-relying. Mong’s community might not strong as the same family that is the foundation of community can’t rely on itself, no warmness and happiness anymore.</p>
<p><b>Case study of Tai Lua community</b></p>
<p>Tai Lua community is a big community which settle in the same residence, having close relation and binding between family which can be found in the morning.</p>
<p>There are housewives sit around the fire to make themselves warm from early morning cool and their children are playing around. It is a very lovely picture. Their children have related to each other since their are small, they are so intimately that they will be closely neighbors, rely on and helping each other when they grow up that caused the peaceable community.</p>
<p>The shape of houses were the throughout the village. The intelligence about the high space under living quarters that make of wood and hip roof, the upper story is a living space, a kitchenette and living room, keep firewood, plowing machine, knife making machine and open lower level that used as a storage to silo to keep farming products, the fringe of the roof had decorative designs, the roof made from thin earth tiles, at the roof gables and eaves had peacock’s carving or some house had the year that the houses were built them. There was only a single step-up door.</p>
<p>The most noticeable found that houses had been built by using original methods, there were drilling, inserting wood and using pegs to hold woods. Their house posts were set on stone bases.</p>
<p>The house settlement were resided on the plain in the valley, due to the cold weather, the feature of the house were cover completely, hardly to find windows.The roof made from thin pieces of baked tiles when touched with sunlight will absorbed the heat and released the cool air into the house. The cool air from the kitchenette in their houses after they had been cooked for food, could have been used for protection the cold weather from the outside.</p>
<p>Founded career were farming in the plain area near water sources found that, there are rice, vegetables and fruits cultivation and animals domestication such as pigs, chicken. In the high plain area along the hillside, there are the growing of tea, para-rubber, fruits and bananas. There were a lot of cassia trees to make firewood. From analysis found that the cassia trees in the past were industry, crops, used for food, medicines and firewood.</p>
<p>Cultivating intelligence, trimming the trees from the ground were about 1.5 meter, will have the branched that have high and long twigs which proper for cutting to be firewood, flower used for food, pods used for skin’s deceases treatment. Currently, the large number of cassia trees have been cut down and replaced by industrial plants such as Para-rubber trees, fruits, bananas. After analyzed, the products from the industry crops are highly demanding to use in china such as bananas which originally grew for consuming. From old economic system, the community grew it in small quantity, so it didn’t have much affect to resources and environment. Presently, the demand from outside community for the industry crops has been more demanded and the community had learnt about patroning economic or because of more economic development than the community’s economic. According to be able to rely on themselves. These should effect to the resources, environment and community way, there are high rate of herbicide usage and a large quantities of fertilizers due to wild spreading of cultivation.</p>
<p>From originally country developing by thought about the growing of the gross domestic products (GDP) and thought that income in form of only money were happily insured. In the new world it may not true. The development of Tai Lua people are developing their way of life away from the truth, that is the way of community, the effective of developing country is the gap of income. The changing from outside condition have highly effected to the community, that may cause Tai Lua to adjust themselves in catching up. For instance, Tai Lua people are good at cultivating, developing and seeking benefits from the cassia trees but presently had been replaced by Para-rubber. Some communities may face the lacking of knowledge, and experience in growing Para-rubber trees as well as they had for the cassia trees growing.</p>
<p>Normally, Well-Developed and most benefit to mankind are totally developing by linking development together, more benefits that can assist each other and rely on themselves as well as Tai Lua people in the past. But the separating development by holding it with something, the deriving benefits will not assist each other but will benefit to just some particular groups, in which the circulation of income was not covered, created the gap of income and severely increasing, combined with the original Tai Lua people had their future way of the community to be changed by the demanding which caused then not to be able to adjust themselves, the original careers, community’s condition, were changed, namely the resources and environment, culture and closely socialing believes had been changed. They could not rely on themselves. From the observation of Tai Lua families that live in semi-city community, the way of life have to change along with the wave of changing, lack of warmness in the family.</p>
<p>The community development of Tai Lua people in the specially governing territory of Sip – Song – Pan – Na, must have the developing strategies by thinking about the dual developing which are the developing with happiness, namely. The community were developed base on self – rely and peaceable community developing.</p>
<p><b>Peaceable in Luang Phra Bang</b></p>
<p>In the other hand, at Luang Phra Bang, the world heritage city. There are mixed way of life among their urban and rural communities. Being one of the world heritage cities caused the community to have their residences to be as assigned by law which forced them to build their house to have Luang Phra Bang Architectural style. By assigning the height of their premises. In order to protect other architectural styles to bee intervened in this World Heritage city. Part of their original careers were changed from earning their living on the waterway, forestry, trust in Buddhism, holding together as the worshipers to their ancestor’s spirits which could be bounded together perfectly.</p>
<p>Some of Luang Phra Bang people change their way of life from their original careers to be the careers that related to traveling such as Hotel Business, Restaurant, Guide, Shuttle Bus, etc. In other way some ways of their community still can normally bee seen such as present food to a Buddhist monk in the morning. Morning shopping in the market of Luang Phra Bank. Products that still produce by the local folk, not the products that produce from the factory. There still have the way of life that rely on the resources and environment. Although, they have both ways of life in the same city, but community can live with happily.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>The necessary reasons had been found from these cases study for the peaceable community that the families in the community have warmness, the strength community was studied in the way of its of the community continually, the community based on the adequate foundation and can rely on itself like the Tai Lua community that the families in the community have warmness and the community can rely on themselves. Lung Phra Bang city where the dual developing which are the developing with happiness, namely and developed base on self – rely and peaceable community developing that could still be able to maintain the path of community during the changing of Globalization. </p>

<p>The <i>Pittsburgh Black Sox</i> are a semi-professional baseball club of the National Adult Baseball Association (NABA)—competing in the Pittsburgh Chapter of that organization.</p>

<p>The <i>Pittsburgh Black Sox</i> were founded in 2003 under the name <i>Pittsburgh Stampeders</i> as part of the humble, four-team beginnings of the NABA Pittsburgh Chapter. After a brief regular season, all four teams were seeded based upon their regular-season records and put into a single-elimination playoff bracket. The <i>Stampeders</i> were eliminated in the first-round though against the Pittsburgh Maulers (baseball club)—the last time that the team would compete under the name <i>Stampeders</i>.</p>

<p>In 2004, the <i>Black Sox</i> underwent an ownership, managerial, and name change when Kenny Rayl took over the team as owner-manager and remained on as a player. The team made a sparkling debut under their new moniker in '04 as the NABA Pittsburgh Chapter doubled in size to include eight teams. Again, all of the teams were included in the playoffs and seeded based on their regular-season records; however, only the four worst regular-season teams did not receive a first-round bye. The <i>B-Sox</i>, as they came to be known, were not one of these teams and thus waited in the quarterfinals for an opponent. That opponent turned-out to be the Pittsburgh Ducks, but the rested <i>B-Sox</i> proved to be too much for the tired <i>Pittsburgh Ducks|Ducks</i>, winning to move-on to the semifinals against another team beneficial of a first-round bye—the Pittsburgh Yankees. The <i>Sox</i> were winners over the Yankess as well, and advanced to a championship showdown against the Pittsburgh Warriors, fresh off of a semifinal win against the Pittsburgh Rangers after receiving byes in the first two playoff rounds as the top seed. A thrilling championship game saw the <i>Black Sox</i> squeak-out a win over the Warriors as late-season acquisition and centerfielder Dan “The Man” Stell scored the winning run to clinch the league title.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-21_e8b5.html" title="Edit section: 2005">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2005</span></h3>
<p>2005 saw the NABA Pittsburgh Chapter grow to include nine teams and switch to a two-division format in which the champions of the league’s regular season divisions were awarded first-round byes in the playoffs. The league also disqualified the three worst teams from the playoffs that year and switched to a best-of-three series format for the semifinals and finals of those playoffs. The <i>B-Sox</i>, winners of the league’s Monongahela Division, put that valuable rest from their bye to good use in the semifinals in grinding-out a gutsy, one-run, come-from-behind win over the Pittsburgh Rangers in Game 1 and a two-run, extra-inning win over the Rangers in Game 2. The sweep of the Rangers allowed the <i>B-Sox</i> to advance again to the league's championship round, which again pitted the <i>Sox</i> against the Pittsburgh Warriors, winners of the league’s Allegheny Division. But this time, the <i>Sox</i> would need to win twice in the championship round to defend their title. However, they were unceremoniously swept two games to none by the Warriors, who more-than-adequately avenged their championship defeat from the previous year.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-21_e8b5.html" title="Edit section: 2006">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2006</span></h3>
<p>2006 marked some significant changes in the NABA Pittsburgh Chapter. First, although the league remained at nine teams, it switched-back to a single-division format. Second, and most importantly, in an attempt to gain more legitimacy to the league’s competition with other Pittsburgh-area semi-pro baseball organizations, the NABA Pittsburgh Chapter switched from allowing aluminum bats to allowing only wooden ones in 2006. Seemingly no team was hurt more than the powerful <i>B-Sox</i>, who could no longer rely on a high-powered offense to win games when their regular starting pitchers were off. As a result, the team limped to a sluggish start in '06, and only a key, late-season stretch of winning baseball got the <i>Sox</i> into the playoffs. In fact, it took a gutsy and vital performance in their second-to-last regular-season game of the year that clinched the sixth and final playoff spot for the <i>Sox</i> as again the league’s three worst teams were excused from playoff competition. Even though the league had gone back to a single-division format in '06, the two top-finishing teams from the regular season were again given first-round byes in the playoffs. The <i>Sox</i>, as the lowest seed though, were not beneficiaries of a bye, and needed to survive a tough, single-elimination, first-round 7-4 win over the Pittsburgh Bulldogs in order to reach the semifinals. Then, in what has become somewhat of a tradition, the <i>Sox</i> would need to get by the rival Pittsburgh Warriors if they hoped to win another championship. Well-rested and owners of the league’s best regular season record, the Warriors were favored to beat the upstart <i>Sox</i>, but they were swept two games to none in the semis, as the <i>Black Sox</i> continued their aggressive pursuit of a second league title.</p>
<p>The <i>Sox</i> now await a best-of-three championship series against the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Morris_University_9a8d.html" title="Robert Morris University">Robert Morris University</a> Colonials, slated to begin with Game 1 on Thursday, August 24 @ 8:30 p.m. @ Moore Park in the South Hills of Pittsburgh. Game 2 and Game 3 (if necessary) are slated for Sunday, August 27 @ 5 and 8 p.m. @ John Herb Field in the North Hills of Pittsburgh. The <i>Sox</i> are vying to become the lowest playoff seed in NABA Pittsburgh Chapter history to win a league championship after already becoming the lowest seed to even reach the championship round.</p>

A re-evaluation of the comedogenicity concept</p>
<p>Zoe Diana Draelos MDa, b, Corresponding Author Contact Information, E-mail The Corresponding Author and Joseph C. DiNardo MSc</p>
<p>aFrom the Department of Dermatology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem bDermatology Consulting Services, High Point cPharma Cosmetix Research LLC, Richmond</p>
<p>Winston-Salem and High Point, North Carolina, and Richmond, Virginia. Available online 17 February 2006.</p>
<p><br />
Background</p>
<p>Comedogenicity is an important consideration in the development of topical medications, cosmetics, and skin care products. The concept of “acne cosmetica” was developed to link the use of certain ingredients to comedo formation. Animal models were originally used to determine the comedogenic potential of raw materials with the assumption that finished formulations containing these ingredients would also be comedogenic. Based on this assumption, dermatologists were presented with lists of substances to avoid in patients with the ability to develop comedones. Objective</p>
<p>We sought to use a modification of the Mills and Kligman human assay for assessing comedogenic potential of finished cosmetic products. Methods</p>
<p>Six individuals with prominent follicular orifices and the ability to form comedones on the upper aspect of the back were enrolled. Each person received patches to the upper aspect of the back saturated with 0.2 to 0.5 mL of the finished cosmetic study products 3 times weekly for 4 weeks. Cyanoacrylate biopsies were performed to determine the number of follicles and microcomedones per square inch. Limitations</p>
<p>Only a finite number of finished cosmetic products could be analyzed. Conclusion</p>
<p>Finished products using comedogenic ingredients are not necessarily comedogenic.</p>

<p>Classical Phylologist born in Bogotá (Colombia) in 1964. He has been working since 2004, together with other members of the World Subud Association, on establishing an entrepreneurial spiritual organisation called <b>Sinar Ilham Holding</b>, based on an unexpected guidance from God. Its purpose is to create possibilities for human beings to stand on their own feet inwardly and outwardly, through being able to put into practice the talents all creatures have been bestowed by God.That includes all possible expressions of human activity: business, arts, health, education, politics, etc. The development of such talents comes about through the sincere intention to serve God through our work, resulting in an amazing process of purification which generally leads to the recuperation of the original human qualities and faculties. That is what is called "Human Culture". The Holding is based in Indonesia (Palangkaraya - Central Kalimantan), but the entities adscribed to it are also located in another countries. Some of those are The Mirabilis Institute, Challenge Language Experts, Bakti Trade Ltd, Usaha Afaal, etc.</p>

<p>Sum Dum Kunt was a hero in the Vietnamese army, who was responsible for firing the rocket which brought down the one and only ROFLCopter.</p>
<p>He was born in Minnesota to an American General and a Vietnamese Dry-Cleaner. He resented his dad for every time he couldn't speak proper english his father would smack him upside the head. He used to plead "please father. donn smack me upside de head" but he would cop a wallop anyway. He deserved it.</p>
<p>When the ROFLCopter flew over his village of Phaic Tan, he fired a rocket launcher and the ROFLCopter needed aid.</p>
<p>Sum Dum Kunt died of gaids in 2006. He will be sadly missed by the peasants of Phaic Tan, where a statue of him and the rocket were erected.</p>

<p><b>BIOLOGY</b> In order to culture any aquatic organism for its commercial exploitation, it is very essential to know its biological features. All the important culturable prawns belong to the genus Macrobrachium which is largest genus of the family Palaemonidae. About 200 species have been recorded from this genus from different parts of the world of which 25 inhabit from Indian waters. Some of the important candidate species for Indian freshwater aquaculture are Macrobrachium rosenbergii, M. malcolmsonii, M .choprai and M. idella. However, M. rosenbergii, the giant freshwater prawn is the most important among them due to its faster growth and larger size. It is commonly known as “Scampi”.</p>
<p><b>Differences between Freshwater and Marine Prawns /Shrimps</b>. The terms “prawns” and “shrimps” are often used synonymously. The use of these terms is geographically dependent. For example, animals of genus Macrobrachium are referred to as freshwater prawns in Australia and freshwater shrimp in United States of America. Having various controversies in the use of these terms, the FAO (1999) defined separately on the basis of their habitat. “Prawns” are those which grown in freshwater, and shrimps which grown in marine and brackishwater environments.</p>

</pre>
<p><b>HABITS AND HABITAT</b></p>
<p>M. rosenbergii inhabits the tropical freshwater environments connected directly or indirectly to the sea. It is also encountered in estuaries and sometimes in seas. M. rosenbergii lives in extremely turbid conditions in nature. This prawn is nocturnal bottom dwelling and sluggish in nature. During day-time, they protect themselves from sunlight and remain half buried in the sediment. They prefer shallow regions, which are rich in aquatic vegetation and organic detritus. Larvae of M. rosenbergii are planktonic Juveniles and adults are benthic.</p>
<p><b>IDENTIFICATION</b></p>
<p>In M. rosenbergii males, the second pair of pereopods are thicker than the other species. It has large carpus of pereopod than merus. M. rosenbergii has long rostrum slightly bent upward (rostrum formula: 11-14/8-10) and the tip is slightly pinkish in colour upto subadult stage. Telson of this species extends upto uropod end. Distinct black bands found on the dorsal side at the junction of all the abdominal segments. Juveniles of this species can be identified by the continuous longitudinal dark bands on the carapace and transverse on each segment of abdomen. A summerised distinguished feature of male and female M.rosenbergii are given below:</p>
<p><b>DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERS OF MALE AND FEMALE</b></p>
<p>CHARACTER MALE FEMALE Size: Males grow much larger with proportionately larger head than female. Females are smaller in size with a small head. Claws: Second pereopod very long, robust, spinous claws or chelipeds. Much smaller and slender claws than males. Gonopore: A pair of gonopores are present at the base of coxal segments of the 5th pair of walking legs which are covered with a thin membrane.. A pair of gonopores are present at the base of coxal segments of the 3rd pair of walking legs which are covered with thin membrane. Appendix masculina: It is present at the junction between the appendices internae and the endopods of the second pair of pleopods Appendix masculina is absent. Only appendices internae is present. Abdominal pleura: In mature males, the ventral surface of the first abdominal pleura becomes slightly pointed centrally. In mature females, the 1-3 abdominal pleura elongated and widen to form a brood chamber. Reproductive setae: Absent Special reproductive setae appear on the thorax and pleopod of maturing female.</p>
<p><b>Food and feeding</b> Adults are omnivorous and consume algae, aquatic plants, mollusks, aquatic insects, worms and other crustaceans. Larvae are zooplanktivorous and their food includes minute crustaceans, small worms, etc. When starved, the giant prawns can become cannibalistic. Age and Growth The life span of M. rosenbergii is 2-3 years. The maximum size recorded is 326 mm (males) and 283 mm (females). Growth occurs through moulting (ecdysis) i. e. shedding of the exoskeleton (the outer hard covering or cuticle). Growth is found to be rapid in males. Normally, these prawns grow to about 50 g under culture conditions in 6-7 months.</p>
<p><b>REPRODUCTION</b> <b>Maturation and Fecundity</b> Giant prawn becomes capable of reproduction from the age of 5 to 6 months. The minimum size at maturity for M. rosenbergii is 175 mm (35 g) for males and 150 mm (25 g) for females. Eggs are oval and 0.6 – 0.7 mm in diameter along the long axis. Fecundity is less for ‘first broods’ ranging from 5000-100000 eggs depending on its size and condition. Females lay eggs 3 to 4 times a year. Normally it breeds throughout the year with a peak at the beginning of rainy season. <b>Sexual dimorphism</b> Sexes are separate in M.rosenbergii they can be identified by the following way, <b>Male</b> Male develops second pair of pereopods with prominent spines. Male gonopores are situated at the base of the fifth pair of pereopods and are covered by flaps. Male has bigger head than female. The ventral side of the first abdominal somite has central lump or point. Mature males are of three different morphotypes, i.e. blue claw (BC) which are relatively larger and possess long blue claws covered with prominent spines with high claw to body length ratio, orange claw (OC) males which possess medium sized, spine less and often orange coloured claws, with lower claw to the body length ratio and small males (SM) which possess short delicate claws, often with little pigment and translucent, and have lowest claw to the body ratio. <b>Female</b> Sexually mature females have smaller heads than males. Gonopores appear on the coxae of the third pair of pereopods and are covered with membrane. Female exhibits a typical brood chamber, which is formed by the first, second, and third abdominal pleurae. Female Macrobrachium rosenbergii also exhibits reproductive setae on the pleopods and thorax, which are functionally distinct. The ovipositing setae which are mostly permanent, on the coxae of the last three pairs of periopods guide the eggs during spawning, and ovigerous setae, which only occur following pre-spawning moult and are used to secure the eggs to the pleopods for brooding. <b>Reproductive system</b> <b>Male</b> Male reproductive system consists of a pair of testes, a pair of vasa differentia and a pair of vasiculeae seminalis. The testis is soft white and elongated structures which fuse at their anterior ends. Each testis consists of a large number of coiled, narrow and thin walled seminiferous tubules, embedded in the connective tissue. A single layer of germinal epithelium, the cells of which undergo spermatogenesis. The products of both the testes pass through two separate coiled and narrow tubes called vasa deferens. On reaching ventrally, near the base of the 5th pair of legs each vas deferens swells into a club-shaped vesicular seminalis, into which spermatozoa are stored. Each vesicular seminalis opens to the exterior via male genital pore at the base of the coxa of the 5th pereopods.</p>
<p><b>Female</b> Female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovary and a pair of oviduct. The ovaries are white, compact and sickle shaped structures, touching each others at both the ends but leaving a gap in the middle. The shape and size of the ovary changes with age and season. They get greatly enlarged during breeding season and may reach upto first abdominal segment. The smaller and immature ova lie toward the center while mature towards the surface. Each ovary gives rise to a short, wide and thin walled tube, oviduct which runs vertically downwards to open outside through a female gonopores on the inner side of the coax of the 3rd pereopods.</p>
<p><b>Mating and Spawning</b> Mating occurs only between a soft- shelled female and a hard shelled male. Female undergoes pre-spawning moult (PSM), which stimulates the male for mating. Mating occurs after PSM and at night. The male deposits the sperm mass between the 3rd to 5th pereopods of the female. Females lay eggs 8-12 hours after mating. The eggs get fertilized while they come out of the female gonopores. These eggs are then directed towards the brood pouch by the peculiar movement of the ovipositing setae. Finally, the eggs get attached to the ovigerous setae present in the brood chamber and are continuously aerated by the female through fanning of pleopods. Eggs hatch in 15 -25 days depending on water temperature. The hatching process is completed in 1 or 2 nights with the newly hatched larvae being dispersed into the water by vigorous movement of pleopods.</p>
<p><b>Life cycle</b> The berried females with different stages of egg development migrate to the estuaries, because the larvae of giant freshwater prawn invariably require brackishwater for their further development. The hatching and the larval development take place in brackishwater. The newly metamorphosed post larvae stay in brackishwater initially (for 2 to 3 weeks) and then migrate upstream. Adults inhabit freshwater bodies, mature and mate there.</p>

<p>REQUIREMENTS OF GIANT FRESHWATER PRAWN HATCHERY</p>
<p>1. Site selection - Large scale commercial prawn hatcheries should coastal sites having adequate supply of sea water and freshwater free form pollutants. - The site should be amenable for provision of infrastructural facilities such as availability of electricity, accessibility, etc. - Small scale, medium scale and backyard hatcheries can be established at any place where good quality of freshwater is available along with either concentrated brine solution or artificial sea water. - Broodstock should be available in the vicinity of the hatchery.</p>
<p>2. Infrastructure facilities: Infrastructure facilities include earthen broodstock ponds to maintain adequate supply of brooders, water supply system, aeration system, main hatchery shed for housing broodstock holding tanks, hatching tanks, larval rearing tanks, post-larvae holding tanks, Artemia nauplii production unit, Moina culture unit, laboratory, power house, pump house, etc.</p>
<p>2.1 Broodstock ponds: - Continuous supply of good quality brooders is one of the prerequisites for the successful operation of commercial hatchery. - Site for broodstock ponds should be in the vicinity of hatchery complex. - The texture of the soil should be sandy-loam or sandy-clay loam with pH 6.5 to 8.0. - The site should have perennial source of freshwater free from pollutants. - Minimum two ponds required for maintenance of broodstock.</p>
<p>2.2 Water supply system The water supply system consists of storage tanks for sea water, freshwater and brackishwater (mixed water), filtration unit and water distribution system to various sections of the hatchery.</p>
<p>2.2 .1. Freshwater: - Freshwater may be obtained from a tube well or from a perennial canal free from pollutants. - CaCO3 hardness should be &lt; 50 ppm. - Fresh water storage tanks - Filter units.</p>
<p>2.3 .2. Sea water: - Inland land locked states can obtain required saline water either through transportation of concentrated brine solution or artificial sea water. - Seawater storage tanks. - Salts for making artificial seawater. - Coastal hatcheries pump seawater from inter-tidal zone during high tide, through an under ground filter point.</p>
<p>2.2 .3. Brackishwater (mixed water) - Mixing tanks - Supernatant water from the freshwater and seawater storage tanks is to be pumped into the mixing tanks so as to get desired salinity (14±2 ppt) with through aeration or with an agitator. - If the freshwater source is from open canal, the mixed water may be treated with bleaching powder to get 5 to 10 ppm chlorine to kill the microflora and microfauna. - After 10-12 hours of chlorination (contact period), agitate water to remove residual chlorine; If still chlorine is present treat with sodium thiosulphate to remove residual chlorine. As far as possible avoid use of sodium thiosulphate, because it is toxic to the larvae. - 1 ppm residual chlorine needs 7 ppm of sodium thiosulphate. - Add 10ppm EDTA to the dechlorinated water to settle heavy metals, if any. - Alternatively water may also be treated with ozone and probiotics.</p>
<p>2.2 .4. Water supply grid: - PVC rigid pipe should be used for water supply grid. - The grid should be fixed above the ground level with proper slope for draining and cleaning as and when required. - Polypropylene control valves to be fixed at appropriate place in the grid.</p>
<p>3. Aeration system: - Uninterrupted pure air supply to all the units of hatchery is very essential to meet the desired DO2 levels. - Oil- free air-blower should be used to get desired quantity of air. - Stand-by air blower is essential. - A shed for installation of air blowers. - Air supply grid should be PVC and provided with polypropylene valves at appropriate place. - The aeration grid should be fixed above the ground level with proper slope to drain condensed water and to clean as and when necessary. - 4. Power supply system: - In addition to regular electric supply, a stand by generator set is essential to operate desired machinery/ equipment. - Power hose for installation of generator. - 5. Main Hatchery Complex: - The main hatchery complex is a shed covered with asbestos cement sheets. - It consists of broodstock unit, larval rearing unit, Artemia hatching unit, postlarval rearing unit.</p>
<p>5.1. Broodstock unit: - This is an asbestos roofed shed. This unit has provision to hold berried females and hatchlings of eggs of berried females. The unit is provided with freshwater, brackishwater and air supply grids of PVC all along the walls inside the shed.</p>
<p>5.1.1. Berried females holding tanks: - The broodstock unit consists of various size (5.0 to 10.0 ton capacity) cement tanks/plastic pools/ FRP tanks to hold the berried females collected from the broodstock ponds. - The berried females having different stages of egg development are stocked in separate tanks i.e. the prawns with orange colour eggs, the prawns with brown colour eggs and the prawns with grey colour eggs. 5.1.2. Hatching tanks: - The size of hatching tanks varies from 250 to 500 l capacity. - Normally FRP tanks are used for hatching.</p>
<p>5.2. Larval rearing unit: - Larval rearing unit plays a major role in the successful operation of prawn hatchery. - The larval rearing shed should be situated with a North-South orientation having large windows on eastern and western sides for proper ventilation. - The roof of the shed is covered with asbestos cement sheets interspersed with one translucent fibre glass sheet after every three sheets, which allows light intensity of 200 to 500 Lux. - The hatchery should have concrete flooring with proper slope and drainage facility. - The unit should be provided with freshwater, brackishwater and air supply grids of PVC all along the walls inside the shed.</p>
<p>5.2.1. Larval Rearing Tanks: - Prawn larvae are reared in different types and sizes of tanks made up of cement, FRP, Ferro-cement, etc. - Circular tanks are with smooth inner surface preferred for better management. - Corners of the tank bottom should be rounded off for easy and efficient cleaning and to avoid the growth of bacteria. - Tank should have proper drainage system. - Small hatcheries need 0.25 to 1.0 ton and commercial hatcheries use 1.0 to 5.0 ton capacity tanks. - Colour of the tanks plays major role in growth and survival. - Dark colours i.e. red, black, dark grey, geen,blue etc. are preferred. - The tanks should be provided with aeration.</p>
<p>6. Artemia Hatching Unit: - This is an asbestos covered shed. - Artemia hatching tanks are 50 to 500 l capacity FRP cylindro-conical jars. The conical part of the jar is translucent and the inner surface of the jar is white in colour. - The jar should have a lid. - Aeration should be provided at the centre of the cone to avoid settlement of eggs. - An outlet valve should be provided at the cone of the jar to harvest the Artemia nauplii after hatching. - Two florescent tube lights to be fixed one feet above the jar to get 1000 Lux. 7. Post-larval Rearing Unit: - This is an asbestos roofed side open shed. - It consists of 5.0 to 10.0 ton capacity cement tanks/plastic pools/FRP tanks. The size of the tanks vary depending on the production capacity of hatchery. - Aeration should be provided in all the tanks.</p>
<p>8. Laboratory: - A small laboratory is required for water analysis, larval observation, wet feed preparation, etc.</p>
<p>9. Equipments: Salinity refractometer, chloroscope, pH meter, thermometer, analytical balance, mixer, cooker, refrigerator, oven, hotplate, sieves, plankton nets, 100 micron bolting silk cloth, plastic wares, and glass wares pumps, etc.</p>
<p>10. Other Facilities: - In addition to the above facilities, overhead tanks, store, office, staff quarters, etc. are required.</p>

<p>Christopher Bramble is a published poet whose works include: "On the Corner of State of Main" about a blind man who sees a world free from War, Raciality, and Indifference. He also writes, "The Pretender" about wanting to be apart of society. This poem is a reference to Christopher's problems with shyness while growing up.</p>
<p><b>"The Pretender"</b> Burdened with facing the world I can see quite well looking down at the sidewalk. When people say hello, I don't really have to talk. I can stutter through my words, Making it difficult to hear. And I can always run away, As opposed to facing my fear. Then, I wouldn't miss the world, Would I?</p>
<p><br />
Christopher was born on July 23, 1968 in Honolulu, HI. His father is a former lieutenant in the US Navy, and former government worker. His mother was a school teacher.</p>
<p>In 1988, Christopher signed on to serve as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. He was called to serve in South Florida. After the mission he pursued a college degree, first in Communications, and then in Theater at Weber State College in Ogden, UT. After an unfortunate bout with alcohol. Christopher eventually dropped out.</p>
<p>In 1998, cured and sober, Christopher went back to school first at Grossmont College where he again studied Theater. He studied both acting and playwrighting. He played the complacent Police Chief in the Grossmont Production of Oyamo's "I Am A Man." It is a play about the events leading up to the assasination of Martin Luther King, Jr. The play and his role were a success.</p>
<p>Christopher would go on to finish his college degree, with a BA in English at San Diego State in 2002.</p>
<p><br />
Christopher continues to write poetry and plays. Although he has published several poetic works, he has yet to find success as a playwright. He is single and living in San Diego, CA. He is a filmologist (study of films and why they are/are not successes), a writer, and a big fan of the his hometown San Diego Padres.</p>

Laulii Village, home to almost 3000 villagers lies East of the Capital City of Samoa, Apia. The village of Laulii is traditionally part of the Tuamasaga Province, and part of the Sub-district of Vaimauga (Itumalo), but when the Tuamasaga District lost its fight with the Atua District, the boundaries between the two Provinces changed, from Salelesi to Laulii, to this day, the river "Mulivaiopuafasa" (Located near the LDS Chapel) in Laulii marks this event, and is where the Provinces divide. Eventhough the village is divided between two Provinces but it is still part of Vaimauga (Tuamasaga). There are 6 denominations within the village, EFKS (Congregational Christian Church of Samoa formerly known as LMS)which was established in the late 18th century, also the Roman Catholic Church (Holy Family/Aiga Paia), Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS/Mormon), Seventh Day Adventist Church, Samoan Independent Seventh Day Adventist Church and Samoa's fastest growing denomination,AOG (Assembly of God). The Laulii Chiefs and Orators (Alii &amp; Faipule) have already declared to the village that no other religion is prohibited to be part of the 6 existing, if so happens, those involved will be banished from the village.</p>

<p>"New Born Christians" is a broadly used term for the actually ment "Reborn Christians" or also "Born-again Christians". The terms refer to Christians who have went through a pronounced and incisive conversion to faith in Jesus, or especially also to a member of certain protestant fractions that stress this experience. This expression relates to the words of Jesus in the Gospels, in a passage describing a conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus (John 3:1-5): "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Non religious context: somebody who is "born again" has the new will and strength for doing something.</p>

The Australian instance of the surname Quinert is an anglicisation of the name 'Le Quiniat', itself a corruption of the Breton 'Ar Kignat' (Kignat meaning "to skin"). This version of the name arrived with Guillaume Le Quiniat sometime after his arrival in Australia in 1882.</p>
<p>Quinert in the US appears to be of German origin, although at least one Le Quiniat appears to have made it to North America.</p>

<p>Deloria Online is a graphical 2D MMORPG/MPOG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game/multiplayer online game) based in a time when warriors sought out triumph and wizards kept balance across the lands. With might and magic in mind, adventurers slay beasts and boses alone or in groups. Deloria Online offers questing, grouping, skills, spells, multiple classes, unique items and a loyal and friendly community.</p>
<p>The new Deloria Online is still in its alpha stages of development, meaning it is constantly being modified and upgraded as players test current features in the game. Deloria Online, unlike many other online games, focuses on the best gameplay and interests all players have in mind. Deloria Online always has been, and always will be, built upon its devoted players.</p>
<p>Joining other players in Deloria Online not only makes you a part of the game, but a part of the Deloria Online community. With many interactive features in and out of the Deloria world, players can role-play and take their characters to the next level.</p>
<p>Deloria Online is designed, developed and created by Jeff O'Blenis. Deloria Online is a trademark of Nexemis Studios</p>

<p>Pazhanji</p>
<p>About 10 km north of Kunnamkulam is Pazhanji. A market known for arecaunut (Beetel Nut). This is the market where the farmers sells the dried areccanut to the traders and the traders take the product to the final destination in North India. october 2nd of every year the village celebrates the local church festival and the celebratins are colourful with lots of fireworks and processions with music and artists along with decorated elephans. Almost fifty decorated elephants gather on this occassion.</p>
<p><br />
Pazhanji Church</p>
<p>The Church known as "Pazhanji Palli" is situated at Pazhanji near Kunnamkulam. It has historical importance and is a part of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.</p>
<p>Follow the below link to have a satellite view of Pazhanji <a href="http://wikimapia.org/#y=10688579&amp;x=76050590&amp;z=18&amp;l=0&amp;m=a" class="external free" title="http://wikimapia.org/#y=10688579&amp;x=76050590&amp;z=18&amp;l=0&amp;m=a" rel="nofollow">http://wikimapia.org/#y=10688579&amp;x=76050590&amp;z=18&amp;l=0&amp;m=a</a></p>
<p>The church is very old and said to have constructed by believers who fleed from Thirukochi during invasion of TipuSultan's army.Later on they settled here forever and constructed the church. It is how the name "Pazhanji" [similar to the malayalam word for "old"] came into being for the place.</p>
<p>The church is ofcourse few hundred years old and the walls are beautiful with paintings and craft works on the walls, and you can feel a true spiritual experience.</p>
<p>Also the "Pazhanji Perunnal" is very famous and all the people who have migrted to remote places for their livelihood will be back to join the two day old function in the church.</p>
<p>People from the neighbouring countryside and surrounding churches congregate in memory of a Christian Bishop who came to Kerala from Syria. St. Mary’s Church Feast is a grand occasion spread over two days (October 2nd and 3rd) and marked by music and festivities and a colourful procession in which more than 40 caparisoned elephants participate.</p>
<p>It is very famous for the colourful processions with Elephants / bandsets / chendamelam / shinkarimelam... and ofcourse the fireworks.</p>
<p>The "Kodiyum Kurisum" and the "Nercha Oonu" is also the inevitable part and worth participating.</p>
<p>Lot of believers and non believers and also tourists from accross mainland and abroad come and visit the church during the occassion.</p>
<p>Kindly be there to experience it on October 2nd and October 3rd of every year.. You are Welcome.</p>
<p>You may get down at Trichur or Guruvayur Railway Station or Nedumbasseri International Airport to reach Pazhanji [approximately 105 km from Cochin]. From the railway station/airport you should reach Kunnamkulam and then Pazhanji.</p>

Network Spinal Analysis™ is an evidenced based approach to wellness and body awareness. Gentle precise touch to the spine cues the brain to create new wellness promoting strategies. Two unique healing waves develop with this work. They are associated with spontaneous release of spinal and life tensions, and the use of existing tension as fuel for spinal re-organization and enhanced wellness. Practitioners combine their clinical assessments of spinal refinements with patient’s self assessments of wellness and life changes. Greater self-awareness and conscious awakening of the relationships between the body, mind, emotion, and expression of the human spirit are realized through this popular healing work. NSA is exclusively practiced by Doctors of Chiropractic in relationship to the identification and self regulation of spinal tension and subluxation patterns.</p>

FreedomWiki is a site created as a experiment dealing with internet users. The idea being, if a empty site was created, and left with directions on how to add, delete or pretty much maintain the website; Would users who just happen to stumble upon the website, add, colaborate and create new content.</p>
<p>Actual results have yet to be seen, it is a relatively new project.</p>

<p>Darryll Schiff is a fine art and commercial photographer and comes from a family of artists. His work is internationally known. At 8 years old he began classes at the Art Institute of Chicago, where his mother and sister both graduated.</p>
<p>Although his first serious photos were taken back in elementary school, his formal education was at the Institute of Design, which was founded as the New Bauhaus by Lazlo Moholy-Nagy. Beginning in graphic design with Cosmo Campoli, he fell in love with the art of photography, studying with Arthur Siegel, Robert Heineken, Gary Winnogrand, and Aaron Siskind.</p>
<p>Continuing his fine art, he also pursued a successful career in commercial photography, shooting assignments for Los Angeles Magazine, Rolling Stone, San Francisco Magazine, Women’s Wear Daily, Stern, Geo, Beverly Hills Magazine, Capitol Records, Charles Jourdan, and Pepsi. Darryll’s list of celebrity clients include Tea Leoni, Mark Harmon, Jason Patric, Holly Robinson Peete, Sela Ward, Pat Riley, Regina King, Chazz Palminteri, Jasmine Guy, and Robin Williams.</p>
<p>Darryll works on a few select commercial assignments only, spending the majority of his time doing his fine art work, where he can focus on the purely artistic aspects of the images. His work appears in the collections of MOMA New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, George Eastman House, Norton Simon Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, and in many private collections.</p>
<p>His work is included in "The Collectible Moment: Photographs in the Norton Simon Museum" from Oct 13, 2006-Feb 26, 2007.</p>

<p>Genre: Rock <b>Zero Band Members</b></p>
<p>Rajeev Talwar ( Vocals )</p>
<p>Girish Talwar ( Bass )</p>
<p>Warren Mendonsa ( Guitars )</p>
<p>Siddharth Coutto ( Drums, Vocals )</p>
<p><br />
<b>Zero</b> was formed in August 1998 as a side project 'fun' band playing covers of the Eagles, Steely Dan, Pearl Jam and the like. Warren, Bobby and Rajeev had played together a couple of years earlier in a time-pass band (Tantra) while Warren and Sidd were in a band called Vicious Circle. Within seven months, they won their first competition, RAIT's Horizons. By the time their first anniversary rolled around, they had played Independence Rock. Zero had arrived, more or less.</p>
<p>After playing clubs, college shows and the like for another year, the band home-recorded and self released a limited edition CD called 'Albummed'. Continuing on with part-time vocalists for 6 months while Rajeev was in the United States, Zero won best band at Mood-Indigo, IIT Mumbai, 2000 4 days after Rajeev's return. Immediately after, they were featured on RSJ's Great Indian Rock 5 compilation. This gave them their first nationwide exposure.</p>
<p>In 2001 Zero played gigs in Pune, Goa, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Independence Rock (for the third year in a row) with special guests Zubin Balaporia and Mahesh Tinaikar (Ex-Indus Creed). A seven month break followed thanks to work commitments.</p>
<p>Since the reunion in April 2002, Zero has gone from strength to strength. Playing, clubs, Rock Yatra and the biggie ... recording and releasing an 8 song EP titled 'Hook'.</p>
<p>2003 has already been a great year. Vijay Nair came on board as the band manager. They were featured on RSJ's Great Indian Rock 7. Their track PSP 12" has already become a huge crowd favourite. They've been on tour playing gigs in Chennai, Delhi, Roorkee and Ahmedabad. And most importantly, Hook has been selling well, increasing the band's popularity with every sale.</p>
<p>Future plans are to release a full length album in mid 2004.</p>

<p>Released December 2002</p>
<p>Genre Rock</p>
<p>Zero's follow up to Albummed</p>
<p>Review "Nice stuff, but tends to drift into elevator-music territory at times", so said this 40 something friend (who's never seen Zero live) the first time I played Hook to him. I insisted he give it a closer listen, and made him take the CD home. "Awesome stuff man! where have you been hiding these guys!" was his reaction the next day. "That CDs been playing a lot at home" was the weary reaction of his wife a couple of days later. "That guitarist! God! He reminds me of Larry Carlton!" he exclaimed a week later (To compare a guitarist to Larry Carlton is just about the greatest compliment you can pay him... ever!). Two months later I still haven't gotten the CD back, and he's asked me for copies to send to his friends abroad.</p>
<p>What an awesome EP Hook is. Zero boys, take a bow.</p>
<p>Lets take this outside in...</p>
<p>Its an EP, something they've knocked together at home, with programmed drums. No fancy production or inlay, no distribution deal. A cover designed overnight by old friend Saumi (of Cusp fame). Its something they've done to bridge the gap between their first album Albummed (of which very few copies were made) and the next album due end-2003. They've made it quick, and they've made it cheap... they're selling at an all-time low of 50 bucks. They're selling it at shows, giving it away free. They're getting they're music heard by as many rockers as they can . And everyone who hears this album is going to wait for their next album, and kill to get it.</p>
<p>How better can a band go about getting itself heard?</p>
<p>Hook is an 8 song evolution of Zero, the band. The best of what they've done in the last 3-4 years (36 songs, they say). It has this touch of 'lets wrap up this stage of life, put it on CD, and then move ahead', and the end result is awesome.</p>
<p>Zero's music is not difficlt to relate too, matter of fact it almost too easy. Every song follows a simple and basic verse-chorus-bridge format, and has that inevitable 'hook' for the listener to latch onto.... catchy stuff that would appeal to the pop fan as well as the rocker, making them just about the only band around bridging the pop-rock divide with its own music.</p>
<p>The album opener Not My Kind of Girl is the very core of the 'Zero sound'. Clean guitars, smooth vocal harmonies with just that dollop of power that Rajeev throws in, beautiful lead work, and a solid bass and drum backing to make the pieces fit. Warren's guitar tone is something to die for, and what he's done, throughout most of the album, is very cleverly overlay many guitar tracks, playing lead, rhythm, and fills, but still keep a straightforward sound. They can still play the tracks live with just one guitar and sound bang on is what I'm saying.</p>
<p>The next track 'Lost' sounds different, recorded at Claver's studio for the F.O.K compilation album. Its not my favourite track on the album, but watch out for the lead solo bit.</p>
<p>Spitleaf. what can I say. It starts out with a vaguely Boston-ish sound. Very late-eighties rock intro, kicking into one beautiful piece I can best describe as exhilirating. Warren once told me that the reason they don't do this song live is because it would need three of him playing... three guitar tones taking up the tune where the last left off and running with it. Beautiful melody, the soaring sound and the sustain, the clear notes ringing out, the slow-down bridge with the guitar crying, the volume control, the power-ending, the harmonized parts. Exhilirating. This song is like diving into crystal, clear and beautiful, and splitting into so many facets if one just listens carefully.</p>
<p>PSP 12" is an absolute killer, one of the best songs they've done, and a number that marks a pretty significant milestone in the band's evolution. Far as I can remember its the song that started Zero on the heavier riff-based songs they're doing today. The verse is melodic, and the chorus kicks in with a punch. The By-standing-By refrain is something thats led to quite a bit of speculation. A song in which Bobby shines with his bass playing. A beautiful spoken-word bridge with Sidd overlaying a vocal line, a kickass solo and and Warren going crazy with a rare bit of speed soloing on the outro.</p>
<p>Christmas in July is another instrumental number, and a Warren showcase. It is, in fact, the number that has led to more Zero popularity in the rock circle than any other number, thanks to a nod or two (possibly unintentional) to Satriani. This song is followed by Lucy, possibly their biggest number from their old bag of songs, and a song that I love to hear for the many guitar tracks layered to fill up the song. The song with the Pearl Jam-ish intro (gets many rockers at their shows on their feet screaming 'Evenflow!'), a lovely the lead part, and ending riff.</p>
<p>Lijo is the third instrumental number of Hook, a light nod along number with clean guitars, a somewhat Knopfleresque sound, and just this little touch of overdriven bit thrown in for good measure. The album ends with Not My Kind of Girl reprise, a gem of a song, with the country-ish acoustic rhythm and guitar fills, and Sidd's 'crying', a neat little trick with vocals played backwards.</p>
<p>Thats Hook for you, some album from some band. Now listen up. This is where I tell you to not take this album seriously. You'll kill its spirit if you try. Don't search for messages, don't wait for complexity, don't get set to headbang, don't look for a hugely unique sound. Just don't frown in concentration and wait for anything, or you'll miss the point. The point is the hook, thats all you need to catch, and from then on your journey's for you to enjoy. Feel the fun thats gone into making these songs... enjoy!</p>

<p>"Mario Adventure" is a <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hack.html" title="Hack">hack</a> of the game "Super Mario Bros. 3." It has the same sprite graphics and music of SMB3, but the levels are completely different. <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Peach_8c84.html" title="Princess Peach">Princess Peach</a> gets kidnapped by <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Bowser_a403.html" title="King Bowser">Bowser</a> (again), and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario.html" title="Mario">Mario</a> has to save her while getting the kings' wands of each world back. After the title screen, pipes leading to worlds 1-8 are shown with 1-7 accessible. Hidden in each of the worlds is a key needed to access world 8.The names of the worlds in order are Koopa Plains, Hot Foot Caverns, Lakitu Glacier, Kuribo's Woods, Starry Slopes, Colossal Classics, Desert Dares, and Bowser's Castle. A magic wand appears as a power-up that never has showed up in any other game. It turns Mario into Magic Mario, who's outfit is black and white and can shoot powerful floating sparks (similar to fireballs). He can also take a few hits before powering down. Look up <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_Bros._3_49ab.html" title="Super Mario Bros. 3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a> for similarities.</p>

The Swan fan Makkum is the largest Brigantine in the world, with an overall length of 61 metres and an air draft of 44 metres.</p>
<p>She was built in Gdansk in 1993, and is operated as a charter vessel most of the year, but regularly participates in at least part of the Tall Ships race series, where she often finishes high up the rankings of the Class A ships.</p>

<p>Episode 60 will be the final episode of season 3 and the last episode of the avatar the last airbender presumably. Aang will face the fire lord in this episode. It is highly unlikely if another season will be produced. The only evidence is the name of seasons which have the name of an element. Based on this, Season 4 would be called air. If it is produced, Anng and his friends would go into the air nation to look for other for living airbenders. It is unlikely because the plot is for Aang to learn the four elements and use them to fight the Fire Lord.</p>

<p>Loophead Lighthouse is situated on the tip of the Loophead Peninsula in West Clare. It separates the Shannon Estuary from the Atlantic. There has been a lighthouse on the site since 1670. The original was a stone cottage with a metal brazier on the roof which housed a warning fire. In the last century the current tower was erected. In 1991 it was fully automated. The lighthouse is maintained by the Commissioner of Irish Lights. The adjoining buildings now form self-catering accommodation for tourists.</p>
