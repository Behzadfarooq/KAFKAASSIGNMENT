<p>Transwiki'd already. This is an article about a one-liner. I checked the refs, they are actually more or less generic references to U-Haul and would apply equally to anyone with a bad relationship history. I didn't see the exact phrase "u-haul lesbian" in them, although maybe I miseed it. This looks like a distillation of primary sources and a one-line gag combined to make what looks like an article but actually isn't. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 19:19, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The transwiki was bizarre given that phrase "U-Haul Lesbian" is a multi-level and complex phenonmen that goes way beyond a "dictionary definition". The article has made verifiable attempts to cover the term as a sterotype, a description of the dating behavior as well as the GLBT cultural signifigance it has following its orgins in gay humor. The term is given serious treatments in several of the references such as Dr. Pimental-Habib &amp; Christopher Alexander's two books. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 19:27, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> although I would agree with the nominator that a number of the sources are deficient, e.g. they discuss lesbian relationships and make one reference to U-Haul.

<li>I have. The <i>Houston Voice</i> article says <i>nothing</i> about this subject at all. The <i>Metro Weekly</i> article simply repeats the joke without any further analysis of what a U-Haul lesbian is, as do all of the <i>Seattle Weekly</i> article, the first article in <i>The Advocate</i>, the book by Hardin, the book by Stevens (which is actually discussing sexually transmitted diseases), and the book by Alexander (which is actually discussing the subject of "merging in lesbian relationships", per the title in boldface at the top of the page). The second article in <i>The Advocate</i> actually talks about U-Haul <i>trucks</i>, not U-Haul lesbians. The book by Marcus mentions the joke <i>in a two word footnote</i> and proceeds to talk about the reality of couple formation, which it states to be quite different. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The sources I examined do mention the joke, but they are not about the concept of "U-Haul lesbians". They are about the feature of some lesbian relationship to which the U-Haul joke is pointing. Whether the woman is using a U-Haul or the back of her pickup is irrelevant. "U-Haul" here means exactly what it means to everyone else in the world; I could easily substitute "moving van" for "U-Haul" or remove the joke altogether and the substantive content of the article would be the same. It seems to me that this substantive content is about lesbian relationships and should therefore be <b>merged to <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">Lesbian</a></b>. If the article remains as it stands, please <b>delete the Transwiki box</b>. - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMae</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">t</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">c</a> - <a href="../../../w/p/n/WP%7EWPN_02d0.html" title="WP:WPN">wpn</a>)</sup> 09:31, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMae</a>. There is no source material about "U-Haul lesbians". Searching, I haven't found any substantial sources that are any different to the cited ones, and that do more than just repeat the joke. The cited sources are actually discussing topics such as how to broach the subject of STDs with one's new partner (the book by Stevens), how <i>slowly</i> couples moved in with each other (the book by Marcus), and "merging in lesbian relationships" (the book by Alexander). This entire article is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, a novel synthesis of sources in order to define a concept that is solely used in the punchline of a joke. Anything substantive to say about lesbian relationships should be said in an article on that topic. Given that most of the content of this article involves twisting the sources out of shape to discuss the joke stereotype rather than the actual subjects that they are addressing in their text, it seems that there's little content to save with a merger that wouldn't require a significant and almost entire rewrite anyway. About the only content worth saving are the book citations themselves, so that editors can go and read the sources and use them to expand articles on the actual subjects that they discuss. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Speedy keep is not a valid&#160;!vote in this context.

<li><b>Keep</b> The concept is certainly out there in the lesbian community, and goes beyond just the punchline to a joke.

<li>Per the cited sources, it <i>doesn't</i> go beyond the punchline of a joke.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see no reason why we shouldn't do articles on lesbian jokes or any other type of humor, particularly when the joke has gained widespread currency over a long period and speaks to deeper sociological issues.
