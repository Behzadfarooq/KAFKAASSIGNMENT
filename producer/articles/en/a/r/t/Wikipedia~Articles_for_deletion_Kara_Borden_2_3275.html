<p>The last AFD of this closed suggesting that this be re-opened in several months, and I am of the opinion that this individual is not notable and that there is no point of having an article for them. Whatever hype there may have been in the media has long passed and we should not set a precedent of including memorial pages and keeping record of every story of someone's troubled life. This article also needlessly violates the privacy of the subject and their family. This is an encyclopedia, not a news service. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 01:34, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

You can not substitute <b>is mentioned in</b> for this phrase. Kara Borden is <b>not</b> the subject of the Fox news source identified in the article. This is about Ludwig and the murders. Kara is mentioned, but is CERTAINLY NOT <i>the subject of</i>. The other source which reads more like a blog than a verifiable source (the one on the court-tv site) could be argued to have her as <i>the subject of</i>, but it is a stretch, and that would be only one source. The blog by the boyfriend does not count as a verifiable source, and Kara is not the subject of that either, anyway. Please explain how you arrived at the conclusion you are proclaiming here and in my editor review about how she passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> with <i>flying colors</i> and how my comment above was <i>editing from the gut</i> and used poor reasoning. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 02:23, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Here's an idea how to address it: <b>read the article</b>. The subject of the article is the killings of the parents. The person doing the talking in any situation is NOT the subject of what is being said, except when the person is talking about themselves. The article is about the death of her parents. So one could argue that they are the subject of that article, and therefore notable. But the daughter is not the subject of the article, and therefore, if that article alone is used to determine notability, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>, she does NOT pass. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 11:46, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> A couple of problems with the nomination. First, for purposes of inclusion, notability and verifiability doesn't "expire" with time. (If it did, we'd lose all manner of historical information that the public has lost interest in.) Either she appears in published articles or she doesn't. Assuming the references in the article are valid, and she has been the subject of multiple articles, she would be notable. Second, the nominator mentioned the article was previously up for afd discussion, but looking at the article history and talk page I don't see any links to the previous debate. If someone could provide a link to the previous debate for reference, that'd be great. At any rate, workign under the assumption that the references check out, I see no violation of policy here. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:26, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

And I agree with you that notability does not expire with time - in that case, I'll change my stance to state that this article never was notable. This was simply (sorry to put it harshly) another abduction that led to nothing notable, unlike other such crimes that spawned the AMBER alert system or Megan's law. If this article is deleted, policy should more clearly state what notability is in terms of short-lived news stories. Why do we write about common abductions that just happen to get news coverage when we don't cover every single murder that reaches news headlines and car accidents as well? <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 23:51, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>{{WP:BIO|Notability is not subjective]]. I'm frankly puzzled at the people who keep arguing delete because she's non-notable. She's <i>indisputably notable</i> - she meets one or more of the notability criteria. I mean, sure, the article is of low importance, but <i>Low importance</i> is not an accepted criterion for deletion - and given that article evaluations keep it as a level of importance, I think it's fairly clear that establishing "only somewhat important" as a criterion for deletion would not be an easy task. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:54, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>We may have lost track of what <i>non-trivial</i> means, lets again look at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for a definition: "Non-triviality is a measure of the depth of content of a published work, and how far removed that content is from a simple directory entry or a mention in passing that does not discuss the subject in detail. <b>A 200-page independent biography of a person that covers that person's life in detail is non-trivial</b>" - - - She does NOT pass. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 21:15, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>whereas a birth certificate or a 1-line listing on an election ballot form is not.</b> is maybe the most important omission. The word <i>trivial</i> is pretty self explanitory, but the sources are not mere directory entries, nor do they only mention the subject in passing. While the coverage on her may not conglomerate to a 200 page book (and if we searched, it might - I have no idea). Why not look at the other kind of criterion in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for a guide of what kind of person is notable. Anyone who's taken the field for an inning of major league baseball without touching the ball passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> - and they're likely to have comparable or lesser coverage than this girl does. Whereas the sources here don't match the 200 page biography example, they're far closer to that than the example of trivial coverage. If you believe the coverage is trivial, you need to go back and review it. It's not, and it's not even mistakable for trivial coverage. Look, I recognise you must have formed your opinion earlier when the article was in worse shape, but as it stands the article is now a 100% clear cut case of passing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> - it's not even remote possible to plausible argue otherwise without being inconsistant with the facts. It happens that an article that looks like a delete at first glance turns into a keep, after some editing. Hell, the first article I nominated for deletion got improved during the AfD and even I have to recognise that by the ene it was a clear-cut keep. Rather tha struggle to vindicate your original conclusion, rejoice that the the encyclopaedia has been improved in the meantime. A positive thing has happened for a valuable, encyclopaedic article. Fighting about it simply makes no sense. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
