<li><b>Comment</b>. I really disagree. You're biting the newbies, in this case me! I'm new and unfamiliar to Wikipedia and I am working as hard as I can to get this article up to the standards. Mr Greg Wain complies to the following:</li>
</ul>
<p>"If an academic/professor meets any one of the following conditions, they are definitely notable. If an academic/professor meets none of these conditions, they may still be notable, and the merits of an article on the academic/professor will depend largely on verifiability.</p>
<p><b>The person is regarded as a significant expert in their area by independent sources.</b> <b>The person is regarded as an important figure by those in the same field.</b> The person has published a large quantity of academic work (of at least reasonable quality). The person has published a significant or well-known academic work. <b>The person is known for originating an important new concept, theory or idea.</b> <b>The person is known for being the advisor of an especially notable student.</b> The person has received a notable award or honor, or has been often nominated for them."</p>
<p>I understand you may disagree, but please I'm trying as hard as I can to compile all the information to stop this article being deleted. Please, please I beg of you, don't delete the article. It hurts me that all these administrators seem to enjoy using their power to burn the little guy. Like I said before, I'm new and I do not possess the expertise or understanding that you have of Wikipedia. I just hope you guys understand...

I don't see anything that asserts the importance of his research. Google hits of 18 for "Greg Wain" + "Emotional intelligence" most of which are from the school's website.

<li><b>Provisional Delete</b> JonoL, you quote the correct Wikipedia guidelines above. However I don't see how Mr. Wain meets these. A fundamental policy of Wikipedia is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> which states that the ultimate criterion for inclusion in Wikipedia is <i>verifiability not truth</i>. In other words we need <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that provide evidence for your claims of notability. In particular, the notability claims seem to be around the "Wain-Mayer" model of emotional intelligence. Has this work been peer reviewed? It appears from the article that it has just been distributed around a set of schools. That alone would not meet the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">professor test</a>. However, if this work has been published in a reputable scientific journal, Mr. Wain would meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability test</a>. In that case I'll happily change my vote here to Keep. Good luck, <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gw</a><a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_Esperanza_97e1.html" title="User:Gwernol/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">rnol</a> 12:42, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Incidentally, I do not see any "biting" taking place in this discussion, JonoL. That term should not be thorwn around so lightly. <a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPJM_3604.html" title="User:PJM">PJM</a> 12:45, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Sorry JonoL but, although he reads as a fine and laudable person, the he does not meet Wikipedia's notability standards. If he had been published ( per <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> ) or had significant things written about him in say newspapers or scholarly works then the article would have a better chance. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 13:03, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless verifiable evidence can be produced of notability. JonoL, I can see you're trying to write a good article, but Mr Wain just isn't the right subject. This isn't "biting", this is just how Wikipedia works. Good luck with your <i>next</i> article! <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartF_f292.html" title="User:StuartF">StuartF</a> 13:04, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Unless there is some reason for independent notability, involving significant outside attention, I can't see any way a secondary-school teacher, principal or headmaster passes notability. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 14:26, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> I really wanted to Keep, but I couldn't scare up anything on Google Scholar. Alternatively, if the papers he has published can be <i>verified</i> to have had a significant effect on educational policy on Australia, I would argue that makes him notable. --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_66a1.html" title="User:Ginkgo100">Ginkgo100</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/i/n/User_talk%7EGinkgo100_02a2.html" title="User talk:Ginkgo100"><i>talk</i></a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ginkgo100_6dbb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ginkgo100"><i>contribs</i></a></sup> 16:48, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> this nicely written, well structured, well formatted, properly Wiki-linked article. I hope the editor will create similar articles on more-encyclopedic topics. The only cited source is a one-paragraph biographical sketch from a school website. He has no hits in Google Books, a personal touchstone of mine. Greg Wain does not meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:33, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> not-notable. My bias towards <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Southport_School_93e5.html" title="The Southport School">the School</a> is quite irrelevant as a) he clearly fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as this is a vanity page for a non-notable pedagogue and b) he became headmaster after I departed and I thus have no relations or personal acquaintance with him. We do not have pages for the headmasters of every school in Australia just because they are well-known in their field. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">Jammo (SM247)</a> 06:46, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> The fact that an article doesn't meet guidelines on this page, does not necessarily mean it qualifies for speedy deletion, as a mere claim of notability (even if contested) may avoid deletion under A7 (Unremarkable people or groups)&#160;; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted.

<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> no-one is proposing that it be speedy deleted. This is an Article for Deletion discussion, not a speedy deletion proposal. You are correct that this does not fall under the A7 speedy deletion criterion, but those are not the criteria used in AfD discussions. There is (so far) no evience that Greg Wain meets any of the notability guidelines and if he does not then the article is subject to debate and potential deletion. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 02:20, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> with regret. I googled Wain Meyer and emotional intelligence and could not find our boy. It sounds as though he's about to become notable, but it seems not yet. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 17:07, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page should not be considered a vanity page. Greg Wain is a figurehead, headmaster, and currenlty holds a position of authority. He should be considered relevant. Note: for further information on Mr. Wain, Google 'Greg Wain'.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia: "An article is "important" enough to be included in Wikipedia if any one of the following is true:</p>
<p>There is evidence that a reasonable number of people are, were or might be concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community). It is an expansion (longer than a stub) upon an established subject. Discussion on the article's talk page establishes its importance.</p>
<p>If an article is "important" according to the above then there's no reason to delete it on the basis of it being: of insufficient importance, fame or relevance, or currently small or a stub, or obscure. (Detailed obscure topics hurt no-one because it's hard to find them by accident, and Wikipedia isn't paper.)"</p>
<p>Greg Wain is well known amongst the private school and Gold Coast community (this community exceeds 200,000 persons). This article is an expansion of the The Southport School 'wikipage', and hopefully the discussion here establishes his importance.</p>
<p>I look forward to any feedback.</p>

<p>"Out of the frying pan, and into the fire" -Brookie</p>
<p>As much as I don't wish for this statement to be true, it may be. Some administrators have proposed Greg Wain's deletion. I'm hurt and when I look at articles like the zero movement, which is one of Coca's Cola's thousands of marketing campaings I wonder why Greg Wain must be constantly scrutinised. I fail to see how a marketing campain which showed a few ads of some guy on a bus ARE MORE significant the Greg Wain, but who am I to decide?</p>
<p>I'd like to thank all the administrators who posted comments on this page. I appreciate the time you have taken to help a new Wikiuser. I have learnt some valuable lessons.</p>
<p>Once again thanks to everyone for reviewing the Greg Wain article and leaving their comments. Best wishes <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonoL_ac79.html" title="User:JonoL">JonoL</a> 00:01, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Wain doesn't seem notable now. However, as a recent newbie myself, I'd suggest we give the creator at least a few more days to work on the article and get it past the notability criteria.
