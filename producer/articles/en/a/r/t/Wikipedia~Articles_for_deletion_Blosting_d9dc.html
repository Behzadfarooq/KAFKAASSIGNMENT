<li><b>Delete</b>. Soon is not now. Plus this sentence: "The first widely known occurrence of blosting was a 2006 biography of Ernst Choukula on Wikipedia.org" makes the article look like missusing Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarg_cafc.html" title="User:Sarg">Sarg</a> 08:27, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Re: Wikipedia, I also noticed that wording and have edited accordingly. Considering the speed at which information travels online, "soon" and "now" are quickly becoming interchangeable. A quick Google search for "Ernst Choukula" will show that dozens of online zines and blogs have already covered this breaking subcultural expression.Jonabechtolt 08:44, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> You infer from this that one person, or a small collective of people, are solely responsible for steps 1,2 and 3. This is not the case. I discovered the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Chocula_a46c.html" title="Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> entry through <a href="http://kottke.org" class="external text" title="http://kottke.org" rel="nofollow">kottke.org</a> and appreciate the interesting problem it poses for Wikipedia. The solution is not to simply delete. To do so violates a number of Wikipedia policies, most notably <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.--71.106.80.32 20:37, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Read our policies more carefully before you cite them, please. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is a policy for interacting with users, not keeping articles. I might assume that you are, in good faith, defending the inclusion of non-notable original research on Wikipedia, but that should not deter me in the slightest from having it deleted as quickly as possible. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 20:41, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is my contention that editors are acting too harshly in the particular instance of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Chocula_a46c.html" title="Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> edit, and that the reason for such extreme harshness is a lack of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> in the users carrying out those edits, myself included. This observation seems to be repeatedly verified by the decidedly pompous assertions that Wikipedia's policies are both unknown and misunderstood by myself and other users attempting to document a light-hearted and inconsequential (yet verifiable) event in the history of Chocula.--71.106.80.32 21:27, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><s>Complete and total rubbish. This IP should be banned.</s> Okay, while that was very harsh, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith cannot be assumed</a> since your intent to vandalize Wikipedia to make a point is clear.

<li><b>Delete</b> so a vandal created an article about his own vandalism in an attempt to create a new term for vandalism?

<li>You people are being really harsh, and unreasonable. Whether <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilelvrum_a388.html" title="User:Philelvrum">Philelvrum</a> and Jonabechtolt created the meme or not, it is something that is being moderately (significantly) reported. There is a Wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">Vandalism</a>. There is a Wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>. Mention of Blosting, the attempted neologism and its coverage by various blogs does not constitute "rewarding" the users with an article.--71.106.80.32 19:52, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The specific vandalism incident is non-notable, even if it was mentioned offhand in several blogs. However, the <i>term</i> is clearly original research. A search for "blosting" google gives 335 results, mostly typos. The fact that somebody is trying to make a neologism out of abusing our website annoys the heck out of me, but the <i>reason</i> we're deleting the article is that it violates about a half-dozen of our policies for the inclusion of articles. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 20:37, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Are you stating that the original "vandalism" of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Chocula_a46c.html" title="Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> is non-notable, or this specific article? I understand your reservations about adding an article specifically devoted to Blosting (it seems premature), but I do believe the so-called "blost" of Chocula is significant--or at least as significant as the other events in the Cultural References category. The inclusion of information about the Chocula "blost" in this area of the Chocula page is fully in line with Wikipedia's policies regarding editing of and addition to existing articles.--71.106.80.32 20:44, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No reference to the vandalism of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Chocula_a46c.html" title="Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> article should appear in that article. The article is for <i>facts about the cereal</i>, not for <i>facts about the article on the cereal</i>. This is per <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">Wikipedia:Avoid self-references</a>. Please read our policies more carefully; I must <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume</a> (in the absence of significant evidence to the contrary) that your incorrect assertions about them are made in error and not out of malice. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 20:51, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have read <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">Wikipedia:Avoid self-references</a> and am very familiar with it. I believe you are misinterpreting, and am willing to concede it is without malicious intent. The WP:ASR refers specifically to references such as "According to this Wikipedia article" (which the Chocula reference is not), and goes on to make clear that, "Wikipedia can, of course, write about Wikipedia...If, in this framework, you link from an article to a Wikipedia page outside the main namespace, use external link style to allow the link to work also in a site with a copy of the main namespace content." The information about Chocula's edit as verified by aforementioned sources should be included with external links in either Cultural Refs or External Links section of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Chocula_a46c.html" title="Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a>.--71.106.80.32 21:13, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uh, nope. ASR may not explicitly spell out the obvious fact that <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Chocula_a46c.html" title="Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> is not an article about edits to the article, but it is unquestionably a blatant self-reference for us to clog articles with facts about previous edits to the article itself. It is against the fundamental fact that we're writing an encyclopedia, not promoting ourselves; just the words "avoid self-references" themselves make this clear. (If the vandalism of the specific page somehow magically became notable, there would be an article on that on a separate page—but I don't think that could ever happen.) Further discussion of this should be in the talk page of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Chocula_a46c.html" title="Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> article, although I doubt there's much point. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 21:23, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The "vandalism" of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Chocula_a46c.html" title="Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> has become notable, not by "magic" but through <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Kottke_1894.html" title="Jason Kottke">kottke.org</a>, et al. Further discussion of this particular aspect of the "blosting" controversy will be taken up on <a href="../../../c/o/u/Talk%7ECount_Chocula_f11d.html" title="Talk:Count Chocula">Talk:Count Chocula</a>.--71.106.80.32 21:40, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
