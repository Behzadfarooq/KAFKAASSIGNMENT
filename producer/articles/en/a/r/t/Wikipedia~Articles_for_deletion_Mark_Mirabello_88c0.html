<li><b>Comment</b> "subject is mentioned in wikipedia by others" - dubious - only mentioned in article on The Odin Brotherhood, book by Mark Mirabello, also up for deletion. 82.23.107.27 - your case is not helped by trolling KimvdLinde, and reference to <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drosophilidae.html" title="Drosophilidae">Drosophilidae</a> is completely irrelevant to this discussion.

<dd>Hello, if KimvdLinde has read the books in question then I am happy to retract my comments but as I suspect she hasn't then surely her comments that the subject in question's works are not notable and nothing worth mentioning are, as you say of another user's comments (hypocrisy eh, gotta love it) pretty lame. Not having heard of something cannot possibly be a verifiable reason for deletion in a worldwide encyclopedia. You'd have to be an ubermensch of the highest variety to KNOW and be able to comment on the notability of everything in the world.

<dd>Several arguments here are <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominems.html" title="Ad hominems">ad hominems</a> directed at me (primarily by new editors), but whether I (or the new editors for that matter) have heard of the person is irrelavant. Arguments should be independent of that. The argument that there are other comparable articles is irrelevant (they might indeed qualify for deletion as Not Notable), inclusion in Wikipedia should be based on more objective criteria, as outlined in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability_(people)</a>. Based on the criteria as a professor, I should be able to find at least a substantial number of references to his work from other scholars, such as in Web-of-Science (zero hits) or google scholar (1 or 2 hits) or google itself (found one, missed maybe some, but likely less than 5 hits). Notability as a writer, even for a subculture (who especially interact at the web) should result in substantial mentioning of the author at the web beyond book reviews, sales lists etc and that is fairly limited. I surely believe he is a nice person (based on what people write about him and from his email), and that he is liked by his students and such, but that does not make someone of encyclopedic value in my opinion, who's main entry at the page is the courses that he teaches. --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">KimvdLinde</a> 14:23, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: My reason for voting <b>keep</b> earlier was due to the fact that in order to become published, the professors work needs to have undergone peer review and as such this makes him notable within his field of work.

<li>Dudes, seriously, he's a non-notable professor who writes non-notable books and none of the arguments for or against can distort those facts. Fails professor test and author test. The simultaneously hilarious and sickening newbie / sockpuppet / meatpuppet fest going on here, the total failure by more experienced users who are apparently independent of Mirabello and claim expertise in said field to show why any of this is notable or wikify the articles plus the huge amount of spidering these pages are currently getting (ka-ching!) leave me exactly where I started with the Odin Brotherhood. <b>Strong Delete</b>. If people want to nominate other articles just because something they have an interest in was deleted, <b>go ahead</b> and they too can be judged on their merits. Just because you think extreme ironing is nn but wouldn't be deleted is not a reason for keeping any other article, nominate it and see what happens. If people think it's more worthy than what you're into, that's just something you're going to have to deal with. <b><font style="verdana" color="#990099">++D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#9900CC">iz</font></b> 02:38, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> From my little experience, this debate should purely be about this reference, the relevance or irrelevance of other articles is a separate isssue. This article is well written, informative and fully has a place on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not Google's little brother, who gives a damn if the author is not massively referenced on there? Google is a corporate whore, a behemoth of the internet which makes it's own rules. When people use the 'lack of google points' reason for requesting a delete they are striking at the very heart of what they are supposedly defending. Wikipedia is the anti-thesis of Google, and will in time slay it like Saint Dan slew the dragon.

<dd><b>Delete</b>. Not enough information available on Mirabello to write an NPOV article. His historical claims strike me as highly questionable, but I can't find a critical appraisal of them online (other than Wikipedia's), or indeed, <i>any</i> appraisal by someone with relevant academic qualifications. Also, his reputation as an academic does not serve to shore up his reputation as a writer of works of "dark horror fiction" with "<a href="http://www.ufo.se/english/reviews/cannibalwithinenglish.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.ufo.se/english/reviews/cannibalwithinenglish.shtml" rel="nofollow">hardcore, X-rated content</a>." I would support an article on Mirabello if either A) his historical theories attracted attention within the academic community, or B) he became well-known for his fiction. - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMa</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">contribs</a>)</sup> 19:10, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Norse mythology and neo-paganism, secret societies, Nazi occultism (which is heavily influenced by Nordic culture) and cults are sources of scholarly attention around the world.

<li><b>Keep</b> "The Odin Brotherhood" is well known by followers of Odinism. The man has appeared on odinist programs and given lectures. If he appears to be too obscure, this may be a result of the obscurity of Odinism (at least the present incarnation). However, make no mistake that he is well known and respected for his work on the subject. - Dunglemagne <i>(user's first edit)</i><a href="../../../h/r/o/User%7EHroptR_9ca5.html" title="User:HroptR">HroptR</a> 21:56, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There appears to be many editors who have edited anonymously or have created a username solely to vote on this issue. While we appreciate your concern and passion about this issue, unfortunately the input of new users does not have much weight in these matters, because you are not yet a contributing member of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Also, it is expressly against Wikipedia policy to create more than one user account to affect the outcomes of <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">deletion discussion</a> or <i>AfD</i>. This is called <i><a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_sock_puppet.html" title="Internet sock puppet">sock puppetry</a></i>. This practice is highly frowned upon by your fellow Wikipedia editors and is expressly discouraged by <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, every computer on the internet has a unique <a href="../../../i/p/_/IP_address_6ed9.html" title="IP address">IP address</a>, which in most instances, can identify the specific computer and the physical location used to make edits. If numerous editors in a vote all have the same IP address, this is evidence of sock puppetry, and your votes will not be counted. You could also be blocked from editing in the future. <i>You are not completely anonymous!</i></p>
<p>From <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock puppetry</a>:</p>

<dd><i>The <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">Arbitration Committee</a> has ruled that, for the purpose of dispute resolution, when there is uncertainty whether a party is one user with sockpuppets or several users with similar editing habits they may be treated as one user with sockpuppets.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I encourage you to stick around Wikipedia and contribute to the project, regardless of the outcome of this vote. - <a href="../../../h/r/o/User%7EHroptR_9ca5.html" title="User:HroptR">HroptR</a> 22:54, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Note</b> I should add that some of the votes considered <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppets.html" title="Sock puppets">sock puppets</a> are from <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shawnee_State_University_dd8a.html" title="Shawnee State University">Shawnee State University</a>.I do not know much about IP address but I think since all 4,000 students are on the same network at the school, and there are only so many computers on campus, some may log in at different times from the same terminal. I ask that you consider this. stege1</p>
<p><b>Note</b> I would like to add that I am neither a sockpuppet or a student of Shawnee State University, if the above user would like to check my IP address he/she will find that I am resident in Europe at the moment. I stand by every point that I made.</p>
