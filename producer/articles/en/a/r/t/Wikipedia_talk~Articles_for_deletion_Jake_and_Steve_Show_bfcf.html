	    <p>It is suggested that Wikipedia keep this article. If you will notice, this same user has been purposefully deleting all things that mention "Jake and Steve" or the "<a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake_and_Steve_Show_8749.html" title="Jake and Steve Show">Jake and Steve Show</a>" such as <a href="../../../e/d/u/Edutainment.html" title="Edutainment">edutainment</a>. It is more than likely that this user has no grounds for which this article should be deleted except for the fact that he does not like them and/or their show. There are no grounds for which the article should be deleted. Take a look at all other pages about radio shows that are on Wikipedia, such as <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_and_Bubba_e40d.html" title="Rick and Bubba">Rick and Bubba</a>. There is no foul language in the article and nothing in it that is not true. If there is something seen as such, it would be best to remove it and make corrections and not delete the entire article. Not only is it suggested that the article be kept, but that actions be taken to prevent the same user, his email address, or IP address to do anything like this again.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>For the sake of disclosure, I am the original author of this article.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to review the newly-listed page for The Jake and Steve Show. I object to the recommendation for deletion by user jsjsjsjs.</p>
<p>There is a strong existing precedent for the Jake and Steve Show stub within the Radio Shows category. Please, for example, see:</p>
<p>Kevin and Trudie | A &amp; J Show | Pugs and Kelly | The Steve Cochran Show | The Joan Kenley Show | The Jay &amp; Kevin Show | The Dudley &amp; Bob Show</p>
<p>These are only a small percentage of the Wiki articles that are similar to the Jake and Steve Show. While I understand how it may perceived that The Jake and Steve Show article falls under the guidelines of Non-notability, I would like to assert that each of the above shows (and many others) likely appeal to a limited or narrow range of people, may not be "newsworthy," and still exist peacefully on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>As the only morning drive-time radio program on a college campus of 25,000 people, in a town of only 70,000 residents, it is arguable that the show's audience is potentially a full third of the population of its entire market. It is hard to know if many of the listed shows have as proportional an audience in their market. As a result, it is feasible that this show appeals to a relatively broad range of people in its market. Please also note that there have been apparent edits by several users listed only by IP address. After conducting a whois: search for the IP addresses, at least one is listed as being located in Virginia, several hundred miles away for the location of the radio show and well-outside its broadcast range. This seems to indicate there are several independent sources (at least myself and this other person in less than 24 hours!) who may be interested in contributing to the article. This is a MAJOR test for notability, and this article passed it within its first day. Because of this, it cannot be satisfactorily determined that the show is non-notable for lack of appeal.</p>
<p>As for "newsworthy," the show's hosts also write a regular column for the campus newspaper, the Crimson White, a Columbia Scholastic Press Crown Award-winning paper with a circulation nearing 14,000 copies four days a week. This is a larger distribution than many small town newspapers in the entire United States, and it would be foolish to argue that those papers don't cover topics that are "newsworthy" within their intended audience. Through this article, they generate campus discussion and debate through entertaining writing. They often use their radio show as the crux of the articles. For evidence of the debate, feel free to read the article feedback available at Crimson White Online. As a result, it is arguable they are "newsworthy" within their sphere of influence in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Because of this, it cannot be satisfactorily determined that the show is non-notable for lack of "newsworthiness."</p>
<p>Careful investigation of user jsjsjsjs's actions indicate the motivation for deleting this article is entirely personal and not reasonable.</p>
<p>I ask that you please reconsider your recommendation for deletion as I believe I have established that the article and its subject meet the test for notability.</p>
<p>I welcome your response and feedback.</p>
