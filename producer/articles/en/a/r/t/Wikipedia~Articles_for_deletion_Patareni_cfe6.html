<li><b>Keep</b>: Passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> #3. They've had a LOT of album releases. I strongly agree the material looks to be copyrighted, but the band is very legit. I think at a minimum the content needs to be wiped and replaced with something not having the copyvio problems, and maybe stubbed appropriately. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 20:01, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>CROATIAN METAL HISTORY</b> Most of you are probably not familiar with any bands coming from Croatia, but there are quite some reasons for this fact...Apart from being a very small country with a population of only 4 million people, the Metal scene had to fight with several other problems like for instance the civil war, that took place from 1991 until 1995, and through which Croatia got an independent country. In days of former Yugoslavia and even nowadays, there was and is no underground label (because of the bad economical situation of the country), that could make promotion, but labels governed by the state. For this reason, there are only very few Metal albums done on a more proffessional format, which were mainly distributed to Yugoslavian only. But, nevertheless, quite a lot of underground bands were active, playing their music without getting much attention from the press. In the following lines, I will present you only bands from the nowadays Croatian territory (I focus mainly on the bands from the 80s, but also a few, that started in the early 90s!)........</p>
<p>........................Surely Grindcore legend <b>PATARENI</b> from Zagreb must not be missed, though many people would disagree to bring them in connection with Metal due to their influences from the Punk genre. But in my opinion, Metal is the biggest part of their music and therefore I will comment on them. PATARENI started back in 1983 and they are still alive! Their discography is immense with a lot of CDs, LPs and split singles with nowadays very famous bands such as Extreme Noise Terror, Agathocles or Cripple Bastards but also with unknown ones. Through this releases they gained a reputation as a cult band and many wellknown bands claimed PATARENI for being one of their main influences, which was prooved by several tribute releases. By the way, if you want to listen to their early from their long sold out split releases without paying exagerated prices, let me tell you that there was a CD released with the title "Tko Ne Pamti Iznova Prozivljava", that includes many material of those times. However, this band has made a lot of tours through foreign countries in the past and even played some shows in the USA. <b>BUKA</b> was a project of some Patareni members, that started around 1980 and ceased to exist in ca. 1990. I don`t have any information on their discography, but I know, that they have some split releases with Patareni. Well, I had only the oportunity to listen to their split CD and their side was called "Untalented After All These Seconds". Well, by selecting such a title, you can imagine how serious they took themselves. To me, the music is similiar to Patareni, but it is less Metal and more noisy and chaotic Grindcore with many crazy ideas, though still justified to categorize them in the Metal genre. But still I am of the opinion that if you like Patareni, you will also enjoy BUKA as long as you have a big sense for humour (but normally, every Patareni fan is humouristic, otherwise they would not like them!).</p>
