<li><b>Comment</b> It is bogus to claim that coverage in the NY Times does not count for notability because the "just lazily copy press releases." They are a reputable newspaper whose editorial policy screens out non-notable press releases.

<dd>I wouldn't consider either of the first two "reviews" to be independent, considering the obvious COI. Any website that is trying to sell you a book will call its advertisement a "review" but it is hardly unbiased. Now, I'm not trying to imply that only negative reviews qualify, but I don't feel that an advertisement counts as a review. If an impartial (no COI) source reviewed the book, that would qualify, but an advertisement is simply an advertisement. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 11:18, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>*After rereading SWAdair's comment about the reviewers selling books thus having conflicts of interest, I went back to Bookstandard and Kircus sites - they are independent sources which sell their reports either through subscription or individually. There are ads at the sites, but the sites don't directly sell the books from what I've seen --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 23:39, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>*I think that SWAdair is spliting hairs. This isn't a murder trial here. We as part time volunteers should be reasonable and not be forcing each other to visit the library daily to support notability with printed material, when online commercial sources reprint reviews, this should be sufficient. Why spend all this effort to disinclude what may be notable -- let's err toward inclusion with accuracy. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 17:13, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The google test seems to be a circular series of references in this instance. There seems to be no evidence from related professional organizations or by virtue of a note-worthy trail of speaking engagements that he hold a position of notariety. The book for which he recieves most hits seems not to be of much importance either in his field or within pop-culture.

<li>Droliver seems to be critiqing the work of the subject (primary reseach) rather than evaluating notability using WP guidelines. We are judging whether the article's writer has supported notability. Whether Droliver thinks the work is meaningful is irrelevant. If Moalem's books only received poor reviews he would still be notable as an "author". Notability and admirabilty are not the same. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 23:46, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I rewrote the introductory paragraph to more accurately reflect his notability as an author rather than a leader in medical research "<i>Sharon Moalem is a recognized author and researcher in the field of <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_medicine.html" title="Evolutionary medicine">evolutionary medicine</a>. Though notable as an author, there is little published evidence that he is yet recognized as a leader among his peers. There is some critisism of his published theories regarding diabetes as being "junk science."</i> --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 00:28, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As above the book has not been released then he can not be considered an author yet in my mind.

<li><b>Delete</b> per JFW and Droliver.
