<li><b>Keep</b>. The reason for this account is to minimize edit wars; instead of edit warring on a creationist page, one can put the desired version of the page here and then discuss why the page is/isn't POV on the relevent creaitonism talk page.

<li><b>Comment.</b> What is atrocious is that there is no way in Wikipedia to assemble <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> pages in some areas of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">Human</a> activity and thought. This VfD is a case in point. The whole set of Creationism pages have been ravaged by what the Frenchman called "les chiens" (the dogs) who replace quotes, paraphrases, and citations to prominent scholars by the "dog's" own personal research. Evolutionists and creationists alike have ripped out scholarly citations from creationism pages--not to be replaced by better scholarly citations but rather with the Wikipedia editor's own uncited personal research. As I read it, the User:FACTS page sets forth an incredible idea! --that the creationism pages would be assembled <i>only</i> from a balanced presentation of what the scholars have actually written with zero personal research. 8)) So of course, "les chiens" are here to make sure that that cannot happen on Wikipedia. 8)) ---<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERednblu_c10b.html" title="User talk:Rednblu">Talk</a> 22:36, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: After further consideration, I think this project is a bad idea; it seeks NPOV in precisely the wrong way, which is unilateral rewriting by one faction.

<li>As I read the User:FACTS page, only the <i>rules</i> are different from the MainSpace. That is, anyone who works on that series of articles agrees that uncited personal research will not replace paraphrases, quotations, and citations to actual published scholars. How is a mix of 50-50 evolutionists and creationists a unilateral faction? Without good rules, they would be at each others' throats. 8)) I would guess that the rules on the User:FACTS page will have to evolve much more if this project is to succeed. 8)) ---<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERednblu_c10b.html" title="User talk:Rednblu">Talk</a> 05:53, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Certainly I, as a volunteer to the "rebellion" 8)) such as it is, would invite anyone interested in "suppressing descriptions of creationism." But the rules would be quite different on User:FACTS, from my view and only from my one vote. In contrast to the normal operation of Wikipedia, those interested in "suppressing descriptions of creaitonism" would not be allowed to "suppress descriptions of creationism." 8)) As I read the rules, everyone is to report in a balanced fashion what the various scholars have actually written about the topics on the page. ---<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERednblu_c10b.html" title="User talk:Rednblu">Talk</a> 20:30, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Currently, Wikipedia does not have <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> rules and policy explicit enough to deal with the personal research on the Creationism pages. As I read the rules on User:FACTS, every editor's statement--if questioned--must be backed up with a quotation, paraphrase, and citation to what an actual scholar has written. This is quite different from the MainSpace where both you and I have allowed bigoted editors to remove whole sections of paraphrase, quotation, and citation to what scholars actually wrote when they replace the whole page with uncited drivel of personal research. Think about it. In my opinion, the most important product of this experimental space would be a set of rules and policy tested and proven to be adequate for keeping personal research out of the Creationism pages. ---<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERednblu_c10b.html" title="User talk:Rednblu">Talk</a> 20:30, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

I have been amazed at the standards and conscientiousness of protecting quality throughout the rest of Wikipedia outside the Creationism pages.

<dd>Actually, ALL of those charges are true, except for the sockpuppet claim. Of course the IP address involved in that was another individual also RfCd for highly biased edits to creationism articles, so you can see where the confusion might come in. The fact that you refer to someone as an inquisitor goes to prove once again that you are the kind of person who simply refuses to accept objective facts if they disagree with your highly biased views. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 10:08, Mar 16, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>i've learned that those who don't recognize their own bias and see everyone who disagrees with them as biased are, without fail, the most biased. Rednblu and i disagree fundamentally on the issues -- he is a tried and true atheist and evolutionist -- but we have something you don't have -- a recognition of our own pov AS a pov that allows for writing npov articles. The key to writing npov articles is FIRST to recognize your own bias, and THEN recognize the rules for building npov articles that fairly represent your pov in concert with all the others. you haven't reached step one. you still think you're unbiased, and so that article must represent your pov entirely in order to be npov. how quaint. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 13:51, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - This project is nothing more than a way to bypass the normal talk pages and consensus-making process in an effort to force their POV onto articles. With Ungtss specifically, it's a way for him to make changes on articles that he promised he wouldn't touch from now on as part of his way to try to get out of an RfC he knew was coming and have some other member of the group add his comments for him. The normal process works, the reason many of these people here are upset with it is solely because the process working means that their agenda is thwarted. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 08:36, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)

Anyone with an ounce of intelligence can see that the above argument is balderdash.8)) First, the User:FACTS work environment is just that--a work environment. If the above argument had any legitimacy at all, then there would have to be links to User:FACTS from the MainSpace. There is not one shred of evidence that the UserSpace anywhere is governed by <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> at all! So the above argument is balderdash. Second, several of us evolutionists can see that certain vandals here unnamed for decency 8)) keep ripping out what the creationists write <i>even when they accurately quote, paraphrase, and cite prominent scholars.</i> You don't have to believe any of that--except that there this one evolutionist, namely me, who thinks that <i>it is unfair</i> that the here unnamed vandals keep ripping out what the creationists write even when they accurately quote, paraphrase, and cite prominent scholars. 8)) How is <i>that</i> for <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>? I have even given an attribution. If you will actually read the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> page, you will see that that attributed assertion is <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. Third, the above argument is <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balderdash.html" title="Balderdash">balderdash</a> because the only show of "force" evidenced within this page is the appeal to the administrators to quash one Wikipedia editor's bold attempt to develop <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> articles that actually quote, paraphrase, and cite what prominent scholars have actually written. Will the pages developed within the User:FACTS sandbox actually be <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>? Who knows?

<li>The point is that several people are shouting angry arguments at one another, and there are several processes of dealing with that involving the community (e.g. RfM, RfC, RfA). I've also seen some accusations of vandalistic POV-pushing. This is not something that VfD ordinarily deals with. RfC primarily gets things to the attention of the community (and that has precedent), which was my point. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 12:05, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)

Am I right? Now I can see a lot of value in getting disputants together in a place where they can shout angry arguments at one another--because it is better that most of the angry shouting be drained into one cesspool. In contrast, the important issue that this VfD page buries is a fundamental flaw in the Wikipedia rules. And the User:FACTS environment is only a System Development Environment (SDE) where "developers" who abide by the evolving SDE rules can work together in prototyping rules that actually produce <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> pages on Creationism. <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> pages on Creationism are obviously impossible in the MainSpace pages.

<li>I would support that. Ungtss is essentially starting a mini-wiki on his userpages, with the explicit goal of replacing articles on the main pages. This is a big deal.

<li>RfC defeats the purpose here, friends. There is too much systemic bias for a "drive-by-vote" to hold any meaning. The project is an OPEN SANDBOX designed to experiment in a place where the egos aren't as hot, and where we can work FREE of systemic bias. Goethean has "essentially" redefined the project as "starting a mini-wiki" when all it is is an effort to develop procedures, rules, and ultimately npov articles in an environment free of the ideological free-for-all we have on the main pages. It does no harm. It's full of evolutionists. Why do maybe 25kb on the server outweigh the benefits of developing the project? <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 14:25, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I believe that you've just proven my point. That "ideological free-for-all" is better known as the normal state of affairs at Wikipedia. Now it's not just <i>articles</i> that you want to develop in a sanitized environment, but policies and procedures, as well! This project is now <i>explicitly</i> anti-wiki. --<a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">Goethean</a> 15:41, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Another massive <i>non-sequitur</i>. Let's start with your assumption that wikipedia is at its heart an "ideological free-for-all." Wrongo. Wikipedia is supposed to operate according to the rules of npov. NPOV beats ideological-free-for-all just like paper beats rock -- every time. We have protection, arbitration, RfC for these purposes ... we have templates like this one:</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>

<li>and we ALSO HAVE SANDBOXES. And THIS is a sandbox. And it is doing NO HARM.

<p>I don't understand the dispute here, being relatively new to Wikipedia. However, it's beyond me why polite articulate explanations of Creationism, and some of its corollaries can't be articulated by Creationists and improved by other Creationists, so that we can all go somewhere to read their best construction of the world and understanding of the facts (facts too are made, en français = faire, to make, as in factory). You can't take the human and the bias utterly out of the process of facting. A lot more can be said about this, but the question of bias applies to all of us and all viewpoints, there are no facts without values impinging upon their selection and their ordering and their existence as mental units. So, if this present quarrel has anything to do with outlawing articles on Creationism by Creationists subject to contraints of politeness, articulateness, and improvement by increasing Creationist expertise: then we're just letting some other bias run roughshod over this particular bias with a smaller community of consensus. But, not knowing precisely what is the issue here, what section of Wiki is the proper place for the entries, why people seem to be stripping authority references from Creationist articles (appropriateness may require a fine line between an apologist's rant and a PhDbiologist's argument against evolution from one original simple lifeform on planet Earth, etc., and not knowing yet what a "Project" is, I would at this stage vote against deletion of the FACTS (whatever it is).

<dd>You, sir, have done a great deal to reestablish my faith in the human race:). Points all well made:). The goal of the project is simple -- to work on policies, procedures, and model pages that will represent creationism concisely, accurately, and in an npov fashion. the reason it is necessary is this: "due to the highly controversial and emotional nature of the topic, the main pages suffer from a great deal of ideological grandstanding, personal research, and outright vandalism by both sides, which makes high quality npov articles absolutely impossible under the current state of affairs. A number of individuals have realized that more detailed and articulated guidelines are necessary if this insanity is ever to end, and model pages can serve as sandboxes on which to develop those policies and see how they work, without being subject to the unending nonsense on the mainpages. Thanks for your consideration, and given your clearly very broad-minded outlook on the issues, I'd look forward to working with you on the project if you'd be willing. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 01:26, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Let's see, someone who admits he or she has no clue what's going on shows up to give you support and this reestablishes your faith in the human race? What, your faith that some people are gullible and ill-informed enough to fall for your nonsense? Nobody disputes that <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> would be good for the Creationism pages. What is in dispute is your claims to be trying for NPOV at all. You have consistently tried to -- not just slightly but severely -- skew the articles toward what you believe at the expense of all other opinions. When you finally lost out on these changes because other editors would no longer let you get away with it, and consensus clearly and firmly showed you that your way is not acceptable, you and some like-minded people decide to do a run-around the normal process and make your own rules so you can change articles as a political action committee. This is completely and totally against Wikipedia policies. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 02:54, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that mob rule is not a correct way to achieve consensus. The correct way to achieve consensus is to have something that approaches fact while not degenerating in to a weenie-war. I think <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">User:172</a> had a lot of objections to the Wikipedia process when he left Wikipedia, and I think the fact that people very hostile to creationism are trying to, some extent, control the creationism-related pages shows a very distinct weakness in Wikipedia's process. And, oh, I really wish these discussions could be about content instead of about people. We're here to make a great encyclopedia, not to have yet another flame war. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamboy_e9bc.html" title="User:Samboy">Samboy</a> 08:09, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The problem here is that it is highly biased to assume that the consensus that already has been reached is mere "mob rule" or that the facts that are int he articles aren't really facts just because you might disagree with them. I would agree that Wikipedia is here to make a great encyclopedia, but it's clear from the actions of Ungtss and other posters that they are only here to try to make a poor encyclopedia so that they can make a great set of pro-Creationism articles. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 09:35, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(ignoring flagrant personal attacks by dreamguy in order to take samboy's suggestion and focus on the article. Oh wait. there's nothing BUT personal attacks in his comments). i repeat. We need specific and identifiable rules so we can all look at the article, look at the rules, and say, "now THAT'S an article that follows the rules." Until then, your claims that i am biased are no better than my claims that you are biased.
