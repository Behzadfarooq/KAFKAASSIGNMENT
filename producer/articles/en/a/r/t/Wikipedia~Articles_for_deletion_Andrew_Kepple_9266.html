<li>'<i>Comment</i>: The reasoning stated in the "prod" was as follows:
<ul>
<li>he who draws NN internet things shall be NN. Apparently, not all webcomics are NN, but he hasn't drawn any with articles</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I feel he's a notable animator, being a significant contributor to the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animutation.html" title="Animutation">Animutation</a> genre for the "Colin Mochrie vs Jesus" series (see also <a href="../../../o/p/b/Opblaaskrokodil.html" title="Opblaaskrokodil">Opblaaskrokodil</a>) and also for his music videos for <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Cicierega_969c.html" title="Neil Cicierega">Neil Cicierega</a>'s music. --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillpg_d182.html" title="User:Billpg">Billpg</a> 11:08, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Have you no heart to consider him nonnotable? I am not going to support this with a lame "He is just famous on the internet," but rather, he has earned a good number of awards in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a>, achieved high fame in <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albino_Blacksheep_f6fb.html" title="Albino Blacksheep">Albino Blacksheep</a>, especially with his <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Cicierega_969c.html" title="Neil Cicierega">Lemon Demon</a> music videos and his best known animutation, <i>French Erotic Film</i>, and is a regular contributor to both sites. Many people follow his style of Flash animation, and he is widely respected throughout the internet. He did make some non-notable works, but that does not make him non-notable, because of <i>French Erotic Film</i>, <i>Zero Wing Rhapsody</i>, <i>Only Superhuman</i>, and a good share of others. Plus, <a href="../../../v/e/l/Veloso.html" title="Veloso">Veloso</a>, the author of <i>Irrational Exuberence</i>, is also there, and Kepple is just as popular. Another supporting point: since <i>French Erotic Film</i> is mentioned in the Wikipedia several times, and there is a page on <a href="../../../o/m/e/Ome_Henk_67ac.html" title="Ome Henk">Ome Henk</a>'s song, <a href="../../../o/p/b/Opblaaskrokodil.html" title="Opblaaskrokodil">Opblaaskrokodil</a>, in which Kepple wrote <i>French Erotic Film</i>, there should be a page on Andrew Kepple. One final pointer: not all famous flash persons draw ALL notable works. AltF4 is famous MOSTLY because of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ultimate_Showdown_of_Ultimate_Destiny_8533.html" title="The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny">The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny</a> and seldom anything else. There is just one undeniable thing that there is: this page is in a stark need of a cleanup, but does not deserve to be deleted. In conclusion, even if this page is not saved, it should. Thanks for listening to my long, boring speech, and thanks for showing no respect to the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animutation.html" title="Animutation">animutation</a> world (in a sarcastic way), to all those who say otherwise as below. --<a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENeryon_e83a.html" title="User:Neryon">Wartys Neryon</a> 9:13, 16 May 2006 (PTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as having no readily apparent claim to encyclopaedic notability. Cicierega's work is borderline for my money, and this looks so much like an attempt at search engine optimisation (look at all those links!) that I have a hard time taking it seriously.

<li><b>Keep</b> - as per above.

<li><b>Comment</b> - A lot of keep comments seem to say that he's active and notable on the "Animutations" circuit. How large is this community exactly? If you could give actual numbers, that would help. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 14:23, 21 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Sorry to go on this commenting thing again. Anyway, to take a far less aggressive approach, he was famous because of his animutation series, the <i><a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Mochrie_4fc2.html" title="Colin Mochrie">Colin Mochrie</a> vs. JHC trilogy</i>, which can be seen on <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albino_Blacksheep_f6fb.html" title="Albino Blacksheep">Albino Blacksheep</a> but he wasn't just an animutator, but also a cartoonist in general: a contributor of two major entertainment sites. Somehow, Andrew Kepple is on the WikiProject Webcomics, and is threatened for deletion because of that. If only we could take the webcomic business as very little as possible and only mention the webcomic stuff on the external links (as is the page on <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Cicierega_969c.html" title="Neil Cicierega">Neil Cicierega</a>, where his <i>Farchie Archie</i> webcomic is only mentioned in the external links), this might help just at least a bit by taking it out of WikiProject Webcomics. I wouldn't really care if the page is gone, but I do have a slight feeling he is notable in a ways. Oh yes, and there is about a few hundred members right now (I believe) in the Animutation Mailing List, but if anyone has a reliable source of information in regards to how large the animutation world is, please post it here. Forgive me, all y'all, for being rather stubborn. -- <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENeryon_e83a.html" title="User:Neryon">Wartys Neryon</a> 3:02, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>No vote</b>, for now, and <b>comment</b>. I'm a big fan of TmsT's work, and I tend to hang out in the same online circles as him, such as the Animutation discussion list and the Lemon Demon forums; given that, I probably have an imbalanced perspective of his notability, since he is indeed quite noted <i>relative to those communities</i>. I don't have a good sense of how widely noted he is on the Internet in general, though if the article is to be kept, then it should include explanation of his notability, which it currently lacks.</p>
