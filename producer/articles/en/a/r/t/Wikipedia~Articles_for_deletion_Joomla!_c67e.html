<li>Look, the folks behind Mambo and Joomla have recently been through several, not very damn nice wars and fights and whatnot regarding the ownership of the Mambo code. (You could make a really informative article on those fights <i>alone.</i> Lots of interesting stuff.) <i>Mambo's descentants</i> (Mambo, Mambo's GPL version, and now this travestry) are being <i>used</i> on zillions of sites. There's no way to deny that. What they want to <i>call</i> that codebase any particular day, well, that's an issue that just has to wait. So, I would rather vote for merge to either this article or the other, or keep both. If people take the "kill them both, let God sort them out" attitude, that's <i>a bit</i> too harsh in my opinion. --<a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">Wwwwolf</a> 23:50, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think if Wikipedia can have articles for 8 forks of <a href="../../../p/h/p/PHP-Nuke_838d.html" title="PHP-Nuke">PHP-Nuke</a>, then it should have an article about a fork of <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mambo_%28CMS%29_842d.html" title="Mambo (CMS)">Mambo</a>. The forum at [<a href="http://forum.opensourcematters.org" class="external text" title="http://forum.opensourcematters.org" rel="nofollow">Open Source Matters</a>] has had 3211 members join in three weeks, so don't tell me Joomla! doesn't have a large number of people following. I think it is Wikipedia worthy. Furthermore, I don't see why the article should be deleted because it list features, <a href="../../../x/o/o/XOOPS_4751.html" title="XOOPS">XOOPS</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/p/PHP-Nuke_838d.html" title="PHP-Nuke">PHP-Nuke</a>, and <a href="../../../e/1/0/E107_%28software%29.html" title="E107 (software)">E107</a> all list their features and those aren't candidates for deletion. I think this <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> just doesn't like Mambo or Joomla! because he nominated both of these articles for deletion, yet other open source CMS articles haven't been nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoffman11_6e5a.html" title="User:Shoffman11">Shoffman11</a> 19:18, September 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but don't merge - Joomla! is not the new name of Mambo they are separate products. While Joomla 1.0 will to a large degree be the same as the current Mambo release the two projects will diverge into separate products in the (near) future. This article is being updated and no longer looks like an advertisement. It just needs a little TLC. To delete this would be wrong as Joomla! will be a major player in the CMS world and no other CMS has been put up for deletion. Johnny Boy 08:55 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete and salt the earth</b>: Advertising. That's all we need: advertising.

<li>What do you mean "current format?" At this moment in time, it's back to advertising. If you're asking that we revert to the cleanest version, then protect it, just so that we can preserve a mention of Yet Another Open Source Program (and a management one at that), I think that's too much, too far. Feature lists are not content. Claims about how it will solve all my problems are not encyclopedic. Concentrate on the few facts, on the significance.

<li><b>Keep</b>, since IIRC all the lead-developers left Mambo and formed this. If Mambo was worthy of an article I'm sure this one is too, even if it needs rewriting to conform to NPOV. --<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasDex_c4f8.html" title="User:TexasDex">TexasDex</a> 03:54, September 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia is a very good tool for a quick comparison of content management systems and other software. SGJ 09:08, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, and don't merge.</b> I agree with Stephanos Geogios John immediately above me. In fact, Wikipedia has the unique abiilty to be the <i>best</i> &#160; way to compare and contrast CMS software due to the rigorous community input. Including this type of software should not be discouraged on Wikipedia; it should in fact be encouraged. Also, forks in open source projects are extremely important. It is highly likely that the two packages will quickly begin to become sufficiently different to force users to have to look <i>somewhere</i> (I think it ought to be here) to find a careful articulation of the differences between the forks. Thus, don't combine. (Oh, and of all types of open source projects to include, it seems CMS systems are pretty important, given the number of people / companies who build sites using them.) <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatsonjay_f372.html" title="User:Batsonjay">Batsonjay</a> 04:12, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think the article has good info on Joomla. It is no better or no worse than entries on other CMS entries.</li>

<li><b>I have added content in hopes to keep it also.</b> This event appears likely to be significant in the history of Open Source and should be kept active in order to capture events as they happen. If it later proves not to have been, you can alway change or remove it then.--207.212.165.197 22:11, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keeping this in mind, as well as the fact that I highly doubt it was one of Joomla!'s developers that wrote this article (all it took was one mention on Slashdot) I do not think the reason cited is a valid reason for deletion. Adding an NPOV tag and letting others fix it would have sufficed. --<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasDex_c4f8.html" title="User:TexasDex">TexasDex</a> 14:25, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
