<dd>Care to explain why the debut dates of characters in a major comic strip aren't encyclopedic in nature? Are you going to advocate the deletion of numerous similar articles? And please don't use the term fancruft, it's offensive.

<dd>Please see <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Wikipedia:Fancruft</a>. Fancruft has become a regular term on Wikipedia, applying to any information that is relevant to fans, but not so much on its own. And, as is mentioned bellow, if the villains don't have their own articles, they probably don't need an entire article dedicated to their appearance dates. <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoizashmo_803f.html" title="User:Joizashmo">Joiz</a> <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A"><sup>A.</sup></a> <a href="../../../j/o/i/User_talk%7EJoizashmo_eb05.html" title="User talk:Joizashmo">Shmo</a> 15:54, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've seen that page. It's an essay, and I would prefer if the advise against using the term were written in much stronger language, and I wish that fewer people would slap that derogatory term around as if it were a convincing argument. And some of the villains do have their own articles. Should all of them? I don't know, that's another issue. Besides, there are many things which don't deserve their own article in the individual, but are more notable in the aggregate. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:16, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Of course the article isn't notable, it's a single article on Wikipedia. Very few of them are notable. But what's wrong with the subject of the article? Do you think <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Tracy_f905.html" title="Dick Tracy">Dick Tracy</a> isn't notable? Do you think that the villains of the strip aren't notable as a whole? Should the ones with individual articles be deleted? Should all dates of initial appearance be deleted from every article about comic characters? Sorry, but just saying "This isn't notable, it's fancruft" is not persuasive reasoning, it's just using a pejorative. Could you please try explaining in more detail exactly what you consider is not encyclopedic about this article's subject, without making use of that term? I would much appreciate it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:59, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Dick Tracy is very notable, some/many of the villains are notable as well, but what is the point of an article that lists the date of their first appearance? The question is not if these villains are notable, but if the dates of their first appearance on its own is notable. This list says nothing but "there are a lot of villains, they were all created by the creator of the comic (duh) except one, seventeen years later, and ... well, that's about it". This list is furthermore redundant with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recurring_characters_in_Dick_Tracy_f0a6.html" title="List of recurring characters in Dick Tracy">List of recurring characters in Dick Tracy</a>, which gives a lot more information (even though it needs a lot of work as well). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 11:25, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First, I would say that this list is incomplete, since obviously it stops relatively short of the modern era. Thus the various people who took over after Gould are unlisted. Incompleteness, note, is not a reason for deletion. If it were, we'd have to delete a lot more pages. It's just a reason for somebody to finish the article. I don't see how the dates of first appearance aren't notable though, since that information is included on pretty much every page about a comic book or strip character. So as a whole, I don't see that as a problem. And yes, I did notice that this page is somewhat redundant to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recurring_characters_in_Dick_Tracy_f0a6.html" title="List of recurring characters in Dick Tracy">List of recurring characters in Dick Tracy</a>, but the more I think about it, the more I think something else besides deletion needs to be done. That page has a section describing first appearances, but it's much more poorly formatted than even this page. I think it might be worth splitting off the villains from that page, merging it with the information from this one instead. Deletion, however, seems needless. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:42, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I wish this page was fancruft in a way, it would have more editors. Dick Tracy isn't a fan hotbed, it's a historically significant comic strip. Maybe 50 years ago it would have been fancruft, now it's just encyclopedic. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 19:04, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
