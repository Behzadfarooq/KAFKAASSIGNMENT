<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. It's patently unclear, after all this procedural bureaucracy, that "Spanish Gibraltarian" is a neutral term. AfD does have a responsibility to eliminate POV forks when they come down the pike, and I see no reason not to confirm the findings of the previous debate. However, the most important problem is that there is no assertion of notability nor proof that this particular sub-group has played an important role of the history of Gibraltar since the British occupation. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 15:13, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This article gives three definitions. The first, which comprises the first three paragraphs, is the part that is a recreation of the "original inhabitants" article for which a consensus to delete was established, and appears to have been created primarily to promote a probably-not-notable organisation of Spanish families who claim descent from the people who left Gibraltar rather than submit to British rule. This appears all to be covered already in the San Roque article.<br />
The second and third, which I believe are new, again appear either to duplicate material in other articles, or to consist of original and unreliable research (in Britain it is <i>not</i> common to use the term "Spanish Gibraltarian" at all, and one citation from 1890 -- claimed here as the first, though without any evidence either way -- hardly counters that fact).<br />
Basically, appears to be a POV fork combining existing information that's already covered better in other articles, and with a very rare term used for the title (&lt;100 Google hits for "spanish gibraltarian", many of which are for things like "the Spanish/Gibraltarian border"). Propose that the author would better spend his efforts working with other Wikipedians to improve the existing articles. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 12:26, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> - inherently POV title - no such thing as Spanish Gibraltarians - you're either one or the other, as Gibraltar is not in Spain.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Haeleth. What happened to the people that left Gibraltar after the British conquest is of encyclopedic relevance, but probably not here and in that form. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 15:51, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep'</b>: Its only just been undeleted. It is NPOV, has valid references and is no less valid than an article on Irish Americans, Asian British or Moroccan Spaniards.... The history of Spaniards in Gibraltar, is of interest in wikipedia, as is the history of Maltese, Sephardic or Genoese Gibraltarians. These communities are also worthy of an article.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 17:01, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This article gives its references clearly and apparently only offers as its mandate the various meanings and usages of this ethnic identification term. The article almost certainly has NPOV issues (made clear by this discussion if nothing else) but secondary source references and limited mandate seem to show it is neither OR nor a hoax...so any problems are an issue for article editors to work out, not AfD. Regarding arguments above that "edit wars are inevitable" I'd only say we shouldn't delete decently researched articles because problems MAY happen in the future. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 17:22, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - we don't need more POV forks. It's extremely unlikely you can make this NPOV since most of the article, if you take away what's covered elsewhere, is bits and pieces.

There is a POV bent to it and I never like that. I always say that means the content should be changed, not the article deleted. I understand this is a passionate issue in Gibraltar (having been there, I've discussed it with locals), but this was a historic part of Gibraltar, even under British rule and that can't be ignored. This reminds me of the article <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whites_in_Zimbabwe_41d4.html" title="Whites in Zimbabwe">Whites in Zimbabwe</a>. That segment has heavily dissipated over the years and even if it totally disappears, the subject still would be relevant even for historical reasons. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 23:17, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So far it seems the vote is split roughly 50/50. Anyone has any constructive criticisms of the article (i.e. changing stuff which may be POV)? I certainly can find nothing. I erased all the stuff about the behaviour of the British during the occupation precisely to keep it neutral and non-partisan.... I guess the main question to ask is the following: Would an article on Maltese Gibraltarians be opposed by those who want to delete this article? If not.

<li><b>Delete</b> This isn't a vote, as I pointed out to User:Burgas00 (who is the original author of this article) in the comments made in the original nomination Originary Inhabitants of Gibraltar. User:Burgas00 renamed/moved this article after several delete recommendations had been made to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Gibraltarians_45ee.html" title="Spanish Gibraltarians">Spanish Gibraltarians</a> and this avoided the deletion as onlt the re-direct was deleted at closure of the AfD process. Now that this article has been nominated, I suppose we can expect to see this kind of tactic again. So, all that said, what are my reasons for deletion? I recommended deletion previously, as the original article was misleading, heavily POV and in places wrong. This article has become what we can now see, which is still POV (and making a POV fork), the facts are disputed, and the topic is about a very minor and not notable segment of Gibraltrian inhabitants who decided not to leave Gibraltar after British conquest who (more than 250 years later) still consider themselves Spanish and the "Heirs of Gibraltar". If there is anything of note in this article it belongs in the main Gibraltar articles, NOT on it's own page. Delete this and whatever else User:Burgas00 decides to rename the article as next. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 23:25, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The Spanish occupation of Gibraltar is already covered elsewhere. <i>Gibraltarian</i> is a present-day term describing the people born in and of Gibraltar. They are British, not Spanish, by birthright and NOT Spanish. Proof? Gibraltar is British territory, not Spanish territory .This article promotes the +wishful+ Spanish POV which denies Gibraltarians exist as a distinct people and should be removed. (Unregd. user)</li>
