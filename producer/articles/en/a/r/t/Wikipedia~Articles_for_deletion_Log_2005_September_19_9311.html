<li>She and several other passengers are historically significant for fighting back against the terroists. This has been confirmed by reconstructions of the flight tapes and from cell phone conversations. I agree posting all 40 passengers would be OTT. Posting these few who fought back is relevant and material to the events on Flight 93. Note that the terrorists are given extensive bios--why not mini bios for the few who foiled their plans?

<li>Then you are on your own, and in disagreement with many other editors, since excluding all projects except for Wikipedia ones is not its generally accepted meaning. Excluding all projects except for <i>Wikimedia</i> ones is not its generally accepted meaning, even. I suggest that you read the first sentence of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">m:transwiki</a> to see how broadly encompassing the concept is, in <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a>'s own words.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Most student organizations that exist at only one university are non-notable.

<li>Comment: Since Wikipedia contains extensive articles on every Pokemon character and video game in existence (not to mention its growing library of porn star bios), I believe the bar is sufficiently low enough to enable a good-sized academic organization at a major institution of higher learning to easily meet the entry qualifications. I'm not defending dumbing down Wikipedia (in fact, I'm quite opposed to it), but I am saying that an even and consistent set of criteria should apply. If we allow cartoon characters to have their own articles, but deny them to college organizations, we've taken one more step down the road to Wikipedia becoming little more than a repository of insignificant, pop-culture trivia. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">C Maylett</a> 17:18, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment: For keeping</b> I am the first stethoscope member who posted above, i made an account but i forgot my log on name so i am signing off with my ip. Someone mentioned student organizations that have been kept, here is one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Sigma_Phi_Philippines" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Sigma_Phi_Philippines" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Sigma_Phi_Philippines</a> . As far as it seems it doesnt have the same scope as our organization since it comes from two small second rate provincial universities in the philippines. They are a considerably older organization, but is age really the matter for notability, or is it the relevance of the organization to an x number of people? We make no financial gain out of having the stethoscope on wikipedia, since our membership is free and open to all, and we even have logged europeans and australians visiting and returning to our website on a regular basis looking for information on the health care professions admissions criteria in canada. This entire article will probably be deleted, but you people who consider yourselves as guardians of wikipedia should really get priorities straight if the message you are sending is that a pokemon character or 60's porn star has more notability than an organization involved in helping the next generation of a first world country's health care profession. 70.30.120.30 13:38, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, the google results all seem to be from wikipedia or descriptions of Saari's book.</li>
<li>Also, the criterion implies that the "intensity of preference" between two candidates can be effectively measured by the number of candidates ranked in between them... this is a serious fallacy.</li>
<li>A merge with Borda count would be logical, but it should be made clear that this is a POV definition of preference intensity, not a generally accepted one. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermitage_df5c.html" title="User:Hermitage">Hermitage</a> 22:44, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Those hundreds of Google results are almost all the same two texts! One is, of course, the Wikipedia article itself, on mirror sites. The other is a review of Donald Saari's book "Elections and Decisions" (a book promoting the use of the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borda_count.html" title="Borda count">Borda count</a>), which is the only place this term is actually published. Filtering out wikipedia mirrors and reviews of that book leaves one hit, which is a randomly-generated spam page.</li>
<li>"Elections and Decisions" has no Wikipedia article; why should a term that only exists as a small part of that book have an article?</li>
<li>The criterion is inherently POV. Criteria are used to promote various voting methods over others based on their mathematical properties, based on the assumption that it is desirable to meet that criterion. This criterion is <i>equivalent</i> to the definition of the Borda count, so the article is simply hiding the statement "The Borda count is good" behind some math.</li>
<li>The criterion has not been accepted by any voting theorists except its creator, Donald Saari. The user who created this article is a strong fan of Saari.</li>
<li>Therefore, I urge people to reconsider their votes.</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> But I don't know to what - <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives.html" title="Independence of irrelevant alternatives">Independence of irrelevant alternatives</a> perhaps could be expanded.

<p>This article should be deleted because it is a cesspool of original research, with a near absolute lack of refrences to any of the points and counter points.

<li><b>Keep'</b> The content could do with an awful lot more expanding and NPVing, but I would like to see such an article. Certainly many people feel strongly about the issue, but that's a good reason to have a summary of such opinion. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_operating_systems.html" title="Comparison of operating systems">Comparison of operating systems</a> has useful technical overview, but surely there is room for a more userfriendly comparison of strengths and weaknesses that should be kept out of 'Comparison_of_operating_systems' and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operating_system.html" title="Operating system">Operating system</a>; the differences between two is important, and not suited to the article on either.</li>
<li>I, at least, was hoping for a reasoned comparison when I clicked the link.</li>
<li>The name should probably be changed to something more neutral or merged back into 'Comparison_of_operating_systems', and this be a redirect, or a stub with a discussion of the history of advocacy itself rather than true comparison. --Jack</li>

<li><b>Keep (sort of):</b> — There's interesting information here, but the premise of the page is goofy and unencylopedic.

<li>That's the cart before the horse somewhat. The content that follows the introduction is a huge chunk of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> without either citations or attributions. Rewriting the introduction to match the rest, essentially refactoring this article as a rewrite of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_operating_systems.html" title="Comparison of operating systems">comparison of operating systems</a>, is both basing the article around the original research and pointless. We already have that article. The focus of <i>this</i> article, per the title, is the <i>advocacy</i>, and <i>not</i> the actual features of the various operating systems themselves. There's a possibility of an encyclopaedia article on operating system advocacy. People have written about it.
<p>The "goofy and unencyclopaedic" title relates to the names of several Usenet newsgroups where such arguments have occurred for the past 20 years, by the way, and is the generally accepted term for what transpires within them. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:01, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Question</b> for <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> and others - can anyone verify this information from a printed source? I'm amazed to find nothing online about this ancient syllabary. User:Gadugi's talk page makes interesting reading and his veracity has been challenged. There are no records of an "Ah-ni-ku-ta-ni" online (according to Google) and a couple of the user's other edits have been challenged. It's possible that this request for deletion owes something to a wish to avoid being caught out. There are credited sources for each article - can anyone find them offline to confirm? Please note that in the absence of independent corroboration I do not have an opinion one way or another on either Gadugi or the facts of this article.<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 10:06, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Vizjim, I have checked the ISBN for the book <i>Cherokee</i> cited in the references and Redlightgreen appears to indicate it is a legitimate book. That being said, I am in Australia and will have difficulty in accessing this book within the timeframe.

<li><b>phandsvrta keep</b>. Notable Subject&#160;: Googling "+written cherokee language" reveals the syllabary, at least the 1820s Sequoyah syllabary, which isn't that ancient. It also reveals a lot of good, learned material on this topic which deserves collation in Wikipedia. Merkey (aka Gadugi) is attempting to suppress already freely available information. Don't allow it.
<ul>
<li>note that Gadugi has stated that the "ancient syllabary" is much older than, and compeltely different from the syllabary created by Sequoyah. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:37, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> I regret my actions here. Please keep this article. Also, Phandsvrta is an SCOX member who has been extremely vocal.

<p>I will second Jeff's sentiment to scrutinize all contributions - mine or otherwise. I have indeed been vocal, and will continue being vocal as long as attempts are made to suppress freedom of information and speech. And, as far as I know, I haven't made any defacements to this article (I'm not adept at using wikipedia, so don't rule out ignorance or finger trouble!).</p>
<p>Jeff, if there is an older syllabary than that of Sequoyah, why isn't it visible elsewhere? There is a LOT of Cherokee information out there, but all references to a written language only get as far as Sequoyah. Surely you woudn't want something as fundamental and precious to wither away in obscurity?</p>
<p>Think of it as adding to the richness found in other, old languages, such as Norn (the ancient language of Orkney), or Ogham (pre-Gaelic Irish), or Kernewek (the direct descendant of the ancient language spoken by Celtic settlers who inhabited Cornwall (Kernow) and most of the British Isles long before the Roman conquest). Many of these were suppressed by later conquerors, and only survived underground. They are now being resurrected and appreciated for their historical and cultural value. I'd want the same for a previously unkown Cherokee written form.</p>
<p>Wouldn't you want to know how to read the Inca Quipus (spelling?)?</p>
<p>I speak as a Scot, living in Ireland. Our native Gaelic was brutally suppressed by the English, only surviving in the Western Isles, including Ireland. As language powerfully shapes a culture, losing languages is, in my opinion, a very bad thing.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Of course, this begs the question "Then why did you create the article if you want it removed?" I think it is good and useful encyclopedic information, and I'm glad you added it. There has been no problem with defacement so far. The wiki process is pretty good at dealing with defacement when it occurs, although unfortunately there is no way to prevent it. Plenty of articles dealing with sacred subects do get defamed on occasion here, but this is only a surface phenomenon. What is truly sacred cannot be defamed. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">Codex Sinaiticus</a> 13:16, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>The answer to that is pretty obvious. The creator got into some rahter nasty disputes with others on wikipedia, mostly if not compeltely unrealted to thsi article. In the course of this, it seems that at least one user posted derogatory language related to the creator's cherokee ethnicity, or at least he took it that way. See the history of the creator's talk page, his user contributions, and jimbo's recent post on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> if you want more details. I can see why these events left the article creator very unhappy with wikipedia, although i think he is mistakenly attributing to all of us the acts of a very few. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:39, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. I regret my actions here. Also, please remove the term "ethnic group" and do not remove the breakdown of the language constructs.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have reverted the redirect. The convention is that articels are not usually converted to redirects, moved, or blanked while an AfD discusiion is in progress. Moreover, assuming that it is verifiabel, the information here strikes me as relevant and should be kept soemwhere. The precise form of the article is another matter. I woulkd say to Gadugi, most people in the US who are not native americans tend to view "indian tribes" as more ethnic than political, and even though it is true that formal membership is a political act, and people may well be descended from native amaricans but not have any formal tribal membership, is it not true that such membership is generally only open to people with such ancestry? If so, it is not a "pure" political association, but more a combination of political and ethnic/racial identity. Correct me if I am wrong, please. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:10, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Response to DES</b> This statement is essentially correct. Membership does require membership in a racial group, however, membbership in an Indian tribe is a political relationship with the US government. It is the policy of the TRIBES to restrict ot members of their race, which is an issue of sovereignty. The problem with using ethnic language to describe this is that under US law, the 14th ammendment which prohibits racial discrimination has been used over and over again by non-indians to claim they have the right to posessess eagle feathers, use and distribute drugs like peyote to non-indians, etc. under Laws which protect Native American Culture. The Courts have had to rule that the relationship is political in order to protect our culture from people like these. So public references, like an encycplopedia, could be used as Court exhibit over and over again in this stale and mouldy argument these people use to setup drug distribution businesses run by non-indians who prey off our culture, and bring us into disrepute. So that's why I object to using the word, "ethic". Also, this particular article is about the language. The editor Karmosin tried to change it into an ethnic article by removing the language constructs. The article should stay the way it is, as I created it and intended it as a starting point to teach others our language. Gadugi 22:35, 21 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah I see your points. Thre ought to be a properly nuanced way to indicvate booth the political and the racial/gentic issues involve, but that kind of discusion realy belongs on the talk page of this article, not on this AfD discussion. I also see that an article about language is not the smae as an articel about the peopel who speak that language. Well it looks to me as if the result here will be keep, but there there is the ewndless process of debating and, one hopes, improving the article. I personaly would oppose a change to a simple redirect as things stand. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a>
<ul>
<li>I don't see anything constructive in DES' revert of my redirect. The AfD is effectively over since Gadugi has voted against his own nomination and the article doesn't serve any purpose. We already have <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee.html" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> which is about the exact same thing, except it uses the commonly used name of the tribe as per our naming conventions. Like I pointed out before; we don't keep 日本人 separate from <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_people.html" title="Japanese people">Japanese people</a> for a very good reason. What's there to argue here? / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 06:45, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>An AfD is either over or not. The reason for not creating a redirect until the AfD is formally closed is to preserve the two-way link between the discussion and the article being discussed. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 14:42, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>In any case, I think that the linguistc information in the article as it stands is of value, and doing a simple redirect amouts to delting this information. Either the information should be merged into <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee.html" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>, or the article should stand as a separeate articel, with proper links. It is not particualrly urgent to do either, so the matter should be discussed on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Talk%7ECherokee_bd4d.html" title="Talk:Cherokee">Talk:Cherokee</a> or on <a href="../../../a/h/-/Talk%7EAh-ni-yv-wi-ya_dafa.html" title="Talk:Ah-ni-yv-wi-ya">Talk:Ah-ni-yv-wi-ya</a>, or both, an an attempot made to come to a consensus on what do do. there was not a consensus here on a simple redirect without merging the info. Put up {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergeto_cea0.html" title="Template:Mergeto">mergeto</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergefrom_0c79.html" title="Template:Mergefrom">mergefrom</a>}} if you linke, to advertise a proposed merge. Or propose a simple redir on <a href="../../../a/h/-/Talk%7EAh-ni-yv-wi-ya_dafa.html" title="Talk:Ah-ni-yv-wi-ya">Talk:Ah-ni-yv-wi-ya</a> and do it if you get something approaching consensus. I will arguie agaisnt such a redir -- unless there is evidence indiacting that the content of the current articel is false to fact, or is unverifiable. I trust that explains my views clearly. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 14:42, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Rebuttal/Request for Non-Deletion</b></p>
<p>Per the Wikipedia Deletion Policy of who can have a listing, "Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more"</p>
<p>I am a published author with an audience of over 5,000 and send out a monthly newsletter to over 13,000. I also intend to run for President of the U.S. in 2044. I have removed links to commercial sites and am happy to edit/re-write article, however required. I appreciate your consideration and hope to become part of the community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing about yourself is a rather poor way to join. It's also going to set up a pretty strong presumption that you don't deserve an article, because if you did, why would you have to write it yourself? This is not a venue for self-promotion, which if your claims are to be believed, is something you obviously don't need Wikipedia for anyway. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 07:45, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Oh, and I almost forgot—writing and editing content about yourself makes it inherently suspect because of your natural bias and conflict of interest regarding objective description. Cheers. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 07:47, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Despite those concerns, I'm going to vote a <s><b>weak keep</b></s> because Mr. Allis's book is selling on Amazon, and one of the two websites has a respectable Alexa rating. I'll be watching the discussion to see if anyone can change my mind because I'm on the fence on this one. And everyone should be watching to make sure this article, if kept, is not just part of a PR campaign. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 07:52, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Allis's book <i>is</i> on Amazon.com, but anyone can use a vanity publisher and get their book listed for sale on Amazon.com. Who is it published by? A company called Virante Inc. Who are Virante Inc? Their founder and President &amp; CEO are a certain Ryan Allis. The book does have 11 reviews (10 of which are glowing 5 star reviews) on Amazon. But again, do some research. Two of the reviews are identical. All but two of the reviewers have reviewed this book AND THIS BOOK ONLY. Which arouses my suspicions. Of the other two reviewers, one states that he knows the author personally (as do other "one-off" reviewers) and the other (the only reviewer I would trust, i.e. who does not know the author and has reviewed other books on Amazon) gives it the only non-5-star rating... a one-star rating. This all leads me to suspect over-hyping vanity, both on Amazon and here. Hence, <b>delete</b> (and add to watchlist to see if it gets kept and grows in vanity or gets deleted and relisted). <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 08:36, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Postdlf, thank you for the feedback. I appreciate your 'weak keep' vote. I have read the full articles on deletion guidelines and vanity guidelines. I agree that the initial version of the article was vanity--I simply was unaware of the guidelines but can assure you I am now. I have registered as a user to remove any anonymity behind any edits. If the article is allowed to be kept I certainly promise not make any edits that encourage any commercial agenda.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. No notability established, chesswise or journalistwise. Personally I think a chess player in general needs to hold some sort of international title to be notable (except for some historic players, before such titles were introduced). International Grandmasters, Woman Grandmasters and national chess champions are OK. International Masters and FIDE masters are borderline.

<li><b>Delete</b> nn. Note to creator of article: It's not the length per se that's the problem. It's the length of non-notable stuff, that's the problem. You have to read <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and see what wikipedia thinks is notable, and worthy of inclusion. Then, the article must show this, and provide verifiable proof (like footnotes) of it. I read the old version and new, and I don't see anything meeting the requirements. As an example, if Parker is the "author of several important historical papers", then the question is what papers, why are they important, where were they published, who published them, how widely were they read, etc... --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 11:22, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Versailles might not be the best example since it says "exclusive" conversion into a house for guests. However, what I was pointing out is that during the reign of Louis XIV the nobles were getting powerful and his plan to neutralize them was to let them live in Versailles where he had a greater deal of control, etc. However, I suppose if this is only about free standing houses and not guest-wings, etc. then it doesn't work... although, there are guest houses on the premises of many palaces I believe... like Hampton...

<p>Seems to have been created to increase the wiki presence of the village of Grendon. The entry starts off like a dicdef ("Half Moon - noun"). It then says that pubs called the Half Moon often have signs with a half moon on - not very informative. It proceeds to name check Grendon, then gives details of local folklore which is already included in the Grendon article. In summary, I'm not convinced that any of this is encyclopedic.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. There is nothing in Google's terms of service which indicate that the web indexing service is intended to be, or functions as a measure of "notability" by any definition other than "gets a lot of Google hits". Certainly notable people have accomplished much without the level of attention the World Wide Web foists upon "American Idol" contestants or "Extended Star Wars Universe" weaponry. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 16:24, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This is true; because of this, we have to be careful when using Google to "prove" that something or someone is <b>non</b>-notable. However, if something gets, say, 100,000 unique Google hits, that generally means that 100,000 people cared enough about it to put something about it up on the Internet. Whatever our personal opinion of "American Idol" contestants or Star Wars weaponry, it is not for us to decide whether or not they are notable. Google is a good indicator of the amount of public interest in a topic, and enough public interest <b>can make anything notable</b>, regardless of any objective merits it may or may not have. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> 17:38, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Or, in the case of Cyrus Farivar, that his name is attached to articles reprinted from MacWorld, and that his hoax and the reaction to it became newsworthy, and was of particular interest to people who actively discuss things online. None of these phenomena make Farivar more intrinsically notable than Cain, they only create a lot of mentions which are indexed by Google. So, I'm not saying that the public interest failed to make something of Farivar, but the lack of Google-indexed public interest should not detract from the achievements of Cain. Kierkegaard is extremely notable, the study of Kierkegaard is quite notable. Individuals prominent in the study of Kierkagaard are, also, sufficiently notable. I'm going to vote now. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 19:25, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough, but I must say that I have still not seen proof that Dr. Cain is "prominent in the study of Kierkegaard". His primary claim to fame seems the be that he has written three books; as I have pointed out above, this is in no way remarkable or worthy of note for a university professor, unless it is shown that his books achieved at least some degree of circulation, which does not seem to be the case. Basically, I do not believe every university professor is notable, and I have not seen anything to distinguish Dr. Cain from other professors. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> 19:35, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Surely Romany language and it's effects on real spoken dialect should be a relevant topic for gathering and disseminating information.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. Whichever way I read this, it's a classic no consensus. People can't deicde on whether to keep it, merge it retaining the text, delete it, or keep a little bit of the text in a merge, or just rewrite it altogether. Then there's the whole thing about the title. Given the lack of an explicit support for any particular merge target, I'm not even going to tag it for that. This particular <i>no consensus</i> is a <i>"do nothing because we haven't agreed on what to do"</i>. That means that any editor can make the decision for us, boldly as ever. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:14, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> No Need For Bushido has a long running history and is rising on Buzzcomics. Also, the article has been expanded since it was originally posted. Likewise, I can't see a problem with letting it stay.</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Looks to me like buzzcomix.net itself has an alexa of just under 200K. I don't see an obvious reason why it's an important website, so this comic being ranked on there doesn't mean much to me. Many websites have loyal readers and are important to those who read them. Personally I think we ought to aim a little higher than that for inclusion. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:10, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While it is true that this comic does not meet the first requirement of the first proposal (Alexa ranking above 200 K,) I believe it does meet the rest of the first proposal, the entire alternate second proposal, and the entire third proposal. Since all other criteria are met, and that the comic is near to the 200 K requirement in the most stringent proposal, I don't see the harm in keeping the article. Unless the comic were to go on hiatus, or loose substantial readership to the point of having an Alexa rating above 250 K.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The alexa rating is currently 194,382. Misterniceguy7</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The Wikiprojects Webcomics page which is a list of all webcomics that have an article on wikipedia has a three point criteria for allowing a comic to be included;</li>
</ul>
<p>1. <b>A webcomic must be on the web and actively producing strips for a minimum of 33 weeks before being considered for Wikipedia.</b> No Need For Bushido has been online for over 3 years (which also meets one of the more strict criteria they are proposing)</p>
<p>2. <b>A webcomic must have at least 100 strips in its archive before being considered for Wikipedia.</b> No Need For Bushido has almost 200 pages archived.</p>
<p>3. <b>Someone other than the webcartoonist needs to actually write and develop the article in question.</b> The number of people editing/expanding the article so far should show this isn't just an article created by the artists.</p>
<p>The inclusion guidelines conclude that their main concern is new or previously unpopular comics using wikipedia as a launching point to increase popularity for their comic. The length of the comic, the longevity of the comic, and the alexa rating of the comic should be enough to prove this article is worthy. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterniceguy7_60bd.html" title="User:Misterniceguy7">Misterniceguy7</a> 06:16, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>non-notable political prisoner. seems like a plea for help for the Falun Gong, obviously non neutral POV, the only sources on this dissident all stem from websites promoting the Falun Gong ie. www.clearwisdom.net. it seems like to me that this is propaganda in order to solicit support for the Falun Gong and Wikipedia is not the proper forum for doing this. <a href="../../../1/2/9/User%7E129.2.237.44.html" title="User:129.2.237.44">129.2.237.44</a></p>
<p><b>Abstain:</b> Is it possible that both the article and its calls for deletion and revision might be motivated by biased viewpoints? This is, after all, a politically charged subject in China. A Google search did turn up a dissident with the name of Xiong Wei, but the Web sites on which the name appeared were all China-related advocacy sites.

<li>After being contacted via e-mail by someone urging me to change my vote, I looked into Richard Rose a little more. The evidence I dug up indicates that he was a legitimate philosopher, spiritual leader and author who managed to attract a significant group of followers and admirers. So from that standpoint, he does seem notable. However, the article is written more like a tribute from one of his disciples than a non-biased statement of simple, straight-forward fact. I'd suggest that someone with an objective viewpoint rewrite and condense the text into something more suitable for a non-biased encyclopedia. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">C Maylett</a> 16:36, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. He seems like an interesting guy, the article is informative (if a tad hagiographic in style, but that can be fixed) and in view of his having a number of published essays and several books, and the fact that he has a small but loyal following, he is certainly notable.</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> the academic quality of this page can be enhanced by including references from the relevant books, essays, and weblinks as footnotes in the body of the write up.

<dd><b>Request:</b> Would someone from the TAT Foundation be willing to provide the publication dates? Thanks. The quotations would be difficult to footnote, as they are mostly often-repeated phrases from Rose's personal vocabulary. All the material was originally self-published via the TAT Foundation. By the way, there remain many unpublished works and transcriptions of lectures, transcribed by volunteers (as usual).

<li>Ok, I'm officially changing my opinion to <b>keep</b>, after the rewrite. I'm not saying the article is perfect, but to me the subject looks significant. Yeah, it's hagiographic here and there (I had to look that one up, thanks), but as pointed out, this can be fixed. While not very famous, as authors go, to me the intro paragraph gives me sufficient info about this guy to consider him significant. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:10, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
<p>- wow an organisation run by two people with full time jobs and charges a small fee to cover costs of newsletter, great reason for removal! Maybe they should charge more and then they wouldn't have to work fulltime jobs. Accounts are fully transparent and available for any member to view.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> You miss the point again. It was not an argument about the fact that you charge, but that you are not a 'full-time', professional organisation worthy of note in an encyclopedia but something you do in your spare time as a hobby. This is an encylcopedia page about your hobby.</dd>

<dd><b>Delete</b>:P.A. is a small group of friends based in Birmingham. Run as a part-time venture by two people who have 'real jobs', a 'kitchen fitter' and a, 'personal assistant' I believe. Likes to give the impression it IS paganism in the Midlands. Charges for membership but the, 'books' are not open for inspection by members. Totally unworthy of mention on Wikipedia: Remove.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: Even after a re-edit the page is still little more than an advert for this group, and by that token an advert for their, 'pay services' such as, 'hand fastings'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: I hardly think being given expenses of a few pounds to cover fuel costs for handfastings all around the UK counts as a 'pay service'? It's not a commercial venture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: Regardless of what this couple charge, they and their services should not be advertised on an encyclopedia, especially as the many other organisations who've been offering such a services for decades are not. It's misleading and could give the impression that this is the only organisation offering such a service.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anyway, if people want a pagan handfasting service, or even to find out about paganism at all, they can look on specifically pagan sites, (easily found through any search engine) or follow the links under <a href="../../../p/a/g/Paganism.html" title="Paganism">paganism</a></p>
<p>They don't need a misleading promotional advert trying to convince them about the importance of any one organisation on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>A page containing a general description of paganism and links to other groups is all that is needed. A page called, 'Pagan Association' is not.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: There already are two, with links. <a href="../../../p/a/g/Paganism.html" title="Paganism">paganism</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neopaganism.html" title="Neopaganism">neopaganism</a></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>- how about <b>rename</b> as Pagan Association- Midlands, England as this group only holds any events or has any active prescence in that region? And have a more objective tone as opposed to 'local pagans loved the idea' and such ad nauseam. There are several <b>pagan groups in Birmingham</b> this page could be subsumed under one of that name. Even then, is an analysis of the regional factions of a minority religion worthy of note, when large pagan groups such as the Druid Network only have a stub, and the Pagan Federation, the UK's largest pagan organisation by far and a registered charity, has no page at all.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: Updated to include other pagan organisations - not sure if there are any suggestions as to how it should then be renamed? Perhaps National Pagan organisations within the UK? Incidentally the Pagan Federation was stripped of its charitable status several years ago and is trying to regain it through PEBBLE. --User:RhiannonB 23:41, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> This is not a pagan information update page -it's to discuss the deletion of an article on Wikipedia. Your 'incidental' comment goes beyond incidental into off-topic.--</p>

<p>Simply place your URL on the links page of <a href="../../../p/a/g/Paganism.html" title="Paganism">paganism</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neopaganism.html" title="Neopaganism">neopaganism</a> You don't need a seperate Wikipedia article for pagan organisations. If need be you could place a subheading <b>UK</b> there for pagan organisations in the UK.</p>
<p>Then if people are interested, they can go direct to the site, or to the many pagan sites that provide descriptions of available UK and local pagan organisations.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Pagan Association UK is the official name, and as members come from as far afield as Berwick Upon Tweed, London, South Wales, and Cornwall, it's a fair name to use. The contacts of the Pagan Association spread even further afield, and as there are many people who use Wikipedia to find out more about paganism, giving them a safe and known point of contact offline seems to me to be a good use of Wikipedia. If someone from within the Pagan Federation wishes to add to the page then we could share the resource. I believe the Children of Artemis is the biggest pagan organisation in the UK with something like 5,000 members, however this is a commercial organisation. --User:RhiannonB 23:41, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>correction</b> No. The particular pagan association refered to has always been based in Birmingham where the founder and leadership live. You must be mistaking it for another of the same name.</p>
<p>And they don't have a 'headquarters'-unless you count their sitting room.</p>
<p>Having read the article you flagged, I can assure you that this organisation is based in Birmingham, and as for 'first gathering outside London'- they've met in a pub at least once a week in Birmingham for some time. I suspect this is a misprint in the article. At any rate it's wholly misleading. <a href="../../../a/c/r/User%7EAcropolis_now_d92f.html" title="User:Acropolis now">User:Acropolis_now</a></p>
<p>This is a global encyclopedia, not for things that have been on -a few minute's segment- of a -local- programme on -one- channel in the-UK-.</p>
<p>A channel which a prominent member of this organisation just happens to work for.</p>
<p>Anyone can be on the local news- especially if they ring the media, are holding a pagan ritual, wearing robes or dancing round a fire.</p>
<p>All they need is their URL under <a href="../../../p/a/g/Pagan.html" title="Pagan">pagan</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neopagan.html" title="Neopagan">neopagan</a>.</p>
<p>Having their own entry is self-indulgent vanity publishing or an indirect advertisment for themselves and indirectly for those services for which they charge. <a href="../../../a/c/r/User%7EAcropolis_now_d92f.html" title="User:Acropolis now">User:Acropolis_now</a></p>

<p><b>Keep:</b> I'm not a believer in the Electric Universe theory, but I suggest that this article remain. I don't mind an having an unreviewed scientific theory present as long as the issue is known on a global scale (The number of Google hits and the number of editors on this article suggest it is) and it is said in the article that the theory is unsupported by the scientific community. My reasoning behind this is the article can still have a historic value even if it no longer has a scientific one. It also appears from the talk page that deletion was discussed before and a consensus was not reached. I hope we are not simply debating the same points we did before. -<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolarusdude_2019.html" title="User:Solarusdude">Solarusdude</a> 19:10, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Many of the references appear to be wrongly appropriated. Others are unscientific. So the question seems to me to be whether this is a notable social phenomenon (as it's not a scientific theory). I don't think it is but I'm open to being convinced otherwise. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> 19:30, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep:</b> I agree with Solarusdude. In my opinion, the whole Electric Universe thing is crackpot psuedoscience that's been picked up by the oddball fringe, but it does have a significant group of followers (for whatever reason) who are good at making noise. As long as the article clearly states that this is not mainstream science and is widely dismissed and riduculed as lacking merit by most every mainstream physicist, I'm fine with it being here. I do think, however, that the article has gotten badly out of control, and that someone needs to wrestle it back into having some semblance of objectivity. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">Cory Maylett</a></li>

<p><b>Delete</b> as vanity, neologism, website advertising: The first half-dozen pages of Google results for "domain hack" suggest that no-one uses this term in this manner (they're all referring to hackers grabbing control of a domain or similar). The article has been edited almost entirely by one IP range, and the only page I found in the Google results that <i>does</i> use this sense of the term is <a href="http://www.xona.com/domainhacks/info.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xona.com/domainhacks/info.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, which coined the term a year ago and presumably created the article (to which the site links; also, the IP range that edited the article and the owner of xona.com correspond geographically.) — <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> 19:39, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: (I'm not sure how to properly edit this page, so please format it preperly afterwards.) To clarify, I am the creator of the article and the creator of the <a href="http://www.xona.com/domainhacks/" class="external text" title="http://www.xona.com/domainhacks/" rel="nofollow">Domain Hacks</a> search utility. As for self-promotion, the article was not created for the promotion of my website. I would have linked to any and all websites better than mine (along with mine), if I could have found any, any at all, but I couldn't. I could only find a few blog entries almost a year after the creation of my utility. I eventually found V3's site. All of these sites I linked to. I did my best to find as much information on domain hacks as I could. There is truly very little information out there. You can see this is true, or else you would already have another name/title for the article in mind. Anyways, I created the article (and my <a href="http://www.xona.com/domainhacks/" class="external text" title="http://www.xona.com/domainhacks/" rel="nofollow">search utility</a>) as this is something big, and there exists little to no information on it. When I programmed the Domain Hacks search, no one else had come up with a name for these type of domains. If they had, I would have used it. I searched very hard and found nothing, so I had to create a name myself. I came up with "domain hack", even though I appreciate the media uses "domain hack" in a completely unrelated sense. If "domain hack" is not used widely enough to have a wikipedia article, then I suggest to rename to "unconventional domain names" (and rename email hack to "unconventional email addresses") and change the article to say that I suggest (and actively use) the name of "domain hack" and "email hack". As far as I know, I am the first one to come up with any name at all. You can appreciate the difficulty in coming up with a more 'proper' name, I can tell by your comments. It is hard. It would also help to consider that the media tends to use "hack" in the system breach sense, not the sense of making a system do something it was never intended to do, which is the type of "hack" I had in mind during the naming of these domains. "Hack" and "hacker" predate computer security, anyway, so my version of "hack" I believe to be more accurate. Because the media uses "domain hack" in another sense, I would NOT use this as a reason to not call these domain names "domain hacks". (That is my personal opinion.) I have held #1 in Google for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22domain+hacks%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22domain+hacks%22" rel="nofollow">domain hacks</a> for a long time. So, with the plural search, it favors to keep the name. As for trademark issues, there is nothing to worry about. I put that "(tm)" to protect my www.domainhacks.com domain name, so nobody would come along afterwards and claim they have more right to use it (with their own trademark) and steal it away. It was done out of protection, not for money making reasons. I solved the situation by moving the search utility under the www.xona.com domain name. I can remove those trademarks, although "Domain Hacks" will more than likely remain the name of my search utility. The trademark was never intended to make money. Anyways, I wrote the article under the name of "domain hack" for two main reasons: 1) it is the only name I know of and 2) it is the only name that is currently in use (albeit by myself via my search utility, none-the-less no other name is in use). I thought, perhaps incorrectly, that this was enough to justify the wikipedia article of the same title. I hope this clarifies my position. Please do whatever is best, of course. 137.186.22.240 01:38, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: As mendel states, it is a neologism, unused outside of its inventor's website, and is a poor neologism at that. (It does not employ the work "hack" in any of its common meanings). Useless and uninformative. -- riotnrrd 15:49, 21 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I coined the term, but I did not invent the idea. The idea still exists, is very popular, and deserves recognition. A rename maybe, but not a delete. Explain why a delete and not a rename. The only question here is the title/name, not the content. As for usage of "hack", it is common to use "hack" in terms of a "programming exploit" or "clever hack", in where things are done that were never meant to be able to do. So that cannot be used as the reason to reject the name. "Domain hack" is the only title that exists and the only one in use. However, it is only used by me, so this is the only reason why the title should be rejected, but not deleted (just renamed to something else, but what?) As for your "useless and uninformative" comment, it is a very individualistic (and emotional?) comment and is obviously not true for everyone. As always, please do what is best. If a rename is in order, what should it be renamed to??? I am new to this. 137.186.22.29 22:53, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Simply put, your concept of a "domain hack" is that people make words out of domain names. That's it. Sure, it's clever to use the top-level-domain "icio.us" to create memorable domain names such as "del.icio.us" in a namespace already heavily occupied (delicious.com, org and net being taken), but is it worthy of note? Is registering the domain "del.icio.us" substantially different from registering "delicious.com?" In the broadest possible sense, this may be a phenomonon that deserves a name, but does it deserve a wikipedia article? I don't think so. So, when I said this entry was "Useless and uniformative" I meant that the article itself provides no other information than "some people register clever domain names and here is a list of them." -- riotnrrd 16:13, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe it is worthy of a note. Perhaps it needs to become more popular, more of a phenomena, before Wikipedia will accept it... not sure. But, it IS something, and I looked for info on Wikipedia FIRST when I went to research it, expecting it to be here in great detail. There's something that told me it should be here. It just felt like Wikipedia type stuff. Hope this poor explanation makes some sense to all of you. 137.186.22.208 20:42, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was thinking about this some more, since there seems to be a strong "Move it... somewhere?" sentiment. There are essentially three parts to the current article: the part about people doing this with domains, the part about the history of "Domain hack" and the related website and its founder, and the list of names. I suspect there's consensus that the phrase "Domain hack" and the history of the related website aren't encyclopedic, so there's that section done. The list itself is borderline; there <i>is</i> a website about this stuff, and where there's a good external resource for something like this then there's no point in keeping a list here, better to provide an external link. So that leaves the observation that people do this — that can be merged into <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domain_name_system.html" title="Domain name system">Domain name system</a> with an external link. Thoughts? — <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> 20:14, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia can maintain the list better than any other site, so is that something to consider? I think the list is interesting, and would wish it to remain on Wikipedia somewhere. 137.186.22.208 20:38, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>So IF a rename, what would it be renamed to? What are these domain names called? How should one refer to them? 137.186.22.208 23:56, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not true, it was coined to have a name and be able to write about it. The search tool could be called what else? Not that this affects the outcome, just making it clear. 137.186.22.208 20:49, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>As recently as Tuesday you were claiming it as a trademark over on the search tool: <a href="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:cf4Qy6n1i94J:www.xona.com/domainhacks/+&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:cf4Qy6n1i94J:www.xona.com/domainhacks/+&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Google cache</a> — <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> 21:22, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I explained the trademark issue already, it was trademarked to protect the www.domainhacks.com domain name from being stolen away. I removed this as it basically makes no sense, which this discussion brought to light. (Thanks for this.) This does not mean that I coined the name "domain hack" to promote my search, which was the point. I can see why you could think this, but it is incorrect. Think of this from this perspective might help: Whatever name I decided on would probably have ended up in the title of my search. I.e. if I could go make the first domain name search, I would probably call it domains.com or domainnames.com. I hope this clarifies my position and thought process on the matter. Again, I doubt this matters. The trademark thing is now irrelevant. 137.186.22.208 23:41, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I will expand on my reasons for calling for deletion. I am not disputing that there is such an area, and its boundaries are clearly defined. However it is not an area in its own right, it is defined as that part of the historic county of <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunbartonshire.html" title="Dunbartonshire">Dunbartonshire</a> which went into <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argyll_and_Bute_54eb.html" title="Argyll and Bute">Argyll and Bute</a> at the local govt. reorganisation of the 1990s. Granted, including the Helensburgh area was controversial. "Helensburgh and Lomond" is, as far as I am aware, not a term which is significantly used either officially or colloquially, I had never heard of it before I came across it on Wikipedia a few minutes ago. It does not even include the majority of the shore of Loch Lomond. I recognise that <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helensburgh.html" title="Helensburgh">Helensburgh</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/c/Loch_Lomond_e1cd.html" title="Loch Lomond">Loch Lomond</a> do merit inclusion. Anything useful in this article should be moved to Argyll and Bute, I think a lot of it will be there already. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 20:17, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm going with Pat Gallacher on this. It should be <b>merged</b> with better known areas. I am surprised it is not called "and Loch Lomond", "and Lomondside" etc...--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 20:47, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm happy to go with a <b>merge to Argyle and Bute</b>. I'd certainly never heard of this division of the area. However, a quick google gives 52,000 hits and indicates that the designation is being extensively used by the local authority and other government agencies as a regional subdivision. Thus, <i>if it were neccessary</i> to split an article on Argle and Bute, this doesn't seem like an unreasonable way to go. PS since nomination calls for move/merge, it could have been done without nominating for deletion. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 21:23, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> My understanding of the above comments is that individual scout troops aren't notable, but the only guideline that seems to apply is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. Two questions: 1) surely some troops, such as Troop 1, are notable because of their tremendous historical influence, so how do you decide which other troops should also have the distinction? 2) at what level does a scout organization become worthy of inclusion: district? council? region? 13:59, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Troop numbers, I believe, are assigned by Councils, so there are likely to be several non-notable "Troop 1"s. I was in the Birmingham Area Council's Troop 1 and I am not aware of anything notable about that organization except perhaps our stranglehold on the canoe-battle competitions at Camp Sequoyah. In my opinion a Troop <i>could</i> be notable, but that would have to be established in the article. More likely, a good article about a Council that might include some information about particular Troops would be encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 16:36, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Note that most states have multiple councils; there are probably other Troop 26's in other parts of Oklahoma. At what level does a scout organization become worthy of inclusion?

<li>Oh puhleeeze! The fact that it has been tagged for clean up for this long means that either it's of no interest or no one with sufficient knowledge has stepped forward to undertake the cleanup. Additionally, the article suffers from obscurity in that it fails to sufficiently explain the position within the federal superstructure of this particular office. If that wasn't enough, since when did minor collections of govco drones become notable?? What has this department achieved that merits an encyclopaedic article?

<li>I agree that the article you cite is no more notable - maybe you should list it in AfD? I don't understand the second part of your argument. Like real people, fictional people vary in notability.

<li><b>Bulk delete</b>. Ignoring the fact that these pages are completely uninformative stubs, the very concept of trying to describe geographic information in prose is misguided. "Beginning at Lakeshore Boulevard near Ashbridge's Bay, the street travels north to O'Connor Drive". Do they expect someone to actually navigate streets by reading this? Who would look in an encyclopedia to find which streets intersect when there is MapQuest, Google Maps, Yahoo maps, and dozens of other web sites that show actual maps of the area? Who's going to keep this stuff updated? There are street changes in every city every year.</li>

Look at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commercial_Drive_74d6.html" title="Commercial Drive">Commercial Drive</a> for an example. Stuff that doesn't go out of date when there's road construction is encyclopedic, but describing directions and street intersections in text has a cost/benefit ratio approaching infinity.

<li><b>Delete</b> all. I'm also a Torontonian, and simply can't agree with the idea that any old run-of-the-mill road deserves a Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Delete:</b> Describing city streets in Wikipedia seems silly. Unless a street is notable and worthy of special mention, it just doesn't, IMHO, merit its own article. Notable streets might include: Pennsylvania Avenue, Champs Elysee, Wall Street, Bourbon Street, Broadway, Downing Street, etc., but I seriously doubt these roads in Toronto are anything more than average, run-of-the-mill thoughfares whose only real significance are as traffic arteries.
