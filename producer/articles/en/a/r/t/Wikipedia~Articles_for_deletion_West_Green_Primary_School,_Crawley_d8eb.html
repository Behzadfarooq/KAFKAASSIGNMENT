<li><b>Keep</b>. Well written article detailing history of this 50+ year old school, hardly a "vanity" article, which is inapplicable (from a policy perspective) to schools in any event. Further, "notability" (or the lack thereof) is not and never has been a valid deletion criterion for schools. 42 elementary/primary schools have survived the AfD process in the past 2 months alone, with hundreds of similar schools surviving the process in the previous 2 year period. While some of these elementary/primary schools resulted in "no consensus" closures, it is reasonable that a wikipedia reader would expect to find an article about this school when searching for it given the great perponderance of other elementary/primary school articles on wikipedia. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 21:04, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This kind of accusation does little to make the Wikipedia project seem more encyclopedic.

<li><b>Undecided</b> - as it was I who wrote the article, I thought I'd add a few comments. Firstly, it's not a private school (not sure why that came up). Secondly, it was never intended to be recruitative; rather that it is difficult to find a central history of schools anywhere, and I have researched several; some of the older history info can be verified from the Victoria History series, so I can find a reference for that if that would make is saveable. Failing that, if consensus is that schools have to be of a certain size or notability, then what it that? And how broadly? It's notable locally since it has been threatened with closure on more than one occasion, and may well be again in the next 5-10 years. Does it need to be broader than that? <a href="../../../t/a/f/User%7ETafkam_3c4d.html" title="User:Tafkam">Tafkam</a> 19:25, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Adding more verified information to the article about its local notability would make for a better evaluation. The article now seems to say that people cared, but not clearly enough to say if they cared about the school specifically or generally objected to the system's plan.

<li><b>Comment</b> That might be true, but I don't see what repeating yourself over and over and over and over again in AfD after AfD adds to the discussion or to consensus building either.

<li><b>Comment</b>: That does not make it appropriate to post deriding comments that show that the editor has no interest in working toward consensus about a subject, which is contrary to the spirit of AFD, and the Wikipedia project itself.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Do you seriously believe that 90% of those who vote to <b>delete</b> on this and all the other school AfDs are "working toward consensus"? Do you think that "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" actually have any respect whatsoever for the opinions of those who disagree with them? I can't see as how those who pile on with <b>delete</b> votes aren't treating these "discussions" as a vote, particularly in light of the fact that school articles are very, very rarely deleted through deletion processes on wikipedia. The fact is, that ALL attempts at consensus on this issue have utterly failed, and in fact, if anything the failure of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> simply codified the polarized positions that exist on this contentious matter. There is no consensus on what to do with schools and trying discredit editors who have well-known views on the subject, expressed in literally hundreds of previous AfD discussions is quite frankly, a cheap shot. Further, "around and around we go" is hardly "deriding"--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 16:53, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>What happened to you assuming good faith? Your comment above claims that the author (and subsequent editors) of this article is engaged in advertising and writing a vanity article - hardly an assumption of good faith.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 19:37, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I feel that it's a good-faith misunderstanding about what Wikipedia is about.

<li>I am sorry, but that is hogwash. When an editor creates an article about a school of which there are literally tens of thousands of such articles on wikipedia as well several organized projects to create and improve articles about schools, it is <b>not</b> an assumption of good faith to then suggest that the editor was creating "advertising". It is the opposite. It is obvious that the editor in this case created the article on wikipedia after seeing many other school articles and wished to contribute information about - not to "advertise" this school. Frankly, I find your lack of assumption of good faith with respect to the author and contributors to this article by suggesting that they are creating "advertising", offensive and uncivil. Your voting premise is faulty and malinformed in any case as this is a not a "private business". The article <b>clearly</b> states that this was founded as a Church of England school. In England, the Church of England is <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_religion.html" title="State religion">established</a>. The article goes on to make abundantly clear that school was later reorganized by the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_education_authority.html" title="Local education authority">Local education authority</a>. This school is funded by the state. Did you actually read the article before voting on it?--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 02:54, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>One para intro, three para history. It's not exactly lauding the merits of the school, I admit, but announcing the existence of a business offering services to the public is an advertisement, unless that article serves some purpose other than announcing the availability of the services. This article fails to anything else, and, whether or not it was intended as an advertisement, it is an advertisement.<br />
My knowledge of English schools is limited. (Does this school actively recruit students, or simply accept students from a district? In the case of the latter, my argument that this is an advertisement would indeed be incorrect.) I went to find out more, then discovered that <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_England_c7c5.html" title="Education in England">Education in England</a> is horrribly uninformative and badly written; it's mostly bulleted lists. Perhaps your time would be better spent making that a useful, informative article?<br />
As for the rest of the articles, looks like there's a lot of work to do to clean them up. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:19, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you had bothered to read the link I cited, it would have explained to you how <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_education_authority.html" title="Local education authority">Local education authoritys</a> work. Students are organized into these STATE SCHOOLS by the LEAs, the school does not solicit for students. Perhaps your time would be better spent getting informed on a subject you are voting on and discussing before pronouncing that the subject is "a private school" and "a private business" which is clearly not the case. I hope the closing admin discounts your obviously and admittedly shoddily-informed comment. Irrespective of your unfounded assertion and continued weak defense of same, "advertisement" is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/advertisement" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/advertisement" rel="nofollow">defined</a> as "A publication produced in order to sell some commodity, service or similar." or "A commercial solicitation in a publication designed to sell some commodity, service or similar." This article is neither of those things, particularly since no service is "sold" by this institution. This state-run school is not a business.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 07:40, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The LEA article is unclear on whether students are recruited or assigned, as well. I was under the impression that private schools solicited students, as is my experience with both the American and Canadian educational systems. Consider my objection mooted, then (although the <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_England_c7c5.html" title="Education in England">Education in England</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Education_Authority_37a1.html" title="Local Education Authority">Local Education Authority</a> articles need a lot of love). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:50, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>That last bit, at the very least, implies that the objections and opinions of editors who disagree are meaningless and without worth to the project, which I find nonconducive to the environment needed to create an encyclopedia. And further, yes, I believe that many of the people who have voted delete above have an interest in consensus, particularly when it comes to this article. The claim that people who would argue to delete an article like this are "piling on votes" is similarly thoroughly unfounded. I have expressed in my vote the reason I think that the article is inappropriate to include, and I am entirely open to discussion on my position as far as this article is concerned. Further, I have respect for the differing opinions of other editors who disagree with me- I extend this effort toward other editors in the name of not detracting from what Wikipedia needs to work, and it is this expectation that led me to voice concerns over what Alkivar had to say. Lastly, the concerns expressed by A Man In Black, I must admit, concern me as well. A civil environment in which editors assume good faith is similarly vital to the project. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 17:38, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
