The article is also entirely <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unreferenced</a> and unsourced, and contains a heap of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, such as <i>the Halo games (so far) only two Monitors have been seen.

<p>Spilt the world into two groups: Those who own Halo: already have the game manual which contains all this information. Actual usefulness of article for this group: <b>none</b>.

<dd>Article seems to have at least one reliable source in the context of a video game. I do not believe it satisfies any solid criteria for deletion any more.

<li><b>Keep</b> Using the reasoning provided, all lists anything like it, in the Halo Wikiproject or not, are "useless" and thus should be removed (lists of weapons, characters, episodes, etc.) I admit it needs sourcing, etc. But I see no reason for its total deletion. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs">David Fuchs</a> 17:14, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This AfD nomination seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. This article is not a manual, guide or a "how-to", thus WP:NOT does not apply. A manual contains instructions for <i>how</i> to do or use a certain thing, and this article don't. I think it's important that we all understand what a manual is, and what it's not, in order to avoid future AfDs without justification or support from the Wikipedia policies and guidelines. The second reason for me voting to keep this article is that this AfD nom. seems to be based on someones personal opinion that Wikipedia shouldn't contain info about games. This means that this AfD nom. in a way violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (censorship) and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and as long as the Wikipedia policies and guidelines doesn't state that Wikipedia is supposed to be kept free from game-related information, I will vote against AfDs like this one just out of principle.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I would rather say that this AfD no longer has any justification. This is not a manual, so the WP:NOT does no longer apply. The information is verifiable (although some editors confuse verifiability with verified, it's not the same, vefifiable means that it can be verified, not that it is), meaning that it doesn't violate WP:V either. And since it's not original research, WP:NOR doesn't apply. This leaves us with some administrators and editors personal opinion that Wikipedia shouldn't contain any game info, and that's not an acceptable argument for deletion, since it violates WP:NOT - Wikipedia is not censored. Personally, I absolutely detest cruft, and would like to rid Wiki of it. But this isn't gamecruft, since gamecruft (as well as other forms of cruft found here and there on Wikipedia) is based on conclusions and assumptions made by some individuals (ie fantasies and their own little "contributions" and "improvements" to for the example overall storyline of a movie, or a fictional universe), and are non-factual/non-canonical information. According to my experience, people tend to condemn everything they personally don't like or are interested in as "cruft", although it is often based on facts and reliable sources. And when you're fighting cruft, you don't use AfD templates, you clean up the crufty articles instead. /<b>M.O</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagore_c109.html" title="User:Magore">u</a>) (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User_talk%7EMagore_308e.html" title="User talk:Magore">t</a>) 16:14, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are far too many things linking to the page and the information can be sourced. Just because an article sits there with a template saying that this article does source it's statements for a long period of time, that doesn't mean it should get an AfD vote.

<li><b>Keep but cleanup</b>. If you believe in <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/immediatism" class="extiw" title="m:immediatism">m:immediatism</a>, sure, this article is in bad shape. But I think that this is an encyclopedic topic, and we should approach it from the viewpoint that it is an incomplete article, rather than one that is unsalvageable. When <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> was being developed, many felt that it should not be made policy because that would potentially spark deletion of salvageable articles on fiction. Although I am nominally part of WikiProject Halo, I'm not a big content contributor; I go through a copyedit articles from time to time. I would say that the focus needs to shift to describing the vehicles as <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_artifact.html" title="Cultural artifact">cultural artifacts</a>. By this, I mean that the following questions should be answered (and sourced):
<ul>
<li>How did Bungie come up with the idea for creation? Did they take anything from their earlier games, or perhaps from other fiction?</li>
<li>For vehicles in both <i>Halo</i> and <i>Halo 2</i>, how did they change? Were the changes aesthetic or for reasons of game balance?</li>
<li>How did game critics and other reliable sources react to the vehicles, or any changes made between the games? Are there any reliable reviews that mention the vehicles' handling and shift to third-person perspective?</li>
<li>How have the vehicles been used in notable <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machinima.html" title="Machinima">machinima</a> pieces? For example, the Warthog was the subject of both <i>Warthog Jump</i>, a video that exploits the <i>Halo</i> physics engine, and an entire episode of <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_vs_Blue_4af2.html" title="Red vs Blue">Red vs Blue</a></i> (where the characters wonder why it's called the Warthog in the first place).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In short, I really do think that this topic can be treated encyclopedically, and, in researching along the lines that I mentioned above, editors <i>may</i> find that they have enough material to justify splitting some of the more notable vehicles into their own articles. — <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a>::<a href="../../../t/k/d/User_talk%7ETKD_73cb.html" title="User talk:TKD">Talk</a> 18:22, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe that TKD made some very compelling points as to the usefulness of some of the information.

<dd>Agreed. I do, however, believe it is possible to reject dictionary-like discourse in favor of encyclopaedic analysis. After all, isn't that what Wikipedia's all about? <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurai_fde2.html" title="User:Ourai">Ourai</a> 16:09, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I'm going to play devil's advocate for articles like this. You just mentioned analysis, but on such topics as these, how can the analysis not be "original"? These articles cannot possibly meet Wikipedia's formal article criteria, for what is the "source" of the material in this article other than the game itself? To the extent that an article like this <i>is allowed</i>, it needs to be judged on its balance and reasonability vis-a-vis the small world it describes. That description is always going to be "original research", in the most trivial possible sense of that term. I have to wonder about anyone who thinks that observing and synthesizing certain facts about a <i>video game</i> violates Wikipedia standards. The <i>standard</i> should be: this is too silly for an encyclopedia that wants to be taken seriously, or it isn't. I fail to see how any of the listed WP policies--original research, strategy guides, dicdef--meaningfully apply to this article. I say either develop a policy that says a video game can have only one page to describe it, without going into excessive detail, or let it rest, unless the article in question is just crap. Which this isn't. That's my opinion... <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutriggr_fee9.html" title="User:Outriggr">Outriggr</a> 00:10, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't play video games or know anything about Halo. That's why I found this article on its vehicles quite informative. There is no reason that we shouldn't be documenting important aspects of these games, which have become a form of literature for an entire generation. Could be useful for people like me who might need the info in the future, perhaps as part of a research project, or in order to discuss halo with the grandchildren.

<dd>Both satisfied by references (see bottom of article). Furthermore, since this article is about a <a href="../../../t/e/x/Text.html" title="Text">text</a>, the text itself is a reference. <s>For example, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>'s article doesn't need a reference to say that the main character is Frodo Baggins, since that text itself is a primary source. In the same way, this article doesn't need a reference to say that the vehicles are Warthog, Tank, etc. There is probably a policy page on this somewhere but I have no idea where to find it.</s> --<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECornflake_pirate_1e01.html" title="User:Cornflake pirate">Cornflake pirate</a> 12:51, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

JJay, the DoD is assigning your team $10bn over 5 years to discover how to replicate this incredible technology in real life".), when the next image of JJay's grandkids' facial expressions when JJay starts talking in detail about Halo vehicles out of nowhere made me laugh so hard I spat out my dinner all over my office desk.
