<li><b>Comment:</b> Hello, I am a staff member of this website and it is the second largest New York Knicks website on the internet. It has gotten many responses in the newspapers and radio stations. I believes it should be kept on because it is a legitimate website with much more traffic than just "Google hits" and has a lot of dedicated and loyal fans. Wikipedia readers should have the right to know about a great website like this.

<p>Alright nerds, listen up: I cannot find the NY Post article in which we are mentioned because it was a very long time ago but we have interviewed writers of the NY Times and NY Post before as a website and even interviewed people from ESPN 1050, a sports radio station here in New York. We've also gotten a few mentions on that radio station as well. A link? <a href="http://www.knicks4life.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10575" class="external free" title="http://www.knicks4life.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10575" rel="nofollow">http://www.knicks4life.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10575</a> That's the best I can give you. People who love their website. Too bad you people are too stuck up to care.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Wikipedia is for people all over the world so just because your site was mentioned in a few New York newspapers, although they are well known newspapers in the United States, not even everyone in the U.S. reads them so their not country-wide much less world-wide. Therefore your site being mentioned once in two popular U.S. newspapers doesn't make it notable to all the other English-speaking countries who use the english version of Wikipedia. Also, there's no reason to call people nerds just because they're intellectually superior to you and you aren't even intelligent enough to come up with a good reason to keep your article posted.--<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMertens21_8589.html" title="User:Mertens21">Mertens21 a.k.a.

<p>Haha. Intellectually superior? What makes you think that? Because you sit behind a computer all day decidng the fate of Wikipedia? If someone wants to search for Knicks sites on Wiki he'll find this on there. It's one of the best sites on the internet. What harm will it cause for it to remain up there? I don't see any insults or pornographic images. I just see a successful website wanting to expand it's image. Let up a little bit, would you?<a href="../../../k/n/e/User%7EKnea2006_b618.html" title="User:Knea2006">Knea2006</a> 03:53, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Once again your intelligence is just astonishing. First of all “You sit behind your computer all day” is not a very accurate statement seeing as any intelligent person (which explains why you wouldn't notice) can see by the timestamp that I'm on around the same time every day and not “all day.” Also, you have no room to say anything about people being on the computer all day. I went to your forum site that you posted here and it's pretty much just 50 posts from you talking about this article and crying about how it's going to get deleted. And one more thing, considering you just said I sit at the computer all day and post on Wikipedia you sure replied fast to my last post. It's almost as if you sit at home all day watching this just to see who else has come here to let you know that your web site is completely unimportant to anyone.--<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMertens21_8589.html" title="User:Mertens21">Mertens21 a.k.a. FrodoTBagins, DonkeyPunch21, Squirrel</a> 04:05, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>More To Add To My Previous <b>Comment</b> - I just thought I'd add that your web site is most definitely not “one of the best sites on the internet.” It is in fact, quite possibly, one of the worst sites on the internet, which is one more reason it doesn't deserve an article. Also, I'd appreciate if you didn't come here and babble incoherently about “insults and pornographic images.” I don't know what that has to do with anything so if you could just keep your porn addiction to yourself that would be great.

<p>Hahaha. Who do you think you are, tool? You think you are someone special because you can decide the fate of Wiki articles? Who gives a rats ass what you can do? Listen up buddy, you don't intimidate me and your attempt to "own" me failed. Also showing your ignorance was the fact that you insulted a website that has done nothing to you. Calling it one of the "worst sites on the internet" is not what you should be doing. Nowhere did I say it was the best on the 'net. I said it was the best KNICKS sites on the web. Now, aside from reading Harry Potter books and pleasuring yourself to Star Trek episodes, do you have any idea who or what the Knicks are? Because from what I can see, you have none. So please, spare me the preaching and the attempt to act like a smart aleck. I've been there and done that and dealt with people like you, who think you are someone special because you work on wikipedia. Whoopdeedamndoo brother, what in the hell is that supposed to mean? I'm supposed to respect you? I don't even know you! So get whatever is out of your ass and act like a human being, rather than a robotic mouthpiece for wikipedia.<a href="../../../k/n/e/User%7EKnea2006_b618.html" title="User:Knea2006">Knea2006</a> 04:47, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - And yet again you're intelligence astonishes me. However if you could stop with the childish insults for a second and learn how to read you would see that you did in fact say that it was the best site on the internet so just in case you do learn how to read I will quote you from your earlier post and highlight the incredibly unintelligent statement contained within it.

<li>Now that you've been embarrassed repeatedly and tried to redeem yourself repeatedly with foolish and childish insults, which, as stated in a previous post, make absolutely no sense, I would suggest that you just give up trying to sound intelligent, get off your computer, leave your mom's basement, and go out and get a job so perhaps someday you can pay for an education. Thank you for your time, I've enjoyed making you look like an incompetent ass, although you didn't need my help, have a nice day. Also, I realize your going to respond with yet another childish insult and call me a “doo doo head” or whatever, but I'm not going to continue trying to convince you that your web site is not one of the best on the internet and not even one of the best Knicks sites on the internet because you are obviously to incompetent to realize that. Once again thank you for using Wikipedia, try putting your article on one of the many gay porn sites you visit.--<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMertens21_8589.html" title="User:Mertens21">Mertens21 a.k.a.

<p>LOL, what a classless tool. So, I made a mistake. The point was it is one of the best KNICK sites on the internet. Why don't you get your head out of your sarcastic, stuck up ass and realize you are a nobody? Mother's basement? You wish buddy. The only ass you've seen is yours in the mirror of your bathroom. You have your opinion about the site, I have mine, but to fall to the levels of calling the sites "one of the worst sites on the internet" is a disgrace for a wikipedia "employee." How did you get your position anyway? Seems like you have no sense of humor though, especially not with that lame gay porn joke. Get a life dude. No, seriously.

<dd>I hope this AFD doesn't put you off from contributing to Wikipedia forever especially on NBA-related articles. An AFD nomination on your very first article can be a very demoralising experience I know and some people do take it personally, but these rules exist to stop people promoting themselves, bands, companies, websites etc, because if we let everyone do it, then Wikipedia will start to lose its reputation for being an independent source of information. -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 22:12, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not promoting. It's a legit website that should be on Wikipedia in my respectful opinion.<a href="../../../k/n/e/User%7EKnea2006_b618.html" title="User:Knea2006">Knea2006</a> 23:55, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
