<li>I am new to the subject, but have considerable doubts as to the merit of its inclusion in Wikipaedia. It would be far more to the point to substitute a short article directing the the user to an external link - a British governmetn website where the Statutory Insitrumetns are listed. This would have the additional advantage that the user would aslo be able to move on to the text of the subordinate legislation in question. <b>Rewrite</b>. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterkingiron_03d3.html" title="User:Peterkingiron">Peterkingiron</a> 00:35, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This is a very good resource to provide in Wiki, which has the space to do so. Any self-respecting encyclopedia would be proud to be able to make such info available.

If we had the list elaborated with further information, like dates of passage or sponsors, it would be worth keeping here.

<dd>I am sure that as we have only listed the titles, we are not in breach of copyright.

<li><b>Keep</b>: The list is a very useful resource. Statutory Instruments are used in every aspect of British Law from bringing Acts of Parliament into force and setting rules for the court system, to defining the allowed capacity of fishing vessels or the route of a proposed motorway. As they have a impact on almost every walk of life in the UK, the subject cannot be defined as anything other than notable (as some people argued in the previous deletion discussion). The article will be even more useful if we can add the missing local instruments to the list.</li>

<dd>All the similar lists should be deleted as well. This kind of article is raw, blunt data, and is not encyclopedic.

<dd>Does it need to be? A lot of the other lists on Wikipedia are "raw, blunt data, and [are] not encyclopedic." They also list the actual data and are not presentatory articles <i>about</i> the data. One of the sentences in <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> states: <i>"research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged."</i></dd>
<dd>This list collects and organises the information from the existing primary sources (the published S.I.s) and secondary sources (the lists provided by the Office of Public Sector Information and other UK government departments). I fail to see how this counts as either raw or original data. If this is raw data, then what do you call all of the other lists like <a href="../../../n/_/_/List_of_United_Kingdom_locations%7E_N_801b.html" title="List of United Kingdom locations: N">List of United Kingdom locations: N</a>? <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoad_Wizard_b7b6.html" title="User:Road Wizard">Road Wizard</a> 18:04, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you. You have now clarified the reason for your vote, which was all I was wanting.

<dd>Good question. I don't know why this particular list was singled out, but if it goes then many, many, many, many others will have to go. I think I will start by finding lists written by those who voted for it to be deleted and nominating them for AFD. If they don't want lists on Wikipedia then they will get lots of their lists nominated for deletion. I personally find it extremely galling to have the hard work that I have put in and that others have put in questioned by those who don't even know Wikipedia policies. There are those who have said it is "listcruft" and those who have said that it bears no resemblance to an encyclopedia article. There are those who have cited <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> which plainly does not apply in this case.</dd>

<dd>It has been said before that AFD is a poison in Wikipedia and this shows why. I have also lost lists of RAF units that I put a lot of work into in the past few days to similar "arguments". Fortunately being an administrator I can go into the deleted pages and rescue the material for my user space. Wikipedia will not lose the work that has been put into these lists let me assure you of that. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 21:59, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You appear to be asking why I chose this list as opposed to another list for a similar year. Good question! I stumbled across this list by <a href="../../../l/o/n/Special%7ELongpages_b363.html" title="Special:Longpages">Special:Longpages</a> shortly before its first nomination for Afd. I wanted to know if there was a way it could be split, and it was nothing more than a group of external links with no internal links in the body, so I didn't see it as a good Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgia_guy_82ac.html" title="User:Georgia guy">Georgia guy</a> 20:27, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It <i>is</i> sorted into English, Welsh, Northern Irish and Scottish lists for the most part at the moment. You obviously haven't looked very hard at the large link box at the top right hand corner of the article. These pieces of legislation form one coherent series. That is why they are all in one list. You say that perhaps they should be sorted by subject or alphabetically and airily say "someone" should do it. {{sofixit}} is the appropriate response to that. You want it, you do it. As for subject matter, do you have any idea how SIs are categorised? There are some that are in more than one category of subject matter. Do you want them in the list twice? When it comes to putting them in alphabetical order that would make absolutely no sense. At least in numerical order they are in at least approximately the order they were made in. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 22:24, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I feel suitably chastised, I could do it, but sorting more than alphabetically would probably be beyond me, in my opinion, to be a useful resource it needs to be by subject matter. Actually it isn't sorted in English Welsh etc. I did check before and again, some SI's only apply to Wales, or even one geographical location, ie road works and, as you say, they are in numeric order. As I'm not prepared to work on it, I guess I'd better be quiet. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichhoncho_144b.html" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> 22:43, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: For those of you voting delete because of a lack of internal links, I am thinking of adding some shortly. Most of the SIs are not in enough depth to require a page of their own, but I was thinking about linking sets of them to a subject page (see my <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoad_Wizard_Sandbox_55e6.html" title="User:Road Wizard/Sandbox">Sandbox</a> for a rough example of how one might look). Unfortunately, I don't think that subject based lists can be a replacement to the existing lists because of the reasons stated by David Newton above. Instead, they can be a very useful addition to what we already have. I had not added any internal links earlier as it was not raised as a problem in the article's recent <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom%2C_1996_1836.html" title="Talk:List of Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom, 1996">talk page discussion</a>. As it will not be possible to work on adding internal links after the page is gone, can you please reconsider voting delete? Thank you. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoad_Wizard_b7b6.html" title="User:Road Wizard">Road Wizard</a> 06:47, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have now added a page called <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom%2C_planning_law_c4c9.html" title="Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom, planning law">Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom, planning law</a> and linked to it from the list page. I would appreciate your comments on the new article's talk page on whether you think it is a good idea. However, I now think that I may have been looking at the internal link issue from the wrong angle. Instead of creating new articles about each SI, wouldn't it be better to link to the <i>subject</i> of the SI? For example, I have now added links from the commencement orders to their associated Acts where the orders can be mentioned in a new section. As you will now see by looking at the 1996 List, the number of relevant internal links has increased markedly. This should improve even further once we begin to identify other relevant pages the remaining SIs can link to. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoad_Wizard_b7b6.html" title="User:Road Wizard">Road Wizard</a> 21:01, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The author doesn't understand categories either. There was precisely this argument when categories were first created. What JzG does not seem to understand is that categories are for existing articles. Lists are often more comprehensive and cover things that haven't had articles written about them yet. Sometimes they also cover things that as individual items do not necessarily justify their own articles but that collectively it is useful to have listed. This is one of those cases in that there are many SIs which amend earlier SIs and do not in themselves deserve articles, but the whole list of SIs is a useful resource. There are some SIs which do deserve their own articles since they cover significant areas of legislation. The <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_Information_Regulations_2004_ffd5.html" title="Environmental Information Regulations 2004">Environmental Information Regulations 2004</a> are a case in point since they define a very important information access regime in the UK. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 08:22, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, the author uderstands categories. They are self-maintaining. If a Wikiproject wants to make an article in Project space on the notable SIs which need articles until they are done, that's just great. This list is never going to be filled in more than a very small percentage of cases (they are not even redlinked)) and adds nothing to the list of SIs at the linked sources from whihc it was copied and pasted (hint: if you find yourself copying and pasting a substantial chunk of text into an areticle, that is almost certainly a sign that what you are doing is wrong). OPSI can be relied on to maintain an up to date list, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a mirror or directory. So, the notable SIs should go in a category, the list is unencyclopaedic. We have many, many precedents for deleting lists like this. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:13, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
