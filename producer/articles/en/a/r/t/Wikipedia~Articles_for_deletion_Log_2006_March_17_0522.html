<p>I would like to propose this defunct mall for deletion. Apparently there has been in the past some disagreement on whether malls are in general notable. Consider this negligible mall, which operated for about 15 years, and not in Times Square, either, if you catch my drift. Does it deserve an article? I say it's non-notable. Then consider "Category:Defunct shopping malls in the United States" (18 entries) and "Category:Shopping malls in the United States" (hundreds). How big is big enough for mall notability? In opining on this page, I ask you to not only decide the fate of Riverbend, but broaden the discussion, so that we could set a meaningful well-argued precedent for the future of malls on WP. <b>DELETE</b>. <font color="light blue"><strong><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">the.crazy.russian</a> <a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">(T)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crzrussian_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crzrussian">(C)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">(E)</a></strong></font> 23:31, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Are there any statistics regarding malls? Any rankings per country? This would give us a better clue as to notability. Also did it contain any notable stores? Did it leave an impact on the area or did it simply vanish without a trace? Did it have any attributable economic/social impact on the area?

<li><b>strong keep</b> Look folks. I wrote the article for deadmalls.com and I did duplicate it here, but wrote it much better than on deadmalls.com. I have wanted to sever ties with that site and have been publishing NOTABLE malls and major store chain histories for the state of Georgia on wiki. I especially like to note the vacant or demolished ones because these are places that people made memories that they might like to look back and find information on. Rich's? The Rich's at Greenbriar? I remember Greenbriar from 20 years ago, I'd like to hear what they had to say about it (see the point?).<br />
There are approximately 40 noteworthy malls in Georgia with major department store anchors: that is it. I am talking traditional, general enclosed malls that featured at least one major department store anchor. This one had three. Malls are disappearing at a rapid rate nationwide. These malls were significant, including some that were short-lived. Some successful malls die young. If an earthquake destroyed the world's largest mall five years after it opened, it would still be significant. Also, most of these descriptions consist of maybe two paragraphs with no photographs, logos or anything. I think Wiki wouldn't crash over that. This information is enjoyed by a surprisingly large amount of people and represents a time when malls were like cities themselves. People made memories in these places and they were known by thousands, maybe millions of people. The fact that they are dying this soon represents a major shift in American society. Riverbend Mall had a very large shopping area drawing people from upwards of three states and caused downtown Rome to lose its two major department stores and completely killed it for years. The mall also stood for actually 24 years though its period of actual success was only 15. And yes, this information came from memory and research of the various regional department store chains. I also remember seeing them report the flooding of the mall on the Atlanta news that year. I knew Hess's, Belk Rhodes and JCPenney (three major anchors) were all there and saw them with my own eyes. I do not need to quote that...I saw it for myself. And yes, this was a successful mall that died young because of a natural disaster (albeit poor planning). The location where it stood is still the major commercial strip of the city. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.11.147.54 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.11.147.54_dda3.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.11.147.54">contribs</a>) 07:45, 19 March 2006.</small> moved down here for chronology sake. <font color="blue"><strong><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">the.crazy.russian</a> <a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">(T)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crzrussian_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crzrussian">(C)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">(E)</a></strong></font></li>

<li>Right. I was there. I saw the anchors, remember when it happened. I saw the banner in front of the Belk Rhodes that read "Outlet Store" a year after Mount Berry opened. I saw the very seedy looking Bon-Ton there with the cheap looking sign. That was strictly from memory and I remember the year well. I was going to Little River Canyon that day and noticed it. I ate in the Morrison's Cafeteria and shopped in the Reed/Big B/Revco/CVS drug store there. I spent much time in that old Belk Rhodes as a kid with my mom and even took a photograph in 2002 of the store just before the wrecking ball finished it off. I can also see a Chick Fil A employee handing out samples along that ramped part of the mall up to the food court around 1991 or so. We used to shop there a lot from about 1985-1992 or so.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: due to the recent rash of "if it exists, we need an article about it" folks showing up at Afd, I raised the question of notability of buildings at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_71e3.html#Notability_of_buildings" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability">Wikipedia talk:Notability#Notability of buildings</a>. Malls and dorms seem to be the most common buildings that we get articles about. We have standards for businesses, see <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. I don't see how an individual property is more "notable" than the business than owns it, so I don't think being a mall is sufficient reason for inclusion. There are hundreds of thousands of them, they pretty much all do the same thing. For this article my opinion is <b>delete</b> (not that it matters), but I've no prejudice against someone making an article about the kidnapping incident.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I can't accept deleting an article based on a claim of "<i>excessive detail</i>". Who is to say what is excessive and what is not? The material was spun out from the main article, and while I'm not opposed to merging it back, I see no point in reducing our coverage of this event. Furthermore, what kind of argument is it to say that there are better sources available elsewhere? In that case, why should we bother working on articles in the first place since there are great pages, fan sites, official sites etc. for just about everything. Or to put it another way, maybe we should devise a template that blanks pages and provides a link to the better sources available on the internet. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:19, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I see nothing at all wrong with that argument. If it has been done better elsewhere, where is the crime in redirecting people to another site. There is no reason information must be physically stored in one bank of servers. The only reason I can think of for wanting to keep information on Wikipedia's servers is because of the dreaded 404 Not Found error when an external link goes down. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">â¯</font></a> 02:47, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

Why not just link directly to that site, since god knows we will never do it better than the people condemned to worship that egg 365 days a year?

<li>The problem with that is that having such a large amount of information for one storm makes it extremely difficult to manage and improve the article. As Jdorje said, this information is already available somewhere else in Wikipedia, and to have detail to the amount you're indicating, it should be added to Wikisource instead of here. Katrina may be a remarkable storm due to its impact, but the majority of the editors who actually <i>maintain</i> this article want it gone, as it is completely redundant. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_edit_counters_Flcelloguy%27s_Tool_0e9a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject edit counters/Flcelloguy's Tool">help us</a>)</sup> 04:36, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. So it's boring, so what? It is just a number, but it has various mathematical properties associated with it. One thing my education taught me about math is that it's too complicated for me to understand. There's probably a lot you could write about this single number. People complain about how you could go on writing about numbers forever, since they're infinite. That's obviously true, but I'm not going to complain if that means we end up with millions, billions, or even trillions of number articles. Bring 'em on. To me this is like a guy who inherits a big pile of money and complains: "That's too much, I can never count all that..." A little wisdom tells you it's nonsense to worry about such things. Also, a number could potentially fall into an automatically notable category, like natural species in biology, natural languages, planets, stars, that kind of thing: just by existing it has some notability attached to it, since it's automatically going to have some scientific significance. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:45, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Every species, language, planet, and star on Wikipedia has already been written about elsewhere; otherwise we wouldn't know about it. Nobody has written anything about 3055. You propose that we could make up stuff to write about 3055; that's called <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

<li>I don't think anything that is patently provable using the laws of mathematics can be considered "original research". Mathematics is really an entirely different realm than the rest of the encyclopedia because in mathematics things can be and are proven 100%. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#0055AA">Cyde&#160;Weys</font></a></b> 08:12, 19 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To the contrary, the history of mathematics is full of incorrect proofs and assertions; now, even after a theorem is proven, often it is not accepted without reservation. Whether a mathematical statement is "really" true or not, Wikipedia requires verification of its proof. Now, I am aware that in practice, mathematics pages contain some trivial original research, especially number articles, and we tend to look the other way. But an entire article filled with the stuff, and using it as a justification to exist, is completely and absolutely unacceptable. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 08:41, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I seen Cashville Records website and looked at it clearly. I believe that it's possible for it to true, but there is no official word from Interscope Records. Interscope has the say in that matter. To me, personally, it looks like a fan site devoted to Young Buck. The B.G. is in talks with G-Unit, but not a signed member of the group or an artist established to any label other than Chopper City Records, his own established label. I doubt B.G. would be a part of any label after Cash Money cheated him out of money. Not saying G-Unit would, but it's more likely he wouldn't. <a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELILVOKA_f991.html" title="User:LILVOKA">LILVOKA</a>.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Right now I'm listening to a song called "Straight out of Ca$hville" released on Cashville records, by Young Buck, Ludacris, and the Game. If that's not notable (the 3 arguably hottest currently producing names in hip-hop) then I don't know what is. Young Buck is a rap star. Not just an average rapper, but a star. His label, therefore is also notable. Also, it's a derivative from G-Unit/Interscope Records, what anyone would consider a highly notable group. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">â</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/18px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 22:17, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> Non-notable as it may seem to you, it is a VERY notable parser - possibly the best, most flexible etc. I started this article when I tried to find out more about GOLD and was surprised to find no article about it. Just because people aren't contributing to the article doesn't mean it's non-notable. It is notable. Because it's not commercial it doesn't have a strong marketing arm to make people more aware of it I guess. To those of you who are voting on the AFD, please don't just say "delete" because you haven't heard of GOLD. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Donama</a> 11:50, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> SWATJester has made it readily obvious he does not take this to be serious subject matter. FCYTravis has also made many uninformed allegations against this article; He confuses North and South Dakota and is apparently unaware of the fact that the University of North Dakota has no accredited journalism department and the campus newspaper is about as focused on Minot happenings as the Chicago Tribune is on Milwaukee. --<b><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwcovington_2ca2.html" title="User:Alexwcovington"><font style="background:#000088;" color="#FFFF88">AlexWCovington</font></a></b> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexwcovington_ddca.html" title="User talk:Alexwcovington">talk</a>) 22:40, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Swatjester made one comment which he noted was a joke, given that and you claim that bias was expressed by "editors" plural, I have trouble seeing that. Your other comments, i.e. not being aware of the nature of the local newspaper and confusing N and S hardly constitute evidence of bias.

<li>My claim that the article should remain based upon the fact that artists on the label have completed national tours in the United States has yet to be disputed. I would also maintain that This Could Work Records <i>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city</i>, as Minot, North Dakota has no other indie/punk record labels. --<b><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwcovington_2ca2.html" title="User:Alexwcovington"><font style="background:#000088;" color="#FFFF88">AlexWCovington</font></a></b> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexwcovington_ddca.html" title="User talk:Alexwcovington">talk</a>) 23:52, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>That policy is a bit strict. What if a writer didn't have an audience of 5,000? We just leave them out and call them "unimportant"?

<p>This topic is informative, and I actually didn't know some of these things until I read this article. It's informative, and it varifies certain information. That's what Wikipedia is supposed to do right? From what I can tell, its in threat of being deleted because not enough people look at it. Have you even given it time? Or a chance? You can't expect people to linch onto something in five minutes. People might want this in the future. Don't delete. - Maki</p>

<p>is very informative, because i've read the article and I see that this writer Mika has quite potential to become a good artist. I think this shouldn't be deleted because if more people find this article and see the works of Mika then she could grow out to quite a succes. Give Mika a chance, im sure she will get more viewers and that this article will grow out with importantence. -[Z0diac]</p>

<p>Because I'm as impatient as hell, I have e-mailed Wikipedia about the deletion of this article. They claim that the descision to delete it is not determined by requests but by the editing comity, so are any of you from the eidting comity? The e-mail says <i>"Wikipedia is a collaborative encyclopaedia written by its readers. The</i> subjects for our articles are chosen by the editing community rather than by request." <i>Meaning that if anything we should wait for the eidting community to stop by here. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mika Feldy (<a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMika_Feldy_38f7.html" title="User talk:Mika Feldy">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mika_Feldy_283f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mika Feldy">contribs</a>).</small></i></p>

<dd>Be aware that the choice to delete is not based on any judgement on the quality of your work. Rather, it is the intent of Wikipedia to document well-known people, not provide exposure for those who wish to become well-known. The policy is described in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Postings by people attempting to publicize themselves are generally subject to heavy scrutiny, but if someone else had created this article I doubt the response would be any different. By the way, you can sign your comments by adding four tilde's (~~~~) at the end of your post. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 01:12, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unverified stub about a supposed Filipino movie director (ie, directing Filipino movies, not that he is Filipino - there's no way of telling that, as he is unverifiable). There is a Filipino actor called <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Barri_2036.html" title="Mario Barri">Mario Barri</a>, who should have an article yet doesn't. Unfortunately, there's no way of telling if telling for sure that this refers to the same person, and I don't think guesswork is appropriate. I'm noting that this article is for a director, and Mario Barri (with no T) was an actor, which also weighs against this being the same guy. Anyway, back on track. This fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which is the bare minimum requirement for any article. Ergo, <b>delete</b>. Please note that this AfD in no way implies that non-Western 1950s pop culture people are any less (or more) notable than their Western counterparts, because God knows that's always the first accusation when you try and AfD an unverifiable and ugly hellpit of redlinks. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">Proto</font></span></span></a><font color="#555555"><b>||</b></font><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">type</font></span></span></a></small> 14:07, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Whatever the AfD nominator may say, the consequences of this campaign is to exclude large swathes of non-Western popular culture from Wikipedia by the moral equivalent of Wikilawyering -- and the same standard hasn't been applied retroactively to recent Western popular cultrue articles.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Mario Barri is a well known filipino actor and director. One of his claims to fame being that he gave <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fernando_Poe%2C_Jr._f9c6.html" title="Fernando Poe, Jr.">Fernando Poe, Jr.</a> his first big break. All of his films are verifiable on the net. For example here where he is clearly listed as director. <a href="http://eofftv.com/a/ana/anak_ng_kidlat_main.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://eofftv.com/a/ana/anak_ng_kidlat_main.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Of course, this demands some effort and knowledge, because Manila is not Hollywood. On a side note, I see the same articles nominated, prodded, then renominated. Once again, I say there is no reason to destroy our incipient coverage of the Filipino film industry. The denigration of other cultures needs to stop. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:17, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The list of movies attributed to Mario T Barri in this article does not seem to correspond at all with the list of movies attributed to Mario Barri on IMDB. Like I said... there just seem to be some issues here that have yet to be addressed. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 01:52, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>. It's quite strange. Most of the movies listed in the article appear nowhere on IMDB. The ones that do don't mention Barri, but they are largely devoid of credits. "Anak ni Palaris" (Anak ng Palaris in imdb) doesn't mention Barri, but does mention Fernando Poe. Other film names appear to be spelled wrong ("Song of Sto. Thomas"). It looks like somebody made an article about a legitimate figure with a lot of questionable or downright false information. Can it be <b>kept and throughly re-edited</b> by somebody who actually knows about this person's career? <a href="../../../c/f/o/User%7ECfortunato_1679.html" title="User:Cfortunato">Carlo</a> 02:04, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>A usage guide, or slang and idiom guide. Wikipedia is not in the business of saying how words, idioms, etc., should be used. We aren't teaching people how to talk like a Cockney chimney-sweep. However, it may be important in the context of an encyclopedia article to describe just how a word is used in order to distinguish among similar, easily confused ideas, as in nation or freedom. In some special cases an article about an essential piece of slang may be appropriate. For a wiki that is a dictionary, visit our sister project <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a>.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The list currently has approximately 1462 entries with new words being added every day. Of those, only about 108 <s>(0.7%)</s> (7.6%) are sourced, mostly from a few old slang dictionaries and one unreferenced website. This article is inherently unverifiable, because it includes contemporary street slang and foreign words that are not included in any reliable sources, With no modern sources available it is impossible to be sure that the descriptions of usage are correct and NPOV. Many, if not most, entries are derived from original research, and some are possibly made-up by users, or at least neologisms. So it irredeemably violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<p><b>Keep</b> Though proper citation may be difficult, the article should be kept. Fans of linguistics/etymology will probably agree. Some of these words are not even offensive/used any more("Tojo", "3/5er"), but the history of how and why they came into use is still important/interesting. If the article is deleted, consider moving these historical entries someplace else or creating new entries for them. Also, how important are credible sources for <i>slang</i>, the origins of which cannot always be easily traced? --Soulburglar 05:24, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> I have been working on this article for months, adding citations from printed dictionaries because Will Beback asked me to. Right now, there are about 115 citations in the article, and that number is growing rapidly.
<p>This list is a remarkable work, comprising over 1400 entries written since June 2003. Deleting them will do more harm than good, possibly creating hundreds of disgruntled vandals and sowing ill will throughout the world. It would also be deleting possibly the most comprehensive and up-to-date list of ethnic slurs available. Further, it sets a bad precedent, threatening to change Wikipedia from the largest encyclopedia ever written into one of the smallest. The current insistence on verifiability was instituted <i>after</i> many of these definitions were written. This discourages others from writing articles in the future for fear that a future policy will result in their contributions being deleted.</p>
<p>If anyone here thinks the list should be in Wiktionary, they should move it there before nominating it for deletion. I would be much less reluctant to support this deletion if these entries were in Wiktionary, formatted (theirs is much more complex than our own), and accepted by the prudish administrators there. I certainly donât mind that it is on Wikipedia right now, though, because Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. The word <i>encyclopedia</i> comes from the Greek words <i>enkyklios paideia,</i> meaning "general education," or "well-rounded education." In a general reference book with almost no size constraints, almost anything can be included. <i>Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged</i> defines an encyclopedia as "a work that treats comprehensively all the various branches of knowledge and that is usually composed of individual articles arranged alphabetically". Stroll by a library reference section and you will find encyclopedias of agriculture, of computing, of bullfighting, and so on. Another example I always like to give is the <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Enciclopedia_universal_ilustrada_europeo-americana.html" title="Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana">Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana</a></i>. It contains embedded French, Italian, English, German, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese.html" title="Portuguese">Portuguese</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalan.html" title="Catalan">Catalan</a>, and <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> dictionaries. At 119 volumes, it is almost as large as Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I also want to say that I enjoy reading and editing this list because I find the strange <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/idiom" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:idiom">idiomatic</a> expressions in it to be fascinating. English slang is one of the most unusual things in the world. I think that the social effects of a list of words can be easily overemphasized, as these simply show others the degree to which racism exists, rather than encourage it. Deleting articles such as these really helps hide the problem, which could make it worse.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 07:15, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Reply.</b> I have <i>six</i> printed slang dictionaries at my house that I checked out from a library, so trust me when I say that the vast majority (about 75%) is verifiable. I also have access to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (OED) and <i>Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> My apologies, I merely copied and pasted the percentage; I'll round you up to 8% and that still isn't very good. The list has no reliability as a whole at present, and whatever value it gains will be the result of your admirable efforts. It just doesn't belong here, and that has nothing to do with "social effects" and everything to do with policy.

Also, those keenest to retain it may note that it is GFDLed, so they may take it wherever they wish. Yes indeed it's an extension of WP's coverage of racism, etc, etc., as claimed above; and in a similar way that a list of, say, Hebrew words glossed in English would be an extension of WP's coverage of Hebrew -- which would not make the list encyclopedic. And what about <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offensive_terms_per_nationality.html" title="Offensive terms per nationality">Offensive terms per nationality</a> etc etc, we are asked. They too are not encyclopedic (just as Flattering terms per nationality would not be encyclopedic). Dictionary entries aren't encyclopedic, and congeries (or thematic lists) of dictionary entries aren't encyclopedic. As for the notion that if this is deleted it will surely reoccur; well, that argument could be used to justify inaction in the face of all sorts of behavior on WP: spamming, the insertion of untruths, vandalism, etc. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:29, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I listed this for proposed deletion, but the author has tried to assert notability. However, being one of 800 museums in the US accredited doesn't notable make. I'd argue that if this museum gets an article, we'd have to go back over hundreds of other similar subjects who have had their pages deleted. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harr</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">o</font></a><b><a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarro5_1808.html" title="User talk:Harro5">5</a></b> 05:44, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After proposed deletion was challenged, I have begun an AfD. This article is a one line stub on a character in a book, but neither the book nor its author has a Wikipedia entry. This suggests no notability. I'd question whether a character needs an article if all it states is that the character was in a book. Imagine how many characters there have been in books.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I'm speedying... for a few reasons... firstly... it's forked content from Aisha that only is showing one side. It's also from a troller (See adding "dog" to Korean Cuisine and "Wikiproject:No Israel"). It doesn't cover orientation so much... I mean... he married Khadija and, it'd need discussion of that to be a good article... but, just because it's content copy from a troller I am deleting... Note, that it's possible there could be decently done work on this maybe... but, this is not that and it's not fit for cleanup since it's forked and ignores previous debates over at <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">ã°ã¬ã³</a> 06:05, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I tend to agree, and I apologize for using the term first. I certainly don't agree with Haikupoet's broad construction of the term. There is room for dissent in science, and even in math; civility aside, I don't use the word "crank" just for thought that differs from expert consensus. It's when they claim to have discovered simple mistakes in the established theory that, somehow, everyone else has just missed, that I think the "c" word is accurate. Whether it's good judgment to <i>use</i> it is a separate question. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 05:05, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The two aren't always mutually exclusive. &#160;:-) At any rate, I don't think that anyone here <i>meant</i> to be insulting or uncivil. <a href="../../../d/b/t/User%7EDbtfz_4176.html" title="User:Dbtfz"><font color="maroon">dbtfz</font></a><a href="../../../d/b/t/User_talk%7EDbtfz_3ffd.html" title="User talk:Dbtfz"><sup><font color="slategray">talk</font></sup></a> 05:17, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>So just because <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> applies only to Wikipedians, it means that it's okay to be uncivil toward others? â<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_V_35de.html" title="User:Larry V">Larry V</a> <small>(<a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarry_V_df0b.html" title="User talk:Larry V">talk</a>)</small> 22:11, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>If it is borderline uncivil and relevant yes. In this case, "crank" is a useful classification term. Do you have a prefered, more polite term? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:30, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Before we make a judgment about this issue -and any other similar issue- we should be aware that throughout human history, many of our systems have not been correct. The systems through which humankind validates its science today are definitely far from being efficient. This sort of incorrectness led humanity to the Dark Ages before. We should begin to notice that Science is being taken to a sort of Dark Age in which it is becoming increasingly difficult to question the consensus. In present time, someone who actually challenges the consensus is never taken seriously. We also should be aware that through history; the consensus has held incorrect theories/conceptions as valid/correct for long periods of time (for instance Geocentrism and Creationism). There are several similarities between the way we treated new ideas and people during the Dark Ages and the way we treat them in the present time:
<ul>
<li>The inquisition condemned lots of people because their ideas differed from the expert consensus. In other words; their ideas differed from the church's opinion; so the church called them, not cranks, but heretics. Today, scientists whose ideas differ from the consensus rarely get published by peer reviewed journals.</li>
<li>It was not really relevant to the condemnation of someone that he was right or wrong about something. It was only relevant that his ideas werenât conflicting with the consensus, and that the ecclesiastical authorities accepted his ideas.</li>
<li>To judge others, a person had to be part of the church. Today, to be a "notable scholar", a scientist has to agree with the consensus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Does anyone think that maybe it would be better deciding to cease the existence of scientists in Wikipedia by judging their work instead of judging them in base of their so called notability? It would be good that a decision like this would be taken by someone who understands the ideas that the author has expressed as clearly as he can in his papers. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiegueins_208b.html" title="User:Diegueins">Diegueins</a> 21:20, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> - no reason for needing a page about this for one specific anime. Does every anime then get a similar article for this? I hope not. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 07:32, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I've repeatedly attempted to include information about the yaoi fandom in the original Trigun article. It is a very important part of what this anime and manga is, and I believed that an original article wouldn't offend people's homophobic little sensibilities. Apparently I was wrong. I also plan to expand this article, so please do not delete it simply because one person does not like Trigun yaoi. Plenty of other people do.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Umm, no homophobia here. It will not be deleted unless other people agree with me on the fact that every anime does not need its own article about a specific type of erotic fan art and fanfic. That is my reason for nomination, not "homophobic little sensibilities".<a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 07:51, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>- Talk about a textbook example of the slippery slope fallacy. Just because there is an article for Trigun yaoi, does not mean that we'll see a flood of articles for anime erotic art. If mine was somehow just an "omg yaoi is hawt" stub or something, I could see deleting it, but this wasn't like that.millyfan 07:57, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
Though I do not see yaoi being canon in Trigun, I don't see why it isn't possible to have a page about it. If it is done in a manner which is unbiased I see no problem in keeping the page up instead of deleting it. Those who find a problem with Trigun yaoi having it's own page, should maybe consider it being allowed to be included in the section for Trigun (though Millyfan has told me that it has been edited out before).</p>
<p>Also, why is this a problem? Star Trek TOS even has it's own page for a certain slash couple (which some consider canon, though that has never been confirmed by Paramount OR Gene Roddenberry).</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I have no problem with it being included in the Trigun article, I just don't feel it warrants its own article. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 08:06, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> per Wickethewok. <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trigun.html" title="Trigun">Trigun</a> is not long enough to require a separate fanfic fork. If fanfic is an important part of the anime's appeal, then it should be included in the main article and you need to work it out with the other editors. I think we generally discourage POV forks unless the main article is too unwieldy to accomodate it. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 08:20, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would gladly merge if the editors for the existing Trigun article didn't delete it every single time I posted anything suggesting anything less than a heteronormative interpretation. They even deleted a reference included to Vash's possibly being bisexual, and I dislike being tagged as a vandal and deleted simply because my opinion is different than that of the other article maintainers. millyfan 23:55, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Dear Readers: Thank you for your interest in this article. We have read every single comment and we're doing all we can to make this article better. The birth year will be added since I did not know it before. The feedback is very, very valuable and we most certainly appreciate it. The comments left by all of you can only aid in making this article much better. As noted for Elite Soiree, its success is attributed to it's founder due to her tenacity and dedication to her work, even at a young age (born 1980; she's 26 by the way), which has garnered her awards, TV opportunities, books and some of the most noted celebrities today. The story of Taylor Lea Thomas is commendable which is why it is written here. Elite Soiree was started without any partners or investors yet she has managed to accomplish the aforementioned on her own. For a woman in business at her age, her accomplishments are therefore notable, as others would agree. It is in no way an advertisement and nothing more than a mere blurb about the company. Rest assured, however, that we will make this article, as well as the others, better and more informative. We therefore kindly request help in doing so since we're inexperienced here on Wikipedia. In time and with your help, we aspire to make this article one that readers enjoy reading. Most importantly, it is not intended as a sales tool or press release and should be understood as such. Again, thank you for the constructive criticism and we most certainly look forward to working with you to make it better in lieu of simply deleting it. Also, we apologize for deleting the previous tag since we were unaware of this discussion page. Thank you for your participation in this matter. Peter Sanders 11:55, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Faarwolf business is noteable, it set off broad controversy across the online gaming world. If you Google Malice Faarwolf you get several hundred hits to pages in at least 3 countries with her identity being "unmasked" and its ramifications to the gaming world. Faarwold as a single search term returns well over 1000 hits.

<dd>Hate to break it to, but <i>the online gaming world</i> is itself pretty non-notable. Just because it's <i>numerous</i> doesn't make it notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Dear Readers: Thank you for your interest in this article. We have read every single comment and we're doing all we can to make this article better. The feedback is very, very valuable and we most certainly appreciate it. The comments left by all of you can only aid in making this article much better. This article on Elite Soiree is mainly to provide readers with the basic info on the company. Elite Soiree's success is attributed to it's founder due to her tenacity and dedication to her work, even at a young age, which has garnered her awards, TV opportunities, books and some of the most noted celebrities today. The story of Taylor Lea Thomas is commendable which is why it is written here. Elite Soiree was started without any partners or investors yet she has managed to accomplish the aforementioned on her own. For a woman in business at her age, her accomplishments are therefore notable, as others would agree. It is in no way an advertisement and nothing more than a mere blurb about the company. Rest assured, however, that we will make this article better and more informative. We therefore kindly request help in doing so since we're inexperienced here on Wikipedia. In time and with your help, we aspire to make this article one that readers enjoy reading. Most importantly, it is not intended as a sales tool and should be understood as such. Again, thank you for the constructive criticism and we most certainly look forward to working with you to make it better in lieu of simply deleting it. Also, we apologize for deleting the previous tag since we were unaware of this discussion page. Thank you for your participation in this matter. <small>(<small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Peter Sanders (<a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_Sanders_4010.html" title="User talk:Peter Sanders">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Peter_Sanders_a60d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Peter Sanders">contribs</a>).</small>)</small></li>

<p><b>Delete.</b> The overriding reason this page should be deleted is because of its massive POV problem. I will argue that this problem is inherent to the topic, "Roman Catholic conservatism". The only purpose this article could possibly serve is to discredit people with whom the author disagrees. It is not a serious encyclopedia entry, and should therefore be deleted.</p>
<p>First, there is a consensus in Catholic circles that political terms like "conservative", "moderate", and "liberal" are inappropriate and not germane to theological questions.</p>
<p>Second, the positions listed as examples of Catholic "conservatism" are very radical, to the point where somebody who believed most of these things probably would belong to a breakaway fringe "Catholic" group rather than subject himself to Rome.</p>
<p>Third, when people think of "conservative" Catholics, they often think of those who simply support the Church's teachings on issues like abortion, birth control, etc. If they came looking for more information to this article on "Roman Catholic conservatism", they would be led to think that those supporers of Church doctrine are much more extreme than they are.</p>
<p>Fourth, some of these are simply disingenuous misrepresentations. Nobody regards Jews as "faithless"; actually, that type of prejudice would be sinful under Catholic teaching! I suspect a lot of these items of "Roman Catholic conservative" ideology were listed and radicalized in order to discredit "Roman Catholic conservatives".</p>
<p>Fifth, equating these outrageously bigoted, non-Catholic, heterodox ideas with perfectly (theologically and morally) acceptable ones like saying the Mass in Latin, emphasizing devotion to Mary and the saints, "justification for war when absolutely necessary", and "abstinence from meat on Fridays", suggests a <i>massive POV problem</i> with this article, and bolsters my suggestion about the authors' motives in the previous point.</p>
<p>Sixth, the idea of "conservatism" implies a tendency to "conserve". In this case, that is precisely the opposite of what this article suggests "Roman Catholic conservatives" want. They supposedly "reject ecumenist policies", "totally avoid interfaith theological dialogue", "deny that Anglicans and Protestants are Christians", demonstrate "no respect for non-Catholics", believe "salvation is for Catholics only", emphasize Tradition <i>over and against</i> Scripture, "avoid handshaking and body prayer" (whatever <i>that</i> is), and believe that sex is for "reproduction only, not pleasure". These positions are <i>contrary</i> to the constant teaching of the Church. They can't be characterized as "conservative" in any meaningful sense.</p>
<p>If this article is about people so radical that they couldn't reasonably be called "Catholic" or "conservative", then I wonder what the purpose of this article is -- other than to discredit both Catholics and conservatives. This is a poor excuse for an encyclopedia entry, and I urge deletion. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyphen5_402f.html" title="User:Hyphen5">Hyphen5</a> 11:21, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, my point is that this article is intellectually unserious. <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditionalist_Catholic_36a0.html" title="Traditionalist Catholic">Traditionalist Catholic</a> is a good faith attempt to document a real phenomenon. <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_conservatism_cc2b.html" title="Roman Catholic conservatism">Roman Catholic conservatism</a> is not, and so I wouldn't necessarily want to fill that article with this one's garbage. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyphen5_402f.html" title="User:Hyphen5">Hyphen5</a> 21:01, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>That may well be so, but this is about process.

If we merge the list there, and then you delete everything you think is wrong, they will see it and possibly object.

<dd>"Terceiro se(c)tor" or "third sector" is a term used for "civil society" (e.g. the set of non-profit/non-governmental organizations) in Portuguese.

I would suggest merge into <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_society.html" title="Civil society">civil society</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. OR, and not very good. I think there's an attempt at a Greek protologism, though my Greek is awfully rusty. Here's a partial, based on a web translation, so you can get the general idea: <i>CONTENT: I search the Greek language and other languages, ancient and new and I have led to the conclusion that I found the end of mystery that is called PROTOLANGUAGE</i> ("Î Î¡Î©Î¤ÎÎÎÎ©Î£Î£Î" or "PROTOGLOSSA")<i>. I found that the letters, each one, have their own significance, no matter in whatever language they are used. In all the languages, the letters that have the same accent, have also the same meaning and significance. Whatever the place of letters in the word, their meaning does not change. In all languages, words with the same letters, have the same meaning.</i> It doesn't get any better after that. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 16:05, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> First of all, you're right, it's horribly titled. But I think it's just a minor symptom of a problem with how the whole subject is organized, or rather, not organized. As with so many complex topics, different articles have been created and updated at different times by different people, and the choice of what to put where ends up looking kind of random. Just based on a quick glance through the various links from <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transexuality.html" title="Transexuality">transexuality</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">transgender</a>, information ends up all over the place. On the specific topic of surgery, there's a non-specific article on sexual reassignment surgery, and separate articles for M-to-F and F-to-M, concentrating on genital surgery. For M-to-F, there's another article on facial feminization, then this one, which is basically "other" (breasts, trachea, voice). Deleting this article won't help with the overall need to organize the topic. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 15:38, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Carlos Blanco was very famous in Spain between 1998 and 2000 as a child prodigy who could read Egyptian hieroglyphs and Arabic, aside from different ancient languages. He was appointed lecturer at the Egyptian Museum of Barcelona when he was 12, in 1998, and he got a "matrÃ­cula de honor" (highest grade) in Egyptian language at the Spanish Association of Egyptology in 1998. He then got a scholarship and went for one year to Westminster School, London, and later to the University of Navarra. All data are true, basically taken from his web page, but it is not difficult to check the data revising what newspapers like "El Mundo" (one of the most important ones in Spain) told of him in 1998: * El Mundo, 17-V-1998, Madrid, 24: "Un niÃ±o de 12 aÃ±os de Coslada, el egiptÃ³logo mÃ¡s joven de Europa". You can see this in <a href="http://www.arrakis.es/~seha/1998.htm#MY" class="external free" title="http://www.arrakis.es/~seha/1998.htm#MY" rel="nofollow">http://www.arrakis.es/~seha/1998.htm#MY</a> with the headlines of 1998, 17th May. And you can check that he had his own section in "CrÃ³nicas Marcianas", the magazine with the highest share in Spain by then, in different webpages or writing to the Spanish channel (Telecinco) where it was emitted when he was collaborating (1999 and 2000). You can also check that he is a member of the International Association of Egyptologists: Blanco PÃ©rez, Carlos Alberto (see web page <a href="http://www.iae.lmu.de/" class="external free" title="http://www.iae.lmu.de/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iae.lmu.de/</a>) So, I see no reason to delete the page, because it gives information on a person who has objectively been well known in his country as a child prodigy and a "superdotado". <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 159.237.12.82 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_159.237.12.82_8579.html" title="Special:Contributions/159.237.12.82">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Mangojuice just asked me (I'm a native speaker). The kid seems to have bona fide credentials; he is listed as a member of the Egyptology Association, there is indeed an Oriental Institute at the U of Chicago, and and I have no reason to doubt that El Mundo's headline is right too (I tried to check in the newspaper's online archives but it was not webbified in 1998). A lot of information is confirmed by a recent (Feb 2006) blog interview on an independent online newspaper (<a href="http://blogs.periodistadigital.com/diarioindependientedigital.php/2006/02/28/carlos_blanco_lel_mundo_necesita_de_gran" class="external text" title="http://blogs.periodistadigital.com/diarioindependientedigital.php/2006/02/28/carlos_blanco_lel_mundo_necesita_de_gran" rel="nofollow">Periodista Digital</a>), where Blanco also speaks of current affairs. It certainly doesn't look like a hoax or an exaggeration. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<dd>Thanks, Pablo-flores. Given this, my opinion is this page should still be <b>userfied and deleted</b> but <b>without prejudice</b>: I feel this article could be recreated at any time by anyone else, as long as it includes verifiable information. <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> is my only problem with this article.

As Pablo Flores (a native speaker) has said, there are good credentials and information seems to be true. It would be interesting to write to the channel "Telecinco" to see if Carlos Blanco worked in "CrÃ³nicas Marcianas" as a "superdotado" (gifted child) when he was so young, because if it is true, then he was really famous in Spain because of his intelligence and it would be interesting to have an article on him in the English Wikipedia. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 159.237.12.82 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_159.237.12.82_8579.html" title="Special:Contributions/159.237.12.82">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I have to agree with <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> here. According to the article the song won some kind of MTV award. Why on earth if a song is that prominent would we want to delete, let alone going so far as to protect the page? I have to wonder if this is not some kind of prudishness at work since many of the South Park songs have articles here and if South Park is not your bag we also have a ton of articles on songs from musicals at <a href="../../../s/o/n/Category%7ESongs_from_musicals_a541.html" title="Category:Songs from musicals">category:Songs from musicals</a>.

<li><b>Comment.</b> For the record, I think that this song is funny, and I really enjoy South Park, but I don't think that this song needs its own article, even if it did win some MTV award.

<li>Well it's OK to be prudent I guess and my remarks were not addressed to you per se.

<li><b>Comment</b>, Scotty Doesn't Know is certainly a well known song and important part of the movie Eurotrip.

It is also perhaps their most famous song, at least according to the band page. The notability is, in my opinion, beyond question. However, the question arises as to whether there is enough content to justify an article independent from Lustra and Eurotrip. Still, I repeat, this song is <i>absolutely notable, period</i>. If the article is expanded a bit, I'll vote super ultra strong keep, but I can't do that until the content is a wee bit better. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool3_2ec0.html" title="User:Cool3">Cool3</a> 21:20, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Hi, i'm afraid i don't understand your vandalise argument, as for who has the longest 'scholong' it may not be definitive but it is the best record maintained all information is factual though. By the way whilst you posted the notice i was unable to save the changes which were quite substantial, i was wondering if there would be anyway of getting them back?</li>

<li>Fundamentally false analogies, much worse than the one provided by Graham above. The example of the term being used in a recent book establishes enough notability for there to be <b>one</b> article on the matter (as opposed to none whatsoever), not for there to be <b>two</b>. The concept/word "bright" is to the movement "Bright" as the concept/word "Christianity" is to the movement "Christianity". Arguing that "bright" is to "Bright" as "Christianity" is to "Jesus" is patently absurd, both in the figurative and literal sense. In the literal sense, Bright is not a person. In the figurative sense, Bright and bright are not clearly-distinct (they're only distinguished by a technicality) nor clearly-noteworthy (both are very borderline). Your examples are rhetoric, not reason. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 02:29, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

And, ummm, the correct analogy is: bright is to bright (movement) as Christianity is to organisations that promote Christianity (e.g. churches of various types, missionary organisations etc.). So if you insist on being positively Talmudic, I'll rephrase: "<b>Keep</b> Obviously.

Rather than keep <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a> as it is, in it's confusing state as to what "bright" really describes, we should rename the current "Bright" article to become a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Bright (philosophy)">bright (philosophy)</a> and make <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a> a disambiguation. At that instance, it would compromise by ensuring an article about both the movement and actual philosophy, but still be able to differentiate between it and other forms of bright. I think Silence makes a pretty good justification why the word "bright" needs to be the front disambiguation page below. Would there be any objections to this? <a href="../../../o/s/c/User%7EOscabat_962c.html" title="User:Oscabat">Oscabat</a> 03:58, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Replace with a disambiguation page</b>: <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Bright (disambiguation)">Bright (disambiguation)</a> should be moved to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">Bright</a> because there are so many potential pages someone could be looking for by searching for "Bright", and none of them are clearly noteworthy enough to merit being the "main page" for the word (the only real candidate, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brightness.html" title="Brightness">brightness</a>, is already at a different page, so just moving the disambig page to the default is what will probably benefit the vast majority of readers the most). In lieu of that, <b>strong delete and merge</b> into <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright_movement.html" title="Bright movement">bright movement</a>. The <i>concept</i> of bright is not noteworthy because it's a neologism (no appearance in any established dictionaries, and barely any in reputable news organizations or publications) synonym of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturalism_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Naturalism (philosophy)">philosophical naturalism</a>; at best, it merits a subsection or paragraph of the aforementioned more established term. The <i>movement</i> or <i>organization</i> of Brights, however, which is pretty much solely responsible for propagating the usage of "bright" as a self-identification, is noteworthy. The admin who closes this vote should keep in mind that most, if not all, of the users supporting the division between the movement "Bright" and the concept "bright" are self-identified brights themselves. A split like this would be a kin to atheists splitting the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a> article into one for the "lack-of-theism" definition and another for the "rejection/denial-of-theism" definition, rather than doing what they should (and are) and treating the topic in a single article. And atheism is much more noteworthy (and complex, spanning dozens of pages) than bright (which is only a page or two long, even merged), so a split is even less justified for this concept/movement (and the distinction between the two isn't always obvious) than it would be for <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a>. (Note that the previous example was not meant to suggest that atheists are brights, or even vice versa; it was just an example.) Having two articles in this case is <b>beyond</b> unacceptable: it's an example of Wikipedia's corrosive systemic bias towards recent subcultures with a significant Internet base. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 02:15, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you can cite a respectable source that says that in the source's opinion <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a> is just a synonym for <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturalism_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Naturalism (philosophy)">naturalism (philosophy)</a>, then please add that interesting snippet to one or both articles. You say <i>"there are so many potential pages someone could be looking for by searching for "Bright", and none of them are clearly noteworthy enough to merit being the "main page" for the word"</i>. Frankly, that's just wishful thinking on your part. No serious user of an encyclopaedia looks up things they already know about, (such as bright in the sense of "light" or "clever"). People use an encyclopaedia to look things up that they haven't come across before. Some very influential thinkers, such as Daniel Dennett, Stephen Pinker, Richard Dawkins have taken recently to using the word "bright" in this sense, and it is extremely likely that people, when they come accross this unfamiliar term, will come to wikipedia to look it up. I've asked on <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBrights_movement_a254.html" title="Talk:Brights movement">Talk:brights movement</a> for suggestions of realistic scenarios where a serious user of this encyclopaedia would type "bright" into the search box, when they were looking for an article about anything other than the philosophical outlook (or the band). Nobody's been able to come up with even one. I also asked for an example of an occasion when it would be useful or appropriate to wikify the word "bright" to link to anywhere other than the article about the philosophical outlook (or the band). Again, nobody's come up with even one. Sorry if it doesn't suit your agenda, but what you are saying is just plain wrong. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahamN_e872.html" title="User:GrahamN">GrahamN</a> 05:36, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>This page is pretty redundant, considering that it is a pretty big breach from protocol (as I understand it) to have a second page discussing the plot of a movie while a first page discusses other aspects. While it's a good summary, it's a bit long and intensive for an encyclopedia. I understand why it was made a separate article, because its inclusion in the main article would make the it far too long.

<p><b>Delete</b> Since I nominated the page for deletion, I feel obliged to explain my thinking. The person is listed with three claims to notoriety. 1. Being an author of an exploration book. 2. (As stated on the original page) Being important in founding Rolls-Royce. 3. Being the cousin of <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnes_Mary_Clerke_87db.html" title="Agnes Mary Clerke">Agnes Mary Clerke</a>.</p>
<p>On the first point. A google search gives a very small number of hits of the book written by a person of this name. The listing on Amazon comes for a review written by a person claiming to be his nephew Hugh Deasy</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00086AKJ2/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/102-1816042-8112154?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00086AKJ2/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/102-1816042-8112154?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00086AKJ2/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/102-1816042-8112154?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155</a></p>
<p>As can be seen from the listing, there are no copies in print &amp; no sales listed, and it is not available as <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolfcam_2c26.html" title="User:Golfcam">User:Golfcam</a> claims. It only has the review, the contents of which is:-</p>
<p>"A Google search for Hugh Deasy throws up me or Henry Hugh. So we are the only two famous people rejoicing in this combination of names. My own book, "Grannies and Time Machines", has a totally different subject matter."</p>
<p>An antique book seller is also listed on Yahoo as having a copy:-</p>
<p><a href="http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~kaivalya/deasy.htm" class="external free" title="http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~kaivalya/deasy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~kaivalya/deasy.htm</a></p>
<p>This doen't really seem to fit the wikipedia guidelines on authors. Also the reference by <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolfcam_2c26.html" title="User:Golfcam">User:Golfcam</a> above to <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Younghusband_6945.html" title="Francis Younghusband">Francis Younghusband</a>'s invasion of Tibet can be ignored. The book was published in 1901, the invasion of Tibet was in 1903.</p>
<p>On the second point. A person of this name formed a motor company in 1906 called the Deasy Motor Company, but this person had servered all ties with the company by 1909, which was when John Siddeley joined the company (changing the name to <a href="../../../s/i/d/Siddeley-Deasy_de83.html" title="Siddeley-Deasy">Siddeley-Deasy</a>), therefore the later success of this company cannot be in any way attributed to Henry Deasy. The only point that indicates that these where the same person is the desciption of Henry Deasy on <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Davenport_Siddeley_1f69.html" title="John Davenport Siddeley">John Davenport Siddeley</a>'s autobiography on the Rolls-Royce web site (link below) i.e. "A company founded by former Cavalry Officer &amp; Explorer, Henry Deasy".</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rolls-royce.com/history/heritage/offices/coventry_evo1.jsp" class="external free" title="http://www.rolls-royce.com/history/heritage/offices/coventry_evo1.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.rolls-royce.com/history/heritage/offices/coventry_evo1.jsp</a></p>
<p>Again this doesn't seem to fit any description of real notoriety.</p>
<p>On the third point of being the cousin of Agnes Clerke. Being somebody's cousin has no relervance here. Furhter to this, there is no evidence on any site about this women (who is well documented) that she was related to this person.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Pedant_f853.html" title="User:The Pedant">The Pedant</a> 09:01, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> There are many articles that contain bickering, but that doesn't make it a reason for its deletion. The article is edited by more then Juggalos, i.e. Pahsons, thus is why there is bickering as the subject of Juggalo is obviously controveral. Not to mention there is in fact a social impact from Juggalos as politicians and people have put blame upon Juggalos and their music to juvenile delinquency and other social problems. Also Juggalos span all the way from America to palces such as Europe and Australia, thus I feel it's international notability is reason for it to be worthy of encyclopedia entry. Even sub-cultures such as punk and goth have an article, which are music group breed as well.

I agree that the page needs substantial revisions - there are several sections here that would fit well into one or more separate articles about engineering. This particular article should be rewritten to better focus on the EUS itself. <a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a> 03:17, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>If this were just about a typical student society, I might tend to agree with that assertion. And, to be fair, the article (in its current form) does little to establish a "reason to care". What is needed is a rewrite to focus on the aspects of the EUS that ARE noteworthy to readers outside of the UBC community. I think it is fair to say that the UBC EUS has established a certain international notoriety for itself over the years. Successfully planning, coordinating, and executing schemes to hijack the Rose Bowl trophy and hang Volkswagen Beetles from numerous locations including the Lions Gate Bridge (Vancouver) and the Golden Gate Bridge is, I think, worthy of an article. <a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a> 05:41, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article may require upgrading, but EUS is a big part of UBC, and UBC is an important university in Canada. EUS is fairly large and remains influential in many UBC matters. Deleting the article would neglect the importance of student organizations.Shambles</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It is one of the largest and influential societies, that has done stunts that are as notable worldwide at their time as an internet meme is now. Being one of the largest Canadian University, with way more students than Harvard, should be able to have its notable and important societies listed on Wikipedia. It's at least as notable as a residence of Harvard. Allowing Harvard Glee Clubs and Residence Halls but not organisations with thousands of members at the major Western Canadian University would show systematic bias, which Wikipedia should avoid. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Dillinger_2c06.html" title="User:Nick Dillinger">Nick Dillinger</a> 07:54, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>You have to keep this game by this point. No question The Game is inane, however it is now an established social grace to admit loss.

<li>I've defended the notability of this article through both of the previous A/VfDs, and on both occasions it was conditional that a lot of the crap be trimmed out of the article. Successive rewrites and re-rewrites have alternately removed and replaced a lot of it, and it's reached a point where there is no chance of ever salvaging it into a sensible article. I fully accept that the above argument is probably a case for cleanup rather than deletion, but a recent RFC attempt got nowhere. I just can't see this ever becoming viable. Right now, the article represents almost everything that is bad about Wikipedia; POV-pushing by both sides, massive piles of cruft flooding the article, chronic unverifiability (the very concept of the article means that a Google Test is meaningless) and breaches of almost any policy you could care to name. <b>Weak Delete</b> (only weak because despite the aforementioned flaws, The Game is a real phenomenon) unless <i>all</i> sides can come up with a solution before this AfD closes; which, sadly, seems increasingly unlikely. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinitawowi_fe97.html" title="User:Kinitawowi">Kinitawowi</a> 11:23, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Let me make this clear: I don't <i>want</i> this article to be deleted. I would like to see this article filled with accurate, authoritative, verifiable information from a better source than a single fanpage somebody made about the Game. The problem is that no such source exists. As has been discussed, the leading source on the internet for information about the Game is precisely this article. As such, it violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and will <i>always</i> continue to do so. Nobody knows who invented The Game; I don't, you don't, and from the anecdote of Mike Codling or whatever his name is, he doesn't either. There is no verifiable rule set; that means that the article is going to be filled with every minor rule variation that can be thought of. <i>That</i>, and that alone, is my reason for voting for deleting it; not because it's non-notable, or even that it's unverifiable, but because it's so unauthoritative that it's always going to be a crap magnet. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinitawowi_fe97.html" title="User:Kinitawowi">Kinitawowi</a> 21:50, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to say <b>keep</b>. If the question is just whether the game exists and is played by enough people to make it significant, then a simple google search for the phrase "I just lost the game" (with quotation marks) reveals how widespread it is. In fact, such a search reveals that by far the most common occurence of that phrase on the internet is in relation to The Game as described in this article. By nature of this game and the way it has spread, it's very unlikely that a 'source' in the usual sense is going to be found. Obviously this game has no historical roots that will be dug up. Even if someone were to step up claiming they invented the game, I very much doubt this would make a difference. Possibly if a prominent journalist wrote a news article about it then perhaps this would qualify, I don't know, but really I would argue that this is one topic that just won't have a 'source'. It is fairly obvious that this article has aided in the spread of The Game. Does that mean it should be removed? Absolutely not! It's irrelevant <i>how</i> it has spread, the point is that it <i>does</i> exist as the phenomenon described in this article. People have claimed that they used this entry as a reference when explaining The Game to others. Isn't that fulfilling its purpose as an encyclopedic entry? If someone asks for an explanation of a phenomenon or entity, pointing them to an encyclopedia entry or suggesting they 'look it up in an encyclopedia' is not an uncommon thing to do. 86.139.10.162 22:18, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

The game exists and it's interesting enough to write about. That said, the article has some dubious information. Until recently it claimed that in Brazil it was called "El Juego", but that's Spanish; in Portuguese it would be "O Jogo". â <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyluciano_4d5d.html" title="User:Andyluciano">Andyluciano</a> 22:27, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

The Game is refered to in a "reliable, published source" and this appears to be all Wikipedia requires as regards verification.

<dd>The ad does mention The Game. The fact it is within a link to Wikipedia is simply a way of telling people (that don't already play) about the rules. According to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> an article "should refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by a reputable publisher".

<li><b>Comment</b>. What about <a href="../../../u/c/s/WP%7EUCS_6cee.html" title="WP:UCS">WP:UCS</a>? We've lost track of Wikipedia's ultimate goal, that is, providing information, in favor of guidelines developed to aid in achieving that goal. If nobody's doubting the Game's <i>existence</i>, then obviously 1. There is sufficient evidence that it exists, even though it doesn't fit the common pattern of some single authoritative source we can cite, and 2. Not providing <i>any</i> information about it, even though nobody is doubting said information's truth, would go against Wikipedia's true goal. Now, I understand that verfiability via citation of authoritative sources is a perfectly legitimate guideline <i>most</i> of the time, but obviously this is a special case. For one, I believe that given the circumstances, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22I%27ve+just+lost+the+game%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22I%27ve+just+lost+the+game%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> would be a perfectly acceptable citation. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAceMyth_ce06.html" title="User:AceMyth">AceMyth</a> 04:15, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - it's been nominated for deletion before, and was kept. Why will it be any different this time? There's more evidence to support its existence than before. Granted, Wikipedia may be the singular major source of information on it, but that is perhaps because of The Game's nature to be spread by word of mouth rather than through online means. I feel that IAR applies in this article's case because of common sense. There seems to be consensus among those who DO want the article to exist that the rules are accurate and correct. If the article's contents are, in fact, precise, then why should verifiability be an issue with such a minor article? I could understand verifiability being crucial with more complex topics, but this is much more trivial than the proverbial rocket science. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrabblebrex_f9b5.html" title="User:Brabblebrex">brabblebrex</a> 20:57, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>POV / Neutral</b> Seeing as there seem to be a lot of new people putting their 2Â¢ in (including me), a quick summary:
<ul>
<li>Existance: "The Game" exists, seems to be the general concensus, though some would rather it not.</li>
<li>Accuracy: Is the content of the article correct, or is it (either wholly or in-part) hear-say and/or fabrication? Some of the content, while it may be accurate, reads like fiction or a good idea the author thought up/was told (Example: T-shirts with "The Game" on them), and are unverified by any of the references.</li>
<li>Suitability: This is the main point at issue; How suitable is it as content?
<ul>
<li>Does it meet the criteria of <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">What Wikipedia Is</a> and <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">The 5 Pillars</a>?</li>
<li>Are the sources <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>? (and if so, are they <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>?) This links in tightly to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a>, as it is fallacious to have the Wikipedia article as it's own main source of information. Some feel that while there are external sites with information, they are tenuous. However, from the nature of The Game, it may be impossible to prove the validity of the content.</li>
<li>Is the article written from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral point of view</a>? Is it written representing The Game as either a good or bad thing?</li>
<li>Just because something exists and is widely "known", this in itself may be insuffient if it is Not <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notable</a>. For this we need to address what impact has The Game had as a memes and on other games, plus evidence of that impact.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This whole thing reminds me of one of those sci-fi situations where a person goes back in time to stop some disaster, and once he gets there, he takes some action accidentally causing it himself. He went back in time because the disaster had happened, but then he was the cause of it. If he hadn't gone back in time, it never would have happened. The disaster caused him to go back in time which caused him to accidentally cause the disaster which caused him to go back in time which caused him to accidentally cause the disaster.</li>
<li>We seem to be involved in a similar loop here. Of the 22,000 google hits on "I just lost the game", 13,000 of them also contain the word "wikipedia". People keep looking for sources for this topic. Of course we can't find any decent sources; we ARE the source. This topic became notable because of the wikipedia article, it is notable because of the wikipedia article, and now we must keep the article because the topic is notable. If we deleted the article, likely the topic would stop being notable, but we can't delete it because the topic is notable.</li>
<li>There are two major methods of deciding whether an article should stay, Notability and Reliable sources. Usually they go together, this time they don't. Half the people here are saying that we must keep this because it's notable, the other half that we have to get rid of it because we'll never get a reliable source. Looks like a stalemate.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia, and therefore there is no reason to delete an article that (accurately) describes a meme that is seen by many across the whole world, especially in the UK and USA. The fact that many people have not heard of it does not make it untrue/unreal/false/worthless - thousands of people seek Wikipedia for an explanation to this "game", and as an encyclopedia it is imperative that such an explanation is provided. Deletion of this article defies the entire purpose of Wikipedia, which (as I understand it) is to achieve an encyclopedia providing a detailed source of knowledge encompassing as many parts of existance as possible. The fact that this many newbies care enough to participate is testimony to how important this article is as a reference - does anyone honestly think people would bother to create an account on wikipedia just to vote in one article <i>just because a friend told them to do so</i>? Of course not. The fact that so many newbies have participated is, in my eyes, an indication of what Wikipedia is all about - a source of information to countless anonymous users who want nothing more than a source of reliable information about things that affect them. Do not take that away. <a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjr_xi_bca9.html" title="User:Djr xi"><b>DJR</b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../d/j/r/User_talk%7EDjr_xi_f6e8.html" title="User talk:Djr xi">Talk</a>)</small> 22:04, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I thought about it long and hard, but decided my original decision was wrong. The game is notable yes, and it definitely exists - but we have no sources, it's therefore clearly against policy, and as others have pointed out Wikipedia is fast becoming a primary source for this, which is a bad idea (we delete other games made up in school to stop Wikipedia being used as a platform for spreading memes, which is exactly what is happening here!). With respect to the large number of users voting keep, (and of course welcome to those new to Wikipedia!), many of you do not seem to understand the reasons for deleting - nobody, or almost nobody, is claiming that The Game does not exist, however it is against the policies of this encyclopedia to document as fact something that we cannot back up. Also, as far as I'm aware the fact it has survived before is not grounds by itself to keep the article. <a href="../../../z/o/f/User%7EZoFreX_cfde.html" title="User:ZoFreX">ZoFreX</a> 01:56, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I've been playing the game for about two years and never came across an article online to help explain it. it's really an amazing mind game - the article's part on its effects on the mind is correct. I don't understand why the article would be deleted if it isn't anywhere else on the internet. that doesn't seem fair. as for it not being credible, the article states itself that the origins are unknown and the theory it provides is labled as such- a theory. this article is very helful to send new players too also, just so the know how big it is and how to play, how many lives are affected by it.

<li><b>Comment</b> But <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> which determines sourcing reliability is a guideline, not a rule, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> does say "For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources."

<li><b>Comment</b>. The current version is <i>better</i>, but still has original research. Anything that is not the three rules is, at this point, original research, and even the rules have verifiability problems in the traditional sense. We do not have verification: We have one website that suffers from credibility. We cannot <a href="../../../u/c/s/WP%7EUCS_6cee.html" title="WP:UCS">WP:UCS</a> about this... the goal is not to document fun games or social memes; the goal is to produce an encyclopedia based on verifiable information. â<a href="../../../s/e/q/User%7ESeqsea_4341.html" title="User:Seqsea">Seqsea</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/q/User_talk%7ESeqsea_914c.html" title="User talk:Seqsea">talk</a>) 23:34, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
