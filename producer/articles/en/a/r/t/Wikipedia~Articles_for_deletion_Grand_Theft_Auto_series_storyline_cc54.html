<li><b>Weak Keep if improved</b> The main flaw with this article is an apparent GTA3 onwards bias. If the article was more appropriately named, this wouldn't be a problem.

<li><s><b>Keep and complete rewrite</b>, per LinaMishima. The article has potential and could serve as the "plot and storyline" segment for all <i>GTA</i> games; it just isn't written in a manner that would be considered encyclopedic (list-only passages, in particular), and disregards pre-<i>GTA III</i> games and also <i><a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Theft_Auto_Advance_3abb.html" title="Grand Theft Auto Advance">GTA Advance</a></i>. Also consider fairly good examples such as <a href="../../../s/t/a/StarCraft_storyline_1e90.html" title="StarCraft storyline"><i>StarCraft</i> storyline</a> and <i>Half-Life</i> series storyline. The <i>Half-Life</i> series storyline article in particular was actually spawned from <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Half-Life_2_a32c.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Half-Life 2">FAC comments on <i>Half-Life 2</i></a> that its plot section is far too long for the parent article; thus, to me, a merge to respectable articles is not advisory and a specialized article is a better way to go to avoid needless rewriting in an event any of the <i>GTA</i> articles undergo an FAC nomination. ╫ <b><a href="../../../z/s/_/User%7EZS_3578.html" title="User:ZS">２５</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/_/User_talk%7EZS_8bf1.html" title="User talk:ZS"><font color="green">◀RingADing▶</font></a></sup></b> 10:54, 30 August 2006 (UTC) ╫</s>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per RandyWang. We are <b>not</b> here to help GTA fans, rather, to help the uninitiated understand a particular topic. This article does not achieve that. I find these summaries hard to follow, and yet I've played two of the four games to completion! I honestly think this is far better covered by the paragraph-style summaries on each page. They tell who Ken Rosenberg is, and <i>why</i> Claude was betrayed, without introducing unproven details like Maria being Salvatore's wife. By all means move it to <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:gta" class="extiw" title="wikia:gta">Grand Theft Auto Wiki</a>, but it doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 21:22, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s>You obviously don't know what your talking about because your so called unproven fact has actually been proven. You may be interested to know that both Salvatore and Maria say that there married in Liberty City Stories. All real GTA fans know this. So next time do a little research before you call something unproven. And this is a great article which we should definetly <b>KEEP</b>--<i>Greene01</i></s> user has already voted above, removing personal attacks.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreene01_e593.html" title="User:Greene01">Greene01</a> (<a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGreene01_a538.html" title="User talk:Greene01">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Greene01_6ba1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Greene01">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>I'm talking about proven as in <i>references</i> (either quoting dialogue or even just saying "as revealed in"), rather than it being true or not; it doesn't matter whether it's true, it needs proof and context to back it up. Your response only further reinforces my point: 99% of the 2001 section is drawn solely from GTAIII, but where the wife detail comes from isn't explained, similar to how Claude is called Claude without noting when this name was confirmed. If people who have played one or none of the games are to understand they need to know where the name Claude came from all of a sudden, and why Maria is married when not a word was said about it in GTAIII. Please refer to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> #7: "<b>Plot summaries</b> - ... articles should not act <b>solely</b> as a summary of the plot of a work of fiction, but should offer comprehensive, summarised plots in conjunction with <b>sourced</b> analysis ... within the article, or as part of a series of articles<i>" It doesn't matter</i> how <i>wonderful or popular an article is, if it breaks these rules it goes bye-byes.

<li>As <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProSieben_9868.html" title="User:ProSieben">ProSieben</a> said below. Its unrealistic to have a link to every detail in order to prove them. This could be done but it would take a lengthy amount of time and the article would look ridiculous. I don't see other articles's with a link for every bit of info said. I don't want to get in an argument but what you said is unrealistic. I can assure you that everything in that article is proven fact. Take my word or not. It doesn't bother me. Im just telling you what i know to be true. Im sorry if i came across too offensive but thats just how i feel.--<i>Greene01</i>

<li>alright, the title was changed very early for no particular reason, since then it has been changed back, and has gone over a bit of an overhaul. The reason the <i>timeline</i> was brought to life in the first place, was to sort out all the different references to the different games, within the games. All the GTA games in the GTA III era reference another game, and often it gets confusing. The timeline sorts out, what happened where and when. It's not so much a plot summery as it is a timeline sorting out the very confusing sequence of events.-<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon">Ganfon</a>
<ul>
<li>I am responsible for changing the title. The initial justification for the renaming was that even with the older <i>GTA</i> games' far more simplistic storylines or the lack thereof, it is worth explaining this in brief and associating it with the expanded storyline of the series' later releases, but not by continuality. The next step is simply sectioning the games by <i>canon and game titles</i>, which would have avoided the confusion resulting from intertwined storylines. The present arrangement, however, with a single linear sequence of location and time, is sure to cause overlapping of all the canons and blur the distinction between the later <i>GTA</i> games and the earlier <i>GTA</i> games, while the <i>GTA III</i>-canon-only exclusivity doesn't invite expansion or proper writing.
<p>I understand your interest of providing a timeline of events in the canon, but the current format of the article is just restrictive and narrow in scope, hence my initial recommendation to have the entire article rewritten with a proper encyclopedia format (but with some designs elements based on the current revision). ╫ <b><a href="../../../z/s/_/User%7EZS_3578.html" title="User:ZS">２５</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/_/User_talk%7EZS_8bf1.html" title="User talk:ZS"><font color="green">◀RingADing▶</font></a></sup></b> 09:58, 3 September 2006 (UTC) ╫</p>

<li>I'd like to applogize to all for my bad, and heat of the moment comment I made earlier on this page. To be quite honest i made it in a fit of anger and actually forgot about it, had I remembered I would have taken it off right away. this is truly embarressing for me and <b>WILL NOT</b> happen <b>ever</b> again. Thank you. that being said I still think that the edits that have been made to the page have made it fit it's title and should <b>remain</b> as it's own article. In response to the thought of including the early GTA games, the timeline is of the recent games that are labled under the <i>GTA III Era</i> timeframe. The earlier games do not play in at all to the events described in the timeline, hence why they are not included. Thank you.<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon">Ganfon</a> 14:57, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. RandyWang's justification is valid. Given that the article was created from scratch and is not a result of an article split (otherwise categorizing it as a part of a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_series_3a8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Article series">series of articles</a>) means that it cannot be exempted from the no-plot-summaries criterion in <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">WP:NOT</a>. In addition, the plot summaries in all <i>GTA</i> titles are already sufficient and yet short enough that it doesn't requires any sort of article split.
<p>On the other hand, it has been noticed that substantial amounts of plot summaries were provided in most of the series' character listings; making them hard to track, find and piece together in those pages. It would have been a good idea to move much of these information into a dedicated article, providing easy readability of detailed plot summaries. I have also picked up a long addition in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29_2e74.html" title="Grand Theft Auto (series)"><i>Grand Theft Auto</i> (series)</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29&amp;diff=73202380&amp;oldid=73159663" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29&amp;diff=73202380&amp;oldid=73159663" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> that contains the storyline in the entire series in the form of prose (although it needs work). Merging any of the abovementioned bodies of text into this article would technically categorize it as part of a <i>GTA</i> article series. ╫ <b><a href="../../../z/s/_/User%7EZS_3578.html" title="User:ZS">２５</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/_/User_talk%7EZS_8bf1.html" title="User talk:ZS"><font color="green">◀RingADing▶</font></a></sup></b> 09:58, 3 September 2006 (UTC) ╫</p>

<li><b>Withdraw Vote</b>, the article is a complete mess at this point. And I do agree with the points made above, the summaries on the main pages are sufficient enough. I also think there are better storyline pages on GameFAQs -- if you could, collaborate with the author somehow.<a href="../../../n/s/r/User%7ENSRegentPark_3eaf.html" title="User:NSRegentPark">NSRegentPark</a> 22:48, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>The article</b> is not a complete mess. it got alot better (be nice if the title didnt keep getting changed for some reason) the title of 'timeline' suits it the best. Plain and simple. The article's edits have helped it alot, this page may be a mess, but the article itself is not.<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon">Ganfon</a> 00:58, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>do a big tidy</b>. It's basically a summary of everything that's happened in all three games, but bits are interesting.
