<p>I came here to find out about the lonelygirl15 phenomenon and found out. Thanks It's notable enough to make it into print media, it can be verified, and Wikipedia is in a position to be ahead of the curve in writing about topics like this, not behind it.

<li><b>Keep</b> - For pete's sake, leave the article alone for one freaking minute and let it grow organically. Over the next few weeks/months, I predict these videos will grow even more in popularity and the truth behind their intent will become clear. Wikipedia needs to be able to move with trends like this, not ignore them in fear of appearing unencyclopedic. -<a href="../../../a/s/r/User%7EAsriel86_e61d.html" title="User:Asriel86">Asriel</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is not here to document trends or bandy in crystalballism about whether or not the intent of these videos will ever become clear. Up until recently (i.e. during the DRV) the subject did not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and thus did not merit an article. Now it has been demonstrated the subject <i>does</i> meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and it appears the article will stay. I'd say the process worked quite nicely.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:41, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><small><b>Comment</b> As noted above, this person has been covered in the conventional media many times.

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">OhNoitsJamie</a>. I voted "delete" last time, and I am coming around to the idea that this may now pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Whilst it's wiki's declared policy not indulge in speculation (i.e. be ahead of the curve), LG15 does appear to have become a phenomenon. The reputable broadsheets have picked up and crystallised the grassroot movement which wiki was confined to ignoring. It is not against wiki policy to be "on the ball". <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:35, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Quoting myself from the undelete discussion: The fact that there are articles about other Youtube people at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Notable_YouTube_users" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Notable_YouTube_users" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Notable_YouTube_users</a> shows that people are looking for them. Several of which have passed AfD's of their own. Having watched this debate, to me, the real reason for the delation really seems to be less about the rules of Wiki, and more about the preceived popularity of who the article is about. That coupled with the reasons above means that this article should exist. Dave 05:32, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> And now a comment: How does internet fame differ from real world? The internet is part of the real world. And please, no "I know it when I see it" answers which amount to little more than a cop-out. Dave 05:32, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not part of this debate since I haven't voted, but to say "the Internet is part of the real world" is a knowing oversimplification. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 05:58, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> She's actually being talked about in forums that are not YouTube. Plus, my parents have heard of her. Maybe she wasn't extremely well-known a month ago, but when you have the New York Times and NPR doing stories on you, it definitely warrants a wikipedia article. <a href="../../../k/d/a/User%7EKdar_d42e.html" title="User:Kdar">Kdar</a> 13:01, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I preface by sayign that I realize I do not have a lot of edits. When this article was for AfD last time, I could see saying that she was not notable enough, but I think her popularity has skyrocketed since that time even further. There do exist multiple sources including newsworthy sources such as the LA Times referencing her. Also, the whole controversy involving the trademark application along with a few other theories not yet mentioned in the article makes this possible to be a genious marketing event. I think because of all this, she is notable enough to have an entry. 24.168.219.121 14:56, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>KEEP Encyplopedias mustn't dictate what interests people (e.g., articles on the fruit fly need to be there, though not of interest to everyone.). Lonleygirl15 is video literature.... real, fictional, or semi-fictional, boring, interesting? no matter. It is a cultural phenomenon that exists and captures the attention of a lot more people than, say, difficult academic new music, or arcane Sanskrit poetry. Elitist intellectualism has no place in legislating what constitutes general human knowledge. Semari1 16:47, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
