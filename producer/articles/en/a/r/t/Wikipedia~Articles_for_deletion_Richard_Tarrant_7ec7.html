<p><s>Candidate for the Republican nomination for US Senator from Vermont. Prod was removed to the talk page with the comment "I removed the proposal to delete the Article on Richard Tarrant. The delete proposal is most likely a "HACK"." I don't know the meaning of the word "hack" in that context so I don't know how to respond. Anyway, four reaons were offered for why the article should be kept. My comments appear in parentheses:</s></p>
<p><s>#"Richard founded one of Vermonts most important companies." <i>(see third point for reason why this isn't all that impressive)</i></s> #"Richard is running for US Senante in 2006." <i>(Candidates aren't notable in and of themselves per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a></i> <s>#"Richard's campagin is one of the leading advertisers in Vermont." <i>(Maybe the article should be merged to Advertising in Vermont?)</i>#"Richard was involved in Vermont's largest accounting scandal." <i>(He testified and wrote an op-ed piece about it. The article does not claim he was charged.)</i></s> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> (<a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JChap2007_84c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/JChap2007">contribs</a>) 00:06, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> A prod can be removed for ANY reason. Explaining an AfD by posting a rebuttal to the person who removed a prod is NOT the best way to explain why an article should be deleted - that person may not have come up with the best set of reasons. And certainly is unlikely to have come up with a complete set of reasons. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 14:11, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're absolutely correct about a sophmoric nomination that was an ill-conceived attempt at humor. The reason why the article should be deleted is that while of his numerous accomplishments each comes close, he has not done any one thing that would qualify him under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. His basketball accomplishments were in Division II. Cofounding a company that is later sold for $1.2 billion is impressive, but $1 billion companies are fairly common these days. There are many other high-achievers who do not have articles here. As for his campaign for Senate (and I know we disagree on this), I think the 100 years test is appropriate. With few exceptions, no one in 100 years is going to care about a candidate for Senate unless he wins. The notablility of candiates is ephemeral. It is better to cover them on the campaigns wikia or on Wikinews than here. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> (<a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JChap2007_84c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/JChap2007">contribs</a>) 14:45, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - senate candidate + non-stub = keep.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Let me emphasize that being a candidate is <i>not the reason</i> for keeping, but rather the multiple occasions of hitting the news with scandal and ongoing (yes) suspicions. His name is moderately frequently mentioned with some hostility on left wing radio. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:58, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> While I <i>strongly</i> disagree with the rationale "a US Senate candidate is notable in [<i>sic</i>] nature" for myriad reasons that are beyond the scope of this discussion, I do have to say that his other contributions (as noted and sourced in the article, as well as the whisperings referenced by Geogre) give me reason to believe he at least deserves a footnote. — <a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENMChico24_74ee.html" title="User:NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>NM</b></font></a><a href="../../../n/m/c/User_talk%7ENMChico24_41e0.html" title="User talk:NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>Chico</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NMChico24_752e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NMChico24"><font color="#3D59AB"><b>24</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Mexico.svg_6b3a.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg/25px-Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_New_Mexico.svg_6b3a.html" /></a> 05:30, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Many brushes with notability, like he hangs on the fringes of famous people. He's not involved with scandal, but writes about it. He's not an elected official, but wants to be. More to the point, unless there's been an article about the election race itself, I'm seeing a violation of <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a> which states elections first, then the candidate. And if this is an article about a candidate, then it needs to be pared down to focus on election issues, not his general bio, per <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a>. <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a> is only a guideline right now, but I propose it's better than guessing and hemming and hawing. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 07:56, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a guy who founded a company later sold for $1.2 billion. It's very likely, with that kind of money, that he'll continue to be in the news. And he's odds-on favorite to be the Republican nominee for the Senate seat in the November 2006 general election, so he's not exactly a fringe candidate. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 14:06, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: This delete proposal should be removed immediately. Through his advertising campaign Richard Tarrant is on Vermont TV and Radio pervasively. This alone warrants the article. I argue that the delete proposal, is an attempt to discredit the article, because it was added hours after information about Richard Tarrant's oversight failure in an accounting scandal was added to the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - People go to Wikipedia as a source for NPOV information on topics relevant to their lives. A Senate candidate from Vermont is noteworthy, at least to folks from Vermont. Amusing that we have <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion</a> but apparently no Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy retention. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 22:27, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Joy of joys - found it. There is a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_keep_5dff.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy keep">Wikipedia:Speedy keep</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, <i>criteria for speedy retention</i> would be a situation where it is very obvious that it will be a unanimous keep, there are no delete votes and the nominator withdraws their nomination. For the moment, <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> is the only remaining delete vote. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 22:33, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Certainly with only 3 federal representatives for the state (2 Senators and 1 Rep), the candidates for those offices are quite notable to residents of Vermont. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Graham_a3b5.html" title="User:William Graham">waffle&#160;iron</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliam_Graham_e6a3.html" title="User talk:William Graham">talk</a></sup> 22:35, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It is to be noted this is not a vote, but a discussion of issues. The fact that Tarrant is notable to those in Vermont does not make him notable to someone in California, which is a given. If the only factor to notability is that someone, somewhere, <i>might</i> find it interesting, this gives inclusion a whole new meaning and requires a rewriting of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> et al. However the article ends up, I do not see my points refuted. Shrug. Life goes on. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 11:20, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
