<li><b>Delete</b>. I know this sounds a bit weird, but I am Andrew Morrison, and I did not in any way request for, or want for that matter, a Wikipedia page to be written about me.

In fact, it is quite embarrasing... I sincerely apologise, on his behalf, for any inconvenience caused to fellow Wikipedia users.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. It's Andrew again. Sorry if this is irritating, but I do find it rather unfair that a previous user, with whom I am personally acquanted, stated that I "vandalise the net."

<p>I jus't thought that I would point out the hypocracy here. All of these wikipedia members are arguing that we should get rid of this DTF page because it is not relevant and simply trying to promote the band. The funny part is that all of these people on the message board have a page written about themselves. THAT seems completely relevant to me. So it is alright for all of you to have a page about yourself, but not alright for a new band to post some RELEVANT and TRUE information about themselves?</p>

<p><b>Dont Delete!</b> This is completely relevant! Some people are researching information on the popularity of unknown teenage bands. The fact that DTF may not be as well known as some other bands does not mean that it does not have potential. DTF is worthy of a spot on the Wikipedia encyclopedia. There are many people interested, as you can see it has had a lot of viewers. I, myself, am a DTF fan. Please do not delete this page! It is gaining popularity to a wider range of people using Wikipedia by drawing attention to the encyclopedia. It is no harm to anybody!</p>
<p>Dont Delete! "What am I talking about?"...well, I am talking about the fact that you (for example Cyrius) would like DTF's page to be deleted because you find it to be irrelevant and for the purpose of self-promotion, yet you happen to have a page on wikipedia for yourself, describing yourself as "just some guy". Why should it be alright for you to post a page about yourself, but not alright for a new band to post a page about themselves? Personally, I do not have a problem with either.</p>

<p>Alright, sorry for my confusion. I still think that DTF should be allowed to keep this page, because they are a talented band that will make a name for themselves one day. I do not think that we should discriminate against bands because they are not as well-known as others. Every band has to start from somewhere.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not "discrimination", this is common sense. An encyclopedia documents famous and notable things, not every single minor thing that ever happened in the world. We have a set of consistent standards we apply to every article: see <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. When DTF becomes successful, you can write an encyclopedia article about them then. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 14:45, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will restate the fact that DTF has signed a deal with British record label Delerium to promote their EP in the United States, Continental Europe and Israel, and they have taken it upon themselves to deal with domestic distribution. That in itself is indicative of success, no?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I chose my words poorly. Good for them on being signed, and this is a measure of success. However, most editors of Wikipedia do not consider merely being signed as enough to merit an encyclopedia article. Please see the guidelines at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for what most editors of Wikipedia consider the standards for inclusion here. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 22:13, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe they will make it big one day - for that, I wish them luck. However, I'm not convinced that you're being totally honest. A small quote from Delerium Records website: "<i>Delerium records is no longer active and the website is now on-line for information purposes. There will be the occasional Delerium re-issue or limited edition.</i>" Over the years I've seen hundreds of bands that their record labels claimed would be huge, only they never did. Wikipedia doesn't really cater for speculation, and to say that they will be huge in the future is just that: speculation. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamyskis_2c95.html" title="User:Jamyskis">Jamyskis</a> 13:02, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would just like to say.....DTF rawks the kazbah. My name is Regina Felangi, and i am a very important business woman in the business world. I know when a band is going to make it big. Just this morning, while i was in board room A, I was discussing with my fellow workers, the potential that said band had. Wikipedia is not being harmed by this link, that is my business perspective.</p>
<p>Dont Delete!!!!! DTF is my favorite band! They have the hottest guys ever! Have you ever seen Jacob Fox? His last name is there for a reason. HE certainly is a Fox. A really fine one. I'm sure that if everyone on this forum saw him, they would immeadiately change their mind about deleting this. Did I mention that he is also an AMAZING lead guitarist? He is.Wow.</p>
<p>Dont Delete!!! I love Jacob too! Even more than her!</p>

The result of the debate was keep in some form.</p>
<p>I count 1 "delete" vote, 6 "keep as redirect" to the band, 8 "keep as is" (one probable troll vote discounted) and 3 "keep as disambiguation page". The decision about what form to keep this article should now be moved to the article's Talk page.</p>
<p>I will, however, add my own vote. Reviewing the revised content, I consider this to still be a dictionary definition - that is, a discussion of the meaning, origins and usage of a word or phrase. If this is not substantially expanded in a reasonable period of time, it may be reappropriate to renominate the page for deletion after updating the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">transwiki</a> to Wiktionary. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:12, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 7 clear "delete" votes, 1 "keep" vote (one very new user discounted) and 4 "keep as merge" votes (one probable troll discounted). Reviewing the article, I conclude that the content was in fact a fork from <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> and find nothing that is appropriate to merge back. I also note that the article is an orphan.</p>
<p>On the principle that we should discourage the creation of forked articles that have the intent of pushing a particular point of view, I am going to exercise my discretion on this one and call it as a delete. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:48, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I should point out that, simply because this organization is obscure, un-noteworthy, etc, should NOT be grounds for deletion. The Wikipedia is a lifesaver for finding information on such topics. However, the content of the article, IMHO, reeks of self-promotion. Were this an article on a general subject, I would say the neutrality is in dispute. However, since it is a commercial organization, and the article is self-serving, I would recommend deletion.Markarian</li>

<dd>It is a condition well known to Psychologists. I noticed that you did't have an entry for it so I added one. Please feel free to edit it. Perhaps you'd prefer the term psychological schizophrenia? They mean the same thing. 203.26.206.129 10:51, 24 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Let's break it down into short statements. Schizophrenia is a pathology. So the statement "pathological schizophrenia" is meaningful. Water is wet. So the statement "wet water" is meaningful. However, both statements are redundant, and the word "pathological" is being used merely as an intensifier. That's why you only find 23 mentions of "pathological schizophrenia" on Google, compared to 7,320,000 for "schizophrenia".
<dl>
<dd>And over 10,000 for "psychological schizophrenia"... It seems like that usage is more common than pathological. 203.26.206.129 11:02, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> never heard of the term. Fake schizophrenia would be an alternative though I have very strong doubts about verifiability and encyclopedic value of the alternative. psychological schizofrenia would be another alternative but I think that user:Anome is right that this is an obsolete/dead/abandoned theory and this should be stated clearly in the article. Or may be Hypochondric schizophrenia? I do not oppose to the latter if this is notable and verifiable. 11:05, 24 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is a difference between it and "fake schizophrenia". Fake schizophrenia is when you don't have it. Pathological schizophrenia is when you have all of the symptoms and for all intensive purposes are schizophrenic - but with no medical symptoms. There's a difference. 203.26.206.129 11:15, 24 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Such as? How do you diagnose "pathological schizophrenia", then, if its symptoms are identical to those of 'real' schizophrenia? Your cites so far have not been enlightening on this point. The actual literature on <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malingering.html" title="Malingering">malingering</a> and schizophrenia <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&amp;db=PubMed&amp;term=%22fake+schizophrenia%22&amp;tool=QuerySuggestion" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&amp;db=PubMed&amp;term=%22fake+schizophrenia%22&amp;tool=QuerySuggestion" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> seems to show that instruments such as the <a href="../../../m/m/p/MMPI_8489.html" title="MMPI">MMPI</a> are pretty good at weeding out malingerers. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 11:29, May 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How do you diagnose it? Well, you may not be aware of this, but there is a medical way to diagnose <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schizophrenia.html" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>, which is through analysis of <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_fluid.html" title="Spinal fluid">spinal fluid</a>. This is the only certain way of diagnosing <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schizophrenia.html" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>. Pathological schizophrenia fails this test. Pretty simple really. Its pretty rare that pathological schizophrenia can't be cured through therapy, and the only examples when it can't is when it is attached to a mental illness with chemical roots, such as <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression.html" title="Depression">depression</a>. Hope that that explains it. 203.26.206.129 11:34, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fascinating.

<li>Well I had to get one when they tested me for schizophrenia. I failed that, so they said I wasn't. Was pretty simple. Would take too long to look it up though. I'll leave it for someone else to do. I'm not quite sure of the correct methods that they do.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. A lumbar puncture isn't used to diagnose schizophrenia. It is used to rule out certain other disorders (particularly infections like neurosyphilis) which may generate similar symptoms. Though there is some evidence to suggest certain neurotransmitter metabolites may be measured in cerebrospinal fluid drawn by lumbar puncture, such measurements are unreliable and <i>not</i> used in clinical diagnosis. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TenOfAllTrades_2268.html" title="Special:Contributions/TenOfAllTrades">contrib</a>)</small> 21:03, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The formal medical term is indeed "lumbar puncture", and that's what we should use in articles.

<li>I must disagree. The phrases "pathological schizophrenia" or "pathologic schizophrenia" do not appear in the last six of eight links. The first link uses "pathological schizophrenia" to refer to schizophrenia, full stop. The second link is a web page by someone who has self-identified with the disorder, but doesn't carry a clinical diagnosis of the purported syndrome.

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was was <b>keep</b>. Reasoning: There is no consensus to delete. The question is whether to keep or merge. Since the article now actually consists of two sections one about Discworld another about Maskerade, unrelated to each other, I am calling this an outright keep for the moment. This does not mean that it cannot be merged later if somebody wants to do some rework, splitting this article into two pieces and merging both of them. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:20, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The crystal ball argument is to prevent pages being created about events that <i>may</i> or <i>could</i> happen in years to come, not pages about events that <i>will</i> happen (production is already underway, and the pilot is finished) ... by that argument the article on Star Wars Episode III shouldn't have been there until May 19th. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> 13:54, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment, indeed, there shouldn't have been an article on the film until this month. An article on the rumors is one thing, but encyclopedias must be conservative in their coverage, and things must be verified. At this point, you could say one or another thing about a <i>plan</i> or about a <i>production</i> of a show, but there is no show until it is shown. When talking about plans and productions, we cross to making cultural announcements, and Wikipedia is not an advertising or announcement site. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:49, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>Most of the "delete" voters clearly expressed an opinion that a new entity can not generally be encyclopedia-worthy the day of its launch (or worse, the day prior) and that more time should be allowed before the decision is made to include it. The "keep" voters were less consistent in their reasoning. By strict vote-count, I count 20 "deletes", 20 "keep as is" (though ten of them had to be discounted as either anonymous or so new that they were indistinguishable from sockpuppets) and 6 "merge". Since the "merge" votes count as a variant of "keep", the decision to delete fails to meet the necessary concensus even though there is a clear majority (20 to 16) in favor of deletion. There is, however, an overwhelming concensus (26 to 10) that this should not remain as an independent article. Accordingly, I am going to call this one as a "merge and redirect". Relevant content has been merged with <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Rose_5701.html" title="Kevin Rose">Kevin Rose</a> per the recommendations below. (If anyone thinks I missed an important detail, you can view it in the page history and can merge it yourself.)</p>
<p>This decision should be considered binding until there is clear and convincing evidence that <i>Systm</i> is independently encyclopedia-worthy. That is usually taken to mean that the entity has been around long enough and has had enough general impact on society that a <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> article of greater than <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">stub</a> length can be written and that the topic is widely enough known that we can expect the necessary critical mass of knowledgable reader/editors to keep the article <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">neutral</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:23, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>A Pan-Turkist is one who espouses <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Turkism_5e38.html" title="Pan-Turkism">Pan-Turkism</a>, and the reason that the article didn't separate the names is probably that the original author was unfamiliar with wiki-markup. In the actual wikitext, there are line breaks between the names. (I've remedied that problem.) As a raw list of names without any explanation whatever, this is <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedy deletion criterion A1</a> territory, though. There's no context to link this article to <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Turkism_5e38.html" title="Pan-Turkism">Pan-Turkism</a> or explain what this list signifies, and no inclusion/exclusion criteria explaining what qualifies someone to be on this list. Given how short both it and <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Turkism_5e38.html" title="Pan-Turkism">Pan-Turkism</a> are, there's scant justification for a stand-alone list, too. If these people are notable within the field of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Turkism_5e38.html" title="Pan-Turkism">Pan-Turkism</a>, why aren't any of them even mentioned in <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Turkism_5e38.html" title="Pan-Turkism">Pan-Turkism</a>?

<p>--Cantor Victor Beck 02:39, 25 May 2005 (UTC)===Discussion=== Let's set the record straight shall we? 1) This is not a vanity article. I didn't even know that it existed till someone sent me the url to see it. 2) I've just opened an account here for the first time a few minutes ago. 3) If you really intend to do research, then you need to expand your horizons beyond the confines of Google. For example, you might try checking with the U.S. Library of Congress. There you would find copies of all the original music that I have written, plus all of my recordings. You would also find Airchecks (recordings) of all the "ASK THE RABBI" radio shows. All of this material was submitted to the Library of Congress for Copywrite protection. The Library of Congress accepted, and Copywrites were issued for all of the materials I submitted. You could also check the archives of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum for my song "NEVER FORGET ME". You will find not only the music, but my recording done with a 40 piece orchestra, as well as the story of how the song came to be written. I am afraid that if you validate the world around you only by what you can find on Google, then you are doing yourself a great dis-service.</p>

<p>As I recall, Reverend Cantor Victor I. Beck voted "Keep" in the same hysterical manner as all the other sockpuppets in the Very Reverend Cantor Lawrence Eliezer KÃ©pecs VfD. Was that a different Reverend Cantor? Was he lying when he signed as you, O Most Highly Notable Very Good Singer Reverend Cantor Victor I. Beck? Or are you lying now when you say that you "just opened an account here for the first time a few minutes ago"? As I recall, I went to the Very Reverend Cantor Beck's website and got his email address and phone number, which I posted in the VfD discussion there. It should be a very small matter to go get that information once again, and this time to actually call the Most Highly Reverend Cantor and see what he has to say about this whole thing in person. I'm disgusted and appalled at the level of chutzpa you exhibit, O Dear High and Mighty Sockpuppet Maestro, and I suspect he would be as well. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 00:16, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let's again set the record straight and this is the final time that I will demean myself to stoop to your level. 1) I DO NOT LIE. NOT FOR YOU OR FOR ANYONE ELSE, AND CONSIDERING THAT YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT ME YOU HAVE INCREADABLE GAUL TO MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION 2) You demonstrate the level of your ability and the value of your judgement regarding being an editor by the way that you attack and threaten me with your personal attacks on my privacy. You dare to blackmail me by threatening to publish my home contact information? If this is the kind of action that is condoned on Wikipedia then I think the world should be so informed of the lack of integrity in this online publication and it's editors. You are a disgrace to the publication and any honest people who may be involved. I can also assure you that I do not take kindly to threats and any actions will be dealt with in a definitive, strong, and forthright manner. Now would be the appropriate time for you to try and prove that you are not a sniveling coward hiding behind your screen image and offer a proper apology. --Cantor Victor Beck 02:39, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apparently, Dear Reverend Cantor, you fail to realize that if the VfU on Lawrence Eliezer KÃ©pecs is successful, this PUBLIC DOMAIN INFORMATION, which you erroneously believe to be "private", <i>will also once again become public</i>. If you'd read more carefully, you'd notice, I've ALREADY published this information, which I got DIRECTLY off the REAL Cantor Beck's (horribly designed) website, as I explicitly stated when I posted it the first time (along with citations). Your flailing attempts to impugn my character do <i>nothing</i> to establish your credibility, nor that of your master, Merlin. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 08:34, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh...and I think you're looking for "incredible gall", not "increadible gaul" (ink-readible french perhaps?). (Why you wouldn't just use a perfectly good word like "chutzpa" is beyond me, unless as some have surmised previously, you're not even Jewish...) "It's" is a contraction for "it is" or "it has", the possessive form of "it" is simply "its". Demeaning yourself and stooping to my level, even if it were somehow possible to "stoop" up to my elevated level, are the same thing. Nothing is served by repetitive tautological redundancy. Publishing public-domain information in public hardly qualifies as "blackmail", look it up <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackmail.html" title="Blackmail">here</a>. Wikipedia is not a publication as such, and even if it were, you, as a purported editor do far more to lower its standards than I have ever done, even at my drunken worst. I have not threatened you, nor am I interested in leveling threats against you. As a sockpuppet, you don't have a leg to stand on, and so you're clearly at a disadvantage, since I have two. Not to mention two hands and a functioning washing-machine. (AND SOAP!) As I have no screen image, I don't see how I can be charged with hiding behind it, but I sincerely think perhaps you should consider the wikipedia policy <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> before you call me a "sniveling coward". Until such time as I do something requiring an apology, however, I recommend you not hold your breath, as none will be forthcoming. As for your apparent illiteracy, as I recommended in the KÃ©pecs VfD discussion, you might do well to get a different box of crackerjacks. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 08:54, May 25, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I am a singer myself who helped contribute to this article, though I admit my voice is not as good as these three cantors. What does it hurt you so much to keep it? I liked Kepecs' article and Krupp's equally as much. It shows what professional cantors are really involved with, besides being "prayer leaders". They are typically involved with community events, charitable causes, helping others, teachers, and trying to help the world reach a higher spiritual level at the same time. The whole purpose of the trip to Rome was to build bridges between many fighting factions. The orthodox condemn the conservatives and reform in Judaism, and vice versa, and in the past there was not such a good relationship with the Vatican, as there is now. This trip brought everyone together for a common cause. It was so powerful an event. Cantor Beck, Cantor Kepecs, Gary Krupp, and Cantor Barnoy were essential figures in trying to bring about world peace. Do you know what that is?? It's a noble cause, and should not be condemned, but rewarded. I wish we had more people in this world like these three superior cantors and the Commandatore who "make good things happen" in the world we live in. And I am not a sockpuppet. You apparently have an article about him so I guess he is more notable in your book than any of the aforementioned cantors. Ask yourselves, do you want the world to be a better place, or a worse place. --Rigoletto1 12:04, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

As for the orthodox condemning the conservative and reform and vice versa, not only is this a caricature, but <i>utterly irrelevant to either this discussion or to the article</i>. BTW...I don't think the world is going to be "a worse place" if this article is deleted, and I think if you think about it for a split second, neither do you. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 14:55, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> I am a student at the seminary where Cantor Beck and Cantor Kepecs are teachers and on the Board of Directors. The seminary is in New York - and yes, it is the same Cantor Beck who has a place of residence in Arizona - and yes, is possible for someone to have 2 residences. I am not sure why there is any confusion as to if it is the same Cantor Victor Beck. I am a bit confused as to why anyone would mention that the article on him violates any rules of this site as when I went to examine the rules of biographies it clearly states that biographies can be included if they meet the criteria of: "Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is recognized as exceptional and likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia's biographical articles policy</a> Cantor Beck is a person who achieved renown and notoriety for his involvement in the seminary, his trip to Rome, MOST OF ALL - his outstanding and remarkable career. He is also recognized as an exceptional Cantor who will most certainly become a part of the enduring history of his field. The same can be said of Cantor Kepecs whose artwork is respected and appreciated. As far as the trip to Rome, I don't understand why the urge to delete this "newsworthy" event. It was reported on CNN, NBC, CBS, Newsday, The New York Times, and the official Vatican Website - just to name a few. I don't think that any of these media sources would carry anything un-newsworthy. On another note - the IP addresses can be similar if they are set up to the same modem. As this is a school, we are all connected to the same network.--Rabbi2b 15:32, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

Scholar's mate is a four move checkmate often seen in tournaments with schoolchildren, perhaps that is where the name comes from.

<li>I know that Blitz is fast chess, but I help out with my daughter's scholastic chess club and local tournaments, and I've heard some players speaking of "blitz" in the context of a tactic. I gather from the context that they are referring to some sort of rapid attack on the king, likely a scholar's mate, but I'm not sure if that's what they mean.--<a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> 18:12, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've heard that form referred to as "speed chess" or "five-minute", with the term "blitz chess" meaning an even faster game, in which all moves must be made immediately, with no pause for thought at all. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 07:50, 26 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are even more terms for it, "lightning chess" for instance. One minute per side is often referred to as "bullet chess". Exactly ten seconds per move, is called "rapid transit chess" (I have heard people refer to that as "gong chess" as well). But the question here is if "Blitzkrieg" is a valid term for a chess strategy. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 10:02, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Bubba73, I think Sjakkalle's point is that it would be a mistake to create Blitz (chess) as a redirect to <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholar%27s_Mate_512e.html" title="Scholar's Mate">Scholar's Mate</a>, because <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitz_chess.html" title="Blitz chess">Blitz chess</a> has an entirely unrelated meaning and already has an article that correctly describes what it means in the chess world. Personally I think conflating "blitzkrieg" with Scholar's Mate with a redirect is an error that will only cause confusion because blitz has a long established meaning in chess that has nothing to do with 4-move mates. Of course WP does not only document correct usage of terms but also common misusages, but it's a shame to use WP to promote <i>uncommon</i> incorrect usages. And no, I really don't want to add anything to the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholar%27s_Mate_512e.html" title="Scholar's Mate">Scholar's Mate</a> page to say that it is sometimes called blitzkrieg. I've played chess for about 35 years and have over 100 books in my chess library and I've <i>never</i> seen or heard that usage. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 21:41, 26 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your point is well taken, so skip the idea of "Blitz (chess)". I've been playing longer than that, but I don't have as many books (50 or so). I never heard Blitz used in context as a tactic until about a year ago when I heard it used by scholastic players, and since then I've heard it 2 or 3 times.

<ul>
<li>Interesting. I'm not around any young chess players these days, so it's very possible that this is a usage that I simply haven't encountered. I couldn't find any support for it on google, which is a little odd because there are quite a few scholastic chess resources on the web and it seems likely that something would turn up. "The Oxford Companion to Chess" says that blitzkrieg is another name for the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_variant.html" title="Chess variant">chess variant</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_chess.html" title="Progressive chess">progressive chess</a>. That would make it a suitable redirect target for blitzkrieg (chess), but naturally not <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitzkrieg_%28chess_strategy%29.html" title="Blitzkrieg (chess strategy)">blitzkrieg (chess strategy)</a>.

<ul>
<li>It might be a colloquialism. In the school club they play without clocks and in the tournaments they mostly play without clocks, but play game/30, so they can't be referring to a 5-minute game. A quote "I won with a blitz". It might mean a rapid attack on the king, similar to scholar's mate. There must be victims of scholor's mate at the tournaments because some games finish in under 2 minutes, sometimes under 1 minute. --<a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> 14:27, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 11 "deletes", 6 "keeps" (2 very new users discounted), 2 commenters who did not express a clear opinion and one "merge". The merge recommendation was generally rejected as an inappropriate target. No alternate target was suggested.</p>
<p>Right around the start of the dicussion, the content and title were changed significantly. However, votes against the article continued after the revisions and none of the early "delete" voters returned to change their votes leading me to conclude that they were unconvinced by the changes.</p>
<p>Looking carefully at the current content, I see an orphaned article which appears to me to be expressing opinions about topics already well covered (and better sourced) in other articles. The content is internally inconsistent. Since the VfD discussion, the article has been neglected. I am going to add my own opinion to the decision and call this (barely) a "delete" decision but without prejudice against the re-creation of the article in a more coherent format. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:54, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>- if its POV clean it up! An article on Christian groups that seek to convert Jews to Christianity is a legitimate subject for an NPOV article, unless they are specifically covered elsewhere.

<li><b>Qualified Keep</b> - The article requires a better title, first of all. Many Christians and Christian groups "convert" Jews and other nonChristians regularly around the world. The groups listed in the article are special because they purposefully convert Jews in particular (or are composed of ethnic Jews who have converted to Christianity) as their primary function. Secondly, the article's text takes what seems to be offense at the idea of Christians converting others, which many Christians feel is an essential component of their faith. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 23:25, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Weak keep: I have a number of problems with this article. Its writing is anemic, as noted, but the title is illogical. Is this how the material will be sought? Is this an apt description of the contents? The article is fairly NPOV, but it's also fairly inaccurate. It glosses over the fact that most Jewish religious groups are not messianic. It's simply not a majority position to look for a messiah, these days. Also, while the groups listed as proselytizers of Jews are proselytizers of Jews, there is a real nightmare of potential POV addition (and that happens with a wiki), as well as defamation. I'm not at all comfortable with the article, but it's not a deletion policy violation, so far as I can see. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:00, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The "Star Fox series" page's list of characters is just a list of links to pages about the characters. I don't see what the huge fuss about letting Caiman have his own page is all about. So what if he is not a huge major character, its okay to let secondary characters have their own pages. All of the StarFox characters should have more added to their pages, which will make Wikipedia more complete.

<li>It is true. Why delete pure information for the sake of deleting it? This article in no way makes Wikipedia less organized.

<li><b>Keep</b>! This article expands on Wikipedia's little-explored StarFox universe. It in no way hurts anything and is completely factional. The only reason I could see for anyone to delete this page is either because they think that "Minor StarFox Characters" should be a page with Caiman on it (which wouldn't work due to StarFox's lack of many minor characters) or for spite. None of those reasons are valid to me. Please, we must keep it! <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._D_1ede.html" title="User:Dr. D">Dr. D</a> 00:07, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>So what if StarFox is a fictional Universe? Wiki covers Star Wars and Star Trek, two of the largest fictional universes known to mankins. THEY both are allowed to have articles about secondary characters, so why shouldn't StarFox's Universe be able to? Just because its smaller doesn't mean that it should be pushed to the side.

<li>Remove it. Please review "Audit explosion" by Michael Power. It is freely available at:</li>

<li>KEEP: RickK, a number of months ago I noticed an absence of information on Wikipedia regarding IT Audit. I teach a Seattle University class on IT Audit and asked my students to post content for their final project. This page is not intended to suit an inappropriate purpose. It was merely intended to provide additional content to the community. My students are more than happy to modify the content, present it in an alternative manner, or make other changes to better reflect the editorial style that the Wikipedia editors would like to see. Please feel free to provide any guidance you think might help. I would ask all that visit this page to vote to KEEP the page. I would also like to understand what criteria might have triggered the request for deletion. We should encourage new users with guidance, as opposed to quickly shutting down a new initiative. Thanks in advance for your help. --Asparks1805 03:52, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would <b>keep</b> the article on <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_Technology_Audit_fba9.html" title="Information Technology Audit">Information Technology Audit</a> since that is a valid topic and what is there now is a legitimate stub. If someone uses the space for his own purposes, rest assured that editors will cut out the offending material. As to the article on <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_Technology_Audit_-_Regulation_2606.html" title="Information Technology Audit - Regulation">Information Technology Audit - Regulation</a>, my initial reaction is that it is a narrow branch of the main topic and doesn't need its own page. I would rather wait a week and see what develops and perhaps, in the meantime, help move the editor in a proper direction so he doesn't waste his energy. - <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 00:00, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Pause, keep for now</b> I suggest that we contact the user and ask them politely about their plans for these articles. As far as I can see, both of them could be made into good encyclopedia articles, and without any evidence to the contrary, I'll assume that the user is planning on turning them into good encyclopedia articles. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 00:09, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Userfy</b> since it's all under construction, and let's find out what the editor has planned for these. It looks like it's going to be a miniature website within Wikipedia if it all gets fleshed out as-is â a bit odd. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>Ð¸<small>D</small>Ñ<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a> 02:13, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Let us just <b>keep</b> both these articles for the time being as they are both good topics and it doesn't seem that the user is trying to write for his/her own purposes. Let us see what changes the user makes by the 6th of June. I feel that it is not going to become a miniature website on its own within wikipedia. There are millions in this world involved with Information Technology Audit and it is a topic that is related to many aspects of IT, so it should not be isolated. I hope the user is going to have some really useful information on IT Audit in this article. - Cassim 03:41, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_Technology_Audit_fba9.html" title="Information Technology Audit">Information Technology Audit</a> for reasons above. <b>Keep for now</b>: <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_Technology_Audit_-_Regulation_2606.html" title="Information Technology Audit - Regulation">Information Technology Audit - Regulation</a>âif it turns out to be only a page of links, it can easily be integrated into <i>Information Technology Audit</i> under the <i>Regulation</i> sub-topic. <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDialUp_ed76.html" title="User:DialUp">DialUp</a> 16:43, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>PLEASE KEEP</b> - This IT Audit page is intended to be a miniature website posted by a graduate IT Audit class in Seattle, Washington, USA as a final project. The professor saw an absence of IT Audit information on Wikipedia and proposed it as a place to post the student's final articles. He hoped to better populate Wiki with IT Audit information and get the students involved in IT community communications. We (students)are learning Wiki-markup and trying our best to get all the articles posted and organized in a professional manner for our final due date of June 6, 2005. Please have patience and understand that we have no intention of using this site for any reason beyond what Wiki stands for. Thank you all for taking the time to watch for misuse of Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>, as <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">User:Jayjg</a> said either in the VfD for KÃ©pecs or on the KÃ©pecs talk page, this guy (Krupp) is more notable than KÃ©pecs. That said, my 9th grade English teacher wrote a couple of children's books and is arguably more notable than my 12th grade English teacher who was accused of having molested a couple of girls (he was acquitted tho eventually). Neither of them, more or less notable, however, is sufficiently note<i><b>worthy</b></i> to warrant a WP article. The same thing applies here (without meaning to impugn the abilities, accomplishments or character of either KÃ©pecs or Krupp). <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 09:33, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> What you are doing is a terrible thing. I am a singer myself, though I admit not as good as these three cantors. What does it hurt you so much to keep it? I liked Krupp's article and Kepecs' equally as much. It shows what professional cantors are really involved with, besides being "prayer leaders". They are typically involved with community events, charitable causes, helping others, teachers, and trying to help the world reach a higher spiritual level at the same time. The whole purpose of the trip to Rome was to build bridges between many fighting factions. The orthodox condemn the conservatives and reform in Judaism, and vice versa, and in the past there was not such a good relationship with the Vatican, as there is now. This trip brought everyone together for a common cause. It was so powerful an event. Cantor Beck, Cantor Kepecs, Gary Krupp, and Cantor Barnoy were essential figures in trying to bring about world peace. Do you know what that is?? It's a noble cause, and should not be condemned, but rewarded. I wish we had more people in this world like these three superior cantors and the Commandatore who "make good things happen" in the world we live in. And I am not a sockpuppet. You apparently have an article about him so I guess he is more notable in your book than any of the aforementioned cantors. Ask yourselves, do you want the world to be a better place, or a worse place. --Rigoletto1 12:15, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>You apparently fail to understand what is going on here. Wikipedia is not a biographical catalog of everyone who has ever tried to do anything any- and everywhere. <i>Nobody</i> is condemning nor demeaning these men's trip to the Vatican, nor is <i>anyone</i> saying that they shouldn't be rewarded. A vanity article in WP, however, is <i>not</i> a reward, it's a violation of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia's biographical articles policy</a>.
