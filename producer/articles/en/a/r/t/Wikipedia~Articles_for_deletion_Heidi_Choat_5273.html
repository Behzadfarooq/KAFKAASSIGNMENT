<p>I have concerns about this article because it purports to be about a living person and a lot of unreferenced and unverifiable allegations are made. There is only one relevant Google hit, an archive of sex offenders which only states her name, age and sentence <a href="http://www.mako.org.au/femoff.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mako.org.au/femoff.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This site is the only online reference cited in the article. The rest of the Google hits appear to be about a <i>West Wing</i> character. There are also no hits for legal documents containing the name in any database on AustLii. <a

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am the original author of the article. I have now provided references for this article - as a busy student, this was simply a work in progress (as is the case with many Wikipedia articles, often unreferenced and often with significantly less content than this one). The concluding paragraph carefully provides reasons for the notability of this subject and it is surely tortuous to suggest that this has not been established. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability_(people)</a> guidelines include the criterion: "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events". One might argue about the level of notability / notoriety established, but this case is significant within the specific genre to which it belongs within Australian criminal law and is cited in the consideration of other such cases. This subject is an increasingly frequent matter being dealt with by courts in US and Australian jurisdictions particularly, and certain trends are emerging of which this case forms a significant part. Any person studying the emergence of female paedophilia in Australian schools would welcome this and similar articles as providing a reliable source of information. The fact that the article provides few Google hits is explained by the fact that the case occurred at a time when online reportage was not extensive. This fact might also be used to support the inclusion of this article in Wikipedia, since it will provide the only significant online resource about this case. The lack of hits on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au" class="external text" title="http://www.austlii.edu.au" rel="nofollow">AustLii</a> is explained by the fact that AustLii only reports on (Australian) High Court, state Supreme Court and Federal Court cases, not cases dealt with by lower level courts in state jurisdictions.

<dd><b>Comment</b> In my opinion your referencing (a short database entry and a hardcopy article) is not sufficient for an article which makes serious allegations about a living person. I still do not believe notability has been established per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<dd>Under the heading 'People still alive', <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> refers to "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events". This case was published as the headline article on the front page of the state newspaper of the state (Queensland) in which it occurred, the article being of sufficient length that it was continued on an inside page. The fact that the case does not register ongoing notoriety does not detract from the fact that it was notorious at the time it occurred and that it has ongoing significance within the genre of such cases. I am glad that you state that "in [your] opinion" the referencing is not sufficient, because a reading of the newspaper article in question will provide ample evidence of the facts to which I have referred. That is not a matter of opinion, it is a matter of fact for anyone who will go to the trouble of accessing and reading the article, which could be done at any state or university library in Australia. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 22:45, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Referencing to print and microform sources is still an established practice in academia, research and writing, despite the increasing prevalence of online sources. To suggest that a person "should not have to go to a library" is denying the importance of what is still a major source of information in our community and intellectual life. I am not sure why more than one source is required, if that source is significant, reliable and verifiable. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 23:00, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I am not saying that only online sources can be used. I'm suggesting that if this woman is a notable or notorious criminal, there would be some online references to her. I have general concerns about the fact you appear to think <s>tacking</s> adding a hardcopy article and a database entry at the end of the article is sufficient referencing for an article which is potentially defamatory. Also, the photo appears to be identical to the image on <a href="http://mako.org.au/images/choat.jpg" class="external text" title="http://mako.org.au/images/choat.jpg" rel="nofollow">Mako</a> (it even appears to have the same creases). This makes me wonder what is going on. If you are from Mako and you did indeed scan that image and make that entry, Mako should be discounted as a reference for the purpose of this discussion. If you are not from Mako and you did not scan the image, you should correct your "self-scanned" copyright declaration. Regardless, I do not feel comfortable with you hanging this article on one single newspaper article. This is my final comment on this page. I shall leave it in the trustworthy hands of the AfD people. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 23:39, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I feel that your use of the term 'tacking' in regard to my reference is a slight to my skills as a writer, and do not appreciate it. The use of the neutral term 'adding' would be preferable. The article would only be defamatory if it were not based on any verifiable sources, so there is no concern there. In regard to the photo: I am indeed definitely not 'from' Mako, nor do I have any connection with or interest in that organization. I would suggest that the similarity in the images is due to their having scanned it from the same microform source as I did, albeit no doubt a different copy of the microform. Thank you for your interest in my articles, and for conducting a (generally) civil discussion. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 23:50, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you have a reference for Jimbo's comments (who's Jimbo, by the way? pardon my ignorance, but I'm not yet on first-name terms with (presumably) administrators here. Can you reference him too please?) Now, as to the newspaper article, I don't 'have' the article, it exists, free for all to access, in probably 300+ libraries in Australia and probably dozens of others around the world. All of the material facts in this article are drawn from the newspaper article, so there is nothing in Wikipedia which has not already been said elsewhere. In regard to conclusions drawn, these are only factual extrapolations from the facts of the case, and do not make value judgments about the individual concerned, so there is no basis for any defamation action. If other evidence was available, I would have cited that too. I would observe, by the way, that <i>The Courier-Mail</i> seems to be a newspaper which withdraws its online articles much earlier than most newspapers - you will probably find that some of thie links where it is cited for other articles are already dead - hence my desire to add print references as well, in the long term. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 22:04, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In further reply to one or two items raised: (1) The comment by <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunk_641f.html" title="User:Thunk">Thunk</a> that "there were plenty of online sources by then" is very general and does not consider, for example, what was the state of online newspaper services in Queensland at that time? (2) The fact that she "is...not well known in Australia" presumably means that <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> has not heard of her; this would be true of many, many Wikipedia articles of a specialist nature, while not addressing the fact that, for those who are interested in the field concerned, this case is significant. (3) The sentiment that "she should be left free to live the rest of her life", while a fine idea on a human level, is not really an argument foror against deletion of this article; that logic could be applied to any criminal, and also fails to consider the fact that her victim would no doubt have liked to be left free to get on with his life, but is unlikely to forget these events. <font color="red">An additional extension of some of my earlier observations, also, would ask editors to consider the basic function of Wikipedia in this way: if lack of numerous online references to a subject be considered reason for deletion of an article, where does this leave Wikipedia as a repository of unique online knowledge as opposed to simply a convenient clearing house for organizing information which is already online?</font> --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 04:45, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Further <b>comment</b>. I refer editors to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Deletion_policy/Archive_December_2004_to_August_2005#Notability_not_a_criterion_for_deletion.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Deletion_policy/Archive_December_2004_to_August_2005#Notability_not_a_criterion_for_deletion.3F" rel="nofollow">this discussion</a> on the Talk page of Wikipedia:Deletion policy, which suggests that non-notability is a contentious issue with many grey areas. Surely where an article is the product of serious research and writing and addresses a genuine subject, inclusion rather than exclusion is justified. I also further note that some of the Wikipedians voting for deletion seem to be prominent advocates of deletion of many articles, and I am troubled that people would want to go around destroying the legitimate work of others. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 13:30, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>comment</b> One newspaper article is not "serious research". If it <i>had</i> been seriously researched and referenced I wouldn't have as much of a problem with it. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 23:07, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your definition of serious research therefore requires quantity rather than quality? That, in fact, seems to be the main thrust of your original basis for listing this article for deletion - that there wasn't enough of various things, rather than looking at the quality of what was there. My own view on life leads me to look at how full the cup is, rather than how empty, and this of course leads me to be an <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism" class="extiw" title="m:Inclusionism">Inclusionist</a> rather than a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism" class="extiw" title="m:Deletionism">Deletionist</a>. There are really two issues going on here, and I think they need to be kept separate: (1) the quality (or quantity?) of referencing, verifiability etc; and (2) the notability / worthiness of the subject for inclusion no matter what the nature of the referencing. I have addressed both of these above, and won't labour the point further. Sarah Ewart, I don't see that your comment here adds anything to what you have already said, does it? --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 12:32, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, verifiability seems to require, by this standard, a certain quantity of sources without much regard for the quality of the sources. Remoteness in time is an adequate explanation for the comparative dearth of material on Choat compared with Ellis; historians constantly face this issue, and historical writing may be validly based upon a single source provided the source is comparatively reliable. The front page of the Queensland state newspaper would seem to be as reliable a source as could be under the circumstances, save possibly access to court papers which, given the nature of the case, are unlikely to be publicly available. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 12:32, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The Choat case is a vital link in any comprehensive treatment of the subject of sexually predatory female school teachers, and if it is deleted the remaining articles on the subject become less meaningful. I would not necessarily be against the suggestion of <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> to merge the relevant articles into an article on Australian female teacher paedophiles (or a similar article heading - I would probably prefer 'sexual predators' to 'paedophiles', as I believe it is more accurate in describing the motivation for these offences, though it is longer), as I had intended (in time) to write a supervening article tying the individual articles together; it might be more cumbersome to have everything together in one place, but it might avoid the constant worrying over notability which is upsetting some of the deletionists. I would prefer to have the separate articles remain and to eventually tie them together with a more general article; but I do not live on Wikipedia, and this would be something which would happen over a period of time. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 12:32, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I appreciate the interest and support of those Wikipedians and admins who see merit in this article. I want to stress that I have not contacted any of the people who have responded seeking their support, and genuinely appreciate the encouragement no matter the outcome. I would like to observe, by way of probably fairly final comment since the period for submission on this AfD is nearly over, that I do see the debate over this article as somewhat symptomatic of the larger debate in Wikipedia between inclusionists and deletionists. I wish there was not such a debate, to be quite honest. I would rather have invested the time spent on this page in more positive efforts actually writing or revising articles. The difficulty I have here is that, for inclusionists, we can spend hours on writing something only to have it destroyed in a moment; whereas deletionists will have no such concerns, since presumably they will stick so strictly to a narrower interpretation of what should be included that they will never chance to write something about a more obscure topic. (When I use the term 'more obscure', I do not mean 'less worthy'; it is simply the case that while, for example, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> will attract widespread interest, <a href="../../../h/a/_/Ha_Ri-su_68de.html" title="Ha Ri-su">Ha Ri-su</a> will be of interest to but a few, particularly in the English-speaking world). Can I be really provocative, discover if deletionists have a sense of humour about their viewpoint, and suggest that deletionism is actually a form of legitimized <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a>? In case someone takes too much exception to this comment, I hasten to state the obvious, that I am speaking somehwat tongue-in-cheek there - and yet my feelings, as opposed to my intellect, resonate with my suggestion. The beauty of Wikipedia, unlike print encyclopaedias, is that we are not constrained by the physical size of the published work, and this site can continue to grow to encompass the full range of human endeavours, accomplishments, deeds and misdeeds as well as every feature of the universe in which we live. I therefore would appeal to those inclined to delete the works of others to re-think and to adopt a policy of "live and let live", and to delete only patent nonsense and material which is clearly false.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In regard to this present article, I would suggest that it has found a significant readership among those researching more recent such cases which have featured in news reports, and if allowed to remain as part of a small but growing project on this topic, it will continue to do so. By nature, the subject of female teachers dealing with their students in the way that this lady and others like her have done has an interest, indeed perhaps a fascination in some cases, for many members of the community. Readers approaching Wikipedia for information on this subject will find an increasingly comprehensive treatment, and as on so many topics, Wikipedia will be the first online authority, gathering information from a range of print and electronic sources and synthesising it in one location. <font color="red">I would suggest that a deletionist approach will only render more distant the day when online researchers perhaps no longer make Google their first avenue of investigation, but rather turn straight to Wikipedia. Is this not what we would want for this amazing online resource? This is only one article we are discussing, but I believe this debate represents much more.</font> Thank you all for your time. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverWings_8087.html" title="User:SilverWings">SilverWings</a> 13:08, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
