Looking at the History page, it seems that the author is essentially the sole contributor, and the primary references are mostly his own published work.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The designation "vanity regulations" that are allegedly "violated" is made up by nominator. These are guidelines that are meant to help us determine when something is a vanity article. In this case, even though written by the originator of the theory, I don't think it qualifies as such. Editors are strongly discouraged from writing about their own work, but there is no <i>rule</i> forbidding this, and it does not <i>automatically</i> disqualify the article. The search term ["self creation cosmology" OR "self creation cosmologies" -wikipedia -answers.com] gets 131 unique Google hits, and 59 Google scholar citations. The article is referenced and written from a reasonably neutral point of view, and might have been written by anyone sufficiently familiar with this work. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:20, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't see the issue here as vanity. It is true that WP <i>does not absolutely forbid</i> an author writing or contributing to an article about himself or his own work, but the only exclusion that I would see for that is when the work is notable, has been widely reviewed and accepted by neutral parties elsewhere and the author, say, wants to make corrections in the article (since obviously he would know the subject matter best). In this case, however, I cannot find any objective reviews, wide acceptance or even awareness in the published literature of this work. If the article is kept, it would be a clear case of WP itself promoting a non-notable subject that was not properly reviewed by neutral 3rd parties, which I believe goes against the basic principles of WP's mission. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 13:00, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, you wrote <i>per nom</i>, which suggested that you agreed with nominator's deletion rationale: "violation" of "vanity regulations" and "essentially original research". No reference there to notability. To start with the OR issue: if someone else had written the article, just reporting on this theory, it would not have qualified as OR. Why should it become OR when the reporter happens to be the originator of the theory? Then, why should the work "have been accepted by neutral parties elsewhere"? We have plenty of articles on theories for which this does not hold. As long as <i>our</i> reporting is neutral, it is fine. The present article does not attempt to suggest that the theory is widely accepted. On the contrary, it is pretty obvious, just from the text of the article, that the theory has <i>not</i> been widely accepted. In that sense, the reporting is quite neutral. The text also makes clear that the theory has unsolved problems. When the publications were peer reviewed, the reviewers (if they did their job) at least made sure that this was scientifically respectable, which includes distinguishing speculation as fact, not glossing over contrary evidence, and acknowledging other relevenat work. I did not try to trace the 60 or so scientific citations, but expect that among those some contain a critical review. It's not our business as Wikipedia to distinguish "good" theories and filter out the "bad" ones. If <i>others</i> claim a theory is bad, we report on that, within reason. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:33, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Regarding my 'per nom' statement, I guess I was relying on this aspect of <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a>: "The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created. If they are encyclopedic, somebody else will notice them and write an article about them."</li>
</ul>

<dd>In my subsequent comment, I continued the argument that even if we ignore the vanity aspects, we still have the issue of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original work</a> and lack or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable 3rd party evaluation</a>. I agree with you fully that WP should not judge technical merit of the actual subject, but we should judge the merit of the <i>evaluators</i> of the subject, since we can only accept <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and we must be able to judge <i>reliability</i>. In this case, I don't see any reliable, objective, neutral source that has evaluated this subject. If no such source can be found, then this article becomes <i>primary</i> or <i>secondary</i> at best, not the required <i>tertiary</i> level article that is needed for WP encyclopedic inclusion. Are there other articles in WP that don't pass these tests? More than likely, but it's our collective job to find them and either fix them up or delete them. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:01, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Take for example <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conformal_field_theory.html" title="Conformal field theory">Conformal field theory</a>. If there is a reliable, objective, neutral source that has "evaluated" this theory (or, rather, family of theories), our article does not mention it. I won't recommend deleting it, though; I'm confident the article could be "fixed up" by someone who has access to a good physics library and the requisite background to understand what they're reading. I think that the same holds for the subject of this article, what with sixty-odd citations. And I think that "evaluation" is not really necessary, at least not as I understand the term: how would one evaluate <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a>? It's not even wrong! --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:13, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we have <i>any</i> neutral reviewers, who are generally knowledgeable in the field of the the subject, who read and critique the subject paper (like typical peer reviewers) and the publisher of a reputable journal (in the scientific case) publishes the paper after that review, I would consider it properly reviewed by a reliable source. The reviewers do not necessarily have to <i>agree</i> with the author's position or results - they can provide a counter-position if they feel necessary. But if the publisher goes ahead after that peer review, and takes a chance on the reputation of the publishing house, then it becomes a legitimate secondary source. Then, assuming the journal has sufficient circulation to be notable, we as WP can pick up the article at the tertiary level. If we shortcut that process by accepting an article that did not undergo the peer review, then WP would stop being an encyclopedia IMO. Again, the issue is not merit per se, it is the need for WP to see some reputable publisher with neutral and capable reviewers review and publish the article before we do. In the case of String Theory, if hypothetically it just came out yesterday, WP would not and should not be the first to publish it, as tempting as it may seem. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 21:51, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I believe they are, good point. I still feel queasy about letting the inventor write the article per above, and it is, by definition <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original work</a>, but I guess these apparent reviews do mitigate the situation somewhat.

<dd>I think your interpretation of "original research" is too wide. "Original research" as anathema on Wikipedia means that Wikipedia is used as the medium to introduce and publish a new theory. But here we have a report on a theory that other sources have published before. These sources are "reliable" according to the criteria used on Wikipedia. Although the <i>subject</i> of the article is research that is arguably original, the article <i>itself</i> is not "original research".</dd>
<dd>As to the reliability of the peer review system, the <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Hendrik_Sch%C3%B6n_46a7.html" title="Jan Hendrik Schön">Schön scandal</a> involved fraud in experimental physics, which is an entirely different matter. Here we have theoretical physics, where there is the <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogdanov_affair.html" title="Bogdanov affair">Bogdanov affair</a>. A published paper in this area might be a hoax, but it can hardly be fraud, since there are no lab reports or anything: all is in the open. But reviewers may fail to notice unbridged gaps or improper appeals to theorems. In any case, we as Wikipedians should not attempt to correct or outguess the experts who do the peer review. Everyone knows or should know that the fact that a statement is published in a peer-reviewed medium does not make it true. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:06, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree in general with all your points. My main concern is that with pure theory, based on math and assumptions that are not manifestly self evident (I would assume to most people), it is quite possible that there are errors in the derivation and hence the results could be quite flawed. Of course this is always true, but more so when it seems that less eyes and brains have digested and seriously critiqued the contents. I think an encycopedia, as a tertiary source, should steer clear of these scenarios and should strive as much as possible to have a neutral person (ideally persons) <i>presenting</i> the article. In this specific case we have the original author/inventor presenting, which is fraught with risks, even if we assume (as I do by default) best intentions, integrity and honesty. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 20:02, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> to Garthbarber: You seem to have a misunderstanding about WP inclusion criteria. You say we should "wait until the result of the Gravity Probe B geodetic precession is published (April 2007) until deciding". This is totally immaterial. Nowhere in WP policies are we to judge technical merit or base inclusion directly on results of experiments. Your 3rd party reference does seem OK, and seems to establish both notability and secondary sourcing. My main concern is with the fact that by you presenting the work here essentially exclusively, it constitutes <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original work</a>, and to some extent <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a>, which are frowned upon, though are not absolute barriers to acceptability. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutrality</a> also becomes an issue, in principle, when the inventor is the sole author of the article. It would have been so much better from WP's perspective if a colleague could have presented the work, with you providing critique and correcting errors. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 11:34, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Re: waiting until April 2007, as suggested above by Garthbarber: a (hypothetical) article X about an unnotable topic that then asked us to wait until the topic became verifiably notable at some future time would probably fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>.

<li><b>Ambivalent keep</b>. While I agree in principle with most of the above delete remarks, in practice on Wikipedia it is really hard to delete articles about non-notable crackpot theories. So why delete an article about a non-crackpot but fringe theory with a real publication record? I think instead the article ideally ought to be cleaned up by someone to conform with NPOV. Although I am realistic about the chances of that actually happening, I still can't support its outright deletion. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke</a> 14:52, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have been aware of this for some time and have expressed concern about the "conflict of interest" inherent in Garth writing about his own research. I haven't mustered interest/time/energy to get hold of original sources and study them so I can form my own opinion about whether his description violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, but I do have the superficial impression that he has been well-behaved (e.g. not spamming other articles) and don't recall noticing anything which suggested to me that he is editing in bad faith or anything like that. Still, I'd be a lot happier of someone was willing to take the time to look more carefully than I have into this. I also wish I had the sense that Garth is going to declare the article complete at some point. FWIW, I think the outcome should of this AfD should probably be reported as <i>inconclusive</i>, reserving the right to nominate it again without prejudice if problems should develop (which I hope won't happen since we have enough trouble from other quarters in the physics/cosmology categories).---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 09:52, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>IMO you can help the article <i>significantly</i> if you can button-hole a colleague and get him/her to review it and then edit boldly where necessary.
