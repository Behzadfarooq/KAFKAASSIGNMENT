<li>I'm open to discussion here, but my instinct would be to refactor any well-cited material that is not elsewhere, and <b>delete</b> this, along with other articles like <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Muslims_d2ab.html" title="Historical persecution by Muslims">Historical persecution by Muslims</a>, Historical persecution by Atheists, and <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Christians_a939.html" title="Historical persecution by Christians">Historical persecution by Christians</a>. All of these seem to me to rely on muddled categories: they pick out a broad religious affiliation, and then seek out persecutors who happen to be of that affiliation. And "persecution" is such a loaded word all around, especially when applied (as it is here) to a private citizen spitting at someone. I could imagine a useful article on human rights of non-Jews in Israel (which seems the real thrust of this), but not one focused primarily on violations of those rights. If violations are prevalent, that would come out in such an article; if not, so would that. More drastically, on a related article, even in a contemporary context, any coverage of "Muslims" ranges from Indonesia to Saudi Arabia. It's hard for me to imagine that any meaningful pattern of persecution ranges over such divergent societies. All worthwhile material here should be regrouped in ways that don't lend themselves to one-sided articles, whether this is organized by time-period, or on some other principle. <b>I don't usually monitor AFD these days</b> (although I'll watchlist this page), but if someone wants to nominate any of these related articles for deletion, you may feel free to contact me via my talk page, and I will cast essentially the same vote on any of them. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:24, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Let me be bold: there's no need for an article that basically has nothing to cover. Jews might not be better than other people, but "religious persecution" seems not to be one of their flaws. I can see that the article itself admits that (at least in my interpretation?) but our tendency to try to write something educated about everything turns this acknowledgment into a pretty awkward text. Also, why do some people always have to mix everything in the same bag? — <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillel_029a.html" title="User:Hillel">Hillel</a> 12:23, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>D</b>elete. Spitting attacks are persecution? The fact that the State of Israel may be doing things that some would call persecution does not equate with "Jews", as these acts are not performed as a function of the state's "Jewish identity" but for political reasons.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> under new name (Historical treatment of non-Jews by Jews). While all Jews are obviously different, this is a facet of Judaism that's absolutely substantial enough to write about by itself. Things it could note: Biblical commands to wipe out Amalekites, Canaanites, etc.; any findings on how those of other religions were treated under the Maccabean Kingdom and later; how apostates and non-Jews have historically been treated and are treated today (e.g., see if we can find news stories about tolerance toward and/or ostracism of those who "went off the path", and instructions from halachic authorities such as the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> on how to deal with such heretics); non-Jews' status in Israel; and non-Jews' status under traditional, Conservative, Reform, and other variants of Jewish law. There's a great deal to discuss here, every bit encyclopedic, and it shouldn't be thrown away just because the current content is incomplete.
<p>For those who've noticed the remarkable prevalence of Jews here, I would like to note that <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">User:IZAK</a> e-mailed me to point out this page, which of course doesn't show up on his edit history. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 18:41, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm confused as to why you moved the article to that new title. The contents have little to do with the new title, and it doesn't seem to make sense to move articles while they're being discussed in AfD. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 18:53, 20 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(Put before IZAK's earlier comment to make the indentation less confusing:) The contents were a subset of the topic covered by the new title, since persecution of non-Jews by Jews is inherently a subset of the historical treatment of non-Jews by Jews. Articles should never present only one side of a story, and therefore I moved the article to a name that didn't inherently restrict the article to one side of a story. And since articles are routinely edited during AFDs, and regularly are kept due to their improvement over the course of the AFD, I see no problem with moving pages either. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 06:15, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have reversed Simetrical's highly manipulative move there, which he should <i>not</i> have done as long as this vote is underway. Furthermore, Simetrical needs to apologize very quickly here and now for his highly offensive comment that "...For those who've noticed the remarkable prevalence of Jews here..." which is totally disgusting and out of line. What is he saying, that Jews should "shut up"&#160;? This just reinforces the need to delete articles of this nature that are poisonous magnets that attract the wrong kind of misinformed and twisted debate and responses. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:29, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Again, I would like to know why moving a page under AFD should be verboten any more than editing it. And I'm certainly not apologizing for commenting on there being a remarkable prevalence of Jews here, because there <i>is</i>. How on Earth is that offensive? Stop trying to suggest that anyone who disagrees with you is an anti-Semite—you've lost an RFAr on that already for good reason.
<p>I was pointing out that you were electioneering, nothing more. You deliberately attempted to skew the proportion of Jews to non-Jews here to well over normal levels, thereby making the vote unrepresentative, and you know it. Don't get upset where you're called out. Not that such electioneering is necessarily prohibited on Wikipedia, but it could be taken into account by the closing admin if the vote were closer than it is. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 06:15, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Simetrical: There is process and method and then there is meaning and intent. While there may be disagreement about what is the best process and method on Wikipedia, there is no disagreement about the meaning and intent of the phrase you used "...For those who've noticed the remarkable prevalence of Jews here..." which you now compound (for the worse) by saying "...You deliberately attempted to skew the proportion of Jews to non-Jews here to well over normal levels..." (implying that Wikipedia works with some sort of racial or religious "quota system", which it does not). Most impartial and knowledgeable people would say your comments are truly unfortunate and VERY nasty, to say the least. I have not and did not use the words "anti-Semite" here and I have not accused you of being one (so quit playing "victim" please). I merely brought your attention to the fact that you continue to make tasteless and disgusting slurs, considered insulting by many people -- not just Jews -- that would be deemed beneath contempt and not to be uttered in polite company, which you should apologize for, and not, as you continue to do, reinforce and self-righteously "justify". Furthermore, you make it sound that I am running for some sort of office by using the word "electioneering" which is all rather strange. Oh, and I am not getting upset, do you think I should be? <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 07:34, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Though in most, if not all, groups there are those who are prejudiced against outsiders, and you could definitely dredge up a few incidents, most of the material in this article is at best tangential to the topic of contemporary persecution of non-Jews by Jews, concentrating on the State of Israel instead. Whoever wrote this article could have at least bothered to look up the views of the various Jewish groups and movements on the topic.

<dd>A group can be both persecutor and persecuted in different times or circumstances.
