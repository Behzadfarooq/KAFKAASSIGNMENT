<p>What is this article?? It appears to try to list everyone whose age either at the present or at death is 108 or 109 and has a large majority of the links ghost links. 66.245.118.178 00:35, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I would like to point out that user 65.93.29.176 has fanatically pounded out MORE THAN 100 EDITS IN THE LAST FIVE DAYS, most involving the subjects of longevity. While some edits have been useful, user 65.93.29.176 has consistently favored the "myth of aging" discourse, plagiarized Guinness World Records and other sources, and refused to respond to requests for using th talk or discussion boards. I move that User 65.93.29.176 be warned that continued activities that favor anti-science positions, coupled with a refusal to discuss, cooperate, or even identify hismelf should result in a current warning of possible future suspensions of rights. <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 18:25, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>First of all...I gave permission to use the list if the source is cited, so deleting the source is not a good solution. Second...if it's currently in order of age (109 years 364 days, 109 years 358 days etc), why not just keep it in the order that it's in?</p>
<p>However, the biggest argument is, if you are going to list people aged 109, why not list the 870+ people aged 110+? <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 17:47, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>THERE ARE OVER 135,000 living people worldwide aged 100 and over. BY 2050 the number should be 4 million. Age 100 is not in itself notable, which is why age 110 has become the new standard. I only agree with lising "famous centenarians" such as Bob Hope. <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 17:49, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Whether being a centenarian makes a person notable or not (and I disagree with the assertion that it does, especially as it becomes more common with better medicine) is, I think, irrelevant to the discussion of a list of such people. Notability would matter regarding the individual articles about specific people, but a list isn't automatically worthy of being kept (or compiled to begin with) simply because many, most, or even all, of the listed items are deserving of articles on an individual basis. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 16:35, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, rename and reformat</b>. People over 100 years old are certainly encyclopedic, but "nearly supercentenarian" is not specific enough. The article should set a specific boundary (probably 100 years) as arbitrary cut-off. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 14:21, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You are missing the whole point. The U.S. currently has 50,000 centenarians, Japan has 25,000. Age 100 in itself is NOT NOTABLE. I think age 110 might be, but we don't even have a list of 110 or older (yet). So why is there a list of "almost 110" if no list of "110+". Second, "Almost supercentenarians" means "almost." What is almost? For my list, I defined the cutoff point as anyone within 90 days of reaching age 110 (or 75% of the way from age 109 to age 110), since some people like to "round up" ages. However, this copier has added in people aged less than 109.75 years, some as young as 107. Since only 6% of people aged 107 reach age 110, I certainly would NOT consider age 107 to be "almost" 110. Incidentally, Japan currently has 101 people aged 108 or over, living, not to mention the deceased. The number of people who died at age 108 or 109 worldwide can be estimated at 3,480 (assuming 50% death rates at age 108 and 109, based on validated list of 870 people reaching age 110).</li>
</ul>
<p>Then of course, maybe we could have a list of baseball pitchers who "almost" won 300 games, football teams that "almost" won the SuperBowl, people that "almost" died in the WTC. I decline to vote because I think a list in order of age wouldn't be too bad, but there should be at minimum source links and a consistent pattern of organization (either by age, by chronological order with an age minimum, or by alphabetical order with age minimum). <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 18:08, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> If there's a List of people who are nearly centenarians, can't there be a list of people who are nearly supercentenarians? --<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.93.29.176 (<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.93.29.176.html" title="User talk:65.93.29.176">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__65.93.29.176_9d15.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 65.93.29.176">contribs</a>) 17:08, 23 October 2005.</small></li>
<li>Comment. One difference is that the list of people who are nearly centenarians is a list of famous people, plus there seems to be a minimum age point of 99 for that list. Consequently, the "list of people who are nearly supercentenarians" is mostly a list of people famous only for old age, with a few "famous" cases thrown in. My problem is not with the list per se, but user 65.93.29.176, who based on his massive time available, infatuation with stats, and immaturity (refusing to discuss issues with others, or to see both sides of an issue) suggests he is a teenager. The list, if kept, should be formatted according to a pre-set standard of who qualifies: age 109? Age 109.5? What is "nearly?" Second, shouldn't a "list of people who are supercentenarians" be tried first, to see whether it would float as a viable entity? Third, if kept, the list should either be formatted, as stated, by alphabetical order, chronological order, or by age (oldest first). The World Almanac lists tallest buildings in order of height, and highest mountains in order of height. Baseball's 300-game winners are listed in order of victories. The problem is not a list per se, but whether it is organized according to systematic criteria or no.172.159.204.208 19:13, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
