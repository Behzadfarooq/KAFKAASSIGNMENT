<p>Beneath all the school in-jokes, all the article effectively says is "this person is a school teacher". However good he is, and however much his students (dis)like him, that is not enough - see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I cannot find any external references to the "numerous historical works" he is said to have published. Google entries that refer to him are, on the whole, copies of this article. (There are a couple of quotations in newspaper articles, but not enough to justify his inclusion as an educational commentator). The one book mentioned in the article ("A Berger: Memoirs" - Adrian Berger, Defton Press 2006 ISBN 0-441-59445) is not to be found through Google or Amazon and may well be a hoax. If it were simply that the article is poorly written and contains lots of material that is unashamedly said to be "unlikely to be true, and ... difficult to verify", I would have a go at cleaning up the article. But there would be nothing worth saving afterwards - hence my AfD nomination. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBencherlite_72d5.html" title="User:Bencherlite">Bencherlite</a> 22:58, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep some of it, delete the rest</b> Adrian Berger is someone I know reasonably well. I have to disagree with some of these points that you all have stated. Yes, there seems to be some very unbelievable "facts," which he himself has informed me of, but let me just explain that there are some things that are 100% true in this article, and it would be a shame to delete them:</li>
</ul>
<p>1) Adrian Berger has told me that he does have a FIFTY-FIRST STATE CAMPAIGN. He is planning to make England a fifty-first state of America. His slogans are - "You can go further with Berger," and "You'll have no beef with Berger," just as the article states. 2) Adrian Berger is planning to write a book, called "Hays for Defence," which he says will take him several years to write. It will be a sort of biography on Arthur Garfield Hays, a well-known lawyer in the 20th Century. 3) He does have an eccentric teaching style, integrating into his lessons "Berger" minutes, an improvised time length, and incorporating signs into the sessions, such as the DOUBLE V, a typical American victory symbol, something that he explained personally to me.</p>
<p>Do not delete all of this article. There is some truth in it, but not all of it is correct. Keep in the elements of the text that I have confirmed as factual information, please, because Adrian Berger is the most enthuastic and knowledgable historian that I have ever met, with a most interesting background, directly linked to WWII. Do you not think that his life deserves to be recorded?

<dd><b>Comment</b> Although the above comment was apparently written by an IP user, it is more likely to be from Oliverelholiby who left the same comments on the article talk page, which I suggested would be better here. (I have left a message on his talk page suggesting he uses ~~~~ to sign messages.)

<dd><b>Reply</b> Oliver, the fact is that this encyclopaedia is <b>not</b> a free-for-all. There are rules and regulations about what goes on here. And, no matter how fantastic Mr Berger is (and I concur heartily, having engaged in many a witty repartée with him in my day), if he fails the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability criteria</a>, then little else matters. I know you may respect Mr Berger very highly, enjoy his lessons thoroughly, and admire him greatly for being such an eccentric figure, but he doesn't belong here. Besides, are not Messrs Worrall, Burcher, Bryant, Johnson, Tillett, Perrott, Bish etc etc not just as worthy? Would you also create encyclopaedic entries on <i>all</i> of these great men? If you <i>really</i> want to document KEGS teachers, then a KEGS wiki would be a place to do that (let me know if you are hell-bent on doing so - I could lend an expert hand!)
