<li><b>Strong Keep</b> High schools are inherently notable, as I argue in my new, expanded essay <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_opinions_6a18.html" title="User:Noroton/opinions">here</a>, but why is an intern on the Jon Stewart show notable?

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article reads like a directory entry. There is nothing in the article to indicate that the school is in any way notable as required by <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Noroton. Nicely written little article shows the school exists and fills its mission in a way beneficial to it community. Also seems to have some notable alums, which common sense says makes it notable. I would have checked this against <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> but someone has tagged that as "rejected" and nothing at the supposedly relevant guideline <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> addresses schools. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 22:58, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment: News flash</b> Take a look at the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_school.html" title="Alternative school">Alternative school</a> article in Wikipedia and what do you see? A picture of Great Neck Village School, put there well before this deletion discussion. Is there anything particularly notable about the school that gets its picture on that page? Well, yes: It happens to be one of the oldest alternative schools in the United States, founded in 1970. Read the first few lines of the Alternative schools article. So here we have one of the oldest examples of the type. I'd say that's pretty notable. I added a new third paragraph to the article to reflect that. Also, alternative schools tend to be small by design, so I don't think that should be a criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:24, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Maybe this AfD will also bring some visibility to the contributions of User:209.177.21.6, who has added many dubious or unsourced statements to Great Neck school and other articles. She has said that she is a high school student there, and she was the one who added the 1970s text to <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_school.html" title="Alternative school">alternative school</a>. I am assuming she made up this "fact" on the spot, and chose this year because that was when the school was founded. Clearly we can't rely on this statement to conclude that Village School is one of the oldest alternative schools in the U.S. That claim would require some sort of scholarly reference. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 04:40, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I just found a pretty good reference at the Great Neck Public Schools web site ("The Village School, which was established in 1970, is one of the nation's oldest and most successful alternative high schools.").

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Village school is an important landmark in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Neck_a6ae.html" title="Great Neck">Great Neck</a> and provides a small localized education for a smaller group of students. Alternative schools are always smaller then 'regular' schooling and would receive less publicity and less articles about it. If it was a significantly better school than <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Neck_South_High_School_8c80.html" title="Great Neck South High School">Great Neck South High School</a> then people would request to go there in greater numbers and it would be forced to become a 3rd main general ed high school in Great Neck, but it has a specific purpose and it does that purpose very well. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMacMan_b672.html" title="User:MrMacMan">MrMacMan</a> 04:24, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> I think Village School should be deleted because there's nothing important about that school. It's never been rated in Newsweek Magazine's recent listing of "America's Best High Schools". I feel that Village School is like in a complete different universe than South or North. Village School have different rules...first the students are allowed to be disrespectful to their teachers...i.e. calling their teachers by their first names...that's messed up...as children we were always taught to call teachers by their last names. And now the VS can do it...The Great Neck School district is a hypocrite...they teach us as children to always call teachers by their last names...if we don't it's disrespectful. Village School has no problem for students to call their teachers by their first names. What is this school district teaching our children?

Tons of schools aren't on the 'America's best high schools' list. Possibly disrespecting teachers cannot be argued by you since you aren't a teacher. Saying 'that's messed up' isn't a valid argument.
