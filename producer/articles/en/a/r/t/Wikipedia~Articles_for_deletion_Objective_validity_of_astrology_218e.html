<p>Fundamental concern is that this is a POV-fork used as a platform to present questionable, obscure astrological research that would not pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> on a more frequented page. The one entry here that has received sufficient attention to warrant Wiki-coverage is the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars_effect.html" title="Mars effect">Mars effect</a>, which has its own page. The main <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> article has a <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html#The_objective_validity_of_astrology" title="Astrology">section</a> which can be expanded somewhat to include any other critical points. We have an <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology_and_astronomy.html" title="Astrology and astronomy">astrology and astronomy</a> to boot, which we can use if we really need comparative analysis. The page is also a gawdawful mess which is constantly being reverted over. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 16:05, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Cited sources appear unreliable, and in any case this is more than adequately covered at <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html#The_objective_validity_of_astrology" title="Astrology">Astrology#The_objective_validity_of_astrology</a>. I see no evidence that the complexity of the argumewnt warrants a separate article, and past history indicates that this is just a venu for <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_pleading.html" title="Special pleading">special pleading</a>. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 16:25, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The history of the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a> page and this one indicate that there was a need to create a separate article exactly because of the issues being argued. The Astrology page was getting too big, hence the creation in April 2005. The title is already implicitly questioning the objective validity of astrology, so if it's a POV-fork, it can only be a <i>scientific</i> POV-fork, which is not what the described issue is. The "fundamental concern" referred to in the opening is a concern only of those editors who oppose the presentation of arguments for the objective validity of astrology. The main Astrology article cannot be expanded to give sufficient coverage to this topic: the objective validity article is already too long in itself. In fact the possibility of creating an <i>astrological research</i> page has just surfaced due to the amount of material still not included and the size of the article. The <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology_and_astronomy.html" title="Astrology and astronomy">Astrology and astronomy</a> article doesn't deal with the objective validity of astrology. To think that the complexity of the argument doesn't warrant a separate page is to ignore numerous researchers spending lifetimes on attempting to determine astrology's objective validity, and then leagues of other researchers arguing about the results for decades. I agree that editing the page is a "gawdawful mess which is constantly being reverted over" -- mostly by Marskell and Jefffire, without discussion. Let me also point out that this AfD was also brought about without input from the other editors. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 18:12, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article only got big because there was a drive by proponents of astrology to make <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_pleading.html" title="Special pleading">special pleading</a> arguments to counter the scientific perspective. This is not what Wikipedia is for. The objective reality section in the main article appears to me to be both balanced and sufficient. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:38, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I appreciate your point; however, the implication is hard to accept without specific examples. This is an extremely complex subject as I'm sure you realize, and a few paragraphs cannot do justice to it in my opinion. What's the point of deleting over a year's worth of hard work? If the article doesn't conform to certain policies or guidelines, I invite you and all editors interested in and knowledgeable about this subject to come and join us in our work until it does meet all required standards. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 00:19, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually I don't think it is extremely complex.

It's a POV title for some <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_pleading.html" title="Special pleading">special pleading</a> and really has to go.

<li><i>I don't think it [the objective validity of astrology] is extremely complex</i>: How deeply have you studied astrology to be able to make this statement? It took Geoffrey Dean (PhD DIC ARCS analytical chemist, science writer, astrologer, and also the foremost skeptic on astrology) and company (50 astrologers and scientists) 7 man-years of effort to compile just 77 years of research on natal astrology alone (which is just one branch of astrology). The result was a 600-page, highly condensed, encyclopedic book. They summarized over 300 astrology books, 400 journal articles and 300 scientific works. He writes: <i>"[Astrology] today [in 1977]... has a vast burgeoning literature"</i>, and <i>"The subject is very a big one and the result is a very big book... about 250,000 words."</i> Researchers have been arguing about the Mars effect for decades. Simple topic?</li>
<li><i>None of the evidence presented here stands up to that</i>: To what, the scientific method or objective validity? What are you basing your opinion on? As it stands now, this is a blanket statement without presenting evidence.</li>
<li><i>POV title</i>: Most astrologers don't question the objective validity of astrology - scientists, skeptics and debunkers do, so, if anything, the title is SPOV.

<li>That astrologers don't question the objective validity of astrology is completely irrelevant and a poor reason for the title change.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia readers know that astrology is a controversial subject and expect to read details about both sides of the controversy. This article, on who has attempted to validate or invalidate astrology, provides this. In the article readers expect to see names like Gauquelin, Hill, Carlson, Dean, Kelly, Urban-Lurain, Tarnus, and Nanninga. That is what makes any encyclopedia worth reading. Don't take away the knowledge and the views that have been gathered for this article. This information needs to go somewhere. If this article didn't already exist, it would need to be created. Most of the objection here is over sources. Probably the most objected to source is the peer-reviewed British journal <i>Correlation</i> published by the University of Southampton. Although this source is used by both sides pro and con, it has been described (by Jefffire) as no better a source than a tabloid. Ask yourself before you vote if this is reasonable. The anti-validity side has used many questionably sources, such as web articles and blogs. Instead of creating a controversy over sources, the anti-validity side should participate in the examination of the methods and findings, as the validity side has done.<a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 18:42, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Both sides are already presented at <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a>.

<li>The main <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> article presents opinion but does not explain how those opinions came about. This is an interesting and complex issue that involves many people with strongly held views and half a century of research. The pro-keep editors are strongly in favor of bringing the two sides of this controversy (since they have much to say about each other) closer together, working through POV issues, and merging the information based on consensus. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 01:10, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Consensus is that, per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, the article should reflect orthodox opinion, which is that astrology has no objective scientific validity. That is a very simple conept to get across, and is stated in carefully neutral terms in <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a>. I really don't see any need to have a long he-said-she-said ramble which amounts to much the same thing but with all kinds of red herrings trailed across it. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:02, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The page is in pretty poor condition and needs to be improved substantially, but there does need to be a centralized page for some of the information and arguments contained in it, regardless of how bogus they may be, and the main astrology article is not the place to do it. There is going to be another page like this one if it is deleted, so I'm not really sure what the point of deleting it would be except to start fresh perhaps.

<li><b>Keep</b> though the title should definitely change. Perhaps "Attempts to prove or disprove objectively valid in astrology" or "Research into the empirical validity of astrology." The title as it stands appears to set up an expectation that objective validity will be proven in the content. The comments by the editors when they remove or edit sections indicate this expectation - all these calls to 'prove it' and the responses of astrologers who think they are 'proving it'. It strikes me as very odd that people think an online encyclopedia, where contributors are largely anonymous and of any possible educational background, is the place to decide upon the 'objective validity' of a phenomenon. Give only the data that reflects the state of affairs of the astrology world and let people do as they will. The article much needs work to remove exactly what is strikingly POV, but it does reflect attempts to find some type of validity to astrology - some of which appear to be important enough to astrologers and skeptics alike, having a significant contribution to how people think about astrology. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 00:27, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It seems to me there are two approaches in this controversy, there are the <i>validationists</i>, who claim to have found no positive results, and there are the <i>empiricists,</i> who claim to have found positive results. The validationists want to compare astrology to some authoritative modern standard such as self-reporting questionnaires (<a href="../../../p/e/r/Personality_tests.html" title="Personality tests">personality tests</a>) and the charts or interpretations of the charts are always matched 1:1. The belief here is that a chart at any point in time is a set of fixed values with only one necessary outcome and (when questionnaires are used) that people can accurately assess themselves. The empiricists carry on the astrological tradition of collecting exemplary cases and looking for strong chart patterns. The modern approach is to collect a lot of charts and use statistical analysis. The belief here is that a chart at any point in time is a set of variables (because this is what you see in astrology texts), each of which can have numerous related values, but the values approach each other when closer to the most exemplary cases, thus there are patterns. How about structuring the article in this manner, showing the validationists versus the empiricists? <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 14:42, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's fine to make this distinction. But I think the whole issue over keeping or deleting the contents of this article is the product of a categorical mistake. The title leads editors to believe that the purpose of the article is to give evidence that proves or disproves astrology. I think the content (merged or retitled) should be kept because it reflects the state of affairs on studies of astrology, and that it falls under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>'s <b>Popular culture</b> category. The same mistake is being made on articles dealing with topics pertaining to philosophy of science or sociology (such as pathological skepticism) rather than scientific research. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeusnoos_5320.html" title="User:Zeusnoos">Zeusnoos</a> 15:33, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you may be right about this being <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> <b>Popular culture</b>, with regard to the sources anyway. One study was extremely lucky to get an article published in <i>Nature</i> by some fluke, when the whole controversy was very immature at the beginning. That's not likely to be repeated. Most of this controversy takes place in books, and articles in <i>Skeptical Inquirer</i> or astrological society journals. It rarely goes above this level. A few weeks ago Objective validity of astrology was very POV with 90% arguments against astrology. This has changed now. <a href="../../../p/i/p/User%7EPiper_Almanac_a5f6.html" title="User:Piper Almanac">Piper Almanac</a> 02:33, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, now instead of being very POV with 90% arguments against astrology, it's very POV with mainly apologia in favour of astrology. It's a POV see-saw, and at root there is a basic problem that there is not that much which can be said about the scientific view of astrology - science views it as bunk. Of course astrologers don't, but that's what the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> article is about. What's been published is not "research" in the sense it would be understood by any scientist, but opinion; there is no shortage of that but to represent it as research is silly.

<li>JzG: Why do you feel a need to push your POV? You have stated your opinion in your first post already. What is the value being added by repeating it over and over?

How can an article treating a small subset of the main <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a> article can be considered a POV-fork? In order to help you prepare your brief and to-the-point answer, let me quote the first two sentences from <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>: <i>"A content fork is usually an unintentional creation of several separate articles all <b>treating the same subject</b>.

<dd>Aquirata, at this point, the article is being <i>deliberately</i> used to present a laundry list of any possible study you and Piper can find that astrologers have performed supporting your POV. Because the main Astology could not and should not accomodate the content, this constitutes a fork. It's an indiscriminate collection of info, a soapbox giving undue weight to one POV, reliant on dubious sources, and riddled with OR phrasing. That is, it violates all of NOT, NPOV, V and NOR. We need to it tie up in a sac weighted with rocks and throw it over-board. <i>Perhaps</i> something like it will need re-creatingâ€”but this page, with this content, is not going to get us there. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 13:18, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Precisely. "Objective validity" is the language of science, but science pretty much universally rejects the validity of astrology. I see no reason why it can't be treated like other belief systems. We do not have an article on the "objective validity of Christianity" (thankfully), and the ones we have on things like creationism make it perfectly clear that, while proponents may use the language of science, science as a whole rejects the idea. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:03, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your analysis is wrong, take a look at the original version of this article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Objective_validity_of_astrology&amp;oldid=12726640" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Objective_validity_of_astrology&amp;oldid=12726640" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which I created and you will see that it had fairly balanced sized sections on the for and against sides. Both sides of the argument were taken here so they could be given the fair treatment to both sides that a controvertial subject deserves without dominating the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a> article. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 20:05, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This article is so far from balanced it isn't even remotely funny. It violates just about every policy in the book. Undue weight, reliable sources, NPOV...you name it. An utter disgrace. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 20:14, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is an argument for cleanup and balancing not for deletion. Pages exist which describe both sides of an argument, see <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existence_of_God_57c6.html" title="Existence of God">Existence of God</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/g/Arguments_for_and_against_drug_prohibition.html" title="Arguments for and against drug prohibition">Arguments for and against drug prohibition</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 08:54, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That was just a comment on the page now. As it stands the only notable part is the Mars effect, which has its own article. Coupled with it having become a POV fork is the main reason for it's deletion. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 10:46, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again this is not an argument for deletion. It once summarised argument for and against under those categories as the two pages above do. It should be returned to that state. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 11:14, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is rather what I had attempted to do, but was prevented at all points by pro-astrology editors. In any case what are the notable points are now found at the main Astrology article, so I see no need to retain this article. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 14:12, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
