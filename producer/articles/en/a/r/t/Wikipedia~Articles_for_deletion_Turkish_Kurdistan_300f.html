<dd>Well, Kurdistan by definition is a geographic region, and it spans several countries. This is different from <i>Kurds here and there</i>, since the term <i>Kurd</i> refers to a group of people not a region. So Turkish Kurdistan which is a region can not be redirected to <i>Kurds in Turkey</i>, a group of people. It's like redirecting apples to oranges.<a href="../../../h/e/j/User%7EHeja_helweda_5867.html" title="User:Heja helweda">Heja Helweda</a> 23:13, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Diyako, Kurdish ethnicity and culture are everywhere in Turkey. Except for the Black Sea region, there is hardly any city in Turkey without a Kurdish population. There are more Kurds in Istanbul, Izmir, Ankara combined than in whole SE Turkey. You are promoting seperatist undertones in Wikipedia. There is no good faith to assume.--<a href="../../../a/d/k/User%7EAdkagansu_ab98.html" title="User:Adkagansu">Kagan the Barbarian</a> 23:39, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is becoming pathologic, and POV pushers don't expect me to even answer. Turkish Kurdistan is an accepted term, it IS an encyclopedic term, it is a term which has been used for quite some time, just like terms 'Ottoman Armenia' or 'Russian Armenia.' And for those googlers that relies on google to establish the notability of a term, Lord Kinross, which Turkish nationalists like to quote in every given occasion that Ataturk is cricised DO call it such, a discussion published in The Geographical Journal Vol. 122, No. 2 (June., 1956) p. 166, Lake Van and Turkish Kurdistan: A Botanical Journey: Discussion by James Marshall-Cornwall; Lord Kinross attest to that. This Wikipedia-wide Turkish ultranationalism is really becoming a disease. Just recently Smyrnas material allegedly under the pretext of dumping it to be merged on Izmir, ended up as a pretext to DELETE the entire section regarding the fire. That they have sliced the criticism on Ataturk pages, that they have gotten parasitically involved in Greek, Armenian and Kurdish matters as far as screwing and scrapping the Armenian genocide article is not enought, they even had to recruit ultranationalists. BTW Coolcat, you were right on one thing, you indeed were not Karabekir, your alter ego Tommiks was, the Tommiks who rearranged, sliced and screwed the entire integrity of the Ottoman Empire related articles and who worked in tandem with you. As for my ranting, sorry, I can't help it, after what I have learned in those two days about the 'Call for Turks' in the 10s Febuary, 2006, to invade those articles made my two days(I have my sources). Also, if I were you, I would start accumulating the evidences, since right now, I have 14 pages of evidences that would discredit you, Tommiks, Ottomanreference, Karabekir and some I'd like to not name here right now, for good..., so it would be a good idea for you to stop requesting Kurdish related articles deletions and start accumulating evidences against me, sine in few days my research will be completed <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 01:56, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't seen you even debate when articles such as anti-Turkism, which are not quite notable were created, have you even requested a merging with the article about Turkish people? Besides what you say doesn't make much sense, this article exist, the term is notable, and doesn't apear to be to be expended article. There are articles of three lines which are accepted and no one even question if they should be merged. STOP IT! Don't you guys not realise that this is WIKIPEDIA and an apolotical encyclopedia? You would be the first, if Greek, Armenian or Kurd nationalists were to go on searching after any Turkish related articles to remove or add whatever they want, but yet, THIS IS EXACTLY what is happening there with ultranationalists like you. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 02:20, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know what's going on; I've seen plenty of these things go down. The purpose of AfD is the use a polling format to bring out the best arguments for keeping or deleting an article in order to write the best encyclopedia we can. Since the discussion format <i>resembles</i> a vote, many people take it to be one, and believe that they can "win" by attracting superior numbers of "voters". However, majority doesn't rule in these discussions - the best arguments rule. A swarm of "votes" which add no <i>reasons</i> for keeping an article are not given equal weight with a handful of thoughtful, well-reasoned arguments that demonsrate understanding of the situation and of the relevant Wiki-policies and guidelines. The strongest argument I'm seeing given for deletion is that the article is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/Wikipedia%7EPOV_fork_3de8.html" title="Wikipedia:POV fork">POV fork</a> - a second article on the same topic as an existing one, presenting it from a different perspective.

<dd>This only proves that the article needs to be rewritten. The point is, as ChrisO noted, that the arguments are not the same; many Kurds do not live in Turkish Kurdistan, and many Turks <i>do</i> live in Turkish Kurdistan. And also there's the region's economy to treat, thing that can hardly be done adequately in <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurds_in_Turkey_c5e2.html" title="Kurds in Turkey">Kurds in Turkey</a>. This is my view.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 22:48, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Are you sure you are comprehending what I am saying? The region already has a name, it is geopoliticaly Southeastern Anatolia, historically Upper Mesopotamia. Turkish Kurdistan should be under these titles. It means nothing alone that you got 1,450,000 hits with Turkish Kurdistan, I googled "Irish Empire" and got 1,630,000 hits, I guess we need to create an Irish Empire article based on this, eh? Please, please, I praise reason and logic.--<a href="../../../a/d/k/User%7EAdkagansu_ab98.html" title="User:Adkagansu">Kagan the Barbarian</a> 10:39, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The argument of redirecting to <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurds_in_Turkey_c5e2.html" title="Kurds in Turkey">Kurds in Turkey</a> is not convincing at all, and should be abandoned. However, Adkagansu's proposal to redirect to Southeastern Anatolia is something else.

<dd>Yes it is a region and it is called Southeastern Anatolia, that's its geopolitical name. I think, instead of thinking clearly, some people here are just saying "This guy is a fascist, I am not like him, I am a humanist liberal righteous someone, I won't allow him to censor it". I wonder how much of those who voted <b>Keep</b> actually tried to understand my point in this without being dragged away by their bias towards certain things. Its geopolitical name is Southeastern Anatolia, at least, as previously suggested, this article should be moved to Southeastern Anatolia and be mentioned some regard it as Turkish Kurdistan, and Turkish Kurdistan will still redirect to this page and people will get their information.</dd>

<p><del>'<b>Delete and Redirect'</b>. Kurdistan is not an actual geographic location. Rather, "Kurdistan" refers to a regional ethnic identity existing across states.

<li>I don't want you to change your vote. It is not the good faith that is questioned. It is the logic. Yor argument does not provide the <b>reason</b> of your vote. If you had given the reason, it could have been possible I'd changed <b>my</b> vote instead. Your explanation basically says "I like it all in one big article", and it is fine with me; I dont want to beat anyone's brows; tastes differ, I know. But this is the reason why I concluded that you probably didn't give it much thought: if you had, you'd explain your reasoning: <b>why</b> subheadings are better than subarticles. In particular you didn't bother to explain what is wrong with my <b>explanation</b>: wikipedia articles breed most often by spawning rather than by merging.

<dd>Ridiculous, it is really pathetic to see how people can give away simply because some ultranationalists are very vocal and by constant lobbying they can dictate what to do. We should simply stick to Wikipedia policies. Is there something called 'Turkish Kurdistan'&#160;? Yes, there is such a thing, Is this term notable? Yes! IT IS! I can cite here various articles, I have access to various servers of notable journals, and this term is very often used. The last question to ask is, are there materials in that article? Yes! THERE ARE. There are various sub of less notable terms which will never get deleted, merged. They have even merged Smyrna the ancient city with Izmir, and in the same token they have removed the entire section about Smyrna fire which is still considered one of the worst fires in history, there are even some comparing it with the burning of Rome. When will anyone attempt to merge the city of Ur with its current location? I say, this is ENOUGHT!!! ENOUGHT! I have attempted blind eyes for few days, but unless people stop sleeping on gas and no one answers this will continue again and again. Also it is amusing to see that some member still brag 'neutrality' request, when this one same member in his own userpage indicated clearly why he was on Wikipedia, which he said was to counter Armenian, Greek and Kurdish POV pushing. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 00:45, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am a Turk, I speak my heart, I don't hide behind devious words or schemes. I won't kiss you on the cheek, and dig your grave behind your back. I see you made a background search on me. I like attention, you may keep stalking me. Anyway, I have no beef with neutral Greek, Armenian and Kurdish users. With one neutral Greek user, <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a>, I believe we did a great job on making <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Cypriots_738d.html" title="Turkish Cypriots">Turkish Cypriots</a> page as NPOV as possible, which was repeatedly edited before. He proved his good faith to me many times and earned my trust.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is a fact there is a lot of POV pushing going on Turkey, Armenia, Greece and Kurdistan related articles. And I believe Turkish voice is definitely not heard as much as it should be. I've seen hardcore Wikipedian Armenian, Greek and Kurdish users here who spare many hours a day here and almost none Turkish. Most Turkish users here either spare little time for this or have little interest in what's going on or are busy with editing Turkish Viki or suffer from limited language skills. Now I have the feeling some people are uncomfortable with Turks rising their voice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway back to the subject here; what we have is a very legitimate case. I have examples in front of me such <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Turkestan_eb53.html" title="Chinese Turkestan">Chinese Turkistan</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian_Kurdistan_c5f3.html" title="Syrian Kurdistan">Syrian Kurdistan</a>. I'll demand my friends to create a Southeastern Anatolia page which is the geopolitic name for the region, internationally recognized, unlike Turkish Kurdistan which has been made popular only by certain media organizations. If you ask me there are 2 decent solutions to this subject:</dd>
</dl>
<p>1. Rewrite and shorten <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Kurdistan_fac6.html" title="Turkish Kurdistan">Turkish Kurdistan</a> page so it won't act as if TK is a breakaway de facto state in Southeastern Turkey. At the beginnig of the article it should say "For the geopolitic Turkish region see Southeastern Anatolia" or something like that, whatever the proper language is. But this will, in my opinion, be POV fork. 2. Delete the entire article and move the information to Southeastern Anatolia. Turkish Kurdistan will redirect to this page and in it the unofficial name will be mentioned like in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Turkestan_eb53.html" title="Chinese Turkestan">Chinese Turkistan</a>. <b>This I think is the most decent thing to do. I really don't understand people who fail to see the legitimate argument here. I am having a hard time assuming good faith</b>.--<a href="../../../a/d/k/User%7EAdkagansu_ab98.html" title="User:Adkagansu">Kagan the Barbarian</a> 09:00, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Background search? What background search? I knew all this all along, since you are one of the Turks who registered in the 10s February 2006. And you are absolutly wrong and you know it when you claim that Greeks, Armenians and Kurds were much active while Turks were not. There are more active Turks and always has been than Armenians, Greeks and Kurds combined. There are at least one Turk in everything related to Armenians, Greeks and Kurds when the slightest political scheme is concerned. And now, with the call for Turks in the 10s February 2006, the amount of POV pushers has just jumped to another fold. No one is saying to stop contributing, in fact I will more than ever welcome a Turk that at least is honest enought to admit for what he is here and also assume his Turkishness, than some dishonest people hidding this all together and both of us know that in this sphere of activity(Kurdish, Armenian and Greek issues) this type of people aren't in shortage. And if you pay attention, there is a clear disproportion between nationalist Turks ivading Kurdish, Armenian and Greek articles than the other way around and if you were honest enought you would have no problem admitting that, but this is not what you do, you are claiming to the contrary. Just for your information, here we have another example of how ultranationalists dictate Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Khoikhoi" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Khoikhoi" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Khoikhoi</a></dd>

<dd>This guy has been fair with everyone requesting concessions from every sides, but yet your fellows will in mass try to hijack a request for adminiship. Claiming that he push Greek POV which BTW is ridiculous when he himself as reverted Greek POVs.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Comming to this poll, most here don't even know for what they are voting, a member has even gone as far as placing statistics of the last Turkish election. By the same token I should also present the statistics of the last Canadian election to advance that French Quebecers are not French Quebecers because they have voted more for the Conservative right party which always was against French Quebecers identity and values, than the Liberals <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> . Or maybe we should merge articles about Upper or 'Downer' Canada, etc. The question here is, IS THERE SOMETHING CALLED TURKISH KURDISTAN??? The answer IS obvious, this term IS notable, the article IS expanded enought. This is what it is, and if you truly are against POV pushing, you will stop doing that. I myself disagree with the maps of Turkish Kurdistan, because it also claims what is called 'Ottoman Armenia,' but Wikipedia IS NOT about what I think, but what positions are, a coverage of positions. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 20:49, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Figures for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> Turkish Provincial Elections (electing members of the Provincial Assemblies) in the 'at least' 17 Turkish provinces covered by the article (former Category: Kurdistan in wikipedia covered 20 provinces, therefore their number is displaying an unmistakably decreasing trend!!!).</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, there are general, provincial and municipal elections. People usually think in terms of the country, the 81 provinces and their specific municipality. The last general election was in 2002. Therefore, these 2004 figures are not only more recent but also, I would say, coherent with the panorama presented by the previous general elections. Provincial elections and municipal elections were held simultaneously. Provincial figures reflect the political choices of the voters better than the municipal ones. My choice for using the provincial figures instead of the municipal ones does not work to the disadvantage of any party. The party that was <i>closest</i> to promoting a Turkish K. agenda (let's say, people thinking in terms of a region whose mint they have struck themselves, with a name of their own preference) in these elections was the <a href="../../../s/h/p/SHP_f744.html" title="SHP">SHP</a> (which is actually a tiny but nation-wide center-left party, and it that had struck a deal for the southeast with the HADEP-<a href="../../../d/e/h/DEHAP_53e5.html" title="DEHAP">DEHAP</a> pedigree for these elections). Any argument with an intention to relativize the definition of non-SHP voters can also be countered by arguments, possibly in stronger terms, for defining the SHP-voter profile as well. In Turkey, it is obligatory to vote in elections (you can vote blank if you want to, but you have to go to the polls), therefore, I would say, that the popular political viewpoint trends are rather well reflected in the numbers that come out of these polls (without having to draw comparisons with elsewhere). I start from the southeastern tip of the country and confine the figures to those parties that scored over 10 % in a given province, unless otherwise relevant or interesting. Very briefly, <a href="../../../a/k/p/AKP_c1ea.html" title="AKP">AKP</a> is the party in power in Turkey, <a href="../../../d/y/p/DYP_4e36.html" title="DYP">DYP</a> is national center-right, <a href="../../../c/h/p/CHP_e92c.html" title="CHP">CHP</a> is national center-left, <a href="../../../s/p/_/SP_6747.html" title="SP">SP</a> is religious-right, <a href="../../../m/h/p/MHP_c332.html" title="MHP">MHP</a> is Turkish nationalist-right.</li>
