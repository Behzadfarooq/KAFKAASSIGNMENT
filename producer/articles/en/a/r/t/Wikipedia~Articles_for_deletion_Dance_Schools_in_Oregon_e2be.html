<dd>Not about dance schools in Oregon, at least I'm not. If you think it's worthy of being altered in the way you outlined than alter it, you'd likely also change some votes. Otherwise, please just vote on the article as it stands not on what you hope the article might someday become. If the time arrives that someone is knowledgeable enough to write a comprehensive article on dance schools in Oregon, they would have my happy support in doing so. Until then, this is a meaningless directory. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> |</dd>

<dd>What an incredibly bitchy thing to say. Who the fuck are you to tell this person what they can and can't say? Fuck off and get a life!</dd>
<dd>In general, if an article appears to have potential, it should be kept. Most wikipedia articles start off as stubs and such, and people wander in off the internet to fix them. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 20:01, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't have any problem with stubs, if written correctly they're great. The problem is this article isn't a stub, it's a list of links. While the possibility might exist for an actual article to be written on dance schools in Oregon, this isn't it. I can start an article about my non-notable local councilman because, potentially, he could become a senator. Potential isn't the issue. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 21:38, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hmmm <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefectures_of_Chad_df0d.html" title="Prefectures of Chad">Prefectures of Chad</a> appears to be little more than a list of links, although it does have a nice map.

<li>I know the question wasn't directed at me but I'm going to jump in anyway: <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefectures_of_Chad_df0d.html" title="Prefectures of Chad">Prefectures of Chad</a> is a list, but it's a notable and encyclopedic one. Dance Schools in Oregon is nothing more than an incomplete directory. If you can quickly find the information in the yellow pages, it's not encyclopedic. Hardware Stores in Milwaukee and Plumbers in Little Rock don't exist for that reason. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 21:48, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>My point was that as those things don't exist, neither should Dance Schools in Oregon. I was arguing the fact that if one can find the information in the yellow pages, it shouldn't have an article. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 22:05, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>So inconsistency in policy and governing of Wikipedia is fine by you? This list of dance schools in Oregon is not advertising, as it doesn't contain any contact information about the listed schools, nor mentions anything about the schools other than the fact that they are in Oregon. All this page does is link to pages within the Wikipedia database. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.200.116.10.html" title="User:207.200.116.10">207.200.116.10</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.200.116.10.html" title="User talk:207.200.116.10">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.200.116.10_803b.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.200.116.10">contribs</a>) 08:53, 1 September 2005.</small>

<ul>
<li>Inconsistency is fine by me. Whenever there is no perfectly "bright line" and decisions must be made by human judgement, there will be inconsistency whenever things fall close to the borderline. If a cop stops you for speeding it is not usually helpful to tell the judge that there were other drivers going faster. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:05, 1 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But then we're not in a court of law talking about a speeding ticket, are we? No. We're on wikipedia talking about the fact that this is all subjective and up to the whims of a clique of wikipedia editors who for some strange reason think the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_planets_in_Futurama_51fa.html" title="List of planets in Futurama">list of fictional planets on Futurama</a> are more deserving of mention than the very real dance schools in the very real state of Oregon. Trekkie convention, anyone? And on the topic of speeding tickets: if it can be proven that the police officer was indeed singling a person out it is actually feasible that charges could be dropped. This sort of thing happens all the time. Maybe someone can make a list for you about the times it has happened, and then you can request the list be deleted as it relates to something in the real world and not a cartoon, hence it is not substantial enough for you.</li>
