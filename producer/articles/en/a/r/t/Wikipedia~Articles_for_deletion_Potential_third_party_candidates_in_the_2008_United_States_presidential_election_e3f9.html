<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with your reasons to delete the page. For that reason I went through and drastically changed the site to include only names of candidates that ARE running for their party, or candidates that have viable sources for their rumor (they told so-and-so that they are considering). I removed anyone that I could not find a souce for. Including even Ralph Nader (I totally expect him to be back up later). Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, and it was getting to the point that anyone with a name could be added. The arguments here are right. If the page can not be used for serious wikipedian documentation of ongoing campiagns and events, then it is not worthy of wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargeAbernathy_804c.html" title="User:SargeAbernathy">SargeAbernathy</a> 16:54, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you do that it's no longer potential candidates, it's actual candidates and just has an inaccurate namespace. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 18:43, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're confused here. This is for potential candidates in the U.S. Presidential Election of 2008. The people listed here are saying they are going to run, yes. But for their PARTY'S nominiation. Just like Democrats and Republicans all third parties must go through a process where the main party elects one person to run. So the people are ACTUAL Primary candidates ... but only POSSIBLE U.S 2008 election candidates. Furthermore this list even indludes names that there is only sourcable rumor to their primary run as well.

<dd>Which I just did.

<dd>I also added "these people are actively" in the first paragraph to disassociate the page from crystalball predictions.

Eliminating the more detailed coverage afforded to third party candidates and movements unreasonably favors the major parties. Deleting this article immediately places wikipedia into a POV stance. I don't disagree that better sources and a more rigorous standard for inclusion are needed, but the fact that an article needs work doesn't qualify it for AfD. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 06:27, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This argument has been used before, that it's POV or "unfair" to only cover the parties and candidates that are well-known, but let's face it: Wikipedia is not the League of Women Voters candidate guide, and does not exist to publicize or promote unknown parties and candidates. Of the five parties listed, most people have only even heard of two, and very few have heard of the candidates even for those two. The independent candidates are even more obscure. This looks to me like a list of non-notable people, in addition to the crystalballism of guessing whether they'll matter at all. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:29, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep/<strike>Move Back</strike></b> While the page needs to have more consistent maintanence than it has in the past, it is both encyclopediac in itself and <i>necessary</i> to prevent POV bias towards the 2 major American political parties. This does <i>not</i> mean that "anyone and his dog" can be listed, rather, people who are considering a <i>serious bid</i> for a <i>political party nomination</i>. Also, as this article's move was improper (taking place during an AFD and without concensus), I propose it be moved back.--<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim4christ17_a2d0.html" title="User:Tim4christ17">Tim4christ17</a> 06:38, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I apologize for that. I should have asked for consensus. However, I feel that "potential" alludes to much to rumor and specualtion and that a clear definition about what the article is and what is going on NOW is needed for the title. If people want to change it back, go ahead. It should have been discussed, but since no one was acting on editing it ... I went after it. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargeAbernathy_804c.html" title="User:SargeAbernathy">SargeAbernathy</a> 01:48, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I would encourage anyone who hasn't looked at this page recently to look again. The cleanup is substantial, and to delete this page seems to imply that the Green Party, Constitution, Libertarian, et al aren't worthy of pages. (<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> only confirms my suspicion with his honest comment.) There are really obscure non-notable candidates. A candidate that gets 0.31% of the popular vote--thousands of thousands of thousands--is not a "non-notable person". <b>Possible removal for the "Independents" section</b>, as those listed tend less notable.</li>
