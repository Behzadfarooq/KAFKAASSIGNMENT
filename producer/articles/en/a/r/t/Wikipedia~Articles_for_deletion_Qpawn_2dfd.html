<li><b>Keep</b>Qpawn is one of the largest nationsims on the net and is currently a large game. It has a large fan basis. Most of the traffic goes direct through the <a href="http://z11.invisionfree.com/QPAWN/index.php?act=idx" class="external text" title="http://z11.invisionfree.com/QPAWN/index.php?act=idx" rel="nofollow">forum</a>, while the <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/oh/qpawn" class="external text" title="http://www.angelfire.com/oh/qpawn" rel="nofollow">Angelfire site</a>is used for players joining the game. The article contains Qpawns history (is still being worked on) and how Qpawn is extremely important in the world of nationsims . angel6dk 23:59, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is no information in the article about Qpawn's 'importance' in nationsim history. As someone else said below, there are also no sources available to back up that claim. --<a href="../../../v/e/e/User%7EVeesicle_11ae.html" title="User:Veesicle">Veesicle</a> 16:13, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, it isn't. That source is a presentation whose sole discussion of this web site comprises a single slide that contains three bullet points telling us that QPawn is "Web-based", has "Real countries", is "Run by moderators", and is "forum-based". That's 1 sentence of information.

<li>If you search the web or bookshop. You will find nothing written on Nationsims game. The best reference and history is written in Wikedpia. If you look at Nationsims games based on a forum, you will also notice that Qpawn is one of the most successfull and largest. The fact is that there is a lack of information on nationsims, and searching it, the only information leads to a Eikedpia article on nationsims. Qpawns importrance is mentioned here. It was not written by a Qpawn member. The fact is when you search the web that nothing is written on nationsims shows that the area is still in development. Or there is simply bot enough to write a book on the subject. Lets face it, a book on nationsims will be boring. Because the games are forum based, little evidence is there to create a history of nationsims. Qpawn startet in 1998,ask anyone in the nationsim world, most consider it the first. As there is no information or articles on nationsims,<a href="http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Geo-Political_web-based_simulator" class="external text" title="http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Geo-Political_web-based_simulator" rel="nofollow">This must count</a>, --angeldk6 19:55, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> While it has been said before, I'll repeat it: It has important historical value in nationsim history.

<li>If there are no sources to cite, there can be no encyclopaedia article. It's that simple. If your argument is that there are no sources to cite, then you've made a strong argument to delete this article, even though you've prefixed that argument with the word "keep". Your argument that there are no sources cannot be out-voted. Your only arguments for keeping are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">sources</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">sources</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">sources</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> QPawn is a nationsim that is not only fun, but also educational. It teaches the player about history, geography, politics, economics and quite possibly, teaches the player a few things about themselves! It's page MUST be kept. Tarkus3 14:02, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> QPawn is certainly significant enough, as it is a nation sim which has continued to exist for quite some time. A lot of nation sims have died, including some mentioned on the page about nation sims, but Qpawn has managed to continue its existence in some form or another. Rabble Rouser 15:54, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Qpawn is a large game, made by the original creator of the Qpawn dynasty. There are now more nationsims on the net than many other types of games. These add variety and this page should be kept because this genre of game is one in its own and deserves its own page. If this page is deleted, Wikipedia has squashed the game as not notworthy enough (being the first and official QPawn) to be noted. All of you who do not feel that this page is notworthy should try it sometime. --Euphoria X 18:18, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Qpawn in by far the best nationsim on the web. The majority of other nationsims have either been inspired from Qpawn or have borrowed many of its fundamental gameplay attributes. It is also worth noting that Qpawn has an unbelievably high activity rating which is not common among nationsims. The reason for this is largely because people find out about Qpawn through wikipedia, which keeps new players coming. Deleting this article would adversely affect the game and unless that is the goal of deleting it there seems to be no reason for doing so.

<ul>
<li>If you want other sources, fine, but I feel fairly strongly that <b>you</b> need to make a distinction between notability in a community and notability worldwide. I edited a page last night on some cooking website I'd never heard of and didn't see any multitudes of sources for, but the site's been around a long time and it wasn't a vanity article, so I saw no reason to send it to the deletion crew (whether it be speedy, ProD, or AfD), and I've been pretty quick on that particular trigger lately. This is all to say that notability <i>must</i> be relative in the cases of certain genres of websites, music, and so on, or there won't be any mention of any of them on Wikipedia whatsoever. I realize this isn't the place for that discussion, but is that really what you want? At the very least, it should be a <b>Redirect</b> to an article about nation sims, as per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, the policy you yourself keep citing as a reason to delete. --<a href="../../../j/e/m/User%7EJemiller226_eedc.html" title="User:Jemiller226">Jemiller226</a> 21:52, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are wrong. There is no reason to make any such distinction between community fame and wordwide fame, because <b><a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_fame_nor_importance" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">notability is not fame nor importance</a></b>, as you erroneously think it to be. The PNC in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does not make any such distinction, and rightly so because it is addressing notability, not fame. The PNC requires multiple non-trivial published works from sources independent of the web site (and its creators/publishers). I've asked for such sources <i>five</i> times, now. If the web site whose article you edited is not the subject of multiple non-trivial published works from independent sources, then it too does not warrant an article on Wikipedia.
<p>For this web site, a redirect is only appropriate if, per <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">Wikipedia:Redirect</a>, the subject would warrant discussion as a sub-topic within an article with broader scope. But since the only source that has been cited contains 1 sentence's worth of information, if that, there's not even enough source material for a sub-topic. As stated right at the start, for this subject to warrant mention <i>even in an article on nationsims</i>, it has to be shown that it has actually been recorded as a "part of nationsim history" (as claimed). Despite repeated encouragement, neither you nor anyone else has cited a single source to demonstrate that it is, in fact, a part of nationsim history, and that it warrants any mention <i>anywhere</i> in Wikipedia.</p>

<li>Let me start off by saying that you have a <i>very interesting</i> definition of the word notable. Notability is neither fame nor importance? Then what, precisely, <i>is</i> it? <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;s=notable&amp;i=2&amp;h=000#c" class="external text" title="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;s=notable&amp;i=2&amp;h=000#c" rel="nofollow">Princeton University</a> seems to disagree with you, by the way. If this is deleted because fame is not notability, maybe I should go AfD <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> or something. After all, what's she done to achieve notability aside from being famous for fame's sake? You basically say on your user page that notability has nothing to do with anything aside from having sources to cite, but then you go on, on that same user page, to list all sorts of things that notability is not, including verifiability, which at first glance seems to fly in the face of notability being nothing more than multitudinous sources.
<p>At the end of the day, Uncle G, three-quarters of the articles on Wikipedia would be gone by a strict reading of your "rules" for notability. While I understand what you have goals and you are trying to make a point, that doesn't necessarily make you right for it.</p>
<p>Lastly, you are flat-out incorrect about what <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html#_note-1" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> states. "Websites or content which fail these guidelines but are linked to a topic or subject which does merit inclusion may be redirected to that topic or subject rather than be listed for deletion." <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">Wikipedia:Redirect</a> has nothing to say on the matter; it's just a list of reasons to redirect and a how-to for doing so. It's not a list of reasons to delete instead of redirect. --<a href="../../../j/e/m/User%7EJemiller226_eedc.html" title="User:Jemiller226">Jemiller226</a> 20:46, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>Keep.'</i> To the extent any nation or political simulator article is "notable", this one most certainly is. It is an important and well known example of the genre, and as is noted above, it has been recognized at least once by a very reputable, independent source. I don't see how this doesn't conform to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> (Which states that content is notable if it is "distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators.") and commonsense guidelines for notability. Structural problems and problems with sourcing can be dealt with and are no grounds for having the article deleted for all time. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesocialistesq_d715.html" title="User:Thesocialistesq">-- Thesocialistesq/M.Lesocialiste</a> 04:35, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
