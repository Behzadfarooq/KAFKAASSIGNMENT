<p><a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_proposal_9cba.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability proposal">Wikipedia:Notability proposal</a> is a proposal to explicitly make "notability" a requirement for Wikipedia articles, and to explicitly include "lack of notability" as a reason for deleting articles.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Policy question</span></h2>
<p>When an admin is closing an AfD discussion that they have nominated or voted in themselves, should they count their own vote towards the consensus? <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">‚Äî <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 08:38, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, the only guideline I have found is that administrators should not delete articles they temselves nominated. Personally though, I will only close a debate which I have participated in if the result is <i>clearly opposite</i> of what I voted. (For example if I cast one of 4 "delete" votes in a debate which finally garners 4d/6k I have no qualms about closing that as a keep). <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:27, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question</span></h2>
<p>I created a page on or about September 22, called "List of military ambushes" or perhaps just "List of ambushes". When I went back to edit it today I couldn't find it - either by direct link or by doing a search. Was it deleted? I couldn't find it by searching the delete log or by scanning the AFD list or by scanning the delete discussions either. - Unsigned by anon IP</p>

<dd>Howdy, and welcome to wikipedia! First of all, the article exists as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_military_ambushes.html" title="List of military ambushes">List_of_military_ambushes</a>. Second, please consider creating an account. You can 'watch' pages so that you don't lost them like you just did. Finally, sign your comments with ~~~~ so people know who they're talking to, it really cuts down on confusion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AfD-dictated merger templates</span></h2>
<p>I've created a pair of new templates: {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd-mergeto_fb15.html" title="Template:Afd-mergeto">afd-mergeto</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd-mergefrom_dd83.html" title="Template:Afd-mergefrom">afd-mergefrom</a>}}. They're intended for use by a sysop who closes an AfD debate with a consensus to merge the nominee into another article, but does not intend to perform the merger (or by a different user acting on such a decision).</p>
<p><a name="Instructions" id="Instructions"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Instructions</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Upon removing the {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}} notice (if still present), add the {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd-mergeto_fb15.html" title="Template:Afd-mergeto">afd-mergeto</a>}} tag to the top of the nominated article. Use the following format:</li>
</ul>
<p>{{afd-mergeto|<font style="color:#00A650;">destination article</font>|<font style="color:#d0a800;">debate name</font>|<font style="color:#e37f00;">debate closure date</font>}}</p>
<p>For example, assume that a debate was closed on <font style="color:#e37f00;">30 March 2007</font>. If the consensus is to merge the nominated article into an article called <font style="color:#00A650;"><i>Topic X</i></font>, and the debate is located at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/<font style="color:#d0a800;">Topic Y (second nomination)</font>, the tag should be configured as follows:</p>
<p>{{afd-mergeto|<font style="color:#00A650;">Topic X</font>|<font style="color:#d0a800;">Topic Y (second nomination)</font>|<font style="color:#e37f00;">30 March 2007</font>}}</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question from a newbie:</span></h2>
<p>What is the value of a <b>weak keep</b> vote other than to leave the administrator who gets stuck making the final call feeling like they are out on a limb? Shouldn't votes be either <b>keep</b>, <b>delete</b>, or <b>abstain</b>?--<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff">Gaff</a> 22:50, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Qualifiers such as "weak" and "strong" are meant not so much to affect the final decision, but rather to influence subsequent voters. When I vote "weak delete" or "weak keep" it means I'm unconfident of the evidence that led me to make my decision. Ideally we are not voting; rather, we're trying to establish a consensus by discussion. ‚Äî<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 03:36, 17 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also, when i say "weak keep" or "weak delete" I mean to imnply that I think it not improbable that future arguemtns might change my vote, or that changes to the articel could do so (particularly for a weak delete). In part it is saying "Come on, persuade me". But in the final tally, if the vote is not later changed, the closer should usually, IMO, read a "weak" vote the same as a "normal" one. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:00, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As to a "strong" vote, i mostly agree with <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> above, buit it also usually means "I can't think how I could ever be persuaded to change this vote, so don't bother". AfD is supposed to be about discussionas much as about voting (that was why the name was changed from VfD) and these qualifiers are part of the discussion aspect, IMO. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:00, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is it ok to add articles to groups of articles that are up for deletion?</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes it is sensible to list more than one article on a AfD subpage, a current example is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Indo-European_root_word_articles_d7ad.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Indo-European root word articles">Indo-European root word articles</a> where the future of a set of pages is being discussed. The user who sugested that we consider deleting these articles has added to the list of pages that should be included in the discussion. Now I'm sure this does not matter in this case (it looks like the words will be merged into a single article), but I can't find a policy on this. The debate is about the type of article but only the listed articles would be deleted if the consensus is to delete, so should we add articles after a "vote" has been cast? I don't think this is a good idea as we can not just remove a page because it is like a page that was deleted after a AfD consensus but others may have other views. Can we reach a consensus on this before this becomes a real issue?</p>

<dd>It depends. If the articles are similar just in subject, but are vastly different in other aspects (notability, completeness, etc), it may not be appropriate to group them.

<dd>Okay, I see. Perhaps this policy comes from a time before VFD was split into multiple subpages? My feeling is that the invitation to participate should be inlined with all of the other AfD listings, rather than in a big box above them all. Based on its placement now, it seems like it must be the most important discussion on what is one of the most active pages in the Wikipedia: namespace.

<p>With the AfD pages running so long, spliting up the AfD into subsets based on article topics might be a good idea. Biographies are a readily identifiable subset of the articles, tho they only run to around 1/4 of the load so {{bfd}} <i>Biographies for Deletion</i> is one possibility. Another possibility would be {{lfd}} <i>Lists for Deletions</i>. There aren't many lists nominated for deletion, but for some reason, list articles uniformly generate much nore discussion than is usual.

<dd>"tested using the category feature"? If I understand correctly, there are objections specific to that which don't apply to subsetting per se. We could, for instance, create section headings within the daily deletion page: Biographies, Lists, Schools, Other. No need to be bureaucratic about it - they can be ad hoc as needed. Or we could go in the direction that RFC did - split into several subpages by topic. There are obvious advantages to subsetting in terms of efficiency and consistency (similar cases, guidelines, etc). <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 14:16, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>However, personally, I think one of the most obvious things to aid AfD is to separate closed from open discussions. All it would take is to use, let's say, Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/YYYY month DD open as the day page, and the closing admin (or non-admin if keep) then moves the transclusion reference to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/YYYY month DD. Bingo - closed discussions are out of the way, and older open ones get more attention. Or have I missed a downside? <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 14:16, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Whilst that's useful for me, it does remove closed discussions <i>entirely</i>. Perhaps the template could be modified so that a link to the article subpage and discussion result is outside the .vfd-tagged div, and therefore still shows up. Also, shouldn't this trick be more prominent? (Or perhaps it is and I just missed it?) Finally, this trick is (a) somewhat user-unfriendly, especially if you sometimes want to look at closed discussions and (b) still loads the entire, pretty big page - which for people on dialup is surely an issue.

<p>Getting back to subsetting, I think this is essential, longer term. For instance, I'm never going to vote on music-related articles, because on the sort of articles that appear that <i>might</i> get deleted I know I'm never going to care either way. If they were in a different section (or page), it would help me avoid them - and others who want to to focus on them. Such specialisation should aid in consistency and efficiency. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 13:02, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would definately support a "Biographies for Deletion" and maybe a "music-related articles" group. Non-notable biographies are often contested, which is the reason they usually go to AfD rather than AfSD. To have them all grouped together would probably make the length of current discussions a little shorter. -<a href="../../../n/a/m/User%7ENameneko_fd06.html" title="User:Nameneko">Nameneko</a> 09:02, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Close discussions when Speedying nominees</span></h2>
<p>Recently there have been a bunch of articles speedied by admins after being listed on AFD, without the discussions being closed. I'd like to encourage all admins to use the proper templates to close the discussions whenever they speedy something, to make life easier for those of us scanning AFD. ‚Äî<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 15:43, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just be careful closing discussions when you didn't speedy the article yourself - about once a week, I find an article pointing at an afd debate with a redlink in the header, but not the article in question (whether due to a typo on the afd, or a multiple nomination). Twice these have been prematurely closed as having been apparently speedied, and in at least one other case the debate had been removed from the daily subpage entirely. ‚Äî<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 04:08, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Real" as a reason to keep</span></h2>
<p>I've noticed that people have been voting/arguing to keep articles because the subject is real, such as a "real band", "real game" or "real food". Essentially, they're saying that the article isn't a hoax or based on a fictional person or thing. This is not very helpful in determing whether an article merits inclusion because there are real things that don't belong in an encyclopedia. A penny you found in the street would be real, but it shouldn't have an article. There are usually valid reasons to keep an article on AfD, use those instead. Even voting "keep" with no comment would be better than using a nonsensical reason. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 12:21, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree. Existence is often a necessary criterion for inclusion, but nearly never a sufficient one. Just because you have been born, gone to a school, formed a band, started a website, or started dating someone, doesn't mean you suddenly become notable. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">‚Äî <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 12:32, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Logically it's a sufficient reason if the nomination is based solely on the premise that the subject is a hoax. Practically, if someone thought it was a hoax, there's usually an implied issue of notability as well, which "real" doesn't address. So rather than end up with a potential renomination for non-notability, responses should <i>really</i> (excuse the pun&#160;:) be "real and notable because..." <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 13:22, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>People are very free to choose any personal criteria for inclusion or deletion.

<li>It would be <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:instruction_creep">m:instruction creep</a> to disallow votes because of the reasoning behind them. If you think someone's vote is illogical, inappropriate or poorly reasoned, please discuss it with them. Besides, there's strong precedent to delete articles on non-notable bands, websites, tiny companies, memes, and numbers. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 11:01, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I wasn't suggesting that votes be discounted or that any of this be policy, just that people use a better reason or just say "keep". Radiant said that disallowing votes because of reasoning would be instruction creep, so I guess there isn't a policy yet. However, at least one user has been threatened with blocking because of illogical votes, so perhaps there should be a policy of whether illogical votes are valid, discounted, or justification for blocking (I'm not sure I'd be for any of those). -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 20:24, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that it depends on the article. In some cases, there are no assertions of notoriety - in that case there is no choice but to delete. In other cases, however, there are assertions to notoriety, and the only reason why it is listed on AFD is to question whether the assertions are true. In cases like that, asserting that it is real is a very valid reason to vote "keep". One example of this, which I can recall offhand, was a case where a woman was a natural conductor of electricity (think <a href="../../../f/e/s/Fester_Addams_b8fd.html" title="Fester Addams">Fester Addams</a> from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Addams_Family_f3c8.html" title="The Addams Family">The Addams Family</a>). It was listed for AFD because the nominator thought it was a hoax. Whilst a google search only had 10 hits, and only 2 of them were talking about her, the fact of the matter was that it was a real person, who really does have that condition, something which was verified. In a case like that, in my opinion, it is notable because of its unusualness and general interest - the fact that it is not widely known is irrelevant.</p>
<p>A second, similar, case was an example where a person found a large shipwreck. Again, the contention was that it was a hoax. It was verified with only 50 google hits, only 1 newspaper report. But it was real. And it was a topic of incredible interest, because of what he discovered.</p>
<p>In cases such as these, discovering that they are real is, in my opinion, a very valid reason to vote "keep". <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 07:11, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">question from beginner</span></h2>
<p>I'm new at this deleting stuff. I requested an article to be deleted and I followed the three steps as indicated. However, the third step doesn't appear to be correct. Am I supposed to put the reason I requested it for deletion? Was I supposed to create a header? Also, is this the correct method for a speedy deletion? My request was simply a duplicate article. BTW, I requested Dysfunction (Staind Album). <a href="../../../g/f/l/User%7EGflores_bda8.html" title="User:Gflores">Gflores</a> 22:30, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The third step is right. The {{subst:afd3 | pg=whatever}} that you insert gets turned into one of the other things you see in that list (that's what 'subst' does). The reason that you requested deletion goes in the second step (afd2), after the text=. Everything else, like the creation of the headers, is done for you.</li>

<dd>In this case, you would have been better off just redirecting the duplicate page to the better one. (Just replace the contents with #REDIRECT [[destination page]].) You can do this without people having to vote on it.</dd>

<dd>A large number of articles nominated for deletion are obvious deletes: Bandity, nn-bio, advertising, etc. The script just makes running through those more efficient. It's a tool that doesn't need to be used for all nominations. I've been using it to great effect for obvious deletes and going through the normal edit process for those that require more thought.

<p>I'd like to see this script inserting a particular edit summary for automatic votes, at least; better still, also have it insert a little <small>small</small> text indicating that the vote was automatic. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">Talk</a></i></sup> 02:23, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry for the delay in reply. I don't think that this script exacerbates the problem. It's not any more automatic than what I would do otherwise: click open the edit link, write a * and three 's and my verdict and my comment and sign and write a summary and click save. Only it does that process faster and with less RSI-inducing activity on my part. It so far has not caused anyone to go on a spree through the AFD logs. Users can not take care in voting with a script or without a script. No difference there.</dd>
<dd>As to Rob's request, it's very easy to put such a thing in, but some peoples' actions on AFD are more automatic than mine or others' using the afd helper. And besides, anyone who was intelligent enough to install the script and to use it for vandalism of the AFD pages would be intelligent enough to modify the script and remove the words 'automatic' or 'small'. And I would feel offended if my votes, after many minutes' consideration, were counted or read less than those of people who pass through <i>themselves</i> on automatic, without the aid of a script.</dd>
<dd>If when I choose to spend valuable hours going through the AFDs I am not <i>prepared to take the time go through the usual effort to record my opinion</i>, but rather wish to take my time to <i>deliberate</i> on my actual opinion instead, I think that's much much <i>much</i> more valuable.</dd>

<p>I think the practice of quoting number of google hits as "proof" of NN should be strongly discouraged. Although one would assume that wikipedia editors will research themselves, it should be remembered that its easily possible to construct a seemingly relevant google query that returns very few results for even the most notable subjects. --<a href="../../../p/y/p/User%7EPypex_3906.html" title="User:Pypex">Pypex</a> 01:11, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A good point, but I'd like to suggest an alternative. Instead, why not try to make a point of having people include the exact search they ran?

<p>Am I the only one who's getting a little concerned with ComCat's AFDs? Every two or three dats he seems to nominate a whole block of 15-20 articles, with his only comment being "NN, D". Likely as not the article being nominated is quite notable, as a quick glance at it can tell (I'd guess that 1/3 of these nominations ends up being deleted). it just seems too... arbitrary. And "NN, D" is hardly a detailed explanation of <i>why</i> these articles are considered non-notable.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">r√¥le of the nomination on AfD</span></h2>
<p>When listing articles on AfD, we ideally explain why we nominated the page for deletion, and what we want people to consider when making their not-allowed-to-call-it-a-vote-votes, right? In my view, we're basically plonking an article down in front of AfD, and saying "here you go, lads (and ladettes), I think this should be deleted because ..." Nominations are recommendations to delete (unless otherwise specified), but they are <i>not votes</i>. I'm not voting, I'm <i>nominating</i>. The distinction is important because nominations ideally require more thought than votes. It's also important because of the reasoning behind the recent "nominators also voting" phenomenon.</p>
<p>I asked about this the other day, and was told by a couple of very helpful users (thanks, guys!) that the practice began because certain admins weren't counting nominations as votes when closing deletions. To me, the only possible response to this is a resounding <i>well, so what?</i> If an AfD debate is <i>so close</i> that <i>whether the nomination is counted as a vote or not</i> will decide its result, it should <i>not</i> be closed as <b>delete</b>. Why the eagerness to get in that extra "vote"? Clear deletes will be deleted on the basis of other votes (which is where the persuasiveness of your nominating argument will come to the fore; take note, ComCat); not-so-clear deletes should not be deleted solely because the nominator shouted loudly enough. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 13:31, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Kelly! Actually, I originally proposed that the Afd2 template itself be changed to put the first 'vote' in by default. There were two objections, so I asked if, as an alternative, perhaps the <i>suggestion</i> could be put in the instructions instead. The only response to that was a "Go for it!" by the admin <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a>, so I made the change mentioned. Frankly, I resent the implication in your text above that I made a policy change against objections, as the change I made (after conferring with the objectors to the <b>original</b> suggestion) was very different from my initial proposal. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">‚òé</a>) 18:53, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You really need more input than that to make a policy change. Frankly, I'm tired of people playing loose with policywriting with respect to AfD.

<dd>I don't really think a reccomendation on the AfD page about how to format a nomination constitutes a "change of policy". There is no policy agaisnt including an explicit vote now, nor does the edit in any way make it mandatory. many people do it now, indeed i think overwhelming majority of afd noms now include an explicit vote or option. I don't see how advising people, presumably newcomers to the afd process, to do what most people are already doing, adn what is clearly allowed by existign policy, constitutes a policy change. It also seems to me to be a change supported by most who are commenting here, and by good inherent reasons. I think your commetns above are not justifed by this situation. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:31, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just make it explicit to prevent any confusion. The nominator should, and most of the cases, <i>does</i> give arguments for its deletion, and indicates that he wants his opinion heard by voting <b>delete</b> also. When I just nominate something for deletion for which I particularily don't care about (such as when cleaning out <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSDs</a>), I ask for my vote not to be counted by saying <b>no vote</b>.

To put it another way, consider an AfD that is 20D/5K. Pretty clear cut delte, right? Now look at a 19/5, 18/5, etc. At some point (depending on the opnions involved, and the standards the closer uses, the result will shift from a delete to a no-consensus keep. It is always possibe for one vote to make a difference, but if you say "don't delete if within one vote" then you just shift the boundry by one vote, unless you then say it again at the new boundry. To put it another way, the nominator is surely at least as free to express an opnion and vote as anyone. If the nom choooses to make a separate explict vote, oit should be counted the same as anyoen else's, right? so whay insit on two seperate edits. Givign an explicit vote in the nomiantion statemet makes things easier for the closer, and is the way that many people post AfDs. So lets suggest it in the instructiosn.

<li>AFD is not about the votes. If it is clear from the nominator's wording that he wishes the article deleted, then it counts as an opinion to delete, regardless of whether he used the word 'delete' or boldfaced it.

<li>Back in the days when I closed VfDs, I generally assumed that the nominator wanted the article deleted unless the nominator indicated otherwise.

<li>We're really chewing on the wrong end of the pencil here. It's not a vote, I think we all agree on that. Thus the closer is really only going to have to fall back on the word "foo" written in the nominator's initial entry if <b>a)</b> the rest of the sentance is ambigious, and/or <b>b)</b> there is some external pressure on the decision.</li>
<li><b>a)</b> is fairly straight forward to address, and I've seen Fudd working on this. Social pressure on nominators to make proper initial statements. A good nomination is no more done by writing "NN D" any more than it is by simply writing "NN".
<ul>
<li>Someone writes that *cough* cat *cough* then we tell them off. Someone writes "Not notable, no google hits, no all music" we let it pass. Someone writes "Not notable. no google [link to search], no all music [link to search]. Unless evidence of notability provided, I recomend that this article be removed" we heap effusive praise upon them.</li>
<li>Note - I've said the opposite on the NND RfC because we haven't done this in the past. I would still support a change in our collective behavior, regardless of my statements there.</li>
<li>Those who are feeling especially bold could even remove afds with no votes that are poorly constructed and place a note on the nominator's talk page pointing to this discussion.</li>
<li>A nomination that clearly explains what the editor is thinking but is <i>outside of policy</i> should be treated as it would now. That is to say, left as it is unless obvious bad faith.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>b)</b> is much more difficult, and is the source of many of the cries that afd is broken. It's a vote in practical terms because votes are <i>easy</i>.
<ul>
<li>I always put <b>Delete</b> on my non-procedural nominations because discussion on an RfC made it clear that if I didn't, it was possible for the closer to "ignore" this opinion. That's one source of pressure. Following a close and contentious close, there will <i>certainly</i> be howls of "this was 15/20, how could you keep!" etc. Here most closers will want to fall back upon some nice solid numbers to defend themselves, rather than having to explain that they thought the nominator was only completing and orphaned nom, etc. This is a second source of pressure.</li>
<li>Closers who make hard decisions are going to catch hell, and there do exist some ideological agendas driving both closures and examination of closures.</li>
<li>Strengthen deletion review, and put the same social pressure on closers to <i>explain themselves</i>. Support closers who make clear decisions based upon well thought out and well presented reasonings <i>even if it's outside the bounds of normal consensus</i>. Get them to ask for more feedback from each other and to engage the people involved in the discussion. Greater autonomy coupled with stronger review reduces both sources of pressure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We have all the tools in place to make a healthy, robust deletion system that <i>everyone</i> can have some level of comfort with here. We just need to tune it up slightly and ride it right.<br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Notifying the article creator</span></h2>
<p>I'd like part of the AFD nomination procedure to include a note on the talk page of the article creator, where possible.</p>
<p>An example is <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danese_Cooper_98e5.html" title="Danese Cooper">Danese Cooper</a>, which I created and which was AFDed. I had no idea this was going on. As it was it was kept, but I would really like to have been able to explain on the AFD why it should be kept. (And to answer the thoroughly bogus and off-the-wall accusations it was a "vanity" piece.

<li>It is a good idea to put all articles which you create to your watchlist so you can catch it if someone tries to nominate it for deletion. Then you can march over to the AFD and add some sense into the debate.&#160;:-) I don't think <i>requiring</i> that the nominator inform the creator is always such a good idea, often the article has been edited by a slew of users, the initiator may not even be the main contributor. However, I think that a template to inform newbies who wind up seeing their article on deletion might be a good idea, at least to calm their nerves when they see a huge deletion tag slapped onto their article. I think most newbies <i>will</i> notice when their article gets nominated, I remember seeing the first article I created up for deletion, and it wasn't the most pleasant of experiences (but it was exciting in a way, and it was pleasant when I saw it was not deleted) <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 18:05, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Watchlisting your articles is something everyone ought to do, but I'm guessing David has on the order of half a trillion pages on his watchlist. I only have a couple hundred and I <i>still</i> miss important changes. (The watchlist seems incredibly under-featured; I think it needs some reworking!) That said, how does one determine the "creator" of an article? The editor who writes a two-sentence stub or the editor who fleshes the article out into a multi-section beauty over the course of several edits? <i><b><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">ndroid</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 18:17, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I share the concerns about identifying the "creator" of any given article. On some, it may be easy. On others, it is functionally impossible. In addition to the example of the heavily-edited article, I would be very reluctant to put that notice on any anon user's page. There is no guarantee that the anon user will reconnect using the same IP. If a different new user logs on, they are going to see the "you have messages" link and be <i>very</i> confused. Furthermore, saying definitively that we <i>will</i> notify sets up an unreasonable expectation for anon users. Someone who is still editing anonymously is unlikely to have figured out the technical limits of the system. To answer Sjakalle's concern about a template for new users, that what the <a href="../../../g/a/f/WP%7EGAFD_bd8b.html" title="WP:GAFD">Guide</a> is supposed to be.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is it time to change the deletion threshold?</span></h2>
<p>Its becoming painfully obvious that having a super majority determine the fate of articles is doing nothing to stop people from nominating and renominating articles over and over and over... And frankly it is also very bias toward the "inclusionist" viewpoint. Why should Wikipedia be any different then politics where simple majority usually rules?<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 21:50, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>First, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_democracy" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a democracy</a>. Reasons for this are to discourage sockpuppetry, and vote stacking, and to encourage discussion. Second, the AFD system is loaded somewhat against deletion for at least one very good reason. If I want to delete an article and it is not deleted, what have I lost? Not much really, if I really hated that article I could simply decide not to read it. If I want to keep an article and it winds up deleted, then I have lost access to it, and that is more serious. (OK, for an administrator that is not all that serious, since I still have access to deleted material, but Wikipedia was made for readers, not administrators.) If a sizable minority of regualr Wikipedia users find that an article has some merit, then the article probably has some value to at least a sizable number of people, and we should not deprive them of accessing that information. That is why I would rather keep a few articles which ought to be deleted, rather than delete an article which ought to be kept. That is why one of the deletion guidelines is "When in doubt, don't delete". <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:17, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wikipedia governance is by consensus, not by majority rule. The very act of voting is contrary to our principle of using consensus to make decisions. I realize that there is a great deal of pressure within AfD to make Wikipedia‚Äîor at least AfD‚Äîmore "democratic", but such pressure is not consistent with our foundational principles. You are free to attempt to change Wikipedia's foundational principles, but this page is not the place to do that. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 15:15, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sjakkalle is correct. Strike through your nomination (using <tt>&lt;s&gt;</tt><s>Delete</s><tt>&lt;/s&gt;</tt>) and explicitly change <i>your</i> opinion but otherwise let the discussion run its course. Good closing admins carefully check the edit history to see if and how many opinions changed as a result of the rewrite.

<p>In the past week, I have seen two occasions where an article was tagged with {{AfD}}, then the nominator saw that several users voted to <b>Keep</b>, and then changed his/her mind and removed the AfD tag before the nom has run its course. Is that permitted? In one case I retagged the article, even though I agreed that it needed to be kept, and voted so. --<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerd_6b4d.html" title="User:Rogerd">Rogerd</a> 03:27, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If pretty much everyone agres that a page should be kept, and particualrly if the nominator has withdrawn the nomination, and admin can and often will clsoe the AfD early as a speedy keep. The nominator should usually withdraw by strinking out the parts of the nomination he now does not agree with, and inserting a comment/vote in which he changes his view to keep (or whatever). The nominator should not, IMO simply remove the afd tag -- leave that for the closer, who should not be a person deeply involved in the discussion, as the nom clearly is. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 03:44, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the other hand, if it's not the case that "pretty much everyone" has voted to keep it, then the nominator shouldn't have any special power to kill the discussion.

<dd>I agree, it sounds like both of you are saying that the AfD shouldn't be removed by the nominator, regardless of how the voting is going, but should be removed only by an admin, either at the end of the voting <b>or</b> if he/she deems it worth of a speedy keep or speedy keep.

<dd>Correct. Strictly speaking, to close an Afd as keep one does not need to be an admin. But one should be an experienced wikipeidian, and not involved in the particular debate. I would advise leaving <b>speedy</b> keep decisions to admins. I have seen people vote "speey keep" as a sugestion to a potential closer. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:30, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Due to the sheer numbers of articles listed in Afd, many editors are trying to hurry things along. I sometimes see articles deletes after a day or 2 rather than 5, if consensus is already clear. You now see speedy keeps done sometimes too, also presumably to save time. IMO, if the nominator withdraws and there's not much serious opposition, closing the Afd is fine. However, there should be no prejudice in such cases against another Afd- if any editor feels there's a legit reason to delete, he should not be silenced just because there was a speedy keep. In general, this probably won't happen much - if controversy is anticipated, the Afd should be left open. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:19, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am getting conflicting opinions here. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> is saying that what I saw may be OK.

In both of these cases, there was clear consensus that the article should be kept, including the nominator (who changed his mind). --<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerd_6b4d.html" title="User:Rogerd">Rogerd</a> 21:15, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please take my remarks as my own personal opinion, not an attempt to explain policy. However, policy may be a bit grey here. The reason admins primarily close afd's is that deleting of the article is often required. Non-admins can and do close Afds sometimes when a deletion is not required. In practice, if consensus to keep is clear, it's unlikely there will be any controversy, no matter who closes it. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 22:57, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Friday here. Howver, closing an AfD, even a pretty clear speedy keep, is probably not something someone on his first month of editing should try. Besides, speedy keeps are relatively easy, someone will grab one pretty quick. It is the really tricky cases that sit unclosed. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 02:37, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The nominator is not a sponsor. Retracting an AfD nomination only retracts the nominator's own opinion.

<p>I have recently seen it contended, for the first time in my experience, that being an "expert" on a topic should give someone's opinions additional weight in an AfD. This claim was made here: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Able_and_Baker_%282nd_nomination%29_cefd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Able and Baker (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Able and Baker (2nd nomination)</a>.

Rather, I tend to assume "credibility" and "reputation" refer to having a track record of editing in good faith‚Äîwhich means doing enough research to "vote" in an informed way. I can't see how giving special emphasis to "expert" editors on AfD's makes any more sense than giving them special rights in the article namespace‚Äîwhich, I understand from <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html#The_role_of_expert_editors" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR#The role of expert editors</a>, we don't do.</p>

<dd>It has to be done on pure numbers, IMO. How are we to judge whether any particular voter on AfD is an "expert" or not?

<dd>I think there is a role for expertise, but it very rarely will come into play. For instance, let's say that someone sporting an IP address for a name steps up and says "I think that you can't delete the article Fastidius Ungerus of Rome; I am an expert in Roman History and that person was KEY to moving the Senate forward on Point X". In a situation with an anonymous user, that just has to be laughed at, I think; but in the event where someone is verifiably a scholar of Roman History and has penned books and articles on which Wikipedia would draw as reference material .. that should (must) be taken into account in the decision making process. Like I said, rarer than a long-tailed <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manx.html" title="Manx">manx</a>, but still to be considered. With all deference to other folks here, I wouldn't invoke this type of mantle of expertise for someone who has only authored faithfully, long, and well on Wikipedia; they must demonstrate that their expertise extends beyond Wikipedia, into the "real world". This, by the way, is a criteria for promotion beyond a certain level in some types of organizations (particularly research organizations), demonstration that people outside of the company see the candidate as an expert in their field. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 04:17, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It depends; verifiability is not always dependent on ability to support by citations.

<dd>But it does seem like some rules for use of sources in article-writing are suspended for evidence given in AfD's (esp. to determine notability), or at least a large fraction of Wikipedians think so.

<p>One thing that should be mentioned in this discussion is time. When providing an edit to an article, we have an attitude of "eventually." If I, as an expert, am busy, and do not have time to go do research to find a great quote, and it waits for a week or two, no harm is done.</p>
<p>Deletion debates are completely different. They have a five day window, after which it is inordinately difficult to overturn them. Which means that experts are expected to do all necessary citation and sourcing work on a deadline, or else the article will be deleted forevermore. That's not reasonable. If deletion debates are going to have a deadline, we have to also be more permissive in giving people who know what they're talking about preference, citations or no. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 19:05, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll buy that.

<p>I'm an academic, and perhaps an "expert" in a few areas -- but it's important to remember that university expertise is highly specialized, and professors have a tendency, sometimes, to overstate the breadth of their expertise. Personally, I think that Wikipedia is exciting precisely because it permits the <i>co-production of knowledge by experts and the public.</i> The process can get sloppy, of course, but it's revolutionary. Don't forget that many crucial advances developed <i>outside</i> universities; academic rigor seems, sometimes, to develop into rigor mortis. -- <a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfaff9_358a.html" title="User:Pfaff9">Bryan</a> 16:19, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know. It would definitely send a chilling message to a new user. What proportion of the new users are having this problem? I ask because when we've checked before, we found that the vast majority of new users were successfully contributing new articles on valid topics. Only a very small minority were contributing articles which were deleted. The number of users who would benefit from such an admonition was thought to be less than the number of users who would be discouraged by it. On the other hand, we are much larger than we were the last time the question came up. Maybe all the easy articles have already been started. Certainly a politely worded mention would be less chilling to the new user than having his/her "golden prose" nominated for deletion. Looking at <a href="../../../y/o/u/Wikipedia%7EYour_first_article_be65.html" title="Wikipedia:Your first article">Wikipedia:Your first article</a>, there are already a few cautions and admonitions there. The recommendations you have above would not be inconsistent. I guess it couldn't hurt to add it. On the other hand, I wouldn't expect too much of it either.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Template:AfDClosing</span></h2>
<p>I've removed this template, and its entire section "How to close pages for deletion", from the main AFD page. The overwhelming majority of people who look at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> don't need to know how to close afds, and many of those who view <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> directly at all are already confused by the instructions there. Consider that on an average day, at least 10% of the nominations are either improperly listed due to the ridiculous <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:instruction_creep">m:instruction creep</a>-ridden complexity of the process and need to be fixed with my bot, or are speedy deletes and didn't need to come to AfD at all. Most of those who list articles properly have done so before in the past and don't need to consult the instructions again.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the process is already explained properly at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia:Deletion process</a>. (Perhaps we could use a link to that page, but not an entire section.) Probably half of my edits over the past two months have been to follow up on afds where the process has <i>not</i> been correctly followed, primarily orphaning titles that should never have an article, and tagging talk pages and redirects for speedy deletion - a step that was omitted entirely in the template. And nonadministrators certainly should not be closing debates as delete; this actually creates work. The administrator who deletes the page himself has to look at the afd himself and determine that it was correctly closed, or he has no business pushing the delete button.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">nominators again</span></h2>
<p>I see that someone's re-added a bit in the AfD instructions to say Nominators Should Vote. At least the silly "to begin consensus-building" phrase is gone, I guess. Now it's "to avoid ambiguity", which makes a lot more sense but is still a Bad Thing.</p>
<p>Quite apart from the sheer unnecessary inelegant redundancy of the idea, there is a major reason not to have nominator voting: it encourages bad nominations. We're so concerned about having our vote counted that once we know for certain that our "Delete per nom" is safe, we don't bother putting effort into the nomination anymore. We've all seen nominations that consist entirely of "nn delete" or even "delete per nom" (!). That's not a nomination. It's barely a vote!</p>
<p>A good nomination should consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it verifiable? (What steps did you take to attempt to verify it?)</li>
<li>Is it notable? (Why not?)</li>
<li>How will deletion affect Wikipedia? (quality, age, and number of links pointing to the article)</li>
<li>Is there some other reason to delete? (e.g. dictionary definition)</li>
</ol>
<p>It doesn't have to. Many of my nominations don't (whoops). But keep this in mind next time you consider saying "'''delete''' per nom ~~~~" <i>as</i> your nomination. Remember that (hoaxen and spam aside), we're deleting someone's good-faith contributions here, and we at the very least owe the page creator an explanation as to <i>why</i>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 04:00, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems unnecessary for the nominator to state his or her position. If it's anything other than "delete", they've come to the wrong place. Other people may vote to merge or redirect, but if that is the nominator's vote, he or she should not have brought it to AfD. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:25, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>mmm. I'm not so sure. There are times when I've brought articles here that I've thought are borderline. Or might mean something to someone, but not me. Or might be better merged into another article. Or might be better transwikied. It doesn't take much effort for the nominator to include that sort of comment into their nomination, though. A nomination should, IMHO, explain what is wrong with the article and what should be done with it. At a pinch, "NN, D" covers that. "Delete per nom" doesn't (it literally translates as "delete because I said so"). Better though is a nomination where it's clear the nominator knows what (s)he is talking about. "This article makes no sense because xxx, and there are only 10 google hits for a combination of yy and zz. <b>Delete</b>". Or "This is probably an important subject, but what's here at the moment is worthless. Unless it is thoroughly rewritten it should be <b>Delete</b>d". There's no need for a <i>separate</i> voting line - the vote itself should be obvious in the nomination. The current problem may partly lie in the lack of instruction on what constitutes a valid nominator's explanation for nomination (at the moment, the instructions for afd2 simply say "include a reason") <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 06:02, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. It's less annoying for nominators to vote on a separate line or give little explanation than it is to remove a nomination, or worse, vote "keep", because someone doesn't like the way it's nominated. They can just add a note to the nomination or the user's talk page about making better nominations in the future, without disrupting the current nomination. That said, I try to make my own nominations as best as I can and I don't use abbreviations, in case other users don't understand them. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:10, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>A non-logged in anonymous user first vandalized <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transfer_RNA_15f7.html" title="Transfer RNA">Transfer RNA</a>, then thought better of it and removed the vandalism but left a "biology is fun" statement as the only item on the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETransfer_RNA_a649.html" title="Talk:Transfer RNA">Talk:Transfer RNA</a>. There are a number of cases I've come across where the article is ok but someone has left a calling card on the talk page. Is it appropriate to nominate talk pages for deletion here without creating confusion about whether the main page should be deleted or not? In other words, if I were to nominate <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETransfer_RNA_a649.html" title="Talk:Transfer RNA">Talk:Transfer RNA</a> for deletion, would I be tossing a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spanner" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:spanner">spanner</a> into the works or would it pass through the system like any other nomination?

<li>I would surely endorse that.

<li>I don't think that is what JIP meant. He wants admins to close the AFD nominations after they speedily delete articles.

<ul>
<li>Yes you are right. So, if it absolutely obvious that this is a speedy, one should indeed speedy the article but not forget to officially close the afd debate. It is kind of pointless to have an open afd debate with a redlink for the article to be deleted. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 00:08, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>There is one way where, unfortunately, this can happen. It is when someone nominates an article for speedy deletion and the AFD notice is <i>removed or obscured</i> at the same time. For an administrator doing speedy deletion patrol, it's thus not immediately obvious that there even <i>is</i> an AFD discussion in progress. If you look at FightBadGuys.com (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_FightBadGuys.com_9a80.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/FightBadGuys.com">AfD discussion</a>) and Davey Morgan (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Davey_Morgan_057f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Davey Morgan">AfD discussion</a>) from yesterday's AFD discussions, for examples, you'll find that the AFD notice was either obscured by speedy deletion notices or removed before the speedy deletion notice was applied. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:08, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Good point. We should instruct people to leave the AfD notice when they nominate it as a speedy deletion, perhaps on the speedy deletion criteria page and/or the AfD main page. How do people obscure the AfD notice?

While this is all well and good, and while I don't exactly mind closing the debates (since it allows me to be all ADMIN-Y and stuff!), shouldn't whoever speedies and lets the AfD people know they speedied it also be kind enough to put in a subst:at and ab while they're there?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proper process?</span></h2>
<p>I have been talking in various places about Deletion Reform, but a number of people have pointed out to me that I am not 100% aware of all of the intricacies of the process. For example, there was a case recently where the final vote was 6/6 yet the closing administrator chose to close the debate as "delete" purely on the basis that he personally felt that the argument to delete was stronger than the argument to keep. Is this an actual policy that a closer has that much power? Note that I nominated it for undeletion and it was upheld unanimously that the closing admin did the right thing, and indeed they told me off for daring to nominate for undeletion! They told me that I should get used to it because Wikipedia is not a democracy.</p>
<p>I secondly had an issue whereby a second article was deleted after a 4/1 vote in favour of delete, with absolutely no discussion whatsoever by any of the 4 people who voted delete - and yet on its original nomination a year earlier there was a wealth of explanation as to why it deserved to keep. Put simply, the article in question was proven to be notable, but it was stubby. Yet a year later, the assertion made by the nominator was that it was not notable - with no evidence whatsoever to back up the claims. If Wikipedia is not a democracy, how is it that people with no arguments are able to vote in that way?</p>
<p>The two cases in effect are mutually exclusive of each other. Either 1 is fair or else the other is fair. They can't both be fair. I cannot comprehend any form of logic that suggests that both articles deserve to be deleted.</p>
<p>The only possibility that I can comprehend, whereby both articles deserved to be deleted is if we think that "Admins can do whatever the hell they want to do". Now, if that is an actual policy, well, urp, I think that I'd like to know about that one! LOL. Wikipedia might not be a democracy, but it makes a lot of claims to being fair, something which I doubt they could do if they said that admins can do whatever the hell they want to do.</p>
<p>I would dearly love to be directed to a comprehensive list of rules for such things, if one exists. I can see no holes in any of my arguments, yet am being told that I am wrong. The arguments put forward, are, in my opinion, quite illogical and cannot be true. Yet they are fought vehemently as if they were true, and indeed both votes for undeletion lost unanimously.</p>
<p>There's a lot of side notes to this kind of topic, but I really think that we need to have some kind of clarification of where we stand. In essence, before we are able to adequately reform the deletion process, we must first know what the deletion process actually is. In as explicit a detail as possible.</p>

<dd>Oh, and I should point out that the first case was NOT rejected due to sock puppetry - because there was no sock puppetry - something that has been admitted. LOL. Tripped yourself up there! Had it been rejected due to sock puppetry, then correct process DEFINITELY would not have been followed, since they were proven not to be sock puppets! Can't get much more obvious than that one! Had the closer said anything about sock puppetry as the reason for it to be deleted, it would have been a very simple case for reversion. Prove that they weren't sock puppets (proven and admitted in article that they were not) and the case is simple as pie. Definition of steamrolling.

<dd>On that last one, without looking at the revisions/article in question, it's entirely possible that a speedy-deletable/pure advertising "article" can be written about something notable in and of itself. The fact that something's notable doesn't mean any article about it should be kept - in many cases, it's better to have a redlink than an poor-quality stub, since you're less likely to have someone notice that it needs an article that way. That or, as you did here, an improvement during the AFD can save it (while I know it's not encouraged, I've actually nominated a couple of particuarly crappy articles for deletion before on the basis that an AFD will often cure or kill it). - <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoM_3601.html" title="User:SoM">SoM</a> 01:11, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Minor or major edits when voting?</span></h2>
<p>This question has probably been asked a bajillion times, but I'm currently on a library computer that uses IE and has a less-than-desirable connection speed, so I can't easily find the answer. I'm wondering what the preferred standard on using minor/major edit is when voting on an AfD. I've been doing both recently, and I see people doing both, but I'd like to know what y'all think about that.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Putting newer AfDs at the top</span></h2>
<p>I was reminded by a recent deletion review discussion of a practice that has been bugging me: putting new articles at the bottom. (Apologies if covered before: found nothing in a quick glance of the archives). I think this tends to disadvantage articles appearing later in the day, as not only are they exposed on the "current" page for a shorter period of time, but they appear at the end of a very long page. Any reason we can't reverse the order, as is done on the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequest_for_adminship_6d32.html" title="Wikipedia:Request for adminship">RfA</a> page? <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 23:49, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hope someone will take the the time to look at the last week or two of AFD pages and compare the number of votes received by, say, the last ten nominations of the day with the number received by the first ten, to see if this is a real problem. I, for one, always start at the bottom of the page and work upwards. ‚Äî<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 00:28, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>When I'm doing voting, I'll actually mash on the Page Down key until I see something with only a few votes, and vote on it. Or I'll start at the bottom, or start at the top... basically I personally randomize how I do it. Also, when I'm checking for non-closed speedied AfDs, I tend to vote on articles that are right next to the ones that I close. Personally I don't see much of a difference, as when people nominate an article they go to the bottom, therefore they see all of those articles at the bottom as they are nominating. <a href="../../../m/o/0/User%7EMo0_25cf.html" title="User:Mo0">Mo0</a>[<a href="../../../m/o/0/User_talk%7EMo0_eb76.html" title="User talk:Mo0">talk</a>] 03:54, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Concern about notability and porn stars</span></h2>
<p>I have noticed somehting very interesting. Apparently, University professors are often deleted, while porn stars are kept on Wikipedia. What exactly are our criteria for a <i>notable</i> porn star? You do realise that half of the porn-stars on that list are by the site operators? I was not aware that we were a porn weblist.</p>

<dd>Perhaps people are mistaking fame for notability. I've seen many articles about famous porn stars here, but I don't think many of them are especially notable. ‚Äî <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 14:32, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think that one issue here is that most people never watch porn, and those that do don't like to admit it!&#160;:) Secondly, the other issue is that porn sites tend to spam a lot (and make up well over 50% of all spam) hence meaning that the google test for porn stars is irrelevant. I think that a solution is to make a separate place for pornography criteria (not just for porn stars, also for sites, producers and so forth) that reflects consensus. For example, the biggest internet porn site on the web, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milf_hunter.html" title="Milf hunter">milf hunter</a> was nominated for deletion with comments that its Alexa rank of 1,000 was not good enough (in spite of the criteria being 10,000), and in spite of it being far more popular than places like <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bang_bus.html" title="Bang bus">bang bus</a> - and if anything the Alexa criteria should be lessened for porn sites since they always have 10 or 15 mirrors (usually for spamming purposes) and hence their actual popularity is much higher than Alexa suggests. Hence I would suggest for porn sites to have a combined Alexa ranking. Such things as them having published videos, an IMDB site, and so forth are also relevant. There are examples, for example, where <a href="../../../t/a/w/Tawnee_Stone_39af.html" title="Tawnee Stone">Tawnee Stone</a> was considered notable yet <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tori_Stone_92e5.html" title="Tori Stone">Tori Stone</a> was nominated for deletion (and passed) in spite of them being pretty much exactly equally notable. Similarly, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicky_Vette_f8f8.html" title="Vicky Vette">Vicky Vette</a> was considered to be notable whilst <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milf_hunter.html" title="Milf hunter">Milf hunter</a>, where she started, was nominated for deletion. The criteria are being moved around a lot.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We should note that a lot of people view Wikipedia as G-rated, and have a bias against including porn of any kind. Thus most of the votes are related to their disgust of pornography rather than any rational argument, and hence perfectly legitimate notable people/sites/etc are deleted because people don't personally like them.</dd>

<dd>A MILF site is number 1? That's just gross. Anyway, I think non-notable professors and porn stars should be deleted. Both may get a fair amount of Google hits now, but that doesn't mean they'll be remembered in 50 years. On the other hand, if a porn star is as notable as someone else who should be included in Wikipedia, their job should not be used as an excuse to delete them. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 18:24, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Relisting AfDs</span></h2>
<p>I've noticed that recently, myself and a number of other Wikipedians have been relisting old AfDs in order to generate more discussion.

So I wanted open a discussion here as to what we as a community can do to either limit this practice, or find some other alternative. My first suggestion is that people could make an effort to vote on anything that's sorely lacking in votes.

<dd>A small bit of history... Before the day-to-day subpages, nominations were kept on VFD and left on VFD until they were closed. Then subpages came, and just the nominations of the subpages were kept until they were closed. Then it changed somewhere along the lines to simply leave only 6 days of discussions on VFD. About one year ago, votes for deletion was converted to the day to day subpages you have today. When we changed to day to day archiving, somehow that was lost. We began archiving pages per day, meaning the nominations stayed where they were, and day pages were yanked in an older than 6 day fashion. Open nominations on anything older than 6 days began to be listed as "no consensus" where it was left alone... and left undeleted. In an attempt to revive an old set precedence, I began relisting nominations where I felt that it was necessary because I was uncomfortable of the fact of leaving a nomination without a clear consensus. As a suggestive alternative, we could just make listing of pages with little or no consensus... --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 05:48, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This eliminates the need for typing "pg=" and "text=", making the AfD process just a little quicker while keeping the legacy code so those used to those parameters can continue to use them.

<dd>Looks good to me. Might want to go even further with afd2 and give it a blank default if neither {{{2}}} nor {{{text}}} is given, so people who put, say, {{afd2|SomeStupidWebsite}} Alexa rank 17 quadrillion, 2 registered users. ~~~~ don't get an ugly bunch of braces at the start of their afd.

<p>Technically speaking, because all uses of the two templates are suppose to be subst:, you can just use 1 and 2 respectively without pg or text. Therefore, don't need to be backwards compatible. The only reason why it was included was that it is merely suggested, at the time when I created them, variables should use names. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 08:15, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you saying I can just use {{subst:afd2|some article|some text}} right now without using pg= or text= and it would work? I tried it and it doesn't work that way.

<dd>No, I meant if you changed it, you could use it as what you suggested it. As: {{subst:afd2|some article|some text}} You wouldn't have to have pg= or text= after the fact, simply because all uses of the template are suppose to be subst: so... there should not be a use where it wasn't. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 09:40, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that some people may <i>continue</i> to use the template with the old syntax.

<dd>Essentially all of them. I don't think anyone would argue if you ignored a "delete" vote made by a patently obvious vandal but other than that, it should be near-unanimous. The reason is that this is not really a "vote". It's a discussion which must be balanced and interpreted in light of Wikipedia's policies and traditions. It's entirely possible for a discussion to have almost all "delete" votes and only one "keep" yet be closed as a "keep" decision if, for example, the "keep" is exceptionally well-reasoned, founded in policy or presents new information which was ignored or unknown to the other discussion participants. The closer has an obligation to carefully review all the comments and other evidence when making the decision and may have to exercise his/her discretion to override the strict vote count. We've found that such judgment calls are best left to people who've had more opportunity to learn about the various policies and practices - people who've seen them in practice enough to know where the exceptions are.

<dd>A concrete number is a bad idea. An influential theologian and writer from 1630, for example, is quite lucky to get 300 results... whereas I have logins from web forums that get over 5,000 results. You just have to apply it logically in every situation... 1,000 hits for a blogger's name doesn't really mean a lot, but for an obscure (to me) Brazilian folk legend, it's nothing to sneeze at. You also have to make sure the results actually have to do with the article in question... 50,000 hits is meaningless if none of them are talking about what the article is about... it just means the article's title is a relatively common term. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 04:25, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><i>(edit conflict)</i> There is no firm answer. The problem is one of the inherent bias in the google test. 100 unique hits may represent phenominal representation if the topic is an offshoot of a highly technical topic like, say, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_chromodynamics.html" title="Quantum chromodynamics">quantum chromodynamics</a>. On the other hand, tens of thousands of hits or even more may be insignificant if the topic is related to pornography. You really should read <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Wikipedia:Google test</a> and the related Talk pages for a much more detailed discussion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:37, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
