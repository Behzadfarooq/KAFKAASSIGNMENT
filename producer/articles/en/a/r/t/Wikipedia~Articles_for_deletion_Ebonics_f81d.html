<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

</dl>
<p>The result was <b>Keep</b>. In the end, not even the nominator was arguing for deleting this article. The only remaining point of contention was whether or not there should be an article on Ebonics distinct from the article on African American Vernacular English. There was not absolute consensus on this point, but a number of commentators presented strong arguments that the two subjects are distinct, and many other participants seem to be agreeing, so this deletion discussion is closed without any AFD-mandated merging of the two articles. I encourage interested participants to discuss what content belongs at what article on the respective talk pages, outside the context of a deletion discussion. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 17:42, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article contains information that already exists in <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_Vernacular_English_5350.html" title="African American Vernacular English">African American Vernacular English</a>.

PS, ugh, that was terrible wording immediately above. Second attempt: That, FF, assumes that all covered by the term "Ebonics" is part of or very relevant to what's covered by the term "AAVE". I'd agree that much of it is, and that's why the duplication of material in the articles is minimal. Much of the original meaning of "Ebonics" isn't covered by "AAVE" (and it is based on linguistic premisses that for now I'll describe as idiosyncratic), thus the additional short article on the term "Ebonics".

<li><b>Keep</b> for now, and allow people who are willing to read and think to consider redirecting it after an intelligent discussion. Dude Man claims above: <i>The African American Vernacular English article uses the phrase "Ebonics" in a context that implies it is the same term as AAVE and vise</i> [sic] <i>versa.</i> Obviously it's not the same <i>term.</i> Does it have the same meaning? No it doesn't, and if the AAVE article says that it does, this needs rewriting. (This is not to deny that the meanings overlap.) <i>Any novel information in this article could easily be merged with the AAVE article considering the terms are synonymous.</i> This is a clear demonstration that Dude Man hasn't even bothered to read the article he's so keen to have deleted. ¶ The attempt to delete this article should be seen with <a href="../../../a/f/r/Talk%7EAfrican_American_Vernacular_English_1fbc.html#Article_Title:_Ebonics_vs._AAVE" title="Talk:African American Vernacular English">this discussion</a> as a background.

<li><b>Keep</b> this article. And, as Hoary rightly says, read the AAVE article and the discussion on its talk page before rushing to merge two articles that do not actually mean the same thing. This AfD has been precipitously brought in the midst of a very lopsided discussion happening on the AAVE talk page and so nothing should be done here before the dust has settled there. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 05:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep separate</b> I think that the history of the word by itself makes this a keeper. Yes the word is practically synonomous with AAVE, but it has a history of its own.

<dd>Let's hear it one more time. "African American vernacular English" is the linguistics term. "Ebonics" is not. It's a poltically-charged (i.e. non-neutral, non-scientific) term that is used by some for AAVE, but that has other overtones as well. "Ebonics" resides in a political and cultural context, "AAVE" in a linguistics context.

<dd>I get it. I get the fact that you have absolutely no evidence supporting those assertions. I get the fact that you're evading the actual question as well.

Further: <i>The combination of the media spotlight, race, language, education and politically correct dogma soon leapt beyond the political realm and became fodder for comedians, pundits, and editorial cartoonists (see chapter 8), and "-bonics" soon became a productive suffix as off-color Ebonics jokes began to flourish. Daytime and late-night talk shows began to lampoon Ebonics....</i> (Introduction, p.12).

<li><b>Vote changed to merge</b> I'm changing my support of having this article deleted and instead supporting it to be redirected and merged to the AAVE article.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidudeman_9722.html" title="User:Wikidudeman"><b><font color="blue">Wikidudeman</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidudeman_054f.html" title="User talk:Wikidudeman">(talk)</a></sup> 04:03, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'd disagree with that too, as I've explained on the talk page of AAVE. But putting aside my disagreement, I'd ask you to help people coming later to this AfD by crossing through your earlier requests to delete. The simplest way to do it is via the (old fashioned) HTML "s" tag, &lt;s&gt;like this&lt;/s&gt;.
