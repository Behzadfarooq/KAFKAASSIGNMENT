<li>Looks thorough, but what does it mean? <b>D</b>elete <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 01:08, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>, NOT delete, will someone state his objections, please? This article compiles the information about these border-cases gathered from the main wikipedia articles about the continents and states involved. I think that instead of continius fighting about what country to include where - this article clears the things out and everyone should be happy with the compromise - also this article acts as some sort of a mover of the unresolvable debate about continent borders from the main pages to a separate 'borderline cases'-page. Also this article reflects the geographical reality. Anyway, even if some information is wrong, why not correct it instead of delete the whole article??? <i>Unsigned by User:62.204.151.1</i>
<ul>
<li>As you say, it duplicates information. How about turning it into a list, instead of rehashing stuff from other articles? <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 01:27, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is it not currently like a list? There are some explanations given, but it could not be plain list... it should be noted WHAT is listed... that's why there are explanations. I think that the information about that subject is much better synthesied here - in one common place, where eveyone can look into (or change if needed) when some debate about states on the continent borders arises... User:62.204.151.1
<ul>

<li>Europe/Asia border is drawn along the Caucaus watershed-Caspian Sea-Ural river-Ural montain-Arctic Ocean. This is the most recognized path. The other - KumaManychRivers-Caspian Sea-Emba river-Ural mountain variant is much rarely used, but we can add it too for completecy.<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlinor_19c1.html" title="User:Alinor">Alinor</a> 07:59, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Americas and Asia/Africa border is drawn along the Isthmus/Canal of Suez/Panama - as stated in many Wikipedia articles. The Oceania/Asia islands are choosed according to the oceania's Melanesia Wikipedia page. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlinor_19c1.html" title="User:Alinor">Alinor</a> 08:42, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note that the exact definition of continents is disputed - see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">Continent</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 19:03, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>; looks interesting and could be expanded in lots of ways. For example, Turkey's bid to join the EU is based on its partial European geography, whereas objections from other European countries are based on its predominantly Asian culture. Other countries have similar political and cultural ambiguities. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 04:01, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I believe the problem is this: if the listed countries have nothing in particular in common other than the fact that they are considered to be on two continents, then the list is as arbitrary as List of countries with an R in their name - ergo, not encyclopedic. If the listed countries <i>are</i> alleged to have something else in common, then the article would be original research. Either way, <b>delete</b>. As a side point, inclusion on this list is arbitrary depending on from what POV you define 'continent' - see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">Continent</a> for details. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 18:59, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The common thing is that they are bicontinental and this is quite enough reason to make such a list - look at the edit wars, witch errup everytime one such country is put on 'the other' continent. This article is a good place to present the subject from a neutral point of view (if you object something in this article - let's discuss and change, not delete) and to release the other articles of these edit wars. (<a href="../../../b/i/c/Talk%7EBicontinental_country_6148.html" title="Talk:Bicontinental country">rant</a>).</dd>

They are practiced by MANY PEOPLE. So it looks that there IS NEED for the information on bicontinental countries to be compiled (and improved) at one single place (not individualy on each country - one time for Russia, next time for Cyprus, again for Turkey, etc.) - I suggest this place to be here.62.204.151.1 19:55, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Since there are edit wars about this subject, creating a new article that explains your POV is not a very good way with dealing with them. It seems to me that the people participating in those edit wars would not agree with the contents of the Bicont page. Hence, it gives them an extra arena to fight edit wars in. Instead, you should go to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> and resolve the issue. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 22:10, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The relevance of this sort of seemingly trivial information may require several steps of inference. For example, I could see relevance to this sort of information when dealing with the politics of conservation. Indonesia's conservation strategy should take <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallace%27s_Line_772f.html" title="Wallace's Line">Wallace's Line</a> into account and potentially treat things very differently on either side. Turkey may have a similar concern across the strait of Bosporus. Panama and Egypt are both in an unual situation with the existence of the Panama and Suez canals. These have isolated once contiguous biological ranges and have led to geographic reproductive isolation among populations on either side. I suspect there's plenty of relevance to this sort of discussion outside of biology as well. Admittedly, borders of continents are somewhat arbitrary, but I think this information is still potentially of some value. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 01:51, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not a notable enough subject to rate a Wikipedia article. Phoenix, Arizona is the only city with an article on anarchist activities in the city. Article is entirely about "black bloc" groups in Phoenix today who have no notability nor influence, neither within anarchism nor within mainstream politics, thus it looks like a possible vanity article. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">Kaibabsquirrel</a> 01:51, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just a follow-up <b>comment</b>: I could see city by city articles on anarchism justified only for those cities where it is notable. Say, Chicago or Seattle. Even there, the Chicago article might as well just redirect to <a href="../../../h/a/y/Haymarket_Riot_85b6.html" title="Haymarket Riot">Haymarket Riot</a> and the Seattle article to <a href="../../../w/t/o/WTO_Meeting_of_1999_b4c3.html" title="WTO Meeting of 1999">WTO Meeting of 1999</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Even though this article lacks a lot of information, it can and will be improved upon. Anarchism in Phoenix is in fact notable for many different reasons which will hopefully be written within this article. I would suggest keeping it up for a little with the hopes of someone updating it. The Phoenix Anarchist Coalition does have notability within Phoenix and espescially Tempe which is a part of Phoenix. Just a note I am not the author of this article. And the Phoenix Anarchist Coalition nor any of the other groups mentioned within this article have anything to do with the blac bloc. And even moreso the Phoenix Anarchist Coalition has been very influential within the national anarchist movement with special emphasis on the southwest

<li><b>Delete/Merge</b> I don't see a problem with a particular track being listed and detailed in the artist's own page, but why is it necessary to have an individual entry for it? If a particular track has had enormous cultural impact - if it has entered the national/international consciousness, then yes. 'Rhapsody in Blue' springs to mind, but I'm sure there are more modern examples. This might be a hit single (I have never heard of it - sorry), but is Wikipedia going to list people's favourite tracks by their favourite bands now? That is more the field of allmusic.com and the like. Keep the details of the track - but under the artist's name - not as an individual entry. Jez</li>

<li>I tried a Google search for "Jesse Ball" poet. It came up with the Amazon article, the Boston Review review and that the New Republic had published one of his poems. This was enough to convince me that he was notable enough for Wikipedia. I hope that my use of the word clearly was not interpreted as a criticism of the momination. It was certainly not my intention and I apologise if such an impression was conveyed. In my view, people nominate articles for deletion because they do not consider that the subjects should be covered. Discussion should not reflect on the motives of those people who vote and people should put forward good arguments for retention, deletion or other options. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 08:16, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

That, combined with the fact that at least one wikipedia user considers him memorable some 70 years after his death, provides a little bit of evidence that he's notable-- <b>very</b> weak evidence, admittedly, but I'd rather err on the side of including information, and giving this article a chance to grow. I've revised the entry to make it coherent English. Note, however, that the name of the piazza (and the inconsistency within the article) suggest that his name might be "Cesare Ferro Milone" rather than "Ferro Milone Cesare".

<li><b>Comment</b> It actually <i>could be</i> an encyclopedic topic if anyone wants to work on it. It was evidently coined in the early 1960s from a common French word, <i>bricolage</i>, to describe a certain type of individual in society: "The <i>bricoleur</i> is adept at performing a large number of diverse tasks; but, unlike the engineer, he does not subordinate each of them to the availability of raw materials and tools conceived and procured for the purpose of the project. His universe of instruments is closed and the rules of his game are always to make do with "whatever is at hand", that is to say with a set of tools and materials which is always finite and is also heterogeneous, because what it contains bears no relation to the current project, or indeed to any particular project, but is the contingent result of all the occasions there have been to renew or enrich the stock or to maintain it with the remains of previous constructions of destructions." —<a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss_37a9.html" title="Claude Lévi-Strauss">Levi-Strauss, Claude</a>. <i>The Savage Mind</i>. 1966 (Paperback edition; University of Chicago Press, 1968 <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0226474844</a> ). <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDialUp_ed76.html" title="User:DialUp">DialUp</a> 04:10, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> It is an important topic. It should remain as a starting point. It's a lazy stunt to simply quickly read it and vote for its rejection. What you should do instead is to improve it. That would be the responsible thing to do. If you don't want Wikipedia to contain explanations of substantive issues, then say so. If you are willing to spend any of your time improving on the explanation of false flag then do that. At least point out the factual errors, or provide a logical refutation of the statements I made. - Bill Cannon</li>

<li><b>Keep and Expand</b> Mark Hardy is absolutely correct. An understanding of the real functioning of the 'National Security State' is only possible if the workings of the intelligence services are brought to light. The term 'False Flag' has gained new currency following the september 11 attacks and has recently been employed in several public addresses regarding the War on Terror's enabling event.

<p>I have watched you, Jayjg, in various topics, using your position as administrator, intervening in various topics all over the place with what looks very much like censorship to me. I can see that many people have attempted to refine, expand and clarify the information in Wikipedia about topics such as apartheid, racism, even the USS Liberty incident, etc., and here, false flags but that you are always there to ensure that no negative references to anyone Jewish or anything Israeli is ever allowed to stay. At least here in the area where we are free to discuss the validity of the phenomenon of false flags you have no justification for removing what I have to say about you. I say again, that the phenomenon of false flag operations is utterly relevant to understanding events in the contemporary world, and an explanation of it, with examples, is essential here in Wikipedia, in spite of your effort here to quash the discussion by declaring as invalid the very inclusion of the topic in Wikipedia itself. I do not appreciate what you are doing here, clear as it is to me, and disgusting as it is to me. I don't like censorship and I don't like how you achieve it here in Wikipedia in your own small way. The strength of the arguments made here in support of not deleting this page is evidence enough for keeping this page ini Wikipedia. You are the one who has a political agenda here, not me. Shame on you. And I will document your behavior, to reveal you as the de facto censor that you are. If it looks like I'm a sockpuppet because I forgot to log on for one of my comments then shame on you again for jumping on that and adding an interpretation to that which you know darn well is NOT an intentional effort to introduce the sockpuppet effect here.

<dd>Yes, and I've watched you "Bill", and the various other sockpuppets you are using here (the ones you call "many other people"), and seen your absurdly POV "contributions" to Wikipedia.

<p>You should be upset, and you should be concerned, because I will deliver, and I will expose your tactics and your intent. You clearly don't have time to contribute to Wikipedia except by censoring, for you surely don't add facts or material that can inform others in all your visits here, but instead use your position to demean others, to attempt to muffle their contributions when it threatens your work to keep Wikipedia from being a source of knowledge that actually explains things as they are. The importance of a thorough explanation of the false flag phenomenon in today's world is clear from the way that it threatens the role you have settled into here and no amount of "lable throwing" or "name calling" at my on your part adds any rational support to any argument supporting deletion of this topic. Instead, it provides evidence that this topic IS important, and that its deletion will weaken Wikipedia as an uncensored source of facts and information about the world we live in. I expected an ad hominem attack; it reveals the bankruptcy of your position and your fearful desperation that someone would see through it so readily. Your ad hominem attack is as irrelevant here to the discussion as any specious comments can be and I reject its appropriateness. I challenge you to lay out any argument for deletion rationally, if you can. Challenge the ideas, not the people who present them. That's the standard here for Wikipedia and its "administrators" if Wikikpedia and its "administrators" are what they pretend to be.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Sure, entertainment is important to many folks, once their basic needs are met. However, that doesn't mean that the English Wikipedia (or the English wiktionary, for that matter) needs a separate article on all the words for <i>entertainment</i> that exist in a couple of thousand human languages Unless there is some evidence that the word is in the process of being adopted into English. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:16, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The english wiktionary certainly wants all the words for entertainment in all languages. What wikipedia doesn't have is an article for Japanese entertainment although <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Japan_02eb.html" title="Culture of Japan">Culture of Japan</a> is close, maybe it could be merged into that. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 21:18, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The remit of Wiktionary is <i>all words in all languages</i>. Being the English Wiktionary means that <i>the articles are written in English</i>, not that it only covers words in the English language. Thus article titles can be in any language, and indeed as per Wiktionary policy <i>should</i> be in the script of the language concerned. (So the articles at Wiktionary would be <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%8A%B8%E8%83%BD%E7%95%8C" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:芸能界">Wiktionary:芸能界</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%8A%B8%E8%83%BD%E4%BA%BA" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:芸能人">Wiktionary:芸能人</a>, and <i>not</i> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/geinokai" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:geinokai">Wiktionary:geinokai</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/geinojin" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:geinojin">Wiktionary:geinojin</a>.) In contrast, article titles in Wikipedia <i>are</i> in English (as per the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">naming conventions</a>). However, I'd like to see evidence of widespread use of these romanizations. If they aren't terms that English speakers would actually use, then they don't justify their being articles. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:36, 2005 Mar 7 (UTC)

That said, regarding BM's comment that this is just a dicdef of 'entertainment,' the Geinokai is an untranslatable concept in English, and as a social phenomenon does not map 1-to-1 with the 'world of entertainment' or 'entertainment,' etc. It goes beyond that, and is a much narrower concept, so I thought it would be useful to include an article about it, since there's articles about <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_idol.html" title="Japanese idol">Japanese idols</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarento.html" title="Tarento">tarento</a> and so on. If those things, which have obviously been recognized as independent concepts worthy of articles, are included, it would make sense to keep Geinokai. Of course, the article would have to be expanded to make this clear. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7EReldam_48f6.html" title="User:Reldam">Reldam</a> 21:22, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately while the policy says "dicdef '<i>with no potential for expansion</i>", in practise people vote delete anyway, so the expansion can't happen. Maybe wikipedia isn't the best place to try and cover non-English-using cultures. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:59, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Mabye this, and other Japanese (non-english) words would be better explained and less likely to be put up for vfd if they were included in some kind of article or list, like List of Japanese words related to entertainment- with the individual words are redirects to the list. I guess it would be like a glossary.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 02:07, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I completely agree with these comments. Japanese popular culture has taken on a life of its own among non-Japanese-speaking peoples (the US and France coming foremost to mind), and as evidenced by other articles specifically defining Japanese words in common use among such fans, there is clearly a niche. Maybe a category called "Japanese popular culture" could be created, under which everything from manga to tarento could be included. As I said before, however, I'm new to this, so I don't know how one would go about doing this. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7EReldam_48f6.html" title="User:Reldam">Reldam</a> 18:25, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unless someone can make a credible argument that Japanese entertainment is significantly different from everyone else's entertainment (and enough different that it deserves a breakout from <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Japan_02eb.html" title="Culture of Japan">Culture of Japan</a>), I have to vote to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:Transwiki">Transwiki</a> to Wiktionary. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7EReldam_48f6.html" title="User:Reldam">Reldam</a> hints that there might be differences but didn't provide evidence. If the article is expanded before the discussion period ends, I'll reconsider my vote. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:28, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course Japanese entertainment is different from everyone else's. Practically every country's entertainment is significantly different from every other's. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:25, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I thought you couldn't expand articles that were being voted on. Basically, there are so many articles specific to Japanese culture (<a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_idol.html" title="Japanese idol">Japanese idol</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mangaka.html" title="Mangaka">mangaka</a> (what other culture has its own list of comicbook writers? - and in so many languages?), <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarento.html" title="Tarento">tarento</a>, etc.) that Geinokai would be an umbrella for them all. If there's no room for Geinokai, then would we delete or transwiki all the other Japan-specific articles? An expanded Geinokai article would discuss the production company system, how scouting works, the Yakuza connection, and more. My argument is that there are so many Japanese pop culture-specific articles (and not just in the English Wikipedia) because Japanese pop culture is unique in the world today, and is beginning to have an influence (although in a different way) like US and British culture had in the 60s. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7EReldam_48f6.html" title="User:Reldam">Reldam</a> 07:16, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You certainly can improve articles during Vfd, although you may have to nag some people to reconsider their votes. An expanded Geinokai article would be a useful way to link the other J-culture items together, but they would still deserve their own articles. Another possibility would be to write about the geinokai in <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Japan_02eb.html" title="Culture of Japan">Culture of Japan</a>, then break it out when its a decent size <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:25, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment. Should be deleted but now, IMHO, it does rise to the level of BJAODN. I love the suggestion of a practical application: "If one needs to store exactly 300,000 units of a product in a storage area of narrow dimensions, and 150 units wide is not an option, one can come very close to the goal with a length of 2027 units." I certainly hope the recent additions are a mischievous joke and not serious. By the way, googling on 2027 reveals many other vacuous and silly pseudo-facts that could be added to the article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 03:02, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is clearly a non-NPOV product of original research. I was willing to just slap an NPOV tag on it and leave it be, but as John Gohde points out, that's only a temporary measure.

<li>I'm not proposing to delete the article to prove a point. I'm proposing to delete the article because I don't believe it can be fixed. You say that it not being changed after receiving the NPOV tag is proof that it is NPOV. I say it's suggests that no one saw this article (since it's not a topic most people would look up normally) and those who did see it couldn't think of a way to fix it. Obviously, I don't want the article deleted so quickly that we can't get any opinions on how to fix it (or even if it needs to be fixed at all, as Snowspinner and I believe and you, John, apparently don't). But in terms of permanent solutions to the problems with the article-- namely while the ideas in it are interesting, they strike me as original research-- deletion is all I can think of. If you disagree with my assertion that the article is original research, I invite you to show me a number of links to reputable and unrelated websites which use the term "Wholeness" in the same way that it's used in the article. If we can do that, it will be a good first step to making it seem less like original research. If we can't do that, then I think it would be best to delete the article because Wikipedia isn't a place for new ideas to emerge but one for old ideas to be categorized. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlj7_e64d.html" title="User:Carlj7">Carl</a> 11:58, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>John is right - an NPOV tag needs a note on talk as to why the tag is there, and preferably some suggestions of what to do about it.

Furthermore, it should be noted that an article is not a "vanity" page simply because it was written by its subject.

<li><b>DELETE</b> - I am the person who they (The members of that forum) are naming on that entry. Khakain is the name of my novel, Khakain the Coming of the Chosen One, I wrote it in 1994 and posted a few chapters on my literary site "Unlimited Fantasy". These members registered the domain name out of spite for me because I shut down their community from my Zelda video game site because they would harass other users on the community, myself, and such. I was hosting the image they think is "Max Fichtl" on my private server and it was hacked without my permission and paraded around thier own forum as some trophy. They have subsequently over the past few years on several occasions attempted to discover my personal identity. At one point in time they posted my phone number on their forum and made prank calls and harrassed my family as late as 3 AM at night. Recently after contacting the teenager, *deleted by said teenager*, who registered the domain and firmly asking for the entire removal of the users attempting to steal my identity, he transferred ownership that day of the domain to an Australian, Andrew Maher, to what he thinks would wash his hands of the issue. This entire entry on Wikipedia is designed to be inflamitory and harrass me. I have attempted at editing the entry 3 times already to remove personal information and harrassment, and replace the entry with the accuracy of what Khakain actually is however each time it was reverted to what it was before by members of their community who likely share the "Khakain" user account, "Castle Guard" (John M.) as well is a member of their forum classified as the "Historian." I have collected an orgy of evidence on the individuals at that forum, including the location of their colleges, and their current residencies, however this is only some of them, many have managed to remain anonymous, however they've left a digital trail online which would likely be easy to follow. Many of them pride themselves in spamming the message boards I currently am co-administrator for with Hentai Pornography and spamming bot programs. I DO NOT WANT my personal information displayed in a public location online, to have my or anyone else in my family's name slandered in that way, this is a form of online cyberstalking as defined by the FBI's computer Crimes Division, and falls under their jurisdiction because it is occuring as a conspiracy between multiple individuals from several states including countries like Canada and Australia. And if the issue is not resolved in due time, I will be pursuing whatever legal recourses are available to me up to and including litigation. I hope that the users of Wikipedia see the perspective I'm coming from and remove the entry and ban users associated with creating this filth. I want to be left alone and I want to be anonymous on the internet and go about my work in peace!

<li><b>Reply</b> It's not hard to find that out when people spam your forums and you trace their IP address and call the school's campus IT department. (That was of course before I and my co-Admin banned those people and they returned on proxy servers) As well, names and addresses are included through the registrar of the domain name. I've already consulted an attorney breifly about the issue. And to clarify, I'm not going to sue Wikimedia, however entries like this could be used as evidence should I decide to pursue a case against specific individuals, if the burden of proof is not strong enough for a criminal case, my lawyer said there was plenty enough for a winnable civil one.

<li><b>Reply</b> Campus IT departments do not hand over the personal information of their college students, it's an internal affair they would deal with (not to mention it would be illegal under current regulations, as you do not represent law enforcement). Not only this, but your vendetta against this community is irrelevent to the subject at hand. Your writings cannot be proven to have been before the registration of this community and this "evidence" of yours is meaningless. 24.194.18.242 20:33, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> All this boils down to is that I want to be left alone, I don't want my name or names or photographs of myself, my family or friends posted and paraded on a public forum like Wikipedia for mockery and harrassment. It is a breach of my personal privacy. If the material is removed and the people from that forum leave me alone, I wouldn't be inclined to prosecute them, it's not something I set out to do, but I will take whatever measures necessary to protect the integrity of my identity, the quality of my work, and the security of my family.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Regarding vanity pages: 'The most significant problem with vanity pages is that they often discuss subjects that are not well-enough known for there to be multiple editors. Additionally, they are often "experimental" pages to which the author never returns. The quality of a Wikipedia article is often presumed to be proportional to the number of edits, so if an article is doomed to be a one-edit page, it should be deleted.'<br />
<br />
As per the already-being-established edit history and the extent of the page's content, it is more than evident that the article serves the purpose of a collaborative effort to chronicle the history of the community, its members, and what products it has wrought (the growing subsite "Tim Hates People" being a prime example, among others -- but that's for the article, not for this page), both for new members and veterans alike.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, regarding Wikipedia's article interests: ' As Wikipedia is, or at least aspires to be, an encyclopædia, it should contain only material that some definable group of people might want to know.'<br />
<br />
The article already has more than enough information to be classified as a relevent information base, and obviously contains material of interest to the members of the community. In no way is it a promotional page; rather, its content more than speaks for its informational nature.

We created an entry to document the name and its origins, and the community is fairly large (the Empire for example, roughly 3/4 of the board's population, is underground, which you cannot see unless you've been approved).

<li><b>Keep</b> This is far from a vanity article.

This particular message board community may not be known well outside of a relatively small corner of the internet, but that does not make it less than noteworthy. Contrary to what you may believe, wikipedia is used by more than bored freshman english students patrolling articles for an egotrip. Who are you to be judge and jury of what something appeals to?

<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps we were mistaken with regards to the experienced editors. However, I think I speak on the behalf of the entire community when I say that, according to the posted, [and perhaps mistakenly taken to be] official deletion policies, it seems well within the spirit of the encyclopedia's goals. It's not that we believe we have a <i>better</i> idea of what this is, but rather that, based on the material available (some of which is quoted in the first two "keep" votes, and we would like refuted), this was a valid article providing "material that some definable group of people might want to know." In our eyes, all the reasons given to delete this article are either in direct opposition to what we thought was the policy, or can be amended with recommendations and support, which is more than available. I've already voted, but we're as stated, we're quite new to the Wiki thing. In fact, we're probably wasting your time already, but some of us want closure on the matter; we've received very little constructive criticism, and yet are told that we could have this article if certain things are done. Could someone please refute these interpretations of the various Wiki-related information pertaining to this debate? Forgive my summary rather than direct quoting:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>From the vanity page definition, regarding fame, we interpreted: <i>"Don't delete just because it's not famous."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And many of the delete reasons seem to say, either explicitly or implicitly: "It's not famous enough, therefore you're either advertising or this is too worthless to exist."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>From the deletion policy regarding anonymous votes: <i>"Don't discount anonymous votes because it violates the premise of good faith in submissions and discourages potential contributions."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The prevailing opinion of many delete voters seems to be this: "You should've known better and registered an account, sockpuppet."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We looked up the definition of sockpuppets, and this is the general idea we got from the Wiki definition; interpreting sockpuppets seems to be a case of good vs. ill faith, but does NOT seem to apply to separate entities taking one side on a matter: <i>"Sockpuppets refer to users running multiple accounts, and while not against the rules, are generally frowned upon."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nonetheless, this is the prevailing opinion we seem to be getting: "Even though you're obviously a full community posting and we've admitted this, this looks suspicious and these are all sockpuppets because it's their first edit. Disregard them."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Explanations appreciated; those of us who started/suggested this project bear no ill will here; this just seems a bit hypocritical. 128.61.69.109 20:30, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia, and those arguing for keeping this article must show that this subject is important enough for an encyclopedia. Not important enough to some niche group or to the people on that forum, but for a general reference work. What makes this different from and more important than any of the countless other forums on the internet? Is it frequented by anyone famous or important? Does it have specialized knowledge of a particular subject? Has it gotten significant media coverage? Objective evidence is what is required here, not a particular interpretation of our own rules. (This is what back in my D&amp;D days we called "rules lawyering".) The best thing you can do to make a case for this article is to provide such evidence. Voting en masse will not do it, as the tallying administrator will most likely toss out your votes as they are allowed to do by policy. This policy is to prevent new users from rushing in from a blog or message board with a particular agenda who don't necessarily have Wikipedia's best interests in mind from overwheliming established Wikipeida users. Given that this policy is designed to prevent precisely what is happening here, you won't be able to argue out of this either. I'm sorry if you think this is unfair, but Wikipedia is not a democracy. Even in a democracy, you can't just show up from outside the society and vote the next day. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 21:08, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment #2</b> Re. 128.61.69.109's questions (composed simultaneously with the post above): Thank you for the sincere and well-formulated questions. I'll try to provide some answers here. First of all, it would help to realize that Wikipedia is an <i>encyclopedia</i>, and strives to provide a wide range of articles that are both accurate, and that might be interesting and useful to the <i>general public</i>. It is not a general knowledge base. This means that the subject of an article has to have a certain level of notability. An example: while I could write a compelling and factually accurate article about my local greengrocer, it is doubtful that anyone outside my neighborhood would be interested in his story. Therefore, the greengrocer might warrant an article in the local newspaper but not in Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A similar choice has to be made about articles pertaining to websites. There are millions out there, and not every one of them is notable enough to have its own article on Wikipedia. To gauge the notability of a site, "hard" criteria can be used, such as the number of Google hits and the Alexa rank (which aren't too impressive for your site, I'm sorry to say). Another, and maybe even more important, criterion is: would anyone <i>not directly associated with the website in question</i> write an article about it? In that case, someone obviously <i>took note</i>, which by definition is a mark of notability. On the other hand, if the article is written by people who are (in this case) members of the forum the article is about, the subject better be something unquestionably notable, or the tag "vanity" is sure to be used. That's why the line you paraphrased reads in full: "Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses are not "vanity" <i>so long as the content is kept to salient material and not overtly promotional.</i>" Salient means: "of notable significance". So we're back at the requiremant of notability.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, suggestions about "improving" the article should be read as: let the article establish why your site is of importance to the general public (i.e. people <i>other than</i> its own members). What are its <i>unique</i> qualities? Why should someone take a look at your site? What contribution have its members made to the Zelda community at large? Is it mentioned on other sites, in reviews, in articles? Establish notability.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the sockpuppet comments: do realize that episodes like this, where someone writes an article about his on forum, the article gets listed here, and suddenly lots of anon users flood the place with "keep" votes, is almost a weekly occurance. It's like waving a big red flag and it will certainly lead to irritation. Imagine a crowd of people you've never met barging into your house, who start to question your choice of furniture and music. Would you receive them with open arms? Of course not. It's just not a polite way to make a first impression.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, it might be useful to know that the VfD page is usually filled with very terse and short comments, that might seem blunt and unfriendly to a new member; however, this is just a way to keep this page working efficently. There are dozens of VfD votes each day, and keeping it concise (unlike my rambling here, sorry guys) is just one way of doing that. See: <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_deletion_e10e.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion</a>. The thing to remember: <i>it's about the article, not about you</i>. Nevertheless, the VfD page is not the most cheerful place to have one's first encounter with Wikipedia. I'd invite you to start at <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome_4140.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome">Wikipedia:Welcome</a> and take it from there.</dd>

<li>Um, and what arguments are those? That you have a right to post whatever you want to an encyclopedia? That's not an argument, that's an assertion which those of us who have been here a while have heard before, and have rejected. Your website is not notable. If there is something that makes it more notable than the 2 million other websites which get more hits, you'll need to make that argument in the article itself, by explaining to us WHY your site is notable.

<li>And you're still doing it. We're not impressed that you rejected them years ago, especially not if this is the amount of thought you put into your decisions. Show us the original discussion where they got rejected and maybe your comment will start to mean something. For the same reason, we don't care about the seniority you attribute to yourself because you've been doing this for however long. I don't care how "jaded" you want to act, these are still copouts. As for improving the article, it'll probably happen if we have some kind of sign that it's worth the effort, i.e. that the work we put into it won't get deleted regardless. <i>unsigned comment from 172.201.48.204</i>

<li>Actually I would vote to delete every personal essay, not just this one. It is against the NPOV policy, and the fact that some people have rewritten articles that were previously personal essays doesn't make it less so. Obviously, if someone will rewrite this into a serious article and prove candid photography is an encyclopedic topic, there is no need to delete it. As it stands, it is unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 23:41, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Mark for cleanup. I'm surprised we don't have an article on this already. The topic is definitely encyclopedic. The writing style is too personal and breeze. But the topic is important enough that it is likely to attract knowledgeable editors who will improve and expand it. If the article's contributor reads this: the biggest problem I see is that you state a number of things on your own authority. The quickest thing you could do to improve the article would be to dig into some books and magazines and replace these statements with quotations from sources that readers will probably accept as authoritative. For example, you say "Arthur Fellig, better known as Weegee, was also one of the great and renowned 'candid' photographers." Can you find a quotation that says this instead of saying it yourself? Don't violate copyright of course, but short quotations are fair use. Be sure to include a reference to where you found it. I thought this statement was obviously correct when I read it, but actually I just tried an online search of The New York Times, a service provided by my local public library; I found several articles about Fellig/WeeGee and was surprised to find that they did <i>not</i> use the word "candid" at all, so now I'm not sure the statement <b>is</b> correct. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:34, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I rewrote the article to comply with the required encyclopediness. Even though I liked it beforehand, it was a simple feat. I believe that focussing on certain aspects of an entry, paragraph by paragraph, makes it easier for other people to understand the content, but also, it makes it easier to find mistakes, add more knowledge, and to rearrange the text. - Wolf, 13:49 (GMT+1), 12 Mar 2005.</li>
