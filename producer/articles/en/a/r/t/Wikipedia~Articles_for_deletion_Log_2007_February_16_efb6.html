This may be a season-long WWE/MTV plot to transfer a group of old veterans and get some story out of it; if so, the entertainment mags (yecch) will be covering it enough for tiny-edge-of-notability.

From a Google search, I found that "prowrestlingblog.com" (not a WP:RS) has a 2006/06/29 article about McMahon taking more creative control over the ECW. The stuff described in the list that's nominated for deletion is part of a longer-term publicly-noted story about the takeover and McMahon's ways, but it's of low enough significance-within-topic to be worthy of merging, not a standalone article, under <a href="../../../s/p/o/WP%7ESPORT_8524.html" title="WP:SPORT">WP:SPORT</a> or <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> or whatever guidelines you think should apply.

<li><b>Delete as unreferenced, likely original research</b> To be fair, I think it would be interesting in the ECW main article to make a mention of the notable personalities who were in both the original ECW promotion and at the launch of the new WWE version of the ECW brand. It would provide some historical connection between the two, at least at the time that the newly remade brand began. However, this particular article appears to be unreferenced and also seems to get into some original research and analysis of the brand.

<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b></s>. The first problem I have with this here is that it's been covered (at least, so says the article), but there's nothing to back it up. The second part I have is that it's also rather opinionated - as it comes from a Libertarian POV, it is going to be easy to violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> here. I think, though, that if the first problem is taken care of, eventually the second problem will take care of itself.

<li><b>Delete</b> It seems to have a strong POV to capitalist based western living, in that its point bases is based on people being able to do capitalist things such as personally buying land, that simply don't apply in other ecenomic based counteries. It seems to be a private (and poor) attempt at measuring living standards by captialist freedom.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I created this article in order to allow Wikipedia readers to access information which I feel is valuable and interesting. Furthermore, the information presented is verifiable (by looking at the project webpage and looking at secondary sources, which can be found with a Google search). Regarding the POV comments, please note Black Falcon's statement above that the Index is POV, not the article (just like an article about the <a href="../../../k/l/u/Klu_Klux_Klan_07cc.html" title="Klu Klux Klan">Klu Klux Klan</a>, for example). Also, the objections explicitly raised in the nomination are invalid:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>The Index webpage is linked to multiple times in the article text and as an E.L... a pretty valid source when the question at hand is the content of the Index. (<i>contra</i>: "Has no reliable sources or references to the 'index'.")</li>
<li>The article certainly does not fail <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> -- it is mentioned and cited by numerous sources.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>However, an implicit objection was made which might be valid: non-notability. ("Appears to have been made up by one person".

I don't know on what criteria "notability" ought to be evaluated in this case, but I invite those editors who have not yet done so to read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_Arguments_e228.html#Arguments_against_deleting_articles_for_non-notability" title="Wikipedia:Notability/Arguments">Arguments against deleting articles for non-notability</a> before voting against the article on that basis (and also to perform a Google search and note the numerous references to the Index). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Runger_5d8c.html" title="User:Dave Runger"><b><font color="#00EEEE">D</font><font color="#00EEEE">a</font><font color="#00CED1">v</font><font color="#00CED1">e</font> <font color="#009ACD">R</font><font color="#009ACD">u</font><font color="#00CED1">n</font><font color="#00CED1">g</font><font color="#00EEEE">e</font><font color="#00EEEE">r</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_Runger_1560.html" title="User talk:Dave Runger">(t)</a></sup>⁄<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dave_Runger_a590.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dave Runger">(c)</a></sub> 04:00, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Note also that Notability is not a specified requirement for Wikipedia articles. Articles are only required to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, avoid being <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and be written from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, and this article meets all of those qualifications. The "Notability" criterion which is often brought up in deletion discussions is done so (legitimately) usually because of concerns relating to the Verifiability requirement, but since the article only attempts to report on the contents of the Index (and these can be easily verified at the project webpage, which is linked from the article), such a non-notability criticism is not legitimate in this context. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Runger_5d8c.html" title="User:Dave Runger"><b><font color="#00EEEE">D</font><font color="#00EEEE">a</font><font color="#00CED1">v</font><font color="#00CED1">e</font> <font color="#009ACD">R</font><font color="#009ACD">u</font><font color="#00CED1">n</font><font color="#00CED1">g</font><font color="#00EEEE">e</font><font color="#00EEEE">r</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_Runger_1560.html" title="User talk:Dave Runger">(t)</a></sup>⁄<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dave_Runger_a590.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dave Runger">(c)</a></sub> 04:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> this article badly fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> currently due to the "Libretarian Philosophy" section. Also, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Runger_5d8c.html" title="User:Dave Runger">Dave_Runger</a>, please be aware that your arguments on the inclusion criteria are somewhat suspect. First of all, while <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> is not in itself an ABSOLUTE requirement for inclusion in Wikipedia, it is an ABSOLUTELY valid reason for deletion as well as a guideline accepted by the majority of Wikipedia editors for both purposes. Further, google hits are not an accurate gauge of notability, they should only be used as anecdotal evidence in concert with other sources of information. Also note that <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> explains that "valuable and interesting" (as you and another have described the article in this discussion) are not themselves valid reasons for inclusion in Wikipedia. Even if we momentarily accept the premise of your argument, this article still fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Sources must be from reliable, third-party <i>published</i> sources, especially in a case like this in which the subject matter concerns a global review and is based on other, similar lists (which do, by the way, satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). If sources are included, such as printed newspaper, magazine, and/or journal articles, and the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> issue is addressed, I see no reason why this article needs to be deleted. However as it stands right now, I have to say delete. I can very easily create an index of similar sorts, that measures some arbitrary concept, find real research to back up my rankings, and calculate the index based on that evidence. Then I could just as easily plant this information online, maybe spread it around a bit, have it cited by some blogs, create a wikipedia entry for it, and maybe submit it to Digg or Fark. Even if I do all of these things, it would still not fit into an encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIRelayer_de15.html" title="User:IRelayer">IRelayer</a> 23:41, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>How is the "Libertarian Philosophy" section POV? The index website <i>itself</i> says that it is libertarian-oriented. The index was created by "Nick Wilson, an activist and co-founder of the Libertarian Reform Caucus, an organization working to turn the United States Libertarian Party into a viable political party". That section is not stating anything that the website itself does not admit to. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:26, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The section has a point of view. It is not saying that the founder is Libretarian, or that the index is Libretarian, it is saying a combination of those things intended to put forth a point of view. Wikipedia is not a soapbox. Even if this were not the case, I believe the article has further problems, thank you for only addressing one of them and ignoring the rest. --<a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIRelayer_de15.html" title="User:IRelayer">IRelayer</a> 07:27, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>There's no need for sarcasm. I still don't see how the section is POV. "Pro-individual freedom, pro-economic freedom and pro-limited government stance" are, in fact, the very tenets of libertarianism. If it quacks, walks, and looks like a duck, it's not POV to call it a duck. However, to satisfy the concerns you've raised, I will replace it with a more neutral and better-sourced section tomorrow. Also, I did not "ignore the rest", but rather focused on what I perceived to be the most important. So, to reply to the other points you've raised:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> is a guideline which I belive should be followed (my agreement with <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Runger_5d8c.html" title="User:Dave Runger">User:Dave Runger</a> above was about the frequent conflation of notability and verifiability. However, this index is noted in a number of sources, which I will add to the article (again, tomorrow). However, as a Google search will show, the index and its rankings are discussed by a number of sources (in my opinion unforunately as I believe the index to be a terrible cross-national indicator of "liberty").</li>
<li><a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. I'm not sure to whom you were referring, but I personally don't like the index. In any case, this is a a criticism of "keep" votes rather than a reason to delete (and I think you have appropriately used it as the former).</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is about "verifiability" rather than being "verified". Most of the information in the article is in fact already verified, and that which is not is certainly verifiable.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In all fairness, you did state that "If sources are included, such as printed newspaper, magazine, and/or journal articles, and the WP:NPOV issue is addressed, I see no reason why this article needs to be deleted." My comment was not intended to dismiss your arguments, but rather to try to understand why you perceived that section to be POV. I hope you will take a look at the revised version of the article and re-evaluate your position in light of its new state.

<li>My point was, that if I make up <i>Selket's world technology index</i> and rank all of the countries by their deployment of technology, <i>Selket's world technology index</i> doesn't deserve a wikipedia page because nobody reputable recognizes it. This has nothing to do with POV or validity of the index, my complaint is that this whole thing is published by some guy in his garage. --<b><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelket_51a5.html" title="User talk:Selket">Talk</a></sup> 07:39, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a>, even if your analogy is a good one (and I'm not saying it is, as you might be hard-pressed to find as many sources citing <i>Selket's world technology index</i> as the number that cite the State of World Liberty Index), I fail to understand what would be so bad about having a Wikipedia article about something some guy published in his garage. This article only represents the <i>subjective evaluation</i> of the State of World Liberty Project's founder. Therefore, his published views on the internet and citations of the Index by other sources is quite enough to establish <i>verifiably</i> that the Wikipedia article is, in fact, accurate in the claims it makes. The Wikipedia article is written in a NPOV, even if the index is not. Furthermore, the Wikipedia article is not a piece of original research. (The article merely reports on research/analysis done by the State of World Liberty Project, which in turn is based on the work of reputable organizations such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Heritage_Foundation_4ef6.html" title="The Heritage Foundation">The Heritage Foundation</a>/<a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_House_082a.html" title="Freedom House">Freedom House</a><a href="../../../r/e/p/Reporters_Without_Borders_f790.html" title="Reporters Without Borders">Reporters Without Borders</a>, etc.). I believe that I have demonstrated that the article meets the three qualifications demanded of Wikipedia article. Deletion votes seem to be based either on the erroneous belief that notability is a necessary quality of Wikipedia articles (though the Index might be "notable" anyhow) and a misunderstanding that a NPOV policy means that the subjects described in articles must have a NPOV. This is utterly false; the articles themselves are, however, required to be written with no POV. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Runger_5d8c.html" title="User:Dave Runger"><b><font color="#00EEEE">D</font><font color="#00EEEE">a</font><font color="#00CED1">v</font><font color="#00CED1">e</font> <font color="#009ACD">R</font><font color="#009ACD">u</font><font color="#00CED1">n</font><font color="#00CED1">g</font><font color="#00EEEE">e</font><font color="#00EEEE">r</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_Runger_1560.html" title="User talk:Dave Runger">(t)</a></sup>⁄<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dave_Runger_a590.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dave Runger">(c)</a></sub> 09:52, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Could you please clarify, I'm <i>very</i> confused. I'm working on trying to improve the article and just can't see where the hell the POV in the article is. The first paragraph is this:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>The State of World Liberty Index is a ranking of countries according to the degree of economic and personal freedoms which their citizens enjoy; each country is given a score between 0 and 100. The Index defines freedom as "the ability for the individual to live their lives as they choose, as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others to do the same." Only one report (the 2006 State of World Liberty Index, released 12 August 2006) has yet been produced by the State of World Liberty Project, but the organization has stated that it will continue to release updated reports annually.[1] 159 countries were ranked in the 2006 report.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>Where is the POV? It is a ranking of countries according to freedom. Maybe it's not a good ranking, but it's a ranking nonetheless. The definition of "freedom" is a quote. And only one report has been produced--that's a fact as well. I'm not sure where you see it as presented "as if it were objective and factual". I do not think this is a good index, but I can't see what problem people are having with the article. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:44, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Additional comment</b>: I see that the single-word page (Palindromic_words) has been "has been transwikied to Wiktionary".

Obviously we don't want the list maintained separately in two places, but I have two questions. First, why would anyone think to look for a list of palindromes (or anthing else for that matter) in a dictionary? Second, even if they did, how would they find the page at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Transwiki:Palindromic_words" class="external free" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Transwiki:Palindromic_words" rel="nofollow">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Transwiki:Palindromic_words</a>?

<li>I asked the help desk at Wictionary whether these lists could go there, and I was told they could. I see no problem in what is essentially an unencyclopedic list moving over to Wictionary if it's OK over there. (I suppose nothing is a sure bet and it might be up for deletion for whatever rules they have, but the administrator over there thinks they'd fit in.) As Wictionary articles, they could easily be linked with the Palindrome article here, just about as easily as a Wikipedia article could be. I think this is the best solution. I'm a bit skeptical about foreign-language palindromes in the English Wictionary, but they could be farmed out with links to other-language Wictionaries, it seems to me. As to whether people would find the list: I think most people who fall upon those lists of palindromes now go there from the Palindrome article, and that won't change. If they find it through a search engine, that won't change either. Here's my discussion at the Wiktionary help desk:</li>

<dd>I just slapped the Wictionary-suggestion notice on the two articles that hadn't been moved there. As for the one that's been copied already, it looks like one article is available in the first link but not the second, more direct link to Wictionary. Maybe it's a matter of time or of decisionmaking over in Wictionary.

<dd>Yes, maybe that's it. Maybe the intention was to put the content at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Palindromic_words" class="external free" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Palindromic_words" rel="nofollow">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Palindromic_words</a>, but for some reason it never happened and it got put at the apparently unfindable <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Transwiki:Palindromic_words" class="external free" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Transwiki:Palindromic_words" rel="nofollow">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Transwiki:Palindromic_words</a> instead. If the links from the Wikipedia palindrome article can be made to point to the lists at Wiktionary then that's better than losing the content altogether I suppose, But I still maintain that a dictionary is not the place for this sort of content. It makes no sense to me... Wikipedia is where it should be. Matt 20:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<li>Hi BuddingJournalist, Please explain what is a <b>Non-notable sailplane product.</b> If notable means <b>worthy of note&#160;: remarkable b: distinguished, prominent</b> I strongly disagree with you.... The Silent 2 Targa is remarkable and distinguished compared to other sailplane and if you are not able to understand why, please let me have the possibility to explain this concept. You say: The article is written like an advertisement, I disagree: this is a technical description of a sailplane, it simply states how the sailplane is made. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDansco2903_773b.html" title="User:Dansco2903">Dansco2903</a>

<li>See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> for Wikipedia's definition of notability. Is the Silent 2 Targa the subject of multiple, third-party, reliable sources? I think phrases such as "innovative", "unique", "very easy and fun to fly", "very good", "nice", etc. constitute the advertising tone, and are certainly not just "a technical description of a sailplane". There's still the copyright violation issue, too; numerous sentences are copied straight from <a href="http://www.alisport.com/eu/eng/silent2_targa1.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.alisport.com/eu/eng/silent2_targa1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.alisport.com/eu/eng/silent2_targa1.htm</a>. <small><a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddingJournalist_e101.html" title="User:BuddingJournalist">Budding</a></small><a href="../../../b/u/d/User_talk%7EBuddingJournalist_fe93.html" title="User talk:BuddingJournalist">Journalist</a> 01:46, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>An object in a book is generally not notable, on top of which the article is an unencyclopedic mess. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELesnail_3c51.html" title="User:Lesnail">Lesnail</a> 01:26, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Save</b>. I deleted the rambling "mess" of the article, though the information could be added back if it was better organized. The Iliad is a famous work of fiction, while I'm not familiar with the specifics, the shield might be of particular importance in the overall story. <a href="../../../z/i/m/User%7EZimmerBarnes_d1fb.html" title="User:ZimmerBarnes">ZimmerBarnes</a> 02:28, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> Is the content that is left enough to warrant an article? It's already mentioned in passing in <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achilles.html#Hector_versus_Achilles" title="Achilles">Achilles</a>, but this article doesn't add any knowledge of the Shield. Further, without the description of "great detail" as written by the poet, what else <i>can</i> be written about the Shield? <a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedlaod_97f5.html" title="User:Cedlaod">Cedlaod</a> 04:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep.</b> The article is slightly inaccurate--the shield is an object in the poem, but "Shield of Achilles" usually refers to the section of the poem where the shield's creation by the god Hephaestus is described. And it's the description that's important--it's one of the first and most famous instances of <a href="../../../e/c/p/Ecphrasis.html" title="Ecphrasis">ecphrasis</a> in western literature, and therefore very important in the history of aesthetics. Books have been written about it--for instance, <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotthold_Ephraim_Lessing_9e89.html" title="Gotthold Ephraim Lessing">Gotthold Ephraim Lessing</a>, <i>Laokoon</i>; A.S. Becker, <i>The Shield of Achilles and the Poetics of Ekphrasis</i>. On the other hand, I'm not going to be able to expand this article any time soon, and I doubt that other editors will get to it soon, so I wouldn't be that upset if the article disappeared. By the way, there are a few other articles on episodes of the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>--<a href="../../../d/e/c/Deception_of_Zeus_ca1a.html" title="Deception of Zeus">Deception of Zeus</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/k/Nekuia.html" title="Nekuia">Nekuia</a> spring to mind; if <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shield_of_Achilles_6576.html" title="Shield of Achilles">Shield of Achilles</a> is deleted, editors may wish to look at those articles as well. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 04:51, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - Definitely a legitimate topic. From just my cursory education in classics, I know this is signficant. There's supposed to be some kind of artwork on his shield with some important symbolism. It's also a motiff in real art. Sofixit. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 07:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Per Akhilleus and Savidan. Very famous passage from one of the most influential works in Western literature. Imitated by later poets such as Virgil (the shield of Aeneas in the <i>Aeneid</i>) and Auden. At the moment it's just a stub but plenty of room for expansion. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 08:35, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the object itself is not terribly notable within the story but the descritpion of it really is a key passage that is very influential. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 10:56, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Update</b> I think it's now a passable short article with room for expansion. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 12:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and suggest <b>speedy keep</b>. Note that the version of the article edited by ZimmerBarnes and Folantin is not the article that was nominated, which appeared to duplicate a long swatch of a prose translation of Homer directly. The description of Achilles' (replacement) shield is a passage from the Iliad that is easily worthy of a separate article, much as the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalogue_of_Ships_4aed.html" title="Catalogue of Ships">Catalogue of Ships</a> is. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> OK, I nominated it for deletion, but now that it is about the section of the poem rather than about the object, I am happy with keeping it. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELesnail_3c51.html" title="User:Lesnail">Lesnail</a> 15:49, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The section you cite tells us that "English-language sources should be used in preference to foreign-language sources, <b>assuming equal quality</b>" (emphasis mine), and no one has claimed that the references on this topic in English are of equal quality to the ones in Japanese on this very Japanese topic.

<p>I actually think that this article is a probably a CSD as it is right on the edge of gibberish. It's a Google translation of the Italian Wikipedia entry for this individual. I'm skeptical of the notability of this individual and, because of the language, can't realistically discern any assertion of notability. Either way, it can't be saved without a complete rewrite from scratch.</p>
<p>As I was uncertain about CSD nomination, I attempted a proposed deletion. This was removed on the grounds that a Google search turned up a few hundred hits about this individual. Even if we agree that this subject is notable (and I'm not on that team at this point), I can't see how a non-sensical article asserts that notability. I also note that the original author of this article shares a last name with the subject, for what it's worth. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlanetneutral_0d3a.html" title="User:Planetneutral">Planetneutral</a> 01:48, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I removed the deletion proposal, not for being opposed to deletion, but to give the deletion wider visibility and discussion. If there are translators and editors with specialized knowledge of Italian and the fine arts, they might be able to help with the wording and comment on whether the individual deserves an article.

<li>It's possible that someone with dual fluency can help clarify that, but I think notability is clearly in question at this point and I don't think that said ambiguity points to a speedy close of the discussion.

<li>Well, he does exist (eight of his books are in the <i>Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Roma</i> online catalogue, the last one dated 1970) but he is not conspicuous on Iranian websites and he doesn't even have an entry in the <i>Allgemeines Künstlerlexikon</i>, which makes him about as non-notable as you can get.

<dd>Sourcing is not the problem I have with the articles, per se. Although the articles invite unsourced material, and would require continuous policing. My real problem is the fact that as a collection of names, the list itself is non-notable. whether certain notable people are LGBT or not may be notable for certain people, aI agree... but this article creates a pro (or con) POV slant... and does not by itself provide encyclopedia context.... what next? List of right-handed people? List of people who like turnips? People who...... the list could go on. But not appropriate for wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 03:59, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you can't tell whether its a pro or con slant, there probably isn't a POV slant at all. The fact that people are gay, lesbian or bisexual is far more significant than that they like turnips. It would be great if we can say sexuality is no big deal. But actually it is. The fact that people come out as gay etc. is a clearly notable fact about them and worthy of being catalogued in an encyclopedia. The examples you cite in comparisson are clearly trivia, this list is not. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 04:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I could not disagree with you more. Every time an interviewer asks a celebrity if they are gay, I cringe.... because I actually do not want to know such a personal detail about somebody. If I can live my whole life without needing to catalog all the gay people in the world, why can't everyone? If the Rosie O'Donnell article and the Ellen Degeneres article say that they are lesbians, based on obvious tons of citable reliable sources, I have no problem with it... but what encyclopedic need does a person have who says "I wonder who all the gays are in the world?" <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 04:11, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The vast majority of people are straight, making this utterly non-notable. The same reasoning explains why <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_left-handed_people.html" title="List of left-handed people">List of left-handed people</a> exists but List of right-handed people does not. Similarly there is no need to have a list people with the normal number of fingers, but there is a list of List of polydactyl people. The number of notable people who have verifiably come out as gay, lesbian or bisexual remains relatively low- which is why in my opinion this list is maintainable and needed. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 04:14, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>aside from inciting an emotional response and inflaming this discussion, what possible purpose could the African American statement above serve? This discussion is not about race, national heritage, or turnip-liking. It is about an indicscriminate list. IF (capitalized on purpose) LGBT people <i>need</i> to know other LGBT people, they do not necessarily <i>need</i> to get that information from wikipedia. Wikipedia inclusion policies are about the encyclopedic content of the articles, not about fulfilling needs of selected groups of readers.

Seriously, the maintainability concern raised by several people above is valid, as more people are willing to openly identify as L, G, or B. It may be impossible to include everyone who fits the criteria. Also, the sourcing for these lists has to be as stringent as possible. But I think the list serves a useful research purpose, and its format allows it to include information that a category can't. (And hopefully no one disputes that the various categories about sexual orientation are useful...) I'm not sure, however, that there's value in maintaining a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bisexual_people.html" title="List of bisexual people">List of bisexual people</a> separate from the other lists; it might be better to <b>merge</b> that one. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 05:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There's no question that these lists need work.

However, to those arguing that this is trivial: if universities start offering degrees in the study of people who like turnips, then yes, we certainly <i>should</i> have a list of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turnip.html" title="Turnip">brassicarapaphiles</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> I am fed up with these lists. The set of people eligible for inclusion in an encyclopedic list should be defined by some notable trait.

I could see that a list of Popes or platinum-selling musicians might be encyclopedic because the set of people listed would be manageable. This list is completely unmanageable.

<dd>Because bisexuality is a separate sexuality from homosexuality, so it deserves its own list for people who want to look up bisexual people: however, when people look up the list of GLB people they're more looking for "not straight" people rather than just gay people.

There is a movement with this list towards making sure that every entry is cited with reliable references and this is on many watchlists to make sure that extraneous and uncited entries are removed. To tell you a little story, when I was just coming out of the closet myself, seeing a similar list (Wikipedia didn't yet exist), helped me adjust to being gay. To be able to see this list gave me something to feel good about: to know that I was in the company of many great men and women. As a gay man, yes this list is important to me, but it's also important information; hardly indescriminate. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 14:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The sexuality of a person considered otherwise famous is, for the most part, trivial information. It's not really something which should be handled via a list like this due to the sheer size of the list which could require massive change at any time. For example, Anne Heche was for a while Gay, then she decided she was Bi, now (IIRC) she's decided she's Straight. So will the list contain people who are LGBT at the moment (which would require DAILY changes of many different entries on the list), or will it include everyone who was once LGBT (which could lead to WP:LIVING violations if the person now objects to the term)?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>While the comparison to left handed people may be correct in terms of the scale of the list, the scope of what is required to maintain the list is entirely different. Someone cannot one day reveal that while they have been pretending to be right handed for years, they actually favor their left. Likewise, switching from right or left handed to ambidexterity requires months of training. Statistically, someone who is left-handed today is going to be left-handed in ten years. The same is not true of a person's sexuality. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 15:47, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Despite difficulties in maintaining such a list, I believe it is a valuable addition. A brief scan shows me almost everyone on the current list is notable enough to have their own article. My reservations are <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerify_6da8.html" title="WP:Verify">WP:Verify</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. I would prefer at least two reliable sources for each listing because, despite what people may say, there is still a widespread stigma attached to these labels. The list provides proof against LGB invisibility and massive evidence of their various contributions. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Pigman_7e6d.html" title="User:Paul Pigman"><b><font color="green">Pig</font></b><sup><font color="red">man</font></sup></a><sub><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Pigman_813e.html" title="User talk:Paul Pigman">Talk to me</a></sub> 20:59, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>That question is I think fairly easily answered.

The list lets people know the occupation and date of birth/death of the person listed before they visit the article. The usual reasons to have a list as well as (or instead of) a category is to provide brief info about each entry. That reasoning seems to apply here. Also its a lot quicker to check if an entry in a list is properly sourced per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> than it is with a category. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 22:40, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Very few of these people are famous because they are G/L/B. That's what takes this from being encyclopaedic to just being a method of grouping semi-trivially.

<li><b>Keep</b> This list needs a lot of work, but given how it should look when it's cleaned up, I think it's necssary and encyclopedic. Dev920 has been working like a dog, with myself and a few others chipping in, and the state of the list is gradually improving. Openly LGBT people are a minority, and bisexual people a minority within a minority. To suggest that non-heterosexual orientation is of no consequence amounts to ignoring the contents of every article in <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_c60a.html" title="Category:LGBT">Category:LGBT</a>, first and foremost the concept of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coming_out.html" title="Coming out">coming out</a>. This needs to be a list more than a category because sourcing is <i>such</i> an important aspect of this (per <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>) and because elaboration is needed. While there have been arguments about who should be included in the list (see talk page) I still think this list can and should be on par with Wikipedia's list standards.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, The list is just as deserving of a place on Wikipedia as any of the other relevants lists such as the lists of African-Americans, Irish-Americans, Left-handed individuals, etc. The requirement was that these individuals are already notable.

<dd>Yes I have, and let's quote from a few: "Delete and salt", how should we interpret "delete and salt" repeatedly used above? is this an allusion to Sodom and Gomorrah perhaps -- words not chosen at random -- or is it an allusion to Rome's treatment of Carthage after years of bitter warfare? In either instance, it's abusive. Then there's the "Delete with fire", when burning of homosexuals was common. Would anyone seriously entertain analogous phraseology like "lynch this article" if used in relation to an African American subject or "gas and burn this article" when used in relation to a Jewish subject. Then there's a few who write from their hearts: "I like many others am personally uncomfortable with classifying people according to their sexuality, because I think people should be allowed to keep their sexuality a private matter if they want to" Gosh, notable people should be able to keep everything else private too, right? Let's delete all private things, even if they've can be found in a verifiably public source, like all that watergate stuff from Nixon's biography, after all I'm sure he would have prefered to keep that a private matter too.

<dd>You misinterpret my words, ExRat, try a small dose of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, it actually tastes good. My point was that when interviewers ask Clay Aiken over and over again if je is gay, after he has definitively stated he is not... I feel bad for him. The same thing happened to Ricky Martin. Not that being gay is bad... being constantly asked about it in public after clearly stating you don't want to be, is humiliating. My worry about these lists is that wikipedia could perpetuate such humiliation by providing such a visible and clearly abused vandal target. As I stated above, since the LGBT wikiproject pledges to patrol these articles, my concern is abated. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 02:02, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Comment - This sounds almost circular at first, but consider this: The fact that <i>these</i> comics won awards is why <i>these</i> comics were covered in this NYT article. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandom832_2ea5.html" title="User:Random832">Random832</a>(<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">t</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Random832_9c40.html" title="Special:Contributions/Random832">c</a>) 03:41, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There new york times is a trivial piece. Here's the whole content from that article that is about the award:</li>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">And there are contests too. The fifth annual Web Cartoonists Choice Awards took place at <a href="http://www.ccawards.com/2005_ceremony.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ccawards.com/2005_ceremony.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccawards.com/2005_ceremony.htm</a> last month. The master of online ceremonies was a Web cartoon character and so were all the award presenters. Otherwise, it was much like the Oscars. There were too many award categories (26) and some commercial breaks, and all winners were rewarded with the Web equivalent of Hollywood fame: a live link to their sites. Consider "Copper," a beautifully drawn animal comic that won the prize for best art in the Web Cartoonists Choice Awards. The prize for best-written comic went to "Narbonic," by Shaenon Garrity. "Alpha Shade," by Christopher Brudlos and Joseph Brudlos, the winner of the long-form comic prize, is 107 pages long. The winning entry in the category of "infinite canvas" went to "Pup" by Drew Weing. "The Perry Bible Fellowship" by Nicholas Gurewitch, the winner of the "comedic comic" prize, does begin to verge on the infinite. The prize in the category "outstanding use of flash" was shared. One prize went to "Alpha Shade" (the one with the great page-turning feature). Another went to "The Discovery of Spoons" by Alexander Danner and John Barber.</td>

<dd>It utterly transparent that the author isn't actually talking <i>about</i> the awards, noting that this was several months after them should provide <i>some</i> clue. This source fails utterly to establish that this is "singularly most prominent and admired awards within an entire genre of art." the attack of the show's re-broadcasting is great and all, but we don't have articles based upon everythingthat ever was on one show. Well, perhaps if the show was <a href="../../../6/0/_/60_minutes.html" title="60 minutes">60 minutes</a>... but that's hardly the case here. unless we're going to go for wholesale abandonment of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">freedom from bias</a> based upon passionate defence, this article must be deleted unless <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">multiple non-trivial sources</a> are added. I understand that there is an active "web community" to whom this awards' importance is claimed to be obvious, but the criteria are really straight-forward, that this claim be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">proven</a> not just <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">asserted.</a><br />

<li><b>Long Comment with no real point.</b> I see where you are coming from. And I might even agree with you to say that the article isn't about the WCCA. But I think the article demonstrates something interesting. The author of the article is using the WCCA as a way to get into different web comics. For him (in the article), the WCCA is a prop... something to get him talking about specific web comics. Maybe that's what the WCCA does... it provides a starting point for people to approach the subject of web comics. It shows people which comics are liked and respected by other artists. As far as I can tell, this is the most notable award for web comics. I think it's a good idea to keep it around. -- <a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESwerdnaneb_2a97.html" title="User:Swerdnaneb">Ben</a> 05:17, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> It is simply incorrect to say that the quotation above is the total sum of the references to the WCCA in the article. Read the article instead of just using your search function and you will find a number of references further down using pronouns and indirect references. This has been asserted and debunked so many times that I'm having a hard time maintaining the assumption of good faith. The NYT article should be read.

<dd>My point is that an award given at a solitary high school is different than an award given to an "industry." One difference would be that we would expect better sources for a seven-year-old "industry" award than we would for any single school's perfect attendance award in a single year. But instead we see the opposite difference, that we seem to have far more sources for an award given in a single year at a solitary high school than we do this seven-year-old award given to an entire "industry." Feel free to draw fruit comparisons. Maybe: "If an attendance award were an Apple, and we shouldn't have an article on the Apple Attendance Award, then we shouldn't have an article on any fruit-based awards with less non-trivial coverage than the Apple Award, so if the Orange Juice Choice award has worse sourcing, then we shouldn't have an article on the Orange Awards." Mmmm ... is anyone else getting hungry? I know am. In fact, I'm really hungry for enough reputable sources that we can cover this topic from a neutral point of view. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 04:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I see. With that in mind, there is at least enough information to fully cite a stub... maybe not enough for a full article, but the article should at least be started. Anyway, it should be short work to make a stub out of the existing information, and when more sources come to light, we can of course restore the appropriate statements from the page history easily. Myself, I'd just leave it as is&#160;— asserting notability on a verifiable topic is good enough for me when the topic is obscure... there are bound to be at least one unsourced statement in an article anyway. Probably the best thing to do here is to leave it alone and simply wait for the sources to appear in the media. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHOzAu_f632.html" title="User:DavidHOzAu">DavidH</a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidHOzAu_91ad.html" title="User talk:DavidHOzAu">Oz</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EDavidHOzAu_59c4.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:DavidHOzAu">Au</a> 11:57, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"The very fact that [someone on this awards' committee] <i>posted</i> about them indicates further notability on the subject"? It seems you are saying that if the members of this awards committe are aware of the awards, then that shows how well known the awards are. I disagree, as I would fully expect an awards committee to be aware of the awards they give out. Further, he is blogging on how little known the awards are: "Problems with the WCCAs [include] making people aware of them, getting people to care about them ...

I disagree with your assertation that the nigh-impossbility of providing sourced information about this site's voting processes is irrelevant: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Attribution</a> is a core policy. How is an encyclopedic treatment of this site's achievements, impact or historical significance possible if the site itself is minimal and, as you suggest, asking for information about it asking too much? As for the webcomic world, I believe that webcomics constitute a fairly small subculture and that webcomic fans have an unrealistic view of their popularity. 'Notable in webcomics' doesn't mean notable, any more than 'notable in origami' or 'notable in homebrewing'. Why can't these awards just be mentioned and linked in <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomic.html" title="Webcomic">webcomic</a> or <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a>, as is normal?--<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas"><font color="blue">Nydas</font></a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 11:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>See my post below re. validity of the NYT article - namely, what exactly would an awards article have to say to be notable in your books, besides describing an award and listing and describing its winners, a process that takes up about 2/3 of the article?</dd>
<dd>I do agree that attribution is difficult, and a paring down of this article is probably in order. I don't claim to know much about the WCCA besides that they exist, and pretty much all the webcomic artists I know of get excited when they win one, even the big names. I, for one, don't care to edit articles I don't know a thing about, but I think it would strengthen the Keep argument if someone who <i>did</i> know something were to edit this a bit.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the importance of the webcomic subculture, it is (ok, getting sick of "irrelevant". New word? um...) unimportant what you "believe" the size of the community is. I would be supporting the inclusion of an article about the Origami Artists' Choice Awards if they had been written up in the New York Times as an example of the internet awards given out to origami artists on the internet, had it been brought to my attention. Especially if a few people who were interested in origami then joined the discussion and listed several origami experts, citing their discussion about said awards and showing that experts in the field were aware of and gave a hoot about the "OACA" one way or the other.</dd>
<dd>The reasoning behind your argument yields the end result, "I don't see how <a href="../../../o/k/a/Okazaki_fragment.html" title="Okazaki fragment">Okazaki fragments</a> are all that notable. Can't they just be contained in the article on <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_replication_3f4b.html" title="DNA replication">DNA replication</a>?" If Wikipedia is not in fact about creating articles that meet Wikipedia's notability standards, and expanding on those articles to the limit of available noteworthy knowledge, I am a little confused about what we are doing here. <b><a href="../../../m/r/e/User%7EMrErku_4e64.html" title="User:MrErku">Erk</a></b>|<a href="../../../m/r/e/User%7EMrErku_4e64.html" title="User:MrErku">Talk</a> <sub>-- I like traffic lights --</sub> 12:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

Quotes from the creator, their motivation, the quirky speeches, info on the judges and a selection of nominees, context and so on. No such coverage exists for the WCCA. If the NYT did an actual write-up of these awards, rather than three or four paragraphs, then the article should be kept.

<dd>All right, you have me in the sense that that shows a lot more information about the Webbys than the NYT article does about the WCCA. Clearly the Webbys are more notable than the WCCA (can't say as I'm surprised), and that is a better article. Regarding annual coverage in a newspaper, comparing the WCCA to the webbys is very misleading: the BBC coverage of the Webbys seems to be mostly "BBC won a webby award last night..." type stuff, in which the resource in question clearly has a vested interest in the awards. In fact, that is also the case in the article you linked, where it appears BBC's intial interest was in their own winning of the award - not that I am calling the article into question, it is definitely valid.</dd>
<dd>However, I would say the NYT article is still very clearly not trivial, and I am not sure where you can come out saying it is. Even if only pared down to the barest bones of absolute direct reference, as Brenneman has done, one comes out with a solid paragraph of information. The definition of non-triviality according to WP:N is: <i>"Non-triviality" is an evaluation of the depth of content contained in the published work, exclusive of mere directory entry information, and of how directly it addresses the subject."</i> with the further elabouration: <i>Examples: The 360-page book by Sobel and the 528-page book by Black on IBM are plainly non-trivial. The 1 sentence mention by Walker of the band Three Blind Mice in a biography of Bill Clinton (Martin Walker. "Tough love child of Kennedy", The Guardian, 6 January 1992.) is plainly trivial.</i> These stress, at least from my perspective, that a "trivial" reference is in fact <i>trivial</i>. It does not spend a paragraph describing the topic in question, in relative detail, nor does it go on to refer back to the topic in nearly <i>every subsequent paragraph of the article</i>. A trivial mention of the WCCA in a New York Times article would be something like, ";There are also awards, like the Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards (link)", the end, proceed with article as planned.</dd>
<dd>Be careful not to apply a judgement call to what is trivial and what is not, based on how important <i>you</i> think the WCCA is. Unless triviality is some ephemereal, hard to define concept - which WP:N does not seem to suggest, else notability would be subjective - there is no way to claim this article is trivial. Not to mention anything of a notable television show devoting an entire episode to it, which Brenneman would like to shrug off, but which is certainly a "non-trivial, reliable published work, whose sources are independent of the subject itself." <b><a href="../../../m/r/e/User%7EMrErku_4e64.html" title="User:MrErku">Erk</a></b>|<a href="../../../m/r/e/User_talk%7EMrErku_e3a0.html" title="User talk:MrErku">Talk</a> <sub>-- I like traffic lights --</sub> 14:12, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did say the NYT snippets were passing mentions, not trivial. However, the NYT article is about webcomics generally, and there is only one paragraph that provides any hard information about the awards themselves, and not very much at that. The TV show did not 'devote a whole episode' to it, it was one of several segments. Whether this segment truly counts as an independent source is questionable, given that it was the WCCA 'Chief Executive' that was hosting it. With both sources being frankly borderline, the lack of further, ongoing coverage clinches it for me; an encyclopedic article can't be created with what is available.--<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas"><font color="blue">Nydas</font></a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 15:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I don't know what the naysayers expect a NYT article to SAY about an internet webcomics award. One would hardly expect them to write a dissertation about its history and management/nomination practices. One would expect, in fact, an article <i>exactly like this one</i>, for almost any award. If this NYT article is non-notable, I can't really imagine a notable article being printed. More importantly, this seems like a strong case of wikilawyering to me. Whether or not there is a dearth of printed articles about the WCCA, almost anyone with ANY involvement in the webcomic industry, from casual readers to authors, has heard of and recognises the WCCA. What is the <i>definition</i> of notability? Is it a tallyup of how many newspapers have mentioned a subject, as WP has lately been leaning towards? Or is that just meant to be an arbitrary measurement of something like, I don't know, how <i>notable</i> something is within its field? Because I would say this is pretty bloomin' notable to webcomics. It doesn't really matter in this debate, since this article meets wp:n anyway, but it is definitely food for thought. <b><a href="../../../m/r/e/User%7EMrErku_4e64.html" title="User:MrErku">Erk</a></b>|<a href="../../../m/r/e/User%7EMrErku_4e64.html" title="User:MrErku">Talk</a> <sub>-- I like traffic lights --</sub> 08:32, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh, as for the individual year articles, neutral. It seems to me one would expect most annual award information to be on the WCCA site itself.

<li><b>Keep</b> Notabilty asserted due to the fact the awards represent an entire industry. Notability asserted due to multiuple coverages in known publications (NTY, G4). And a comment - award presentations - even well known ones - can be boring and often don't attract huge coverage in media, but that has nothing to do with the notabilty of the award.

<li><b>Keep</b> For the main article, merge the years into a single article or with the main article. To repeat my argument in the undeletion, 'As per the NYT article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/17/books/17comi.html?ex=1281931200&amp;en=08e3777cc4943486&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=geartest&amp;emc=rss" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/17/books/17comi.html?ex=1281931200&amp;en=08e3777cc4943486&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=geartest&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> and most of an episode of "Attack of the Show" <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/episodes/4335/Web_Toon_Awards_Picture_Podcasts_The_High_Speed_Scene.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/episodes/4335/Web_Toon_Awards_Picture_Podcasts_The_High_Speed_Scene.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>'. As I said, independent mentions in a mayor national newspaper and a popular cable/satellite television show (on G4TV) should count for something. The fact that the writer of the NYT article disagreed with many of the judges choices (and apparently disliked the medium as a whole) is irrelevant here. What is relevant is that the writer thought the awards were important enough, or representative enough to devote 7 paragraphs to them and its winners in an 18 paragraph general article about webcomics (actually, rereading it, the WCCA's seem to be used as one of the articles main 'hooks').

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">'fame' and 'importance' are not the right words to use, they are merely rough approximations to what we're really interested in, which is verifiability and NPOV. I understand and appreciate where people are coming from on the 'Yes' vote, but feel that they will only get the unanimity necessary in a wiki environment if they rephrase the issue in those terms. Consider an obscure scientific concept, '<a href="../../../q/u/b/Qubit_Field_Theory_b73c.html" title="Qubit Field Theory">Qubit Field Theory</a>' -- 24 hits on google. I'd say that not more than a few thousand people in the world have heard of it, and not more than a few dozen understand it. (I certainly don't.) It is not famous and it is arguably not important, but I think that no one would serious question that it is valid material for an encyclopedia. What is it that makes <i>this</i> encyclopedic? It is that it is information which is verifiable and which can be easily presented in an NPOV fashion. (Though perhaps only as a stub, of course, since it's very complicated and not many people would know how to express it clearly in layperson's terms.)</td>

<li>My thinking goes something like this: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: "Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require stronger sources." <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>: "articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers, but should describe the site in an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance" Is it an "exceptional claim" to say a website has had impact or historical significance?

So let's go right out and delete everything less notable that Francis, God help us if Jimbo shows up and demands the same treatment, or does it only work for Francis? Let's examine the article on its merits. Wikipedia is case by case and has shades of grey. Wikipedia is a broad church.

<li>No, the point is that you think these are trivial mentions and that you think they aren't notable enough. The NYT article used the awards as a hook, criticised them but placed a value on them. The NYT article assessed them as relevant to the field of webcomics, discussed them as part of the medium. It was not trivial. Triviality is a throw away "The WCCA were awarded on Tues night". Triviality defined in the guideline as follows:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Trivial coverage, such as (1) newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, (2) newspaper articles that simply report the times at which such content is updated or made available, (3) a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or (4) content descriptions in internet directories or online stores.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>This was not trivial coverage by that definition. It wasn't a brief summary of the website. This wasn't reporting the internet address, it wasn't an internet directory listing and it wasn't telling you update times, in fact it deferred to the awards in picking strips to cover.

<li>I applaud the effort, but at this stage the author's opinion is pretty much invalid. Her article has been published already, and clearly makes more than trivial mention of the WCCA. Whether or not she <i>intended</i> the mention to be trivial is not the issue: very clearly, the mention is not trivial. I know you know the definition of trivial, brenneman, so I am in the dark as to why you think this doesn't meet it. At best, one might call this a "casual" mention, but it covers far too much ground to be trivial. Allowing the author to amend their opinions on a published work defeats the entire purpose of using published works, namely that they are in print and unchanging.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are some confusion about the format that Comixpedia uses and as a long time reader, and previous contributor, I can shed some light on this. Comixpeida.org is a comic wiki, not to be confused with comixpedia.com (although they have the same publisher). Comixpedia.com consists of one magazine part, which is under editorial control. The content is contributed by staff writers and freelancers to editors. Back when I contributed, you got payed for what you wrote (a rather symbolic amount though, it was 10 US$ for columns and somewhat more for articles if I remember correctly), but I admit I don't know if they still do this. The current month's magazine content can be found on the right side of the frontpage. The second part of comixpedia.com is the community/news section consisting of forums and blogs. The way the frontpage news work is by community contribution. A person writes in their blog on the site, and the newseditor promotes it to the frontpage if he/she finds it to be of interest. <a href="../../../e/p/a/User%7EEpameinondas_efbf.html" title="User:Epameinondas">Epameinondas</a> 14:58, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's not a 1-paragraph mention, it's spread throughout the article, the person copying it here compressed it, so it looks smaller. They also arguably left out other references to the awards.

<li><b>Keep</b> main article, <s><b>Delete</b> yearly articles.</s> Notability requirements have been filled, and the fact that there are criticisms over the award's organization does not in any way affect whether or not it should have an article.

<li><b>Keep</b> The current procedural argument to establish notability is currently based on minimal foundations but these are solid enough to support the existence of an article. The argument against the NYT article supporting notability requires that the mention of the WCCA be trivial, that is, the NYT article would not be substantially changed or significantly reduced by the removal of references to the WCCA. My understanding is that it would be significantly changed in that one or more introductory paragraphs would be lost and the structure of the NYT article would be lost, reducing it to a series of isolated comments on a random and, to the read inexplicable, sampling of comics without any basis for asserting that they are in any way representative of web comics or to show that they have not been carefully selected by the NYT reporter to support her positions regarding web comics. I believe this argument shows that the WCCA were not a trivial part of the article and since there appears to be a consensus that the article as a whole was non-trivial it therefore follows that the mention of the WCCA was non-trivial.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I remember hearing of Starslip Crisis on at least two separate Internet contexts at least six months ago. I've never read it, but after reading the article, it sounds like an interesting comic. By the way, many notable AND non-notable webcomics (indeed, many print comics and print comic strips) have <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_paperback.html" title="Trade paperback">trade paperback</a> collections; both <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garfield.html" title="Garfield">Garfield</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Goonish_Shive_89a5.html" title="El Goonish Shive">El Goonish Shive</a> have collections available. One point I've not heard yet in this discussion: notability is based on context. For the larger world audience, any <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkour.html" title="Parkour">Parkour</a> enthusiasts or <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_running.html" title="Free running">Free running</a> clubs outside of the originators are largely irrelevant; the same is likely true of past <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toastmasters.html" title="Toastmasters">Toastmasters</a> World Champions of Public Speaking, but as a Toastmasters AC-B myself, I would recognize the names of at least the past three if I heard them in passing. Webcomics are largely more notable within their intended audience, as is everything else. There are people who don't know anything about Brian Peppers, and people who don't know anything about Bahrain; if those people are called on to decide the notability of such articles, they're not as likely to find it notable as people who know more about the subject. On whose context does Wikipedia depend? --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueNight_546f.html" title="User:BlueNight">BlueNight</a> 06:22, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Looks like that may be wrong though, as we seem to be having arguments over what constitutes reliable published works as detailed in this part of the guidance: "The inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, or journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it." I'd suggest it is subjective, the arguments support that and that that section be stricken. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 11:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not sure why that would be -- whether they were sock puppets (seemed obvious to me) or just goofy new users, their sillier arguments (Alexa rankings, convention appearances, etc.) were pushed aside to focus on actual content standards, which the article didn't meet then or now. I think the idea was that the puppeteer was going to nominate the article based on a bad Alexa search and back it up with things like "hasn't even been invited as a guest to conventions." Then when it would get deleted for those reasons, the puppeteer would say it was all a joke and that the Alexa search was bad and he really was a convention guest and we would all be really embarrassed and keep his article. Instead, we ruined the joke and said "Alexa rankings, convention appearances, etc. aren't particularly useful for writing encyclopedia articles," and deleted it based on our actual policies rather than somebody goofing around with puppets.

You might as well delete every single webcomic but <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny-Arcade_06d0.html" title="Penny-Arcade">Penny-Arcade</a> then, since The <a href="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/profile.php|Webcomic" class="external text" title="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/profile.php|Webcomic" rel="nofollow">list</a>, the most complete list of webcomics I've been able to find lists only 8,300 - that's including webcomics that no longer update and comics in multiple languages. Assuming that the actual number of webcomics is as much as 3 times what this site has been able to find... we're still looking at 24,000. My point is to show how much this has been blown out of proportion. It is possible for reasonable people to come to a consensus on what webcomics should be considered notable without resorting to off the wall numbers. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESeph_Vellius_4783.html" title="User:Seph Vellius">Seph Vellius</a> 06:45, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>That 24,000 estimate sounds incredibly low. Why would we expect that 1/3 of all webcomics in the world are listed on that site?

<li>Can you speak on why it is not? If you were being honest here, you'd admit that you're destroying information because you can... and perhaps because you're a tad bitter over the author's stunt. If winning awards at the WCCA doesn't establish notability in webcomics then nothing does. And don't even think of turning that around to say that no webcomics are notable because many clearly are; otherwise, there wouldn't be so much controversy over the current deletion spree. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_9_6eb1.html" title="User:Rogue 9">Rogue 9</a> 01:04, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I must apologise for the previous statement, I did not intend to assert myself on you. In my opinion, these awards are neither notable enough to be included on Wikipedia nor should they be used to assert and substantiate the notability of a webcomic, purely based on them. I hope I make myself clear here. I believe if you are rooting for the article because they have been mentioned in the New York times, the argument is not valid. As there is only a <i>trvial mention</i> of the WCCA in the article, which is not enough to make it notable for inclusion. — <a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_ae26.html" title="User talk:Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington"><font color="black">Nearly Headless Nick</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_0b0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington"><font color="black" title="Contributions"><sup><b>{C}</b></sup></font></a> 10:36, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Apology accepted. I'm still unclear as to what we are discussing. Are we discussing Starslip Crisis, which has not been mentioned in the NYT; or the WCCA, which has, and which you assert is a trivial mention and which I assert is not, and which you further assert should not merit inclusion since it fails a guideline, and which I further assert should merit inclusion since it meets policies. If we are discussing the latter article's deletion debate, I suggest we don't do it here. If you want to make the case that the WCCA aren't of enough value to ascribe notions of notability outlined at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, go ahead.

<li>I would say that a very significant fraction of those regularly reading webcomics that have won WCCAs are aware of the WCCAs... which in itself constitutes a rather large number of people if you start adding up readership figures. They do not garner much media attention off the internet, but do garner a fair amount of attention <i>on</i> the internet. Just not as much as they'd like; call webcomic artists demanding attention whores as a community if you like. See search engine results, a prime indicator of net attention, which show the WCCAs coming up higher on a number of interrelated searches than the mammoth Eisners and Reubens (e.g., the basic comics+awards search), sometimes even outranking the perennial Usenet-favored Squiddies. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 10:07, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, that's what I'm getting at. What we've got that can be verified independently is the first two sentences. Is that enough to build an article on. All the rest, I hope you will agree, can be fleshed out from primary source material. But is that first two sentences enough? If we had a stub with just those two sentences, sourced from a reliable source, is that enough? Would that be a stub worth having? Would that make us a better encyclopedia or a worse one? That's what I think the argument is, that's what I think we should be discussing. What better serves our readers? What are we here for? Let's forget the point/counter over well-known and triviality, this is basically what it is all about, isn't it? What's not enough information to write from? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 11:33, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The other two are Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in Wikipedia articles.</i> Now I can't see a mention of notability there, I can't see that those notability guidelines form a part of what should "determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in Wikipedia articles", so forgive me if I ignore them somewhat. I think that's what policy dictates me to do, but if I have it otherwise feel free to enlighten me. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:49, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay, so what are we saying? Stubs are no good? Surplus to requirements? What do we do with them, merge them to where the information may be useful? Delete them? What are we doing here, what's the goal? An encyclopedia of the stuff we consensually agree we like? Where's the line? It's not a black and white issue we have here, is it, it's light and shade, and we dapple our canvas with care. What do we need? What is enough. Because it changes daily. We know this comic strip exists, but that's not enough. We can verify it exists, easily, but that's not enough. We can verify a point of note, that it was one of the first Blank Label Comics. But that's not enough. How do we decide what is enough? How do we explain to people who don't get it that that's not enough? Is it enough to say, look, go read that page over there, that's why? Does that work when that page doesn't really get specific? Or do we need to take the time to work out what isn't enough? What do we do when there is some merit for the information somewhere? I mean, we agree there's merit in a mention of the strip being made somewhere on Wikipedia, right? So should we explain that sometimes, until there's enough material to work with which allows us to write from a full neutral perspective, when there's enough sourcing to allow us to balance different point of views, when there's enough to seed an article and allow primary source material in, then the time is right? Do we allow primary source to build an article? And should we explain that sometimes we do allow articles to rely more heavily on primary source? And try and work out what the difference is? It's not easy working these ideas out, and we should never pretend it is. We shouldn't pass people off on poorly written guidance. We shouldn't even parrot it. We should take the time to consider the best thing for the article. We should listen to the article. Where does this article want to be? What do the independent sources tell us about this article? They tell us it is by <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristofer_Straub_f1de.html" title="Kristofer Straub">Kristofer Straub</a> and it was one of the strips with which <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blank_Label_Comics_d9bb.html" title="Blank Label Comics">Blank Label Comics</a> launched. So it makes sense to include the information there. And if a stub isn't enough here, to allow people to digest that snippet and decide where they want to go first, either to Blank Label Comics or to Straub, then we've got to work out where to redirect it. We've got to take the time to work these issues out. Or we are just a headless bureaucracy. And I don't believe in that Wikipedia. I don't believe in a Wikipedia where we try and score points, where we just battle our position, where we fight and call each other names. I believe in a Wikipedia where we at least try and understand each other, and work towards a consensus, an outcome where we can all point to something conceded and something gained. Where we can share war stories and laugh. Where we build an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>. While popular, this comic is not truly notable -- It has failed to make an impact in the webcomics community. JackSlack 00:56, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. It should be deleted in accordance with the wishes of our WikiOverlords on project Webcomic Witchhunt. Also, deleting it will encourage a whole bunch of potential Wikipedians who read about this to instead give up on Wikipedia in disgust before they even start. After all, you know how much our lords and masters hate having to explain to new people that while all Wikipedians are equal, some are more equal than others. Thus, making Wikipedia a laughingstock should be encouraged at all times.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and restore the excised content... Wikipedia's core content policies (not the vague and subjective and even contradictory bureaucratic bloat that has evolved around them) do not equate using primary sources with performing original research (which it isn't)... that is using multiple sources (primary or otherwise) to synthesize something new. Even if the only source for some information is the author's own output, it should not matter, so long as it's not a matter of grandiose/self-aggrandizing claims. Therefore even the excising of information that cannot be verified except by using the comic's own website is unnecessary. The question of whether or not the comic is notable is a separate one from whether or not the information presented is verifiable.... but following the policy failure that is the web notability guidelines does -not- make Wikipedia better, or improve its credibility. Short term solution: ignore the guidelines. Long term solution: jettison them. Clinging to them like a protective talisman will only alienate the largest group outside of die-hard-wikipedians who find any relevance in Wikipedia: the internet-savvy folks. Or did I miss something where the goal of the project to make a resource used only by Wikipedians? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandra_Erin_1ed2.html" title="User:Alexandra Erin">Alexandra Erin</a> 03:14, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your interpretation of the core content policies are at odds with both their spirit and the letter. There is nothing ambiguous about needing multiple reliable third party references.

<li>Mine results in no degradation of information quality. Yours results in an "encyclopedia" that will only be paid attention to by the people who choose to spend their time catering to the increasingly complex, irrelevant, and bizarre rituals that have evolved to support its existence. Multiple third party sources do establish (tautologically) that a subject is notable enough to be mentioned in third party sources, and thus "deserves" an article... but once such notability has been established for the topic of the article, there's nothing gained by using those sources exclusively for the body, as some are saying. "Okay, so this subject comes up in multiple third party sources. Clearly it's worth mentioning. But there's not enough information in these sources for the article to say anything useful. Delete!" It's a pointless, double-layered notability test that would only make sense if Wikipedia was under severe space constraints. The fact is that accepting a third-party source's information about something non-contentious, like say, the characters in a fictional work does 'nothing' to improve the quality or reliability of information as opoposed to going straight to the primary. Their ultimate source is the first-party source. Reliable third-party sources have fact checkers, you say? They go back to the first-party source, too. The core content policies are unambiguous that simply accepting first-party information is not original research in and of itself, and while a lot of rather dense shrubbery has sprung up surrounding the relatively simple and workable ideas in the core content policies, "Ignore All Rules" trumps everything if the rules aren't making wikipedia better. This silly game of "Well, even if you and I and anybody with a mind to do so can go check out the page and verify that the information is accurate, that doesn't make the information verifiable." is just that... a silly game. Whether ones cites a primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary, or googolnary source... the citation still comes down to nothing more than editor saying, "Well, I read this stuff right here, in this source that anybody can go check out if somebody wanted to contest it." On the other hand, if somebody wanted to put in their take on the Jungian symbolism behind Starslip Crisis and said "Just look at the strip... it's all there!", THAT would unambiguously be original research... saning (yes, I said "saning"... imagine a verb, "to sane.") down the content policies needn't open the much-feared flood gates to reams of unverifiable speculation as some people need to fear, any more than acknowledging that in the Brave New World that has such online fricking encylopedias in it web-based notoriety really IS notability will turn Wikipedia into a directory of crappy Geocities pages. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandra_Erin_1ed2.html" title="User:Alexandra Erin">Alexandra Erin</a> 01:01, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>that would be the only valid reason for denying the use of the comic itself as a source. It does not violate WP:RS, WP:V, or WP:OR unless you argue that an author isn't an expert on his own work, because we have a single, reliable source, so long as we do not draw any interpretations from it. It would make a small article, but not any smaller than the less well-known fictional books or movies we have on the site.</dd>
<dd>Under Wikipolicy, an article CAN be written from the comic. It is incorrect to say that it can't. The question is whether one SHOULD be written - ie, notability. Or, if you'd like to make a sweeping statement, whether we should have articles that are little more than book summaries. Both of those are perfectly legitimate debates to have, but one that I have no interest engaging in myself. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 29.138.2.170 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_29.138.2.170_d79f.html" title="Special:Contributions/29.138.2.170">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

How about we stick to the intent of the rules, instead, with arguments about why the policies exist, and whether this would be in line with them? Sorry if this sounds a tad sarcastic or sassy, but I'm a bit fed up with the webcomic AfD's in general (on both sides, as I've said), and I'm a bit tired of every argument degenerating into the minutae of policy and guideline, and going into the hyperbolic. How much of a mention is trivial? How independent does something need to be? How notable is notable? Is a given person "expert" enough to listen to? Is it justified to send ten sockpuppets out to illustrate a problem? So on and so forth. Argue against number three if you'd like, as it's the only argument there that I actually care about, and maybe you'll convince me, but I doubt it.</dd>

<p><b>Keep All</b>: Need I remind you people that creation of wiki pages for every school is officially endorsed by the wiki school project!!

<p>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.

<li><b>Delete</b> Not only irrelevant, trivial, and indiscriminate, it is indeterminate (particularly in that the current limitation to nine begs the creation of articles for 1 through 8 fingers, heaven forbid). Even if it were about fictional characters with any number of missing fingers, I doubt there is more than a handful (sorry, couldn't resist) of characters in which this trait is critical to the story. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:47, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete, but comment</b> I would say delete since the list appears to be unreferenced and possibly involves original research. (Is there a citation available to an already published list analyzing characters with nine fingers?) However, that being said, I do want to point out that, contrary to some of the opinions above, WP:NOT#IINFO does not deal with "lists of trivia". That particular section of policy is quite specific on what it covers, and trivia lists are not part of it. In fact, an attempt to add "almanac style" lists to WP:NOT#IINFO last year failed due to lack of consensus. Thus I would discount arguments which say it violates WP:NOT#IINFO. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> While WP:NOT#IINFO might not expressly deal with lists or trivia, I disagree that the policy is inapplicable to this article simply because it is a list or because it deals with trivia. The policy stated in the first sentence, "<i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information</i>" always applies. The illustrative list that follows is clearly not exhaustive and does not preclude the application of the general statement of the policy to any class of entries. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 21:33, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are misreading what the phrase "indisriminate collection of items of information" refers to. In this context the section is referring to information that, while true, is still "that which editors may discriminate against". The first paragraph of the policy section then goes on to specify that the bullet points below are areas which have editorial consensus, and that "other areas do not necessarilly have consensus". Trivia in particular is one of those areas that does not currently seem to have strong consensus in its definition or how to handle it, and thus is specifically not included anywhere in WP:NOT (let alone in that particular section).</li>
<li>Now, it may very well be the case that in the future, if consensus is achieved, a trivia section will be added to policy, possibly under WP:NOT#IINFO. But until that happens, you can't simply use WP:NOT#IINFO as a blanket statement against "trivia", because it is specifically worded so as not to talk about trivia and "cruft", etc. That section is very specific on what it covers. FYI, this topic is discussed in greater detail on the WP:NOT talk page, so I'd recommend directing further comments about WP:NOT#IINFO there. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:09, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I humbly beg to differ and stand by my reading of the policy. However, this isn't the place for any deeper discussion on the point, so I'll leave it at that. Regardless of the reading of the policy, it appears we both agree that this article cannot stand various forms of analysis and is suitable for deletion. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 23:01, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Just in case someone reading this is a new editor, a lot of the discussion we're talking about is at <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_79ff.html#Inappropriate_use_of_Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information_on_afd.2Fcfd" title="Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not#Inappropriate use of Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information on afd/cfd</a>.

Only the list itself should be somehow notable. For example, a cast list for a tv series or movie will often contain non-notable actors, but the cast list <i>as a whole</i> would be considered notable and even essential for an article on the subject. For the TV series Punk'd, we are dealing with what are essentially the equivalent of reality show contestents, similar to Survivor or American Idol, etc. Therefore a list of the people who are punk'd and who are the punk accomplices makes sense. I do think, though, it would make sense to merge these two lists, so that you can see in one line the Punk victim and the associated Punk accomplice. I think this would serve people interested in reading about the show much better than having seperate lists for the two. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:15, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> Since the article is newly created, shouldn't time be given to see what form it takes? The topic itself appears to be one that could be considered meaningful. Apart from the reference to Bircham IU given above as a reason for deletion, I didn't see anything in the article that would have led me to correlate this with Bircham IU or any particular institution of POV.

<li><b>keep</b> and nominate again if not improved in a month. The article is about a very real topic, there are researchers there besides EK-R &amp; PA. I think it could be improved to a shorter description of the field that would not be an essay or OR, &amp;, given a chance, I think that will happen. Birchan IU, on the other hand, is suitable for deletion &amp; I'll nominate it when we've reached a conclusion here.

<p><b>Pls Help Me! Pls</b> Dear Sir, I am Dr. Mohammad Samir Hossain from Bangladesh. I was and still am too poor like my country. I was desperately searching for support for my research and seeing my desperate wish some educators from the so called non-accreditated university Bircham International University became too kind to buy me books and appove me 100% fund. I had to beg to many but got only one. So I jumped on my dream topic - Philosophy of Death and Adjustment and start working on the Impact of different philosophies on different bangladeshi people. I did it because in the science of death such research was never conducted, but if I can do or at least raise some point for it, may be some richer and more qualified people will find their interest in it and may proceed. My back ground thought was that remedy to many mental health problem might come out from this new branch. But who would raise me with it? Cause I did not have money even to buy papers or my daily food, let alone doing vast correspondences or take help from any accreditated university. Though fortunately I enrolled at Harvard Medical School with full waiver, but that was too small period for me to do any good job. Finally I thought may be Elisabeth kubler-Ross herself might find interest in it and togather we will proceed. But my luck did not support me, cause I found the news of her funeral on the very day I found her organization's web site. So temporarily my research work stopped upto which Bircham International University helped me. So till now I dream of proceeding more on the research with supports of knowledge from all over the world, and I do not even have a web site to introduce my thoughts. So the only light of hope became this free encyclopedia, and for reference I only had Bircham International University web site. So I desperately tried to promote the introduction of the university in this encyclopedia so that the research reference gets its better base. I know my letter is big and annoying, but sometimes we do annoying things for something better, and please believe me I tried to promote Bircham International University or any other that you all object, just to facilitate the birth of a new branch of a science. Please help me in every way, you do not need to ask me anything for editing or changing. If you all fail to help in a rational manner, I do not mind and will take it as a fate. I will see my reply through the condition of the article "Philosophy of Death and Adjustment". I will love to see this baby of mine alive, but if dead, I will follow the branch of science that I am holding on.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have improved the article. It is wikified and referenced. This article is addressing the psychology of death from a scientific point of view. Wikipedia has no such articles now. Further, the research added by the gentleman from Bangladesh is on non western subjects. I am sure there is western research on the subject, as psychology/psychiatry has moved from philosophy to being scientifically based -- I just don't have time to find it now. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 18:59, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is a way of saving this article from deletion and simultaneously addressing the issues of original research, but it will take a really large overhaul. My suggestion, though it might be a stretch, would be for a new article to be created addressing Dipesh Chakarbati's ideas in Provincialising Europe, which is being used as a text for both Historiography and Cultural Histories studies. This would be a long process--a person would have to read this, and also consider the academic reviews of it (access to Jstor or a long time in a library), then create an article specifically about postcolonial thought and historical differences within which the conflicting ideas of death could then be addressed. OR, the entire article could be re-named History of Death as a sub-article of death but would have to include lots of other examples that might not square with your own research. Keeping it within the psychology section as an emerging area of interest doesn't work either way, unless you can find some academic journals addressing it. Or, get your ideas at least mentioned in a journal. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalyres_3267.html" title="User:Chalyres">Chalyres</a> 19:48, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - You may be right. But this article is one day old. It needs a chance to evolve. I added four or five research articles and references to it for now. No one would ever create a stub if they had to go through the process you are suggesting in order to put a one day old article on Wikipedia. I agree it is a complicated subject and could go many directions. It turns out there are many research-based articles available and it is a very active field of inquiry in many disciplines including medicine, psychology, and sociology, with very important treatment and policy implications. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 20:55, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It is more about attitudes about death, how they vary among ethnic and other groups, the impact of these attitudes on personal adjustment and ability to deal with trauma (the original article), on public policy (e.g. when to euthenise), how doctor's attitudes toward death affect patient care, how to treat bereavement etc. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattisse_2503.html" title="User:Mattisse">Mattisse</a> 00:07, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
<b>Some elaboration</b> - Dear all, Its me the researcher of the Article - Philosophy of death and adjustment. I will briefly inform you about the main event of the research and the theme behind it.</p>
<p>From very early childhood of mine I could not accept that my parents will die someday. After some years I could not accept the truth that all of my near ones will die someday. I was going through some depressive disorder and having treatment. When I completed my MBBS, I saw that many of the troublesome thoughts and events on this earth relates to existance and preventing from ceasing to exist. In market, in history and even in human life. But death in life is such a sensetive event we merely keep in our mind in everyday life that we will die someday. But our mental health and overall civilization on this earth is very much maintained and managed after this very truth in our subconscious mind. I needed a remedy for this subconscious problem for myself and any other people who suffers like I do. So I started to read and search for articles that describes how a man can adjust with the universal truth of death, not when ill or dying or old, rather in every day healthy life. Surprisingly I found none on it and I decided to do my research on this subject. Then Primarily I defined death and the main theme was for most of us was "ceasing to exist". If death were not such ceassation, then it would not be such a disturbing element for human psychology. So I started to search the philosophies of death. I found the Arie's one, the Kubler-ross one etc. But none of them could finish in a descent line of accepting death for a person who is healthy and not ill. The only way was to eradicate the philosophy of cessation from the death philosophy. Then I realised that only religion enlightens upon life after death, that is death is not the end at least, but no scientific study on it that can be brought and used for psychiatry. So I took 5 groups of muslims in Bangladesh and one end of them had the highest belief in life after death and the other end had little or no belief in life after death. Then I assed their mental health and found that the more one believes in death as non-ceassing event, the more healthy he or she is mentally. Also I used the kubler-ross theme to evaluate the five groups' capacity to accept death. Surprisingly, by a scale (according to KR research), the most adjusted ones were also those who took death as an event but not a cessation. Thus without advocating for religion, I showed that if the concept or the philosophy of death is maintained as something like an event, not an end, then a person can remain healthier in respect of mental health and also adjust with death more easily. I had an "Excellent" grade after the evaluation of my research evaluator. Now a days, while I give psychotherapy to patients who are not adjusted with the truth of death in their physically healthy life, I use this concept for those who believe in any religion showing death as an event with an afterlife and I find excellent prognosis in their treatment. Now I hope you understand why I am so much dedicated and serious about the article"Philosophy of Death and Adjustment". The name of the article means nothing to me, what matters is that it is a huge resourse for the future of psychiatry. Also I will be very glad if you edit my article more and more and ask me any question you need to know.</p>

<dd>Dear friend, all of this is very interesting, &amp; consolidates a lot of material I have heard of but not understood, but the WP is not the place to present the OR. The place to present your study is in a peer-reviewed journal; the place to present your analysis is in a scholarly review. That people with some religious views accept death is understandable, but the details are interesting. That done, then a summary for general readers based on these public source should go here. If the culmination of your articles depends on this work, you should withdraw it for now. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:42, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>For all</b>-</p>
<p>Thanks to all for so much discussion that helped me know many things. I will humbly request all honorable editor to erase or move the too much(!?) controvertial article, if needed, to stop this very hard discussion for me. If any of you are interested to know about my full introduction, you will find it in any good library of UK or USA in the Dictionary of International Biography, 33rd edition published from Cambridge, UK. Please visit the web site of the Bircham International University to know all about it. If you think that there is any lie in them, you might want to take any legal step against them too and I am saying it because I should be at least this much sensible for any educational institution, I hope you all should agree that one must be given the chance to speak for himself(or itself) before he or it is given any introduction full of hatred. So far all I have heared from this discussion about BIU is borrowed from some sourse other than BIU itself. Also the trend of such discussion is good but should be more polished for all the contributors. We, the ordinary people from all around the world want to see wikipedia with due respect, not like the Bircham International University. I want to say good-buy on this matter leaving all in all yours' hand.</p>

It is also a very serious question as to how one kick-starts a new academic field. 80+ years ago, you just <i>did it</i>, put your name on a door and started offering degrees.

In the end, though, it's business. It's an "interesting topic" and should not, according to the "rules", have been created. And I do <i>not think</i> it was too hasty to suggest "delete". <b>Finally</b>, the <i>content</i> of the article can easily be included in other appropriate articles <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerentology.html" title="Gerentology">gerentology</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/e/Ageing.html" title="Ageing">ageing</a>, death and dying, etc. Please, Samir, publish something somewhere (there are on-line sites where you can do this), then an article can be made. --<a href="../../../o/t/h/User%7EOtheus_fe85.html" title="User:Otheus">Otheus</a> 01:36, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>For Otheus</b></p>
<p>1)Samir was a very new user of wikipedia. He made mistakes in his several steps.</p>
<p>2)He only got scholarship for 12 courses at harvard in honor of a dead indian professor, and no further courses were offered from harvard for anyone after those 12. He did not have the money to pay and study.</p>
<p>3) Samir does not know why he was born on the day of his birth day cause he never wrote his fate, same was the case of finding the funaral date of K-R.</p>
<p>4) Samir had to struggle till now by pleading and begging, cause he is a genuine citizen of Bangladesh where sometimes human feel happy to be alive let alone with honor and dignity and scopes for free aducation.</p>
<p>5) Finally this article is too young in the science to have a name for itself or tagged with others. But whether you like it or not, you know that you will die someday though you may be young and healthy now and I will never believe that one accepts this truth very gladly unless he does not understand death or sadly he may be insane. So we need to pull this thorn out of our throat, because, we can't pull death out, even when we are young and healthy.</p>

<li><b>Reaffirm Delete</b>: Dear Samir, Wikipedia is an excellent way for people around the users to discover knowledge. But in order for Wikipedia to be respected as a repository for such knowledge, there must be certain guidelines, restrictions, rules, if you will. One of these key guidelines is that Wikipedia articles should be based on existing material, <i>referenced</i> by <i>reputable sources</i>. You, Dr. Samir, are trying to become such a reputable source, is that not so? I believe with your persitence, and by focusing your energies <i>in the proper venue</i>, you will succeed!

<p>Google must be different in India. In the US "print expense management" results in 298 hits and "business process outsourcing" results in 1.3 million hits. "Print expense", 37000 hits is the second largest expense for corporations. Indeed, managing this expense as an ASP is new.

<p>Dhartung is exactly correct per the national origin comment. The comment represents a complete lack of moral propriety for which I have nothing but contempt. I am condemned by my own words before those who selflessly strive to provide a correct and objective information depository. I humbly and honestly apologize to Mordecai and to the entire community. My poison words and inflective to avenge a perceived attack were uncalled for and is reprehensible. I have brought shame on myself and my family. I humbly apologize, I am very sorry. Please do with the article what you gentlemen feel is correct as I know you only have the best interests of the community in mind. Clearly my attempt to shed light on a new and emerging technological service has failed. While the public markets have only recently, within the last 90 days, cast their vote on print expense management with the $160 million funding of InnerWorkings, it seems clear the technological application may be too new for wikipedia standards. PEM represents a huge and growing market first identified publicly in these documents. Print Procurement: A Services Purchase Exception Aberdeen Group “print is an area ripe for optimization” article speaks to a burgeoning interest to manage print expense in a new manner utilizing technologies proven in other expense fields, notably ASP.</p>
<p>Report Policies Precede Procurement Automation but Technology Ensures Compliance: The Category Spend Management Report Series 2004: Advertising, Marketing and Printing Christa Degnan, Aberdeen Group "companies are seeing the need to implement standard procedures and systems to respond to the top pressure in the market today to cut costs"</p>
<p>This article is the first we could find citing the potential of using the Internet as a foundation to manage an expense that had previously been managed only manually by multiple cyclical site visits by technicians, salesmen and inventory control personnel. Cost Cutting Printing with less red ink. By Alex Nyberg Stuart, CFO Magazine Print expense represents “up to 3 percent of revenues at most large companies”</p>
<p>Mordecai, we appreciate your good work. It was late and I was stupid. I am very sorry. If there is yet time to salvage the article we would be more than happy to provide further documentation.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Reluctant though I am to mention Google hits&#160;: Google returns a putative 299 hits for the term "print expense management," but narrows that to 19 unique pages and (I assume) 280 duplicates. In any case, most of these 19 are scraped from the article under discussion. That aside, this article is indeed a thinly-veiled advertisement.

<li><b>Comment</b> There are clearly notable people, clearly non-notable people, and then there are those in between. With political candidates of marginal significance, there's a trend towards supporters (or possible detractors) of that candidate writing articles for them. Isn't this a form of systematic bias? Another problem is that the articles often lack citations of non-vanity reliable sources. Any flaws in unreliable sources (or people working from memory) are likely to affect the article. Currently, Hanson's article does not cite reliable sources (it merely lists mentions in the media), and Rishworth only cites one reliable source. In future, if everybody just cited reliable sources for everything they wrote, it won't end up in tears. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 01:35, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>My local primary school has an article in the local paper <i>every week</i>, summarising the various goings-on. This does not make that school notable. Likewise, anyone standing for a candidacy in a state election is probably going to have a couple of cursory, local news items produced about them, yet unless the person is somehow otherwise notable, this doesn't set them apart from the pack. If we include this individual, then we might as well create an article on every Green, Democrat, Family First and One Nation candidate out there ever, because I'm sure they've all received at least some coverage. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 06:47, 18 February 2007 (UTC).</li>

<dd>Well, we disagree - a person's impact on politics, culture, history, religion, academia, medicine, whatever, is what I would measure notability by, not the number of newspaper mentions we can find on Google. Genuine "impact" will inevitably generate coverage, which will allow the article to be sourced. But not every newspaper mention is notable - just because we can source something doesn't qualify it for an article.</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Hi. Could you explain how you think she passes the criterea? I'm not sure I understand what criterea you're using to call her notable. She hasn't stopped being a junior level skater and she hasn't started competing internationally (I waited until now to renom to see if she was going to Junior Worlds). I'm curious, because you made the same assertion in the first AfD, but never explained what you meant. <a href="../../../k/o/l/User%7EKolindigo_00b3.html" title="User:Kolindigo">Kolindigo</a> 00:09, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The objection isn't "grounds that seem to apply only to this article", but rather, the criteria specified in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>: "Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports..." Riordan clearly has <i>not</i> competed at the "highest level" in the sport of figure skating. She has only competed at the junior level (not the highest, or senior level) within her country; has never been a member of her country's national team; and has never participated in any international events that have "equivalent standing" as elite or notable competitions within the sport of figure skating. The reason why it may seem that Riordan is being singled out here is that none of the thousands of other non-notable figure skaters with similar levels of achievement in the sport are the subject of Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.frog_7088.html" title="User:Dr.frog">Dr.frog</a> 23:42, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Former Big Brother contestant and current lightsabre salesman, all his biographical information already exists in the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_6_%28US%29_fdd5.html" title="Big Brother 6 (US)">Big brother 6</a> article. Much of the biographical information about him appears to be either wrapped in hype from CBS, or from Gordon himself. Although there are an abundance of Ghits which mention his name, most are trivial (the show being the primary subject), chat forum or blogs. There is a shortage of coverage from reliable independent sources for biographical details. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 06:47, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Rather annoyed and reluctant <b>keep</b>. Personally I find the Big Brother concept to be among the most brainless ideas to have "graced" the TV screens around the World, but unfortunately, the high viewership of the program turns the contestants into celebrities. According to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <i>"Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions"</i> pass the notability criteria, and this person has apparently been on not only the Big Brother 6 series, but also an "All-Star" series. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:16, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Correct me if I'm wrong, but the result of the afd from just about a month ago was "keep".

<dd>I stand corrected - make that "a few months ago" for the September/October afd. The rest of my comment still applies, though.

<dd>But, as you pointed out in the Osten Taylor afd, each article is being considered on its own merits. It's not so much a matter of being "consistent" with Osten Taylor as consistent with the previous afds for <i>this</i> article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Though I would say merge if this were the first time this article was nominated for deletion, the fact remains that this article was already up for deletion not once, but <i><b>twice</b></i> already... both time resulting in a decision to keep.

<p>Sardar Bahadur Dilbagh Singh .... comment copied here from article page by <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 19:43, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have changed the name of the link in article on Sikh to 'Sardar Bahadur Dilbagh Singh'. I do hope that Ill be allowed to use this name By the way, my great grandfather was not a local hero. At the time when he was district magistrate in Lyallpur, it was one of the most influential cities under British Rule in India The title of Sardar Bahadur allowed him to hold public court in his home. I never met him but what I gathered from my family, inspite of the power he held, he understood the responsibility it carried with it.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Like it says in the guideline <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, it's about having sufficient <i>source material</i> for a verifiable, encyclopedic article about each topic. There's no evidence here about written source material, so it's not viable.

<p><b>Delete</b> - First off, "famous" is completely subjective.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Otto. Picking up on his comment, in most cases the degree is likely irrelevant to what many of the listed people are notable for, which only compounds the indiscriminate nature of this list.

<p>This is not adequately sourced in my opinion, and the only reference for a "pear of anguish" comes from a website called "Occasional Hell" that also had this to say: <i>it is not known whether the <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.cx.html" title="Goatse.cx">goatse.cx</a> man has ever used this device.</i> The closest thing we have to a reliable source, the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brewer%27s_Dictionary_of_Phrase_and_Fable_0b5d.html" title="Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable">Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</a>, does not corroborate the bulk of the material presented, nor does it even refer to the item by the same title.

<dd>The footnote says that "A choke-pear was used by robbers: it was made of iron in the shape of a pear, and would be placed into the mouths of their victims. With the turn of a key, it would enlarge so that it could not be removed." This is a <i>modern editorial explanation</i> of the metaphorical use in the actual text. In the actual text, a work of scholarship is described as a "metaphysical choke-pear". As can be seen from Ogilvie and Brown above, there is a less colourful explanation of what a "metaphysical choke-pear" is. It's an argument that is unanswerable or unrefutable.</dd>

<li>There are quite a few books that describe a "choke-pear", or a "pear of anguish", or a "poire d'angoisse" as a iron tool used to gag. <i>Most of these books are works of fiction.</i> A lot of authors in the 19th and 20th century have picked up on the idea that such a device existed, and incorporated it into their stories as a device to terrify the protagonists with.

<dd>This is a far more reliable source. It describes the "poire d'angoisse", invented by a robber named Palioly in the days of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_of_Navarre_8d44.html" title="Henry of Navarre">Henry of Navarre</a> complete with spring-loaded spikes and special key, citing M. de Calvi's <i>Histoire General Des Larrons</i> written in the 17th century as its source. <i>However</i>, it then proceeds to cast doubt upon the entire idea, saying that "[f]ortunately for us this 'diabolical invention' appears to be one of the lost arts, if, indeed, it ever existed outside of de Calvi's head. There is no doubt, however, of the fashioning of a pear-shaped gag which has been largely used in former days by robbers in Europe, and may still be employed to some extent. This is also known as the 'choke-pear', though it is far less marvellous and dangerous than the pear of Palioly."</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>I conclude from this that it is pretty much unequivocal that there is a variety of bad-tasting pear (grown in Angoisse in the Middle Ages) that is known in French as "poire d'Angoisse", and that in English a pear that is so sour that it is difficult to swallow has been known as a "choke pear" for a long time (alongside other sour fruits such as the "choke cherry", itself to be found documented in many sources as a species of cherry in North America whose fruit is exceedingly bitter, and "choke plum"), from which the metaphor of an argument that cannot be answered has sprung.
<p>As for the instrument of robbery: The sources that confirm the idea are either fiction or sensationalism. (As <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> points out on the article's talk page, there's a lot of contamination of early 20th century scholarship by these fictions, too.) The sources that are actually reliable <i>themselves</i> cast doubt upon the whole idea. They confirm that an ordinary pear-shaped gag, <i>without</i> all of the acoutrements of springs, spikes, and keys, is known as a "poire d'angoisse" (and that's probably, from the context of the story, what Dumas was referring to).</p>
<p>I have found <i>no</i> sources that confirm that this is an instrument of torture. Even the (reliable) sources from the 20th and 21st centuries that take devices from museums, of unknown provenance, and (like Frank above) hypothesize what they might be, don't hypothesize a torture device.</p>
<p>Therefore: I think that there's enough from the above to make an article, especially given Eldridge's debuking of the idea and the abundance of sources that tell us that <i>these are varieties of fruit</i>. <b>Keep, rename back to <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choke_pear.html" title="Choke pear">choke pear</a></b> (per our <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>), and feel free to write an article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:40, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You make several academically convincing points, however I have to mention that El Goonish Shive is published in <a href="http://keenspot.com/paypalstore/sectionDisplay.php?el_goonish_shive" class="external text" title="http://keenspot.com/paypalstore/sectionDisplay.php?el_goonish_shive" rel="nofollow">2 books</a>, and it has held a spot in or near the top 10 on the <a href="http://topwebcomics.com/" class="external text" title="http://topwebcomics.com/" rel="nofollow">TopWebcomics</a> list for many years. I'd say that merits keeping the article, though with some editing to make it less like, as you call it, "fancruft." As for "independent and disinterested" editors, who besides those who are interested in the subject would bother to write a wikipedia article about it in the first place?

They appear to be sold by one web outfit, and lack distribution in established channels. From what I can gather, it basically amounts to limited-run publishing. Anybody with a few hundred dollars can have an on-demand publisher print their material, so I think we have to require that notability derived from print publication be limited to subjects whose printed matter is either backed by a major publishing house, or whose printed matter is distributed through a significant number of brick-and-mortar booksellers. As for the toplist <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=toplist" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=toplist" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, that hardly conveys notability. Toplists have been around for years, and anybody can basically get listed on one somewhere. I don't see many notable sites subscribing to them, either. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a> 08:42, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Those books are <i>not</i> published by an on-demand publisher, however. They're published by Keenspot, which is a conventional publisher (ie, the books are returnable) that distributes to comic book stores and other bookstores worldwide. Just take a look at the wikipedia article. El Goonish Shive has been around for over five years now and so is one of the longer-lived Keenspot webcomics. This is hardly "yet another non-notable web comic", it's one of the more prominent ones. As for your complaints about the article's writing style, bear in mind that AfD is not cleanup. Work was just starting to be done on an overhaul of the article when this AfD was listed, see the article's talk page. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan Derksen</a> 10:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>El Goonish Shive has been around for over 5 years, and joined Keenspot over 3 years ago (Keenspot being rated "High importance" in the webcomic project assessment). The Alexa ratings, used by the top-level article "Webcomic", show elgoonishshive.com to have 1/3 of the reach of sluggy.com, with Sluggy Freelance being listed as among the most popular webcomics. If one assumes that different people use elgoonishshive.com and the alternate domain name egscomics.com, the number grows to half of the reach of sluggy.com.

<li><b>Keep</b> El Goonish Shive is notable for several reasons. It has over 20,000 unique visitors daily and growing, it has inspired multiple people to start their own webcomics and / or start drawing again, it has resulted in some people addressing topics such as transformation and transgenderism that they might not have had the courage to touch otherwise, it is cited under Arbitrary Gender with a pictorial reference in "A History of WebComics" (a book by T Campbell published under Atlantic Press), it was a part of a Free Comic Book Day book last year and will be again this year, took part in a webcomic benefit for New Orleans, a character from the comic was featured prominently on a large two-booth sized banner that was up at the Comic-Con International ( <a href="http://www.comic-con.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.comic-con.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.comic-con.org/</a> ) in 2006 and will be there again in 2007, the author has spoken in a panel at Comic-Con for the past four years and is expected to again this year, the first book was available through amazon.com and sold out very quickly, and the first book is also now in its second print run meaning the first run has sold in its entirety.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I don't understand why the deletion policy is so strict. I understand why it exists, there are literally thousands of webcomics that barely ran for a month and had no readers. But to extend that to a comic with many thousands of readers that's been going for years is absurd. More people read this comic than read many published books. Yes, it's on the internet, but why should that matter? Wikipedia itself doesn't get its entirety in a book in Barnes and Noble, but that doesn't mean it isn't relevant to society. The fact that such a successful webcomic is being considered for deletion makes me think that the deletion rules need to be overhauled. This isn't a case that should be borderline at all. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.227.126.50 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.227.126.50.html" title="User talk:24.227.126.50">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.227.126.50_8bef.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.227.126.50">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The problem seems to be that, while Wikipedia has a clear list of why an article could be up for deletion, some of the criteria is subjective. Good arguments have been established for why the EGS article should be deleted, and why it should not. At the end of the day, though, what makes EGS less notable than Bob and George or VG Cats (both of which have articles, and both of which are not currently up for deletion)? True, Wikipedia shouldn't be inundated articles for every upstart webcomic that dies after a month, but perhaps if a comic is regularly updated for a defined period of time, with a defined number of unique hits, it should qualify as notable?15:47, 16 February 2007 (UTC)71.253.15.176mikeszekely</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There is no way deletion of this page can be justified as EGS is VERY notable in the webcomic world, and as stated earlier has many 'real world' notable moments. --Zikar 15:49, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Frequent reader of the webcomic myself, which may present bias, I believe that the webcomic is notable for a number of different reasons. Existing for five years is definitely an accomplishment as far as webcomics go, being in print should count for something, and Danshive's reasons ring true to me as well. The article as it stands will need to be edited, because it does not read like an encyclopedic article, I agree. Perhaps some of El Goonish Shive's accomplishments as listed by Danshive should be included in the article. In any case, it is my opinion that what we are dealing with here is an incorrectly created article, not an insignificant article. Masterflux 15:53, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Having existed, and been relatively continuously updated for more than five years, the comic meets one of the (harder to achieve) sufficient criteria for notability that have been put forward. It has also been published (and therefor has a large enough reader base to support a publishing effort). The reader base itself, as has been mentioned, is also very large. Finally, the content of almost any article based on a creative work be it a movie, comic, novel or anime is usually centered around describing said work. Not only should <i>tone</i> of content not be considered grounds for deletion, but to expect or demand anything different in this case is nothing but folly.&#160;:Finally, would it be possible for someone to format this thing correctly. If nothing else, the period for consideration of this article should be extended, as right now it is almost impossible to tell that it is even up for deletion, much less figure out where to comment. Could very easily have been nothing more than a typo when loading everything up, but it does cast doubts as to how well all viewpoints will be represented. (I think, though, that if a "keep" consensus is reached under these conditions where those most likely to support the article wouldn't be able to do so, that it would be reasonable to uphold the decision to keep the article.) <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelight_76ef.html" title="User:Icelight">Icelight</a> 16:03, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> As has been stated before, an AfD is not a tool to use to say "clean this up." Considering there has been talk about how to clean it up, deleting this article seems very premature. Furthermore, I must seriously question the original nominator's research into whether or not something is notable or trivial. Considering the user has only been a named part of Wikipedia for 8 days at the time of this comment, and has almost 200 contributions, the vast majority of which (at least 2/3, it seems to be closer to 3/4, however) are supporting or nominating an article for deletion, I have doubts as to how well the user has been able to actually "carefully consider" said articles as they have themselves claimed.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I acknowledge that there are times when an article may be so obvious to be garbage that one could nominate it with only a general look and search on Google, however, considering the sheer volume of the user's contributions to such articles, I cannot help but question if he is only a vandal and a griefer, who has taken an agenda again Webcomics for his own personal reasons. I cannot help but think that it would be near impossible to have carefully considered so many articles, when many of his contributions to their discussion pages are mere minutes apart. Furthermore, many of his comments on whether to delete or keep an article seem to be rehashes of the same paragraph, changing significantly only when it changes topics (for example, the shift between his contributions on porn stars and web comics), while any lateral shift in the same field generally reads very similar.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also acknowledge that the user in question may very well have done their research before beginning their contributions to Wikipedia. However, I cannot help but doubt such a thing for reasons as stated above (that the user has apparently simply rehashed the same paragraph, changing on minor wording, while in similar categories, user lacks any real proof in case of web comics, often mentioning only the Alexa ranking, and even then only when the topic of the article has ranked relatively low on Alexa, furthermore, user has stated that they are biased "While I am no fan of webcomics and their lack of notability and worth in general" and I will also acknowledge that, following this quote, said user admitted they would be willing to vote in favor of the web comic's article if it were cleaned up. However, the bias of the user must still be questioned if they so willingly volunteer they feel webcomics are without merit.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am in favor of keeping this article, so long as it is cleaned up and made to be less based on fancruft. Considering that there were, indeed, talks on how to improve the article on the discussion page, I feel that the AfD was premature and done with bias and animosity towards a genre. Furthermore, if a user looking into whether an article fits for an AfD, one would think the article's discussion page would be one of the first places to look for information supporting or dismissing the need for an AfD. Had the discussion of the article been looked over, it would have been made quite obvious that this was a concern, and efforts to improve it were being discussed.</dd>

<dd>You aren't too good at this, are you? It's called "Burden of proof", and it's on the people who wish to prove notability, not those who do not. If somebody is voting to delete, then their claims they can't find anything are suspect. For all we know, they googled "Evil mimes invade Quebec" and found no sources to support the article's notability. The burden of proof is on those voting to keep to prove that it's notable, not on those voting to delete attempting to fraudulently "prove" a negative.</dd>
<dd>For positive proof, feel free to look at Keenspot's official list of the comics they publish at their website, <a href="http://keenspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://keenspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://keenspot.com/</a> . Being published by Keenspot grants it notability as per point three, period.</dd>
<dd>As for ad hominem attacks, that's an attack in the format of 'my opponent has quality X, therefore their arguments are invalid'. Take note of the fact that nothing I said attempts to discredit your non-arguments on the grounds of who you are, I simply demonstrated that they were invalid.</dd>
<dd>Further, you haven't refuted a single argument but instead have simply made vague and unproven allegations. If you want the article deleted, then it's your responsibility to discredit claims of notability. Demanding that you actually <i>refute</i> arguments you want to dismiss is <b>not</b> in violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, while posting unsupported allegations and derailing the AfD discussion <b>is</b>.

<dd>Actually, you have the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Burden_of_evidence" title="WP:V">burden of proof</a> thing the wrong way around. The onus is on the <i>keepers</i> to provide evidence to support the argument that a given article belongs in Wikipedia, not the other way around as you suggest. Meeting point 3 of the guidelines is worthless, as all articles must meet the equivalent of point 1 (see <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>), something which nobody has made any effort to prove yet. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 10:50, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> As Kizor said in his comment above, the fanbase itself has been extremely polite and have argued throughly.

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> I suggest we need to keep this article. This comic inspired me to start drawing, and has definitely improved my world views as to racism and other sensitive topics. I also noticed that many of the webcomics on Wikipedia, such as 2Kinds (Which definitely improved my vires on racism, and should have been kept). Many webcomic authors are getting extremely hassled with other comics being struck off of wiki with no warning whatsoever (No AfD, nothing). I honestly want to know what some people mean when they say "It looks like it was made by the fans, and not by a non-reading person." Well honestly, not to be brash, but "No S**t Sherlock!" Some random person is not going to pop up and start typing on something they never read, and probably don't plan to. As much as I'm sure some people would like to say "POS, DELETEZORZ!" And move on to the NEXT webcomic they want to nuke, this one must be kept. This is where I learn about comics I read, and I am feeling increasingly rushed to read before they get deleted by some new dude. As self-correcting as Wikipedia is supposed to be, this is what you get when you add one or two really bad apples. They spoil the whole bunch. [/rant].<br />

<li><b>Addition</b> I want to make it clear that I am not siding with the nom; on the contrary, a look up a ways, you'll see I voted to keep. While our sides may be opposite, and he did indeed use the same argument for both this and another comic. He also has stated his aversion to webcomics elsewhere. One place he hadn't done so was his userpage. No Wikipedian, no matter how POV, trollish, NPOV, or WikiGnome or WikiFairy deserves to have his or her Userpage vandalized in order to win an argument on AFD. *Steps off soapbox. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetrelg_3f4a.html" title="User:Petrelg">Petrelg</a> 01:50, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Aside from plain numbers as to El Goonish Shive's popularity, NetOracle's personal preferences, and etc., it's important to remember that these sorts of articles are true to Wikipedia's nature. There are thousands of articles with only a few lines, but they still serve as gathering points for those who <i>are</i> interested in them. Though some users may with to disagree, Wikipedia has become likely the best online reference for a myriad of subjects, both popular and relatively obscure. Should all of the articles on small U.S. farming towns be deleted, since they only have a few dozen residents who would be interested in them? There hasn't been a press for this so far. The Internet is composed of an infinite number of groups with highly specialized interests. Wikipedia is an ideal Internet site in that it caters to, and accepts help from, this world of so many fragmented sets of hobbies and observations. While some may not appreciate a webcomic that a "mere" few thousand people pay attention to, the fact is that even a thousand regular visitors would generate large amounts of traffic for any single online resource amongst the crowd, especially compared to webcomics that haven't even become half as popular as El Goonish Shive. To conclude, if Wikipedia is to restrict itself to only allowing pages covering "notable" topics, it will cease to be of use to the millions who have built it up, those whose tastes never match up 100% with the mainstream focus. - Vintagejonny 22:48, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> As nearly all of the reasons I can think of as to why the comic is notable, including popularity of the comic, it being referenced in what would normally be called "notable" sources by most, and just about anything else that doesn't violate Wikipedia's fancruft regulations on this subject, I've decided to focus on the character in question as well. NetOracle has more and more proved that he is not experienced in the area of webcomics, to the point of admitting that he has only a week's experience in the area.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In "The noob" article for deletion (2nd nomination) (the topic was deleted for fancruft, lack of sources, and other reasons why NetOracle seems to be on this mad crusade) he verified his bias, lack of experience in the area, and why he believes that these "unnotable webcomics," as he likes to call them, are destroying wikipedia's image as a professional, respectful, informative website.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>His direct quote from that article:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Your comment concerning the timing of the discussion, and the hushed accusation of my intentions as being based in bad faith, is rather inappropriate. I couldn't have named a single webcomic as of yesterday, and only began to care about these things yesterday after I saw a solid case for deletion destroyed by insane levels of meatpuppetry and fanboyism. I have a strong concern that postponing this discussion until the author returns will only allow time for a similar meatpuppet army to assemble. I'm not here to attack a specific strip - I only became involved in this because I saw the professionalism of Wikipedia being compromised by a steady encroachment of fancruft, and wanted to remedy the situation. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a>" <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">The_noob</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And, on the same article, talked about why he believed the article Webcartoonists' choice awards should be deleted. His Quote again:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"As for the "Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards", this "organization" is not notable in itself. It appears to be some loosely-organized group of Internet cartoonists, established for the sake of mutual promotion.<a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a>" <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">The_noob</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In general, this could be said about any award, award ceremony, or the organization behind such formentioned awards, as it's meant to promote the winner, nominees, and the event in itself. Award ceremonies gain prominence when more sites, or people recognize it. Any subjective person could see this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, while these quotes and comments, especially on the awards stuff would fit better in their respective AfD pages, this was meant as something to go and prove his biased against such webcomics, and prove that El Goonish Shive is just another victim of his crusade. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalton2K5_fba0.html" title="User:Dalton2K5">Dalton2K5</a> 22:54, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notability asserted due to 1) Longevity of Comic 2) Printed versions 3) External references. And unfortunately, another unnecessary AFD of a notable comic by <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a>, where we editors waste our time fighting his prejudice against webcomics as "fancruft".

<li>Well, no. We know what, where and by who this one is. From what I can see from several of his nominations, people are calling for an RfC on an editor who cuts-and-pastes excessively vague deletion nomination reasons, makes up standards ("Test of time" indeed), mistakes AfD for cleanup, refuses to use concern tags, writes "Non-notable web comic, and we're going to sack it" in edit summaries, uses cruft as an argument when there's an effort to remove said cruft and make the article more acceptable going on in plain sight, uses Alexa rankings as an argument though only when they work in his favor, openly admits to knowing nothing about the field he also says he's moving against, etc. That sort of thing. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 10:49, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. It is obvious that NetOracle does not intend to back up any arguments of his own, so much as he desires to propose for every webcomic Wiki article's deletion. We should not be wasting our time on this, and as many of the other comments have noted, this comic does have notability through references in many other webcomics along with a few articles from the media and press.

<li><b>Keep</b>. El Goonish Shive is a prominent member of extremely popular, invitation-only Keenspot. To <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Superosity_%282nd_nomination%29_9d5d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Superosity (2nd nomination)">quote admin BradBeattie</a>, "there's an established precedent amongst the <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> crowd that being hosted on Keenspot is sufficient notability." As is discussed on top of this page, the comic has a print presence on a conventional publisher that extends to the likes of Amazon.com and Barnes &amp; Noble (both very well-known distributors independent of the work) and proper brick-and-mortal bookstores to boot. I believe <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> has been met with flying colors. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 03:00, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep/confused comment</b> First, El Goonish Shive meets the requirement for web notability that "The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." ~ <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I am under the impression that it's long been agreed Keenspot counts as such. On that basis alone it seems odd to delete this article on grounds of non-notability.</dd>
<dd>Also, as a result of the recent burst of webcomic article deletions, and accompanying discussion/rants from fans/authors, I've realised that I'm entirely unclear on Wikipedia's actual policy regarding webcomics notability, and it seems like I will need to read a years' worth of discussion to figure out exactly what is and is not accepted. This is an extremely daunting task. I think I shan't be trying. A relatively concise, explicit explanation would be very welcome, though.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It seems to me that while <i>very</i> few webcomics (indeed, none but the most famous, equivalent in notability within their respective worlds (webcomics and printed fiction) to perhaps Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings) will be discussed at all extensively in non-webcomics-related sources, surely it must count for something if they are notable <i>within the webcomics community</i>. I understand that most likely this suggestion will be thoroughly ignored, an impression reinforced by the cliquey and elitist reputation Wikipedia has got in my usual internet haunts. However, I feel like it has to be said: if Wikipedia is to compare a category with one sort of following - webcomics - to a category with another sort of following - everything off the internet - in terms of what makes it "notable", then I do not think Wikipedia's policy is adequate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, there is the matter of using AfD when perhaps it should be tagged as needing sources or references. <a href="../../../u/s/e/Userfriendly.html" title="Userfriendly">Userfriendly</a> is another webcomic article which lacks any links to references which would prove the webcomic's notability, and it is tagged appropriately, rather than being up for deletion. <a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstelendur_86bc.html" title="User:Estelendur">Esty</a> 05:10, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Keenspot is not a "both well known and independent" publisher. If it were well known, there would be no need to try to make the case that it is "notable within the webcomics community." This comic and its publisher may be well known in certain corners of webcomics fandom, but it is hardly well known in all of webcomics, and definately not well known in any general sense. This publisher (Keenspot) is certainly not well known in the sense that the content it publishes "will almost certainly satisfy the first criterion [of having] been the subject of multiple and non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." Meeting the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline won't necessarily make or break an article, but an article with absolutely no third-party, independent sources fails <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. "If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it." With no sources, it's pretty much all original resaearch and wikipedia editor's personal points of view -- non eof which is appropriate for an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 05:39, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>All I can say to the Keenspot thing is to request that you read the comment by <a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> that is directly above my original comment at the time of me writing this. As for the rest, all I can do is repeat my easily-dismissed, probably invalid, opinion that webcomics shouldn't be held to the same standards of notability as, say, bands; if they are to fit identical requirements, I expect there would be fewer than 40 articles on webcomics throughout Wikipedia.</li>

<li>Keenspot is well known for those who are interested in webcomic publishers. That the Wikipedia article lacks better references on Keenspot's activity and success doesn't devaluate Keenspot itself. As comparison: I only started reading Megatokyo a few weeks ago, and before that I thought it was just manga fanfiction with the low standards associated with fanfiction. Finding it both here and high on thewebcomiclist.com changed my mind, but Megatokyo certainly wasn't well known to me, and I have read web comics for years. My position rested on a false premise because I haven't bothered to look. And those people who bother to look on info about webcomic publishers will find information on Keenspot that supports the position that it is notable. I understand your "delete" position if it rests on the premise that Keenspot isn't notable (and that therefore none of its actions count), but I think that premise is false. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_Valent_7a85.html" title="User:Ambi Valent">Ambi Valent</a> 10:35, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Dragonfiend, you seem to be missing the point.</b> this article is only up for AfD because of a troll, and the Webcomics Project guidelines actually side on keep.</li>
<li>To quote in full agreement what Phil Sandifer said to you over a similar situation: "I will point out once again that the standard you are applying is not the standard intended or endorsed by any of our content policies. This is not OR by any useful definition - useful both in the sense of being useful to writing an encyclopedia and in the sense of actually being used by Wikipedia." Looking at that policy page, the article draws from the primary source - the comic - without "unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories," without independent "analysis or synthesis" of material, without "advancing a position," without a "novel narrative interpretation." Or if it has started any of these during the ongoing attempt to improve it, feel free to point that out. Aside from the brief fandom coverage, the facts in the article are either from outside references or unambiguously visible in the work itself. If we must blind ourselves to a work while making an article of it, then every plot description of every book, play, TV show or game on Wikipedia is immediately suspect. We have sources and references, the described situation of "absolutely no[ne]" isn't in play, though I am unfortunately too tired to contest in detail whether being known by a million or few net-users is "well known in any general sense." Damn you, body. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 00:12, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Right, you are quoting from an AFD improperly closed as a "keep", overwhelmingly reversed at DRV as in improper close, and then overwhelmingly deleted when relisted. In other words, you're quoting from someone who was wrong.

<li>I went and looked at the Keenspot "swag" page to check <a href="http://www.keenswag.com/home.php" class="external text" title="http://www.keenswag.com/home.php" rel="nofollow">which books are on sale</a>, and then went and compared Alexa reach. Result: among the books EGS book 1 is on 3rd position, combo package (books 1+2) on 7th, book 2 alone on 10th (8 and 9 not being books). Alexa reach of webcomics to which those books belong show EGS on 4th position, behind Dominic Deegan, Wapsi Square and Scary Go Round (which all left Keenspot). Among those who are still at Keenspot, this leaves EGS with the #1 bestseller on the list, and among those with published books who are still at Keenspot as the #1 in Alexa reach (I haven't checked the Keenspot comics without published Keenspot books). <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_Valent_7a85.html" title="User:Ambi Valent">Ambi Valent</a> 01:39, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I Think the page should be kept due to the comic's influence on other webcomics, not too mention it's incredibly large fanbase. As others have noted, El Goonish Shive is availible in 2 books, the first being "Read or the Owl Will Eat You!', released in 2003 by Dan Shive, the comic's author. I work at the Borders in a local mall and I have teenagers coming up to me every week asking for it, showing said fanbase. On a visit to a webcomics convention in Los Angeles, I have found more people 'cosplaying' as El Goonish Shive characters than any other webcomic, due to the imagination used in the character's design.

<li>Somebody asked me to look into this. Taking the Keenspot publisher, the lack of other sources, and the appearance of the article itself into account, I'm tempted to vote "Delete".

<p>As far as I can tell there is no name for the collection of all four nuclear power plants. So I guess I will have to create two articles, <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daya_Bay_Nuclear_Power_Plant_3ed4.html" title="Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant">Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/n/Ling_Ao_Nuclear_Power_Plant_c37a.html" title="Ling Ao Nuclear Power Plant">Ling Ao Nuclear Power Plant</a>, as linked to by <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daya_Bay_Reactor_Neutrino_Experiment_e7d5.html" title="Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment">Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment</a>, which appears to be the reason for this little constellation of articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> While it may not be particularly well written, an article on the U.S. political right in regard to printed media is not itself out of bounds. It makes no judgements as to the "rightness" or "wrongness" of this position. As such, I find it to be NPOV. If you have difficulties with specific statements that you believe are POV, then perhaps you should visit the talk page of the article and voice your concerns on how you feel improvement can take place. <a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbagot_183b.html" title="User:Bbagot">Bbagot</a> 21:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Notwithstanding verifiability and notability issues, the article is grossly misleading. This is the first album of <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regis_Philbin_22e7.html" title="Regis Philbin">Regis Philbin</a>, in 1968. But statements like "The album went on to become the highest grossing album of a new recording artist in the year and has been cited as an influence to several musicians of the time including greats such as Frank Sinatra, Liberace, and The Rolling Stones." and "The album consistently rates in top 100 lists in music publications since its debut..." make the article a joke. If the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Its-Time-Regis-Philbin/dp/B00000AEWA" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Its-Time-Regis-Philbin/dp/B00000AEWA" rel="nofollow">Amazon.com</a> listing and the fact that Philbin didn't record another studio album until 2004 are guides, the article is absurd. An alternative could be to rewrite the article with a track listing, but I don't think the album is notable enough for that. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 11:59, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tagged as CSD A7, but I'm not deleting that based on that because this is about a <i>concept</i> of wiki-based novels, not any specific site. That said, I'm not sure we should have an article on this; few people have tried writing wiki-based collaborative novels yet (A Million Penguins is one of the few examples, of not the <i>only</i> example, that has gained any media attention at all), so this probably suffers from <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">general neologism problems</a>. <i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 12:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm not saying this article should be spared; I'm just saying I don't see <i>what speedy deletion criteria this meets</i>. Notability is a tricky one because we don't, er, have notability criteria for neologisms. It <i>does</i> fail quite a few of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> points, there's no sources that would say this is a particularly widespread term yet - that's why it's deletable material. I just don't see how it could qualify for <i>speedy</i> deletion - neologisms are specifically <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">listed</a> under "non-criteria", and one can't really argue this is <i>blatant</i> advertising.

Documenting the word once it can be confirmed to be in widespread use is Wiktionary's remit, not ours. (For one thing, that's primary research that Wiktionary editors are allowed to do and we are not.) An encyclopaedia article entitled "wikinovel" would be about wikinovels — what they are, who came up with the idea, how successful they have been, what their impact upon the world of creative writing has been, and so forth.

<li>Yup. So the big question is this: Is this a correct, widespread term?

<ul>
<li>As far as I'm concerned, 3 sources and 193 ghits does not constitute widespread popular use. More to the point, the kind of project it's supposed to be is not new, and goes by a name that escapes me at the moment, so essentially this is a new name for an old idea, the main difference deing that it is done through wiki making it easier to facilitate than the previous websites that do open-ended group-written novels. Given that, I say the claim that the idea 'began' in Februart 2007 is bogus. At the most, only the term 'Wikinovel' was coined in February 2007, which brings me to my next point. If the concept was only, er, conceived in February then according to the article it can only be 16 days old at best, hardly enough time for something to have made it's way into general usage. I'd have to say <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for something made up in school one day. It doesn't say that policy only applies to the students in school. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 14:53, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Thinking of it in terms of a 'term' and looking for 'widespread usage' is still thinking about it as a dictionary definition, which, admittedly, is how the article was originally written. But a dicdef isn't what a wikipedia article is supposed to be. We want to look at whether reliable sources are discussing the idea, which they are (see my&#160;!vote below, and the&#160;!vote between here and there for examples, as well as the ones on the talk page). This clearly suggests to me that it is a notable idea; it clearly meets the description at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, at least. BTW: I don't think something that <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penguin_Books_86fe.html" title="Penguin Books">Penguin Books</a> have sponsored can be described as "something made up in school one day", even if it is a student project. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 18:42, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I kind of think of what is happening as similar to the discovery of the first <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extrasolar_planet.html" title="Extrasolar planet">extrasolar planet</a> or first extrasolar earthlike planet, which would lead to the whole class of objects possibly getting a wp article, even though all the news is only about the one that was discovered. Over time more would likely be discovered, and any important planets could get their own page. So to me, since one exists, people are going to be interested in what a wikinovel is. They are likely to ask a good encyclopedia, and right now, we have the beginings of an answer. If more form or become prominent, we will have more data points from which to talk about what these are (and thus answer UncleG), but right now with only one we don't have much to say, but it is better than nothing, it is interesting, and, to me, it is encyclopedic.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Of course it could turn out to be a fluke (evidence could show that there are no real extra solar earthlike planets) and after some time we could want to delete the article, or make it an article about a short lived meme or something. <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/m/User_talk%7ESmmurphy_5e09.html" title="User talk:Smmurphy">Talk</a>)</sup> 17:54, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But as an encyclopaedia, we are not supposed to document things as they emerge - we are supposed to document things when they become notable. Wikipedia is not a news service, nor is it a collection of everything. If wikinovels do become notable, and it is perfectly possible that they will, to some degree that somebody actually writes something about wikinovels (and not about this or that example), then we can create an article. That's not to say there can't be a sentence or two at, for example, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a>, but it clearly has not been the <i>subject</i> of anything we can source at this point, and failing the primary notability guideline seems to preclude having its own article.

There's on paragraph -- the one with the dates and big about rebels -- that's news to me; without a citation, I don't feel comfortable dropping it into the Klingon article.

<li>Thanks. I struck out my Delete recommendation and will instead recommend <b>Keep pending stub expansion</b>. I'm pretty sure the franchise is well known enough that it will probably generate a fair amount of press in the near term, so I'll give it some benefit of the doubt that the stub will be expanded slowly over time. I think it would also help if some of the additional information about the game from the published articles can be added in the meantime, so the stub isn't just a couple of sentences. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The sources don't seem enough. The GameSpot is a good source, but doesn't establish any notable content and only hints at the existence of the game in development. The CODHQ source is better, but again it only confirms the game's existence and reveals no information at all. The Neowin article, on the other hand, is not a reliable source: it's a forum post based on an unknown leak. Even though the existence of the game <i>in development</i> is now unquestionable, there is still nothing about the game itself to warrant an article. There's no need to jump the gun here; wait for an official announcement in published sources before creating the article. If we keep the article with what scraps of information we have now, it's going to be a speculation magnet. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 03:28, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I guess the question is whether or not we should have a stub article about a game that we have confirmed sources for to indicate it is in fact under development, but about which we have very little other info. There are two ways to look at it, from what I can tell. We could say "since we know the game is actually under development, and is part of a large enough franchise that it will certainly eventually have more information down the road, we can keep this article around as a stub for that information as it becomes available." The flip side would be "since the only information we have is that the game is under development, it would be best to temporarily delete the article and maybe redirect to an appropriate related article until more information is available. Otherwise we'll end up with a stub article that could become a frequent site for unreferenced rumors in the coming year."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Personally I'd lean toward keeping the stub since I'm sure the article will eventually be viable. But I can definitely understand the desire to delete until more info is available, so it's not an easy call. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:41, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Granted that there are a lot of DB and DBZ character articles that should be merged. But to declare that Raditz is more important then Nappa, Dodoria, and Zarbon, that's just beyond silly. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 03:38, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The long-term impact that Nappa, Dodoria and Zarbon had on the DBZ storyline is minimal. Nappa served to further show the strength of the Saiyans, and also the strength of the resurrected Goku. Zarbon and Dodoria served to illustrate the strength of Frieza's army and also as fodder to illustrate the strength of Vegeta. Isn't this the same role Raditz played, to kick off the saga and show the strength of the Saiyans? (This is of course ignoring the fact that, if not for Raditz, Vegeta and Nappa would likely have not even come to earth in the first place.) Their pages are basically carbon copies of Raditz's page anyway: a short summary of their story with some other "useless" info thrown in. These pages could thus easily be merged or redirected, like the rabble seems to want to do with Raditz... Nonetheless, they are minor characters no matter how you spin it, and either all the minor characters get their own pages or none of them do. Otherwise you're just splitting hairs.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'd just like to say that Napp and Zarbon were far more of a presnece in this series than Raditz (Dodoria's arguable). The fact that Raditz dropped the opening plot twist has absolutely no bearing on whether or not he deserves his own headline here at Wikipedia. What is important is the content of the article. Nappa was in far more episodes, was the personal trainer and right hand man of one the first major villains and was pretty much the face of the "Saiyan threat" for most of the battle (responsible for the deaths of 3 of the Z senshi and incapaciting two others before Goku showed up). Zarbon and Dodoria showed similar presence as Freeza's top men, and Zarbon is present in most of what FUNimation dubbed the "Namek Saga," even handing Vegeta a severe thrashing during his tenure. Raditz really just showed up, dropped a plot twist, bit off more than he could chew, and faded into obsucurity.

<li>Nappa killed three of the Z warriors and was in more episodes, yes. But Raditz' actions led to the death of the main protagonist, Goku. Raditz's presence also was the catalyst for Piccolo and Goku joining forces (a fact that has not been yet mentioned, but is still a very significant turning point in the series). If Goku had not died during Raditz's incursion, he would not have met King Kai, done all of that training, yadda yadda. Zarbon's biggest feat was whipping Vegeta. But so what? Raditz was one of the only villains to ever punk out Goku like he did. Does that make him more worthy of an article? Apparently not. Like I said, people now are just splitting hairs -- either give the minor characters all their own pages, or put them all in separate, collective lists. Not to mention, the same junk that people are complaining about on Raditz's page (voice actors, video game info) all exists as filler on Nappa's, Dodoria's and Zarbon's pages which are barely longer than Raditz's page. If you're going to start merging and redirecting, do it accross the board, don't just pick and choose characters here and there. It'll keep things consistent and tidy.

<li><b>Comment</b> So far, the "keep" comments have only pointed that the character was the first villain, albeit short-lived, of the DBZ storyline and that he is the brother of the main protagonist of the series. First of all, we don't extend notability to family members simply because they are family under any of the notability guidelines. Also, there really isn't much to say about this character. And while he does start the ball rolling for DBZ, he is no more important for that then <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_InuYasha_characters_9beb.html" title="List of minor InuYasha characters">Kagome's cat</a> who was likewise <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Buyo_%28Inuyasha%29_162b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Buyo (Inuyasha)">merged</a> into a list. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 03:54, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>procedural close, optional relist</b>. Seriously, no concensus had or was ever going to form out of this, given the different levels of development the articles are at. The closest thing to concensus I found in this debate after reading it a couple of times was that these artists would require separate AfD's if anything like concensus was to be formed to delete.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Actually, this may just show that you are maybe a bit too close to the topic to be objective (and yes, I know, can any of us be truly objective, blah, blah, blah). But, "my artists" is a bit of an odd statement. You are the original author of the articles, and I understand that you feel strongly about it, but someone has nominated them for deletion and I think there is a healthy debate going on, which is especially useful for media such as graffiti art, where traditional sources may not be applicable. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 16:52, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

In the absence of citations it is unlikely the artist has demonstrated sufficient importance for inclusion on Wikipedia. How is that "Point Of View?" Are you saying that Wikipedia shouldn't have any criteria for who is considered notable and who is not considered notable? I think those standards are a necessary fact.

<p>which substantiate the notability of the artists and shows work done by them as evidence to their notability.</p>
<p>I also believe that several books have been written on the subject. Here's one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title: Stencil graffiti capital&#160;: Melbourne / Jake Smallman and Carl Nyman. <a href="http://graphicdesignbasics.com/2006/stencil-graffiti-capital-melbourne.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://graphicdesignbasics.com/2006/stencil-graffiti-capital-melbourne.html" rel="nofollow">[58]</a></li>
<li>Author: Smallman, Jake.</li>
<li>New York&#160;: Mark Batty Publisher, 2005.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0976224534</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The articles are covered and recognized by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Melbourne_547b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Melbourne">Wikipedia:WikiProject Melbourne</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australia_0645.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australia">Wikipedia:WikiProject Australia</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Graffiti_a155.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Graffiti">Wikipedia:WikiProject Graffiti</a>.</p>
<p>If these articles are allowed for deletion, then <a href="../../../g/r/a/Category%7EGraffiti_stubs_2faa.html" title="Category:Graffiti stubs">these articles</a> would also merit deletion. So would <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banksy.html" title="Banksy">Banksy</a>. This cannot happen. It seems that you are allowing your personal interest to determine what and who is notable, to you. If you followed street art, these people are internationally known. The "fact" that they are no-notable local personalities is false. I don't even live in Melbourne, but I do follow street art, which is why they are notable enough to have an article on, in the same way that <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhani_Ram_Shandil_31a6.html" title="Dhani Ram Shandil">Dhani Ram Shandil</a> is not notable to me, as I don't follow Indian National Congress.</p>
<p>Please look at he effort I have, and continue to put into, articles like <a href="../../../h/a/-/Ha-Ha_%28street_artist%29_42c9.html" title="Ha-Ha (street artist)">Ha-Ha (street artist)</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/n/Rone.html" title="Rone">Rone</a>. Don't delete them, you'll find they are more notable and better quality than a huge amount of articles currently on Wikipedia. I should be improving them instead of defending them.</p>
<p>Read before you judge and please reconsider. <a href="../../../d/f/r/User%7EDfrg.msc_c6f9.html" title="User:Dfrg.msc">Dfrg.</a><a href="../../../d/f/r/User_talk%7EDfrg.msc_187f.html" title="User talk:Dfrg.msc">msc</a> 22:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>There is no comparison between Banksy and these artists. No-one is saying that a properly referenced article on an artist of repute is going to be deleted. The problem here - with all of the above - is that there are no sources whatsoever other than blogs and, ostensibly, one single reference book. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 11:15, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into one article. I'm inclined to lean towards keep, simply because a precedent has been set for graffiti art (albeit not my personal favourite medium). However, the only legitimate reference is one published book in which all the above artists appear. That doesn't firmly establish notability as individuals, but as some sort of collective, or grouping, you could make a case. Could this be reworked as one article with a small section on each artist? Just a thought. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 22:54, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> too many to evaluate together, even if they are related. They appear to all come from the same book, but they should be evaluated individually. --<b><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelket_51a5.html" title="User talk:Selket">Talk</a></sup> 00:38, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep/Merge</b> There does seem to be a notable Melbourne graffiti scene. <a href="../../../r/o/n/Rone.html" title="Rone">Rone</a> seems to be the leading light, so deserves an article, <i>maybe</i> one or two of the others. An article Melbourne graffiti art should be started and most of the articles merged into it. The references need to be more specific, not just a book, but page numbers and exactly what is referenced on the particular page(s). As for the list of refs provided above, flickr and Youtube are not acceptable references. Besides which, it's not up to the nom to find references: they should already be in the article. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:06, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Grounds for a Speedy Keep are not 'there are too many to evaluate together'. Where are the sources? A few blogs and one unknown book? If that makes for a Keep - let alone a Speedy Keep - we are setting new and, to my mind, unacceptably low levels for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 11:15, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> – I don't know enough about this artist to say one way or the other about his or her notability. However, if any graffiti artist that gets a modicum of local fame is sufficiently notable for a Wikipedia article, then there should be articles on at least half the artists in the documentary <i><a href="../../../p/i/e/Piece_by_Piece_%28documentary%29_0a3a.html" title="Piece by Piece (documentary)">Piece by Piece</a></i> should have an article. In some of the articles I've contributed to on the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mission_School_1334.html" title="Mission School">Mission School</a> and related topics, I've avoided creating new articles on artists like Reminisce and Amaze because I didn't feel like they quite made the cut in terms of notability, at least, not any more than do any of several dozen local up-and-coming gallery artists. Some graffiti/street artists (like <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bansky.html" title="Bansky">Bansky</a> or <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepard_Fairey_37a6.html" title="Shepard Fairey">Shepard Fairey</a>) clearly are notable enough to merit an article, of course, but there really should be clear guidelines as to what constitutes sufficient notability for inclusion for street artists. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 07:44, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>One more thing – if Civilian, Rone, Optic, etc are sufficinetly notable to have articles, than what about San Francisco graffiti legends Reminisce, Amaze, Dug, ORFN, Vegan, Ribbity, etc? (<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_McGee_f747.html" title="Barry McGee">Twist</a> already has an article, but his notability based on fame in the "fine art" world is clearly established.)

<dd>Well, apparently they're not notable enough.<u><b>Notability is POV.</b></u> Peter, I live in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>, I like street art, so I have heard of these artists, so I developed articles on each of them. I've never heard of Reminisce, Amaze, Dug, ORFN, Vegan or Ribbity; but I would very much like to. You have, because you live in America, you like street art, and you can develop articles on them. Through Wikipedia, I can learn about your Street Artists, and you can learn about mine. If the consensus is not that most graffiti artists deserve not to have articles, I'll help you as much as I can to make them. <a href="../../../d/f/r/User%7EDfrg.msc_c6f9.html" title="User:Dfrg.msc">Dfrg.</a><a href="../../../d/f/r/User_talk%7EDfrg.msc_187f.html" title="User talk:Dfrg.msc">msc</a> 09:05, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Has Wikipedia really changed so much? Here, for example, is the full text of the article for "Meek (street artist)":- <i>Meek is a notable street artist operating out of Melbourne, Australia. Meek is twenty six years old, and started putting up street art at the start of 2003. Meek enjoys the irony of his name, in an area that is all about bragging and boasting. Meek lived in London for some time and was exposed to the work of Banksy. As well as stenciling prolifically Meek has also hijacked billboards, used wheat paste and stickers.</i> And here is the full text for the article for "Phibs (street artist)":- <i>Phibs is a notable street art operating out of Melbourne Australia.</i> Some of the others say just as little. And those which say more are saying just as little! Are these really Keeps? Are they even a Relist?? Is it too much work for an editor on AfD to look at these articles and decide that they are all saying nothing? As to the single reference book - which we have no access to - is that really all that suffices these days in order to warrant an article? Times certainly have-a-changed on here.... <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 10:58, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep some. Delete some.</b> The original author has asserted twice in this AfD that notability is POV. While in life, I tend to agree, there are some guidelines in place to prevent editor POV from prevailing. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE#Notability is not subjective</a>. Of course, there's the basic def of notability: "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and of each other." So notability is POV, but the POV of people writing for sources outside of Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In the end, I think these need to be treated individually and not deleted or kept wholesale. The ones that are more developed and demonstrate references from multiple verifiable sources (<a href="../../../r/o/n/Rone.html" title="Rone">Rone</a>, for example) are worth stronger consideration than the ones that only reference this one book. The originally-nominated article is probably a delete, unless additional references can be directly incorporated into the article. I think an article on this scene as a whole might be worthwhile, but not necessarily at the expense of some of the more notable individuals with the scene. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlanetneutral_0d3a.html" title="User:Planetneutral">Planetneutral</a> 14:32, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep/merge</b> Per Tyrenius &amp; Freshacconci above. One article on Melbourne street art would I think be clearly justified for notability. Individually, even Rone is a bit marginal. Whatever Star Trek &amp; the Australian cricket team do, treating minor artists as "schools" is a traditional way of handling them, of which there are many examples in WP (and there could usefully be more).

<li><b>Keep All and nominate to Delete some individually at a later time</b> There is no sensible way to deal with a multiple listing of pages like this. Clearly, the Rone and Ha-Ha pages, for example, are currently much better than some of the other pages and should not be considered for deletion. The fact that some of these artists have formed an artist's collective, Everfresh Studios, in Melbourne is notable and encyclopedic. Also, some of these artists could be contacted for photos, surely, and visuals would make these articles better. An example of art found at Everfresh Studios can be found here: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/--meggs--/" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/--meggs--/" rel="nofollow">Meggs photos</a>.

<li>I like the sound of these comments. There's something worthwhile here. It just needs the right form for it. There's no reason why a deleted article would be "salted". That usually only happens in cases of abusive recreation, e.g. with same content after AfD, as opposed to new super-improved content, which can make recreation acceptable if it successfully addresses AfD objections. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 05:37, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually the notability hasnt been established across the board. My recommendation was to give you more time to establish it. The reason why some should be deleted is that you can only work on a few articles at a time, and some of these articles arnt worth keeping in there current form. For example, Vexta only says "<b>Vexta</b> is a notable <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_artist.html" title="Street artist">street art</a> operating out of <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>". Thats it; the rest of the text in the article is merely dressing. Hardly worth keeping. Compare it to another article that is being considered for deletion: <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magdalena_Trzebiatowska_3b23.html" title="Magdalena Trzebiatowska">Magdalena Trzebiatowska</a>.

<dd>That's the ideology. It's laid out pretty clearly. No one who edits here gets to decide notability any more than you do. The decision is based on whether reliable outside sources think the subject is worthy of attention and demonstrate it through publication (and whether there is a consensus that this is the case). From the available evidence, I'd say that some of these entries qualify and some don't.</dd>

Some of them, however, do have the right stuff. Sure, it's possible that there will be stronger evidence of notability for the other artists in the future, but there might be more evidence of my notability later too. Doesn't mean I warrant an entry now. I'm pretty sure there are hundreds of articles that would disappear after a deletion proposal, but it's a matter of insufficient time and attention.</dd>

<li>Culverin, it great to hear you are keen for these articles to be kept. A lot of the comments on this discussion indicate that you are not alone. This deletion process will last about five days from when it was started, and you are more than welcome to help improve the articles during this time. For my own part, I would prefer that we concentrate on the best five of them. Five good articles is better than eleven stubs. If you look at the history of the five I have recommended to be kept, you will see that I have edited them all; <a href="../../../r/f/w/User%7ERfwoolf_6c5c.html" title="User:Rfwoolf">User:Rfwoolf</a> also has, and a new user User:Urbanistika also has started helping on <a href="../../../r/o/n/Rone.html" title="Rone">Rone</a>. If you know anything at all about these artists, share what you know by adding a comment on the talk page of the article. Each article needs to have at least two pieces of supporting evidence from [[WP:RS|"reliable sources"]. Due to the nature of this art work, I think it would be really helpful to have more photographs of the artwork. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 14:10, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi John, I've added quite a few reference links with numerous photos of works exhibited in galleries or at shows, and a link to an award winning documentary in which several of these artists were featured...I'm not sure I agree that only the five best should be kept. 'Phibs,' for example, is now referenced well enough to develop the article further.

<li><b>Keep All, <i>but</i> nominate to Delete some individually at a later time</b>, per Greatwalk. I think the notability of each artist needs to be assessed on its own merits – I do not support either blanket inclusion or blanket deletion. I also don't agree that "notability is POV". Wikipedia has clear standards about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">notability</a>, namely multiple non-trivial mentions in published sources. Some graffiti artists rise to that level of notability, but many don't.<br />
<br />
I do like the idea of an article like Street art in Melbourne, or some variation on that (using "street art" in the title would make it more inclusive than "graffiti"). Such an article could probably be quite easily assembled from multiple non-trivial sources, even if individual artists may not rise to that level of notability. If that kind of article is a good idea, in the future, I'd certainly like to contribute a Street art in San Francisco article (for which I can find many published sources for). <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 07:05, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't know much about the notability of these artists, and none of the articles (except for the one on Rone) tell me very much about what makes that artist notable. Its probably the case that not every single artist listed above is notable in the sense of having been published in multiple non-trivial sources. The ones that aren't shouldn't have their own article, even though they should merit mention in a Street art of Mebourne article. Rone sounds notable, but there's very little in the other articles which speaks to the notability of those artists. Prime example, "Optic is a notable street artist operating out of Melbourne Australia." Well, why is he "notable"? Just because he has a page in the Stencil Graffiti book? Does that mean every single artist in Graffiti World and Graffiti Women gets a Wikipedia page? That's an awfully low standard of notability. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 21:58, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> I would call it "Stencil art in Melbourne," or "Stencil art movement in Melbourne." But that second name really should have a citation referring to it as a "movement." I don't know if that already exists. I would not call it "Street art" or "Graffiti art." Neither "street" or "graffiti" is as specifically related to visual art as is stencil printing. I don't think any of the artists are notable enough to have articles devoted to them. None of them have received sufficient critical note. If one or more of them goes on to receive multiple non-trivial published citations then by all means I think separate articles should be devoted to them. Another possible name would be "Stencil art movement in Australia," since there seems also to be a Sydney stencil art movement. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 00:26, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> -- Very little can be said about any artist. Notability is all that matters. Or, if you want to see what matters, look at the piece. Or, look at reproductions of the pieces. You can't write an article if a prior article or articles do not exist. That is: multiple, non trivial published material from reliable sources. That is why Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.

<li>Graphics would make better articles, but I agree in part. An artist is 'made' by review: public exhibitions, becoming the subject of documentaries, interviews, being members of known artists' collectives, becoming curators, judges and reviewers, etc. A surprising number of the artists the primary editor has selected have, and are, these. A quick search on Google shows as much in several cases. --<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatwalk_4ed3.html" title="User:Greatwalk">Greatwalk</a> 07:10, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

As it turns out, Melbourne is recognised for its street art, and the National Gallery is currently collecting pieces. I found all of this out in the last 24 hours, in bits and pieces when I had the time, as the result of this AfD debate...so I think we're not really asking Wiki to drop its standards to allow these articles.

<dd>Bus stop, you appear (to me) to be stating some different policy for 'notability' than I believe Wiki gives. Several of these artists are featured as artists in numerous, non-trivial sources: (the documentary and the feature in a book about street art in Melbourne is sufficient to show notability by Wiki standards, but several artists also are referenced as exhibited artists in their own right at festivals and galleries). I think a page on graffiti in Melbourne would make a great article too, but whether one exists or not can not be used as grounds for deletion of these articles, surely: they were made in good faith, and either meet or can clearly be improved to meet Wiki standards.

Obviously I am not holding these artists to higher Wikipedia standards than other artists. It is normal Wikipedia minimal standards of notability that are not attained. The closest any of the artists come to notability is being mentioned in passing while describing the stencil art scene in general in Melbourne. That constitutes "trivial" coverage, in my opinion. To none of these artists is actually devoted anything approaching individual coverage. I don't think the mention of the names and a few tidbits about them in an article covering stencil art in Melbourne qualifies each one for a separate free standing article. I do not see in the references even one of these artists actually receiving non trivial coverage. I've suggested the Melbourne stencil art article only because that seems an appropriate setting at this time for what little needs to be said about these individual artists. That is not to degrade them. But the published material out there simply barely does more than mention them, and only as part of a group.

The artists are featured individually in separate sections of the book/documentary: please look at the reference websites. Smallman/Nyman provide a photo of the pages dedicated to 'Psalm' for instance: book is a collection of individual artist profiles, including the eleven artists the primary editor chose to make articles about and the documentary site clearly lists names of the 'featured artists.' Some of the articles are better referenced again.: I don't know why all haven't been improved yet: perhaps they will be after the AfD closes.

I have downloaded that PDF for the program, and indeed I see an individual spray painting what looks like "610." So what? By means of this I am to accept that a name not even associated with the number "610" except by the assertion of that in the article, is notable for inclusion on Wikipedia? I don't see that as notability.

<p>Not sure how this page works re replies so apologies if I have done this incorrectly. The article is absolutely true &amp; was created with the full knowledge &amp; appproval of the subject. However Casey-Jane has a cyber-stalker adding vicious &amp; offensive untruths &amp; linking her to her online forum life, posing a massive security risk &amp; causing much distress to Casey-Jane &amp; her family. Casey-Jane has been in contact with Wikipedia regarding this issue and plans to take the matter further. I am the author &amp; have been deleting these comments as they have appeared but we would like the article deleted immediately please. Thank you. Jennyacedaras 15:28, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Reposting as my original comment was removed by Jennyacedaras in her edit of this page. Recommend this article be removed as it sounds like a resume. Author most likely to be person referenced in article. Breach of point 11 - Advertising. FatalError12345 15:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
In an attempt to save this, have been editing to remove self-promoting comments and neutralise statements. Would help if the Original Author wouldn't keep changing it back to the orioginal PR spiel. However, strongly recommend a surname be added as "Casey-jane" could be anybody of a few thousand casey-janes in the world. Also, doing a search on full name (as found in prior edit) brings up nothing in google. Subject of article seems to be unknown and not noteworthy for inclusion as none of the "achievements" are or can be referenced. FatalError12345 15:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I have not reverted anything back to the "original PR spiel" - I have corrected a typo &amp; added a lesser version of a comment you said couldn't be referenced. Also added a brand name as your version completely changed the entire point of the paragraph. I am removing the surname, as you can see from my previous entry on this page, there is currently a massive security risk to Casey &amp; her family, which is why I removed it this morning. WOULD HELP IF YOU DID NOT ADD TO THIS. Her surname has never been used professionally so it is of no benefit to the article. Jennyacedaras 16:05, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Without the surname, the article is meaningless - who is Casey-Jane? This isn't MySpace. Also, please ad a comment to your corrections - it makes editing much harder if you don't tell us what and why you're editing. Thank you! FatalError12345 16:10, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The article is waiting to be deleted because there is some nutter stalking her. Does it really need constant editting if it is waiting to be deleted??? JUST DELETE IT &amp; STOP ADDING TO THE SECURITY RISK. We would very much like it to become meaningless! Jennyacedaras 16:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am editing it as pointed out by Adam, in order to attempt to reference and save it. Adding yourself to Wikipedia and then failing to accept others can and will be editing your content makes a mockery of the whole thing. FatalError12345 16:17, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>NO ONE WANTS IT TO BE SAVED. Not the author, not Casey, not you! If you do not think Casey-Jane is worthy of a precious Wikipedia page, is making a mockery of your little website &amp; that I have written this about myself then why does it bother you so much that it be editted to absolute perfection? If the article is so inaccurate, just a PR stunt or advertising (Why?? Casey is retired now?) then JUST DELETE IT. Jennyacedaras 16:22, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I don't really understand why you're flying off the handle. I can't delete it. You submitted an article to a social website. Articles are then claimed by the community and continually improved. We both suggested it be deleted, but an Admin has suggested the article be referenced in order to save it. I'm attempting to do so. FatalError12345 16:26, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I am 'flying off the handle' because this is not just that someone posted a nasty comment, it is that someone is creating a security risk to Casey &amp; her family. We are trying to stop it &amp; you adding surnames is making it worse! You think I wrote it about myself, you think Casey is unknown, so show admin your search engine results, prove she's a nobody &amp; get them to delete it. You obviously doubt the entire thing &amp; if that is enough to have it removed then so be it, that's fine by everyone involved! Jennyacedaras 16:42, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I'm attempting to save the entry as suggested by Adam. FatalError12345 16:50, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Why would Adam want to save an entry about an unknown person writing an article about themself as a PR stunt? Obviously Google results are all that signify sucess so Casey is obviously unworthy. Jennyacedaras 16:53, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Ask him, he's the one who suggested it. Have managed to reference last statement so article might be salvageable. FatalError12345 17:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well isn't that just wonderful... thanks for that, I hope you never have a stalker after you, causing a risk to your children. Jennyacedaras 17:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I'm sorry to hear that, but I don't see the relevence. You added content to Wikipedia in full knowledge that it would not only be public, but fully editable. I'm sorry someone has taken exception that you, but surely the last thing one would do in such a situation would be to publicise yourself on such a large and open platform. I'm just following the site philosophy which is to work with what is provided and make it as detailed and relevant as possible. I suggest you take your ire out on 1. your stalker, 2. an admin (not recommended since it's hardly their fault!) 3. Yourself for creating this situation. FatalError12345 17:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>EDIT: The article was created BEFORE the stalker came about, otherwise I wouldn't have created the article, obviously. I have never blamed anyone for the situation, you are right in as much as it is the stalkers fault &amp; possibly mine for creating the article (though if other models or TV presenters had someone posting about their personal or forum life it would hardly be the article's authors fault, would it!), but is that a reason to not help, make the whole situation worse &amp; post even more details about Casey?? You started off by saying you recommend it for deletion, then go on to edit it so it can stay! And put in surnames which had been removed, as explained, because of a nasty situation &amp; security risk that had arisen?? Why would anyone with any kind of morals or heart do that??? Jennyacedaras 18:36, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Last update for today - have only managed to reference two points in the article. Not sure if this makes it notable enough for inclusion. If it does, still recommend surname is added to title for clarity. I also retract my suggestion for removal, following Original Author's continuous assertions she isn't the subject. It can be found in earlier edits, I won't post it here as I can't deal be bothered to deal with more hysteria. FatalError12345 17:26, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your constant edits have deleted 2 replies. Now I can't even think what they were because all I can say is how could you? Knowing the situation, how could you do that? Sleep well tonight. I came asking for help &amp; all you have done is give them even more ammo &amp; go one step further - at least they hadn't posted Casey's married surname &amp; husband's name. When have I said I'm NOT Casey? I've said you obviously think I am. Well that breaks the "philosophy" too &amp; the article should still be deleted then, so fine, I'm Casey, I wrote it about myself, now delete it admin. At minimum you could leave it as it is &amp; delete the history for now at least. Jennyacedaras 18:04, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Note to anyone who could care less about this nonsense: Jennyacedaras *is* the titular Casey-Jane, despite her laughably hilarious third-person speech. She wrote an autobiographical Vanity entry about her non-Notable life (seriously, Google her full name and see what you find) and is now whining about it. Which is somewhat ironic given that she, well *wrote her own Wiki entry and is now bothered about the attention it garnered*. Here's an idea, if you don't want people to know stuff about, try *not* writing an article about yourself on a public website.</p>

<p>Redundant with the plot sections. Expanding upon that is horror fancruft. It is violating the growing consensus for a word limit for film plot synopses. I have also seen a more basic list of deaths being added to the films' articles: these are redundant to the plot section and looks like something an amateur fan site would do.

<p>He then walks over to the tub and slips on the puddle, causing him to fall on a clothesline cord, which snaps off the wall and, pulled by the velocity of Tod's fall, wraps tightly around his neck several times and strangles him in the tub, while he struggles to stand up, but only manages to kick over bottles of shampoo and soap, spilling them inside the tub and making it slippery and preventing him from getting to his feet. The blood vessels in his eyes burst as he tries to break free from the wire and reach a pair of scissors on the counter across the room. He slowly weakens and finally dies</p>

<li>Okay, think about this. For example, Tod Waggner- Killed by strangulation by clothes line. Inside or out? How on earth did he get strangled by a CLOTHES LINE? Lotsa questions get asked if the death is summerised in one brief sentence. Think about it your self. If it was your first time looking at the movie, what would you think about their deaths? The F13 movies is unnecessary, as it's either pop, rip or stab. NOthing creative. 211.30.223.128 09:01, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Eh? What a stupid proposal? The deaths are essential to the plot in illustrating that death would catch up with people. They can't make a popular movie by saying: "We got out of a crashed plane, and no we are each being picked off one by one. We won't tell you how, but use your imagination..." The deaths are imperative to the plot and, hence the movie's success. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Oliverlock (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Oliverlock_f3d5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Oliverlock">contribs</a>) 20:45, 20 February 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> List of deaths in the Friday the 13th series per Docu.

I suggest merging the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Destination_bfac.html" title="Final Destination">Final Destination</a> death lists into one article, something like Lists of deaths in the Final Destination series and mirroring the tone/brevity of the Friday the 13th list.

<dd>A simple Google Search came up with uses of "Battle Frontier" but I couldn't find "reliable sources" discussing the subject in and of itself. If there were some that could verify the information of the article, since it is very well done, I'd think they would have been added already. Of course, them not being added yet not being a valid reason to bring it here, I simply don't think it's notable enough to ever have reliable sources.

<p>I don't think a short, one-way, residential street can really be considered notable. Its only claim to notability is that one killing happened there. I don't think every murder needs a place on Wikipedia, but even if this one does, I think a better place for it would be at an article about the victim or an involved gang, not the street it happened on. Wikipedia is not a road map. <a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">User:Eastmain</a> (not the creator of the article) removed the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">PROD</a> notice with the explanation "Street is notable for the killing and for other characteristics." -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 16:18, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Perhaps the street is better understood as a neighborhood which can be distinguished by ethnicity, income and gang activity from the more tourist- and university-oriented parts of the city. There is a role for articles about boroughs and arrondissements and other subdivisions of cities, and while Dickerman doesn't have self-government, it has the other characteristics of a distinct community. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 18:18, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Many of the voters voted keep simply because the article was new and were waiting for the article to grow and accrue more references. Sufficient time has passed and not much improvement has been achieved. I am cross-posting from <a href="../../../s/e/p/Talk%7ESephardic_Pizmonim_Project_68d7.html" title="Talk:Sephardic Pizmonim Project">Talk:Sephardic Pizmonim Project</a> my analysis of the two sources that <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Betesh_0168.html" title="User:David Betesh">User:David Betesh</a> has provided:</p>
<p>The organization is not notable, period. With all due respect to the wonderful cause that it represents, it is entirely unheard of outside of the Syrian community, and even inside the community its mention would barely raise an eyebrow. The two sources consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A paragraph from <i>Aleppo - City of Scholars</i> that reads (in its entirety):</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Mr. David Betesh, a great-grandson of Gabriel Shrem, received these tapes [of pizmonim] as a Bar Mitzvah gift from his grandmother, Florence Zeitouni, the daughter of Gabriel Shrem, and resolved to pass on this treasured gift to the entire community. He re-released and upgraded both the published and the unpublished works of his great-grandfather to create an inclusive and wide-ranging recording of pizmonim. The CD set, which is distributed by the Bnai Yosef Synagogue, also includes an explanation of the origin of each maqam, as well as the perashah or occasion during which it should be used and why."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>...which is honestly very nice, but it amounts to virtually nothing within an encyclopedic work about the Syrian Jewish community.</p>

<li>An article in <i>Community Magazine</i>. Community Magazine is a publication geared to a small subset of the Syrian community, and it will routinely report on even the most insignificant happenings in the community [things like a high school's trip to Israel on a "chesed mission", or a small-time Orthodox Jewish magician who has to struggle to keep kosher on the road, etc.].</li>

<p>The paucity of substance in the nature of each of these sources is reason enough to discount the notability of the SPP.

The example you gave is of an actual institution with personnel and a physical location to boot. The Sephardic Pizmonim Project is essentially one person (David Betesh) who decided to sell some CDs.

Btw, Aaron Lansky didn't always have personnel and a location for his Yiddish project (NYBC), he spent years as just a one-man student operation. I think projects dedicated to preserving ancient culture are of significant historical value that deserve an encyclopedia article. You'll definitely find more pop culture on the web, and are less likely to find info on nearly lost cultures. We want to keep "fluff" out of the encyclopedia, but I don't think this is fluff. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 18:35, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. In logical analysis, it can be very easy to prove that something exists, while it can be treacherously difficult to prove that something <i>doesn't</i> exist (see <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem_f4b0.html" title="Fermat's Last Theorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a> for math buffs). This AfD demonstrates that the same applies to Wikipedia: It's extremely easy (and often disingenuous as a result) to "prove" that a topic is notable, while it is well nigh impossible to prove that it is not notable. Indeed, if actual <i>evidence</i> existed showing non-notability, it would not be non-notable in the first place! To the issue at hand - I, through my personal connection and exposure to the Syrian Jewish community in <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flatbush%2C_Brooklyn_97c0.html" title="Flatbush, Brooklyn">Flatbush, Brooklyn</a>, KNOW that the SPP is not notable. I can't <i>prove</i> that it's not notable, because that would be a logical fallacy. No other user (besides <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Betesh_0168.html" title="User:David Betesh">User:David Betesh</a>, obviously) can claim to have personal knowledge of this project. Of course I realize that this testimony doesn't hold much water in an AfD vote, but I feel that I should air my thoughts anyway. And to IZAK, I never said that the article is "villainous" - I just don't think it belongs in an encyclopedia, even one that is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">not made of paper</a>. --<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 13:27, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> In the first AFD, I wrote, "<b>Delete.</b> I really don't have a reason to delete, but I feel like sticking up for DLand for nominating a potentially nonnotable musical entity." I'm glad I have a chance to speak more wisely this time. DLand has established a clear case. It is incorrect to say that an article needs sources and the subject needs to be notable. An article needs sources, and those sources should affirm its notability. Everything depends on the sources. Since the sources are demonstrably trivial, notability has not been established. The SPP is a one-man, non-commercial project that has not received serious press coverage. If you take away the "Jewish culture" aspect, and evaluate solely based on <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, it falls short of the criteria for inclusion. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 05:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
<p>This article in a previous incarnation <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Support_for_evolution_e199.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Support for evolution">survived deletion through “no consensus”</a> as it was hoped by the community that improvements could be made to the article to keep it neutral, verifiable, and reliable. Unfortunately, this has proven to be an impossible task because of the nature and scope of the article itself. I propose this deletion after working for some time to try to improve the article content and now coming to the conclusion that, as an article, it cannot survive for very serious editorial reasons.</p>
<p>Much of the content of this article can and does belong on Wikipedia. For example, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Steve_9fd7.html" title="Project Steve">Project Steve</a> is mentioned in its own article and appropriate parent articles such as <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a>. The various opinion polls can be elucidated and outlined such locations as well. The problem is the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original synthesis of the article</a> described in the next paragraph which is specifically problematic in light of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Wikipedia’s NPOV policy</a>.</p>
<p>The article as it is formed functions basically as an undercover creationist <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">POV-fork</a> of the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a> article. This fact may be difficult for some to see, but consider that the article takes as its main thesis that there exists a way to gauge the “level of support” for the scientific concept of evolution by means of opinion polling, open letters, and the like. This very particular and peculiar point-of-view cannot accommodate the fact that no scientific theory in the context of science (which is the context in which evolution is defined, supported, and described) is “supported” by such means. We do not subject the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_relativity.html" title="Theory of relativity">theory of relativity</a> to an article regarding opinion polls on the subject. Support for the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principle_of_least_action.html" title="Principle of least action">principle of least action</a> is not gauged in our encyclopedia by counting how many open letters were written regarding the subject. Even more controversial scientific subjects such as the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a> or the <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaia_hypothesis.html" title="Gaia hypothesis">Gaia hypothesis</a> do not have articles that treat the subjects in such a way. The only reason we have such an article ostensibly about “evolution” is because we are effectively accommodating a uniquely creationist <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_dispute_c299.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV dispute">POV-pushing perspective</a> of evolution and how its support should be “measured”.</p>
<p>Consideration for this deletion proposal is guided in part by guidelines for <a href="../../../s/c/i/WP%7ESCI_649f.html" title="WP:SCI">how to cover science at Wikipedia</a>. In particular, discussions about science that are <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> need to deal with science as it is evaluated by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources. Polls, open letters, and opinion pieces are not how this is done for scientific subjects. To advance the idea that a scientific principle can have its support gauged in such a fashion is a POV which is obviously at odds with how we have dealt with scientific subjects in the past.</p>
<p>We have an old problem with such problematic content forks at Wikipedia regarding evolution. I would remind the community of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Evolution_poll_297a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Evolution poll">this AfD</a> which was ostensibly on the same subject and was deleted for reasons similar to the ones I outline here. I believe that precedent for deleting articles of this sort is well-established and that the community can work to include the verifiable content in other articles.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - per the well-reasoned nomination. Content-forking issues aside, this is a fundamentally unencyclopedic essay: a well-written and well-cited essay, but the lack of encyclopedic value makes this, in my opinion, high-class <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>. This sort of thing is precisely what I mean:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"This is definitely true in science, and the only thing in science that matters is whether the data available match the predictions of a given scientific theory. If they do, then the theory gains support among the scientific community. In this case, the polls do confirm that evolution is the dominantly accepted theory attempting to explain the diversity of the earth's life forms among scientists.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is never absolute support of all scientists for any theory, however. There are always alternative theories that exist and garner support. It is also important to remember, as Guy Woods writes, "It is dangerous to follow the multitude because the majority is almost always on the wrong side in this world."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Now that is fundamentally what I mean: a good essay, but not acceptable from an encyclopedic standpoint. This will get you an A at your A-levels, but a <b>delete</b> at an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup> 20:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>A single disputed paragraph at the very end of an article doesn't warrant deletion of the entire article; this is a reason to make that paragraph more NPOV (I imagine it would be easy to simply quote an organization or expert in science stating that science is based on evidence rather than popular opinion, thus not even making it necessary for Wikipedia to affirm such a clearly factual statement), not to delete the article. You seem to feel that this paragraph is characteristic of the entire article, but that doesn't seem to be the case to me. The topic itself is encyclopedic, as it is a noteworthy issue in the creation-evolution debate about which there is much misunderstanding, making an article on this very valuable for reporting on the facts and claims of both sides. This is not an essay, because it is not making an argument: nowhere in the article is it argued that a theory needs the "absolute support of all scientists" (not even in the above quote), nor is the Guy Woods quote relevant (because the article doesn't say that a side is wrong or right based purely on popularity), and if you mean to apply that logic to science, you will end up abandoning both evolution and claims like "the Earth revolves around the Sun" or "if you drop an apple, it will fall because of gravity". You seem to be making counter-arguments against claims the article doesn't actually make. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 20:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. None of the above claims are both (a) accurate and (b) reason to delete this article. First, the contents of this article cannot be moved to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Steve_9fd7.html" title="Project Steve">Project Steve</a> (where they would be largely off-topic) or <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">Creation-evolution controversy</a> (where they simply wouldn't fit; that page is already 104 kb long!!!). Second, this article is not a POV fork of any article at all; indeed, that is impossible because there is no other article that specifically covers this topic. ScienceApologist's claim that this is an "undercover creationist POV fork" is both absurd (the article was created by <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">User:Filll</a>, one of the strongest anti-creationists on Wikipedia) and a clear example of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">failing to assume good faith</a>. Third, this article does not have a "thesis", it has a topic. Encyclopedia articles do not make arguments; they report on noteworthy subjects, and the level of popular support for evolution is a noteworthy subject, by virtue of its being so frequently discussed, debated, and disputed in the creation-evolution controversy.</li>
<li>Fourth, ScienceApologist consistently misunderstands the clear fact (which no one else has failed to notice, even other critics of this article) that the word <i>support</i> in this context refers to <i>popular</i> support (i.e., whether a person supports or opposes something), not to evidence or arguments used to <i>support</i> a claim. To conflate these two very different meanings is an example of the <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equivocation.html" title="Equivocation">equivocation</a> fallacy, and while the article itself is quite careful never to equivocate on this matter, nor even to leave any ambiguity on it (hence the dab notice at the top of the article), ScienceApologist is not demonstrating any such compunctions in trying to dismiss this article with mere word-games. This is especially surprising considering how many times the distinction has been explained to ScienceApologist on <a href="../../../l/e/v/Talk%7ELevel_of_support_for_evolution_fc20.html" title="Talk:Level of support for evolution">Talk:Level of support for evolution</a>. (This misunderstanding of his was also his motivation for trying to repeatedly delete this article by unilateral means shortly after it passed its last AfD; his appeal to AfD here seems to simply be a last resort after failing either to delete it himself or to convince others that he is correct.) As for <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaia_hypothesis.html" title="Gaia hypothesis">Gaia hypothesis</a>, both are much less socially controversial than evolution (and the latter isn't noteworthy enough to have a big series of articles).</li>
<li>This article is not a biology article, anymore than <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a> is. It is a sociological article about the phenomenon of varying degrees of popular support for evolutionary theory in different groups, times, places, etc.; it is not about the evidence used to support the theory of biological evolution, which is already covered at <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence_of_evolution.html" title="Evidence of evolution">Evidence of evolution</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28science%29_196b.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (science)">Wikipedia:Notability (science)</a> (which is a proposed guideline, not a guideline) therefore doesn't apply here, except indirectly.</li>
<li>As for "Evolution poll", that article was, at the time of AfD, an unencyclopedic unreferenced stubby opinion-piece. It was, in other words, precisely the <i>opposite</i> of <a href="../../../l/e/v/Level_of_support_for_evolution.html" title="Level of support for evolution">Level of support for evolution</a>, which is well-referenced, neutral, lengthy, and encyclopedic. The majority of the article in question was also a rant about the reliability of polling, not actual information about the level of popular support for evolution; and the title was malformed and bizarre. All of this makes attempts to judge this page based on that one useless. Their topical similarities are purely superficial, and even if they weren't, almost all of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Evolution_poll_297a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Evolution poll">delete votes</a> were about the contents. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 20:32, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I'm not voting on this one, at least not yet... but if the article is kept (and I think the above poster provided valid reasons why it should) it needs some copy-editing to adopt a fully encyclopedic tone. Some statements, like "it is likely that there will be more conflict and controversy in the future," and use of the term "unfortunately" could be attributed or removed to better suit a factual entry. I think it's informative, and certainly well referenced, but it does need a little attention. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">◄</font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">►</font></a> 20:51, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The bottom line to me is that the article appears to be generally well referenced and objective and which analyzes the unique social side of these creationist vs evolution debates. To fail the original research test, this article would have to be, as a whole, clearly forming an original opinion about the subject. But instead it looks like the article is collecting well documented major examples of how the various groups perceive evolution and creationism in context. Finally, the nominator complains about the use of polls, but in this case the article isn't using polls to validate the biological science of evolution, but is rather talking about a social phenomenan closely associated with the study and education of evolution and creationism and brings up polls as examples of the social issues in play. And even if you believe that the article presents some of the information in a slightly biased fashion (eg I think it uses weasel words like "frequently" and "often" too much) that would be an issue for clean-up and talk page discussion and not for an afd discussion on deleting the <i>entire</i> article. Thus while I think the article could stand some minor rewording and clean-up, I don't see any need to delete the whole thing. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:29, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>P.S. I would probably support a rename of the article to something like "Social reaction to evolution vs creationism debates". That might make it more clear that the article isn't attempting to "validate" a scientific theory, but rather to present interesting and notable social issues tied to the way people discuss it in public forums. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:36, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with the rest of your comment entirely (especially the fact that the article "isn't using polls to validate the biological science of evolution", nor to do the opposite), but I don't think that renaming would be very effective, mainly because this article doesn't describe how people react to the creation-evolution debates, but rather how they react to evolution. The creation-evolution debates are what makes this topic <i>noteworthy</i> (there aren't comparable creation-gravity debates, else that topic would also merit articles), but it's not the be-all and end-all of this article. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 21:43, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, that's an interesting point on the rename suggestion. It might be worth thinking about possible modifying the article to more clearly discuss both social reaction to evolution AND social reaction to creationism. It does cover some reaction to creationism, though, as in the section talking about the Steve list as a reaction to creationist claims of acceptance by a wide cross-section of the scientific community. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:33, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But Project Steve is worded not as a rejection of creationism, but as an <i>affirmation</i> of evolution. (Hence it leaves the door open for <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theistic_evolution.html" title="Theistic evolution">theistic evolution</a>, which is arguably a form of creationism.) Thus, although it is indeed a reaction to the creation-evolution social controversy, its primary relevance to the <a href="../../../l/e/v/Level_of_support_for_evolution.html" title="Level of support for evolution">Level of support for evolution</a> article is that it is one of many indicators of the level of support for evolution among scientists, and that it is also indirectly an indicator of the ongoing dispute over this level. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 23:35, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The standards for deletion should be consistent and the bar should be set rather high. Reading the article I found information that was favorable to both sides of the issues and also found an article that was fleshed out and well sourced as well as the topic being notable in our society today.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, as per above. The article could possibly use a rewrite/refocusing (it's a bit ADHD in its current form), but there's a lot of useful information, and contrary to the original request, I can't really see it as a pro-creation piece. (warning: pretty much soapboxing from here on out - feel free to skim&#160;:-D ) Maybe there're editwars going on that I'm not privy to, but if anything, the <i>only bias</i> I could find would be an "Americans are stupid lol, Scandanavia is so much more enlightened AMERIKKA=OWNED" bias - which is a theory that I, as an American who believes in the merits of the scientific process, have to admit seems to be supported by the Gallup numbers. Then again, maybe it's like what they say about finding smart jurors - "anybody who's smart will get out of jury duty" (or "anybody with an opinion worth sharing will have an unlisted telephone number"]. As far as the claim that sheer numbers neither prove nor disprove anything, again, I don't think the article is trying to prove anything one way or the other. (to wander even further off-topic for a minute: Saying that more than 98% of accredited scientists in relevant fields believe in evolution is a bit more substantial than the original request makes it out to be. People who respond to Gallup polls are also the sorts to loan <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advance_fee_fraud.html" title="Advance fee fraud">Nigerian princes</a> tens of thousands of dollars, so hey.) <b>Anyway --</b> the article serves a clear purpose by being a handy compilation of primary and secondary sources, serving as a branching point for an important and noteworthy academic topic, which I believe is what Wikipedia is all about.

(Somewhat tongue-in-cheek: I'm awaiting SA's AfD for the Controversy article.) I also have a positive argument: this article reports on the acceptance of evolution amongst lay people whereas the Controversy article deals with acceptance amongst scientists vs. rejection amongst lay people (creationists...). As such this new article Fillls a very real niche that was empty until this article was started. Obviously its scientific counterpart, the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> article, has been there since time immemorial.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This does not sound like a creationist fork. In fact, I think the POV is fair &amp; represents the scientific viewpoint in proportion to the consensus there, and similarly with the other sections. Others seem to see this also--some of the strongest pro-evolutionists in WP are one one side of this AfD, and some on the other. There is a great deal of editing to be done. some sections, like the one of the Catholic Church, are probably better merged elsewhere. Some on the general scientific literacy of the american public, should be articles of their own. Deleting the article is not the way to go about these changes. Once these are done, there is a great deal of editing in detail. But this is in my opinion at least perhaps the best and the fairest of all the articles on the controversy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Name can be rethought later--the article can be moved either by consensus, or at WP:RM. I think it possible that a better wording might be found by consensus among the editors without WP:PM. (It will take a little consideration for finding the best name. Perhaps this AfD will prove useful in getting the cleanup accomplished, though it will take a while and should go by slow stages--not by a vote here. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:02, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>If you have been reading the comments of the editors on the talk page then the idea that this is a creationist POV fork is ridiculous as the main editors are all pro-evolution (Fill, Silence, and Orangemarlin). This topic is relevant and important, particularly in the realms of politics and media. As sad as it is, since the government runs the public school system, politics is largely involved in education (which I feel should be eradicated with a voucher system, but that is another subject) and politics is obviously affected by public perception. All you have to do is look to San Francisco and the requirement of homosexual history to see this. It is even arguable that the public perception affects the teaching of evolution even more than scientific evidence does. Also, if I am not mistaken, one tactic that is used at almost every one of the "vs. evolution" trials is to bring in a stack of papers that support evolution and drop them on the objectors stand which is exactly what this article addresses. It is also very important in the media as the they use public opinion polls in their reporting, make decisions on what views to air, and decide how much time to give them and how to air opinions based on the popularity of the view. Regardless of how much time this issue deserves, it is often covered heavily by the media and thus is not just a creationist fork.</li>
<li>Fill has been more then willing in cleaning up the article when suggestions were made. I am a creationist and most of my complaints were addressed though I still feel that <b>Examining the level of public support</b> section needs to attempt to provide credibility for the general public or the section should be erased entirely to be NPOV, but this is a simple problem to deal with.</li>
<li>As for the title, it could probably use a better title, but the content is much more important, and I find it ridiculous that we keep wasting time on the title when we could be moving on to more important issues.</li>
<li>The other editors have already stated that this is not a scientific article but a social one.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>Rename</b>. The issue appears to be the idea that the article is about popular support and polls. So rename it. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 05:13, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> I suggest <i>Level of popular support for evolution</i> because: i) This partly addresses the concern that some sophist try to use the article to twist the poll results into a condemnation of the theory of evolution. ii) As <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">User:Silence</a> said above, that is the main thing the article is about, iii) It is a small change to the title. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardamon_ba9d.html" title="User:Cardamon">Cardamon</a> 10:47, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The main reason this change hasn't already been implemented is that Filll felt (and I agreed) that using "popular" here would suggest that the article is only concerned with the opinion of the masses, not with the opinion of scientists, etc., when in reality it discusses the level of support for evolution among all sorts of different groups of people. So "popular" in this sense would simply mean "by people", not "by laypeople". However, I'm coming around to thinking that this would not be a <i>terrible</i> change, and could perhaps be justified either by being careful to make sure that we're clear about which sense of "popular" we're using, or by simply refocusing the scope of this article and indeed focusing it primarily on laypeople's views of evolution, while discussing scientists' views only as a (lengthy) sidenote. However, considering that the current title (particularly with the dab notice at the top of the page) is about 99% non-ambiguous, I am still reluctant to change it largely to satisfy the nitpicking of one persistent editor (ScienceApologist). And I still worry that the new title would just replace one set of problems with a new, possibly worse set of problems (i.e., people might start trying to remove the scientific perspective from the article altogether). So at this point, I'm still wary about making such a rename, though it's certainly something to consider. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 13:22, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Although the name is putatively a problem, I will note that this has been addressed repeatedly without much satisfactory result or resolution on the talk page of the article. I compiled a long list of potential new names, and attempted to gauge community opinion on the matter, but this did not produce a satisfactory conclusion. I suspect that if the name was changed, this would not stop ScienceApologist's unilateral edits and what seems to be emerging as some sort of personal vendetta. ScienceApologist has continued to agitate against the article's theme and dispute the wording of various sections, both while logged in and as various anons. Apellative inconsistency and incompatibility seems to constitute only a small part of his concerns. Most of his problem appears to be that a balanced NPOV article in this area is not desirable since it might give some succor and comfort to creationists, a complaint that is not addressable in WP, and has nothing to do with the name. Changing the name would not quell the rancor or polemical exchanges I fear. For example, a suggestion to replace the word "support" with the word "acceptance" or the word "approval", either of which might be potentially more descriptive and less open to misinterpretation, did not receive his affirmation. Another prominent area of apparent dissension in this altercation is the claim that this article tries to suggest that science is decided by opinion polls. However, I dispute this assertion vigorously, which is addressed prominently (but not exclusively) in the article itself, in <a href="../../../l/e/v/Level_of_support_for_evolution.html#Validity_of_polling.2C_surveys.2C_resolutions.2C_etc." title="Level of support for evolution">Level_of_support_for_evolution#Validity_of_polling.2C_surveys.2C_resolutions.2C_etc.</a>. and in other places in the text. This eristic contretemps is not solely over the name, but over the existence of the article itself, and even the role of WP in documenting the controversy.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 16:49, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"General" is too vague here; pairing "General" with "Scientific" would confuse most readers because they would assume that "general" normally encompasses "scientific". "Perceptions" also isn't the best word, because it is vague (and thus has less informational value than "level of support") and arguably infers too much about the page's contents (i.e., the fact that someone says something about evolution doesn't mean that that's his "perception" of evolution; this seems to be conflating "perception" with "point of view" or "opinion", when normally opinions are subjective inferences <i>from</i> perceptions, not perceptions themselves). It's also pretty long, and (on a grammatical/style note) shouldn't be capitalized. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 16:38, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> While I certainly agree the title presents a problem (more one of uncertainty regarding the topic than POV), the content is extremely clear, well-defined, and well-referenced. It's a fallacy of the original nomination that this article has no value because popular opinion has no direct influence on the sciences. While that may be so, the effects of the evolution debate have extremely strong encyclopedic value to sociology, political science, and demographics. The effect on a scientific debate upon public perception, which in turn affects politics and education, is clearly of historical and socio-political value to an excyclopedia. This is a good article by all wikipedia criteria, keep it. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 14:08, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>one more point. As for this article being an "undercover creationist POV fork", all I can say is WTF?

<li><b>Strong keep</b> – this is a useful resource that can be linked from all the articles SA suggests, rather than trying to maintain the same information repeated in several article. The concern about this somehow conveying the mistaken idea that science is by majority opinion can usefully be addressed by a clear statement at the outset of the science section. Regarding the title, I suggest <i>Public opinion on evolution</i> as more clearly neutral, and as "public opinion" and "opinion polls" can refer to opinion amongst particular groups rather than the public at large. The sections could then be rephrased as "opinion on evolution" rather than acceptance or support. Alternatives might be <i>Levels of opinion on evolution</i> or <i>Extent of opinions on evolution</i>. Either way, these are problems that can be fixed and not a good reason to discard this resource. ... <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 22:58, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I believe this editor has not actually read the article, since it has signed statements that date from 1966, and polls that date back for a couple of decades, and clear evidence in the "Trends" section that my intention is to find more historical material. My impression from looking at the literature is that creationism belief levels in the US have always been high, and that the recent excitement is not really anything new at all. It also appears that the level of acceptance of evolution among scientists appears to be increasing, not decreasing.

<p>&lt;arbitrary indent reduction&gt;The topic of this article is sufficiently of interest that at least 3 mainstream books have been published on this, as noted in the article. These sorts of discussions are the basis of laws or laws under consideration in at least 40 US states currently. These sorts of discussions have been part of more than 10 court cases in federal courts, including the US Supreme Court. The level of acceptance of the theory is also used by both sides in the controversy, and considerable effort has been expended by various elements to try to determine what the level of acceptance is by different groups. It is not an article about the science of evolution directly; it is an article about the controversy, and charting its progress. --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 18:10, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>- I commented early on in this AfD, and I've been reading the comments since. I've read the article, and I do not see how any objective reader can conceive that the article is pro-creationism. Now, it is true that (as I mentioned up above) some POV statements need to be removed. The last "delete" vote had a point regarding the ending sentence... I don't think it was necessary, and certainly added nothing of value to the objective data. Nevertheless, that is a problem for cleanup, not scrapping the entire entry. The votes for delete have largely consisted of "<a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html#I_don.27t_like_it" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">I don't like it</a>" comments (if any justification is included at all), and one <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html#What_about_article_x.3F" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">scorched earth</a> statement. I don't know about the (apparently intricate) edit wars that have attended this and similar articles, but coming into the arena fresh I don't see any good reason provided for deleting this one, and lots of valid data that justifies its retention. And further, reporting on other people's POV from verifiable sources is not, itself, POV; especially if the <i>topic itself</i> is about viewpoints. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">◄</font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">►</font></a> 17:16, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b>. What does "support" mean in this case? "I support evolution and think we should have more of it"? "I oppose evolution and want it to stop"?

<li>Huh. You are right! I don't think anyone had noticed that until now. However, I think instead of changing the word "support", we should add "the theory of" before evolution: Level of support for the theory of evolution. The article measures support for the theory of evolution, not the concept of evolution itself. "Level of belief" just sounds somehow ... strange to me.

<dd>I will point out that the renaming of this article has been the subject of an immense amount of discussion. Part of the difficulty is that it has been difficult to get any kind of consensus about renaming. The problem with the word "belief" is that it has too many religious connotations. The acceptance by the scientific community of the theory of evolution to explain the fact of evolution is just what would be expected in any scientific activity. To call this a "belief" would draw parallels with creationism, the fear of which is driving the efforts to have this article deleted. So actually, to call it a "belief" would invite even more attacks of the sort we are witnessing on this page. One could of course include the word theory, but the distinction between the theory of evolution and the process of evolution is addressed in <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> and in <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objections_to_evolution.html" title="Objections to evolution">objections to evolution</a> and is also addressed in <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution_as_theory_and_fact.html" title="Evolution as theory and fact">evolution as theory and fact</a>. I will point out that some creationists accept the process of evolution, and some deny that it occurs. Some even accept the theory of evolution, at least in part, to explain the process of evolution. There are many many types of creationist with many different shades of acceptance of evolution the process, and evolution the theory. And none of them agree with each other, by and large. To get into these fine distinctions in this article would require much more information than is currently available, and would require a much longer article.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 01:00, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Article appears to be based on original research. It is largely irrelevant information, and a picture, of a freeway exit which by and large dead-ends on either side of the road. It provides minimal access to the Mt.

<p>OK, this is a strange one and needs some thought. I'm nominating this as being basically an indiscriminate collection of information and possible original research. There are tens of thousands of 'Grants'. There is a <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_Grant_452a.html" title="Clan Grant">Clan Grant</a> and there are many descendants of it various chiefs. This article picks out some Grants who became wealthy recently and trances their origins back to some of them. Perhaps it is verifiable (although the references given don't verify it) but it really doesn't belong here. It is just genealogical trivial on one prominent set of Grants. Merging it with <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_Grant_452a.html" title="Clan Grant">Clan Grant</a> would make no sense either - as this not a geneology of the chiefs - and that article can't contain every Grant. <b>Delete</b> -<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 20:04, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a bit tricky. First, normally I don't see the point of an <i>X family</i> article if there aren't at least a couple notable members (e.g. <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush_family.html" title="Bush family">Bush family</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booth_family.html" title="Booth family">Booth family</a>). On the other hand, the Rich List treats the entire descendancy as one holding and they do occasionally receive coverage. Still this isn't direct coverage, usually, it's coverage of the business. I think being in the top 10 wealth ranking in any country is potentially notable, but is Scotland a country for these purposes? Ultimately I think my instinct is to <b>merge</b> with <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Grant_%28businessman%29_18ed.html" title="William Grant (businessman)">William Grant (businessman)</a> (there's more information on him in this article than that one), and note the present wealth of the family there. If John Grant (current chairman) or someone else is notable individually, they should have an article, but if we don't have more than one notable member there's little point to an overview/navigation article. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:22, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Problem with a merge is that we are left with a redirect from 'Grant family' to one particular, and certainly not the most notable, Grant. I suppose, on reflection, we could simply redirect this, without merge, to <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_Grant_452a.html" title="Clan Grant">Clan Grant</a>?--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 22:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is not an article about "everyone named Grant", it is an article about the descendants of William Grant, who are rich, and tangentially perhaps related to Clan Grant. William Grant is possibly unquestionably the most notable member. Articles named "Lastname" are for generic information/disambiguation about last names. Articles named "Lastname family" are generally about a <i>particular</i> grouping of people with that name, and should be disambiguated as necessary (e.g. <i>Grant family (distillers)</i>. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 03:30, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hm, maybe I took your wording the wrong way. We can certainly merge the info and then redirect the article wherever best. As there is also an Irish line of Grants, perhaps <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grant.html" title="Grant">Grant</a> <i>per se</i> would be the best redirect.--<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 03:39, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Right now there seem to be three articles which all contain similar information -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grant_family.html" title="Grant family">Grant family</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Grant_%28businessman%29_18ed.html" title="William Grant (businessman)">William Grant (businessman)</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Grant_%26_Sons_c74d.html" title="William Grant &amp; Sons">William Grant &amp; Sons</a> -- so I think it does need to be rationalised somehow to remove the duplication. Maybe instead of my original idea, moving the historical information to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Grant_%28businessman%29_18ed.html" title="William Grant (businessman)">William Grant (businessman)</a> and redirecting <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grant_family.html" title="Grant family">Grant family</a> to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Grant_%26_Sons_c74d.html" title="William Grant &amp; Sons">William Grant &amp; Sons</a>? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 15:43, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Roundhill co-wrote a song on a recent <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Libertines_%28album%29_d531.html" title="The Libertines (album)">#1 album</a>; he's the literary agent for <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Doherty_4634.html" title="Pete Doherty">one of the most famous musician/poets in the country</a>, and he's featured in dozens of newspaper articles. The citations are adequate for a brand-new article, including documentation of his role as literary agent and publicist for Doherty, and work editing his prison diaries. I would like to add more citations and improve it, so if you see something lacking, please put a "citation needed" tag in, and someone can try to verify it, or remove it if that fails. It's much better than deleting the whole thing outright, especially when the man has been featured in dozens of reputable news articles and meets the standard for notability. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneVeryBadMan_2984.html" title="User:OneVeryBadMan">OneVeryBadMan</a> 16:09, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What song?</dd>
<dd>And your citation about him being a svengali is an article about him being implicated in a murder, I would say this is important. I don't believe you have a NPOV on this subject, which is why i suspect you're either ro or his associate.</dd>
<dd>It maybe does meet the standard for notability though.</dd>
<dd>If it is kept, i think it that it needs completely rewriting.</dd>

<dd>With all due respect, sir, have you read the article? It clearly identifies the song as <i>The Saga</i>. I'm also baffled by your claim not to see anything about public relations in the relevant citation<a href="http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news?id=16767/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news?id=16767/" rel="nofollow">[83]</a>. Almost the whole article consists of Roundhill acting as a PR, defending Pete and explaining the blood paintings, as well as organizing an exhibition of Peter's artwork. A few of the background bits need referencing, which I'm working on, but almost all the major elements of the article are supported by appropriate citations, namely the role as literary agent, PR, and role in creating the heavily-reviewed multimedia archive on balachadha (which is not defunct, but undergoing a redesign and update). As for co-writing a song with Doherty on the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Libertines_%28album%29_d531.html" title="The Libertines (album)">#1 Libertines album</a>, he's credited by name in the songbook I have. I'm looking for an internet citation at the moment, but in any case, it is indisputably verifiable and very notable.</dd>

<dd>Also, a google search reveals <i>300,000</i> hits on his name, linked to him and his work with Doherty, Wolfman, or the Mark Blanco incident, and I've seen his name on the front page of several major newspapers in recent months.</dd>

<dd>I've been editing here for a long time, and I would appreciate it if you refrained from speculating about my personal life and whom I might or might not be friends with. It's not relevant, and I don't think you have grounds to challenge me on NPOV. People are entitled to their opinions as long as they produce factually correct and neutral articles, and I believe I have done that. I take Wikipedia's policies very seriously, so if you can find something in the article which is biased, please bring it to my attention and make an appropriate edit.</dd>

The article plainly says no such thing and explicitly states there "is no suggestion that Roundhill had anything to do with it." <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneVeryBadMan_2984.html" title="User:OneVeryBadMan">OneVeryBadMan</a> 21:09, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In regards to your friendship with Ro, it is relevant. Also, it is not a neutral article, the pete doherty article refers to mark blanco, why does the article not mention any of ro's bad qualities, you cite an article in which he is referred to as “a pond-life dealer and junkie.” in addition to: “There are always young kids round and he lets them take drugs. Since Pete started going around to the flat, more and more of them have been turning up there hoping to see him.". Why are none of these bad qualities mentioned? And in regards to the mark blanco incident, he was questioned about it, implicated was a bit strong, i apologise, but he was involved and you did not mention it at all. Why is this? And bala v2 has not changed in the 7 months i have been aware of it. (assuming it is still at the thinkartful address. I don't have any feelings for or against the man, indeed, he does sound interesting. You've convinced me that it should be kept too.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article has clearly been written by an associate of its subject and omits the unsavoury aspects of Roundhill's character - notably the death of Mark Blanco, the drug-dealing and the scam Babyshambles 'gig' that he arranged in 2005. However, subject to prudent editing and NPOV maintenance it is worthy of inclusion IMO. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERaskazz_9ba3.html" title="User:Raskazz">Raskazz</a> 21:04, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete as subjective, unreferenced and arbitrary inclusion criteria</b> An actual article analyzing the history of "giant wrestlers" might be interesting, such as if it examined and compared historical big men in wrestling to modern day ones, looking at comparing styles, similarities in gimmicks, public reaction and in- and out-of-ring physical health issues (some of these gigantic guys have some similar health problems that most people, even other wrestlers, don't experience). Unfortunately, though, this article doesn't cut it. It's unreferenced, with a totally subjective list inclusion criteria (how giant do you have to be to be giant? JBL is really tall, does he count?) There is no attempt at putting the list in context or explaining exactly why this list of big wrestlers is any more interesting or notable than any other list of wrestlers. I suggest deletion, and then if an editor is interested maybe think about pursuing an actual written article about "giant wrestlers" using proper citations. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:46, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My recommendation then would be for the new editor who is looking to maintain this to copy and paste the article to his user space.

<p>Extinct political or honorary office had only one apparently otherwise nonnotable holder appointed 1627. "Aylsbury baronets" gets 2 Google hits. Unless all titles of nobility which ever existed in the world are inherently notable, delete for lack of notability. Wikipedia does not need to contain copies of everything in every reference book or directory. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 21:11, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep unless something has changed</b> As mentioned above, this got a "keep" result in the previous afd (not no consensus, but pretty strong keep it looks like).

<p>Apparently a non-notable actor, their most notable role being 'Teenage Girl #1' in a non-notable short. Claims that she has 'written and published two books under an alias' and 'had her worked published in newspapers', but doesn't cite any examples. No obvious google hits. No IMDB page.

<p>Non-notable university student club. No assertion of notability other than an unsourced unverified statement that it might be "one of" the oldest clubs of its types.
