<p><i>wild style is a crazy form of graffiti, most of the time it is very coplicated and hard to read by people who are not familiar with tath typical style, it also includes arrows, spikes, and other things, depending on the style</i> — which (to the best of my understanding) makes it sound entirely conventional.

<li><b>Comment</b> But (so far as I succeed in understanding the limp prose of <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_style.html" title="Wild style">Wild style</a>), roughly half of the photos in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graffiti.html" title="Graffiti">Graffiti</a> show "wild style". I don't claim any expertise, but it seems to me to be a kind of default mode among non-stenciled, western (or western-influenced) fairly large-scale exterior urban graffiti. If the article doesn't yet say (in words) anything about it, it could easily do so. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:19, 2005 Mar 27 (UTC)

<li>It could, but it doesn't. This article says something that needs to be said, although maybe it doesn't say it very well, so it should be cleaned up and merged or kept. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 08:06, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b>. <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graffiti.html" title="Graffiti">Graffiti</a> doesn't talk about this "style", but I can't find a reason why this is even considered its own unique style. Until graffiti is broken down into cubist, neoclassical, postmodern, etc... we don't need a single style article on its own. <a href="../../../f/e/c/User%7EFeco_e36a.html" title="User:Feco">Feco</a> 04:54, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>No, it's just that material about this particular style should go into the graffiti article until there's plenty of material to split off. If and when that happens, I'll change my vote.

<li>So what is the purpose of a redirect? Just to tell people not to make a separate article? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Information does not want to be alone. If there's little to say about a topic, merge it with a related topic, for easier reference. E.g. <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_pranks.html" title="School pranks">School pranks</a>. Items can be broken out if and when they get too big, but for several topics that isn't likely. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 11:09, Mar 27, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> as the person who got <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graffiti.html" title="Graffiti">Graffiti</a> to FA status please allow me to elaborate. There are many "styles" of graffiti, most notably the "Wild Style" most popularized by NY City writers and "Wiked Style" most popularized by Californian artits. Although these are similar in that they are both graffiti and block lettering, there are distinct differences. The earlier comment about Cubist, Modernism etc is actually not far from accurate here, Wild Style is more aggressive and angular in origin whereas Wicked Style is more futuristic and rounded. Graffiti historians and enthusiasts can generally identify where a writer learned/who influenced their work based on the form of their characters. Both of these styles were originally redlinked from <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graffiti.html" title="Graffiti">Graffiti</a> although it would appear someone came through and attempted to start a stub. I feel this stub should be kept and allowed to expand, rather than redirected to the movie which although uses the name is a poor target IMO. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a>™ 19:35, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>Reviewing the article, I can find nothing redeeming to it. The article lists a series of unrelated coincidences and tries to imply a connection to the Sep 11 attacks. The military runs war games all the time and they run them on more scenarios than you can imagine. There are entire groups whose job security depends on finding new scenarios to plan for. If I'd found this discussion during the voting period, I would probably voted to delete it as contentless. However, the community concensus is not to delete. The decision is to keep.</p>
<p>Having decided to keep, I am not going to call this as a decision necessarily to keep in its current form. Very good arguments were made in favor of merge and/or redirect. That decision should be reached on the articles' Talk pages. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:38, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>They may be segregated, but that's a good thing. A dictionary and an encyclopaedia have different aims. However, it doesn't mean that they are <i>separate</i>, that readers don't have easy ways to navigate from one to the other. See the shiny new interwiki link at <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foucault%27s_Pendulum_%28book%29_6a28.html" title="Foucault's Pendulum (book)">Foucault's Pendulum (book)</a>, for example. And note that whilst it would have been a bad idea to redlink every single listed word in List of Words from Foucault's Pendulum in Wikipedia, in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Words_From_Foucault%27s_Pendulum" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Appendix:Words_From_Foucault's_Pendulum">Wiktionary:Appendix:Words From Foucault's Pendulum</a> in Wiktionary that's actually a <i>good and desirable</i> thing. Wiktionary <i>likes</i> dictionary-definition magnets. Furthermore, notice how many of your de-linked words, that you manually added definitions to, already had definitions in Wiktionary. Concordances get definitions of their words for free in Wiktionary, which doesn't happen in Wikipedia. You've made a contribution to the betterment of Wiktionary. Thank you. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:09, 2005 Mar 27 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've said it before and I'll say it again: This is another typical "bored student" substub that is patently useless as is and does nothing to establish anything of note about its subject. It's more of a Yellow Pages listing than an encyclopedia article. Respectfully disagree that any handful of words that try to describe a public facility is automatically sacrosanct and/or capable of growth. OTOH, if this is fleshed into a real article and not a phone book entry, I'll gladly vote to keep this. Public facilities can be and often are notable, but this article doesn't ring the bell for this particular example. - Lucky 6.9 23:39, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>You probably mean you would keep an article on public toilet facilities in general (which I'd agree with) - but would you want to keep an article on public toilets in south London? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 08:07, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A general article would certainly be a keeper - but a geographically-specific article could easily be a keeper as well. There may well be someone out there who is the world authority on south London public toilets, and if they can present an interesting, informational, factual overview that describes the history and social relevance of those facilities (eg, how 19th century British attitudes towards public sanitation led to their construction, why they were sited where they are, who built them, how much they cost, how they may have altered social attitudes, how they may have been utilised as meeting places by subculture groups such as homosexuals etc etc), I see no reason for that not to exist as a stand-alone article in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 10:15, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, if we conjecture that there is actually something historically and socially relevant about toilets in south London, then it would be a useful article (per <a href="../../../u/a/_/WP%7EUA_5bfb.html" title="WP:UA">WP:UA</a>, too). But even then, a series of articles on public toilets for a large number of locations in the world would be very repetitive. The problem is that most school articles are neither interesting nor informational, nor do they have historic significance. Several schools are interesting because of a famous event there, or a number of famous alumni, or for some other reason - but the vast majority of schools have no distinguishable features. And hence, are unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 13:21, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is "actually something historically and socially relevant" about all public facilities, including schools. Details such as where they are sited, who founded them, why they were founded, when they were founded, how much they cost to construct, who constructeed them, how many pupils they started out with vs how many they have now, how many graduates they've produced, particular values they claim to promote, whether they are government or privately owned, how they interact with the local community, notable teachers/alumni, notable academic/sporting achievements are all "historically and socially relevant" to <i>someone</i>. Just because those details may not be of importance to <i>you</i> doesn't make them objectively unimportant. Indeed, the fact that so many articles are written about schools is itself a testament to their tremendous significance within the context of contemporary western civilization - and as far as I'm concerned the higher the level of granularity Wikipedia can achieve on this and other so-called mundane subjects, the better. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 21:01, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The details you mention are <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivia.html" title="Trivia">trivia</a>, rather than facts of historical significance. The fact that so many articles are written about schools is a testament to the fact that many people want to write an article about their own high school, but very few people care about articles about other high schools, except on general principle (because if they did, those articles would not be stubs). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 09:26, Mar 29, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You seem to be confusing the concepts of notable historic detail and trivia. The former relates to matters of factual relevance to researchers on a given subject, whilst the latter relates to irrelevant minutiae. As a hypothetical example: It is historically relevant that St John's Primary School was founded in 1985 by Father Peter Smith, that it is sited on land donated by Mary Stewart adjacent to St John's parish church in Vincent Street, Kentville, Australia, that it was funded largely by a bequest from the Davis family and that it now consists of 14 classrooms housing 300 students. Irrelevant trivia might be that there are 3 eucalypts growing in the lower playground, that the boys toilets are painted duck egg blue and neighbour Mrs Marple whose property adjoins the school is a grouch who refuses to return balls accidentally lobbed over her back fence. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 22:39, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I would consider the amount of classrooms and exact amount of students to be trivia. And certainly, for some schools it is historically relevant by whom they were founded and who donated the land (I never said that <i>every</i> school is not notable, just that <i>some</i> aren't) - but the majority of schools were founded by the community council, on ground donated by the community council. That's nothing special. You can't use an example for <i>some</i> schools to claim that <i>all</i> schools are important. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 07:55, Mar 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I, on the other hand, <i>do</i> believe that virtually all schools are nonnotable. By Centauri's logic, every single person who has ever lived is worthy of an encyclopedia article, because the "notable historic detail" of when they were born, who their parents were, who their brothers and sisters were, what they did for a living, what their favorite color was, what their favorite food was, who they were married to (if applicable), and how and when they died (for those who aren't still alive), etc., are "'historically and socially relevant' to <i>someone</i>". --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 19:23, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Errr yes. That's my point precisely (aside from your confusion of trivia and historically notable detail). This is an encyclopedia, after all. It's <i>supposed</i> to be encyclopedic.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 21:47, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Good, I'm glad I didn't misunderstand you. But if you truly believe that Wikipedia should have an article on every single human being who has ever lived, you'd better get busy. It'll take a while. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 22:22, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If someone is dedicated enough to use the potential of wiki technology to establish a project intended to create a fully cross-referenced article record of every person who has ever lived I would certainly support it. There is currently no such record in existence, and were it to be created within the context of Wikipedia it would be an awesome achievement and another credit to the project. It's time people stopped acting like Wikipedia is some sort of hip electronic version of Britannica, and started recognizing and making use of its real potential.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 23:12, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is quite simply a pipedream, and I credit you with enough intelligence to realize this. There is no way to accomplsih this since the necessary records do not exist and never will.

<li>It seems to be a real school. I'm not clear on the relationship between Bridgetown and Cincinatti, but I've run into a number of things like that. Bridgetown is apparently either a suburb of, or neighborhood-with-its-own-name-and-Zip-code-within, Cincinatti. The school's website <a href="http://www.oakhills.k12.oh.us/OHHS/" class="external text" title="http://www.oakhills.k12.oh.us/OHHS/" rel="nofollow">here</a> puts it at 3200 Ebenezer Road, Cincinnati, Ohio 45248, while <a href="http://www.hometownlocator.com/City/Bridgetown-Ohio.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.hometownlocator.com/City/Bridgetown-Ohio.cfm" rel="nofollow">Bridgetown</a>] seems to be Zip code 45211.

As to the age of our company (see NormanEinstein's remark) - one-click-translation tools are a very narrow niche, but in this field we are certainly one of the main players and being in the Internet business for about eight years - that makes us almost a "dinosaurian".

(Just in this new addition: What does "leveraged" mean beyond "used"? We don't need to be told that its "technology" is "patented". Retrieval can't be "instant".) So what is it that you're you voting to keep -- (a) something in the spirit of the version that I made, or (b) a not-too-obvious corporate puff (just a little milder than the original, which you thanked me for rewriting)? If it's the latter, I vote to delete it. (Incidentally, my own employer is a large institution that unquestionably meets the criteria for an article on WP. Rather to my surprise, it doesn't yet have an article -- but I'm not going to create one, precisely because it's my employer. Somebody else is sure to create an article eventually.

Earlier, I got the impression that the author realized that it was too much of an advertising page and was happy with changes making it less of one; since then, she has in effect reverted a number of these changes.

<p>1.) I didn't write the first version of this article, someone else in the company did, simple copy &amp; pasted some of the texts in our website. 2.) I inherited it as – god forbid, I wrote an article about Joshua Sobol (Israeli author), which makes me the “wiki-pro” in our company. 3.) I was more then happy about the changes done by Hoary, and even more delighted by his kindness to help. 4.) The changes I did, and that found so much criticism by Hoary, were mainly a response to some of the votes above from people being unsure if Babylon is “worth” an WP article. I had the feeling that important info was missing in the article and that it simple became too short. So I made a new version. 5.) My mother tongue is German, I raise two kids that answer me only in Hebrew (we are living in Israel), so no wonder that I relay on people that should know better and took the “leverage” stuff from someone who speaks English as her mother tongue. I looked the phrase up now – and it doesn’t make sense to me either and it is gone from my new version. 6.) Making a search on "instant information retrieval" in Google I see that Babylon is not the only one to use this phrase to describe their way of information delivery. 7.) My personal opinion set aside – have you got any notion of how many of WP’s company articles have been written by a “disinterested person” and how many are done by the companies themselves? 8.) greetings to all <a href="../../../u/r/s/User%7EUrsulaR_6e68.html" title="User:UrsulaR">UrsulaR</a> 17:59, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>As noted elsewhere, I think the results of that poll are, to coin a phrase, so completely and irremediably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to try to make head or tail of it. It is not a touchstone that can be used as a working tool to crystallize consensus on particular cases. I can't remember it being cited more than a couple of times in all of 2004. I think the hope was that the poll would demonstrate consensus for at least the extreme cases, and IMHO it didn't. I still think the most accurate thing that can be said about high schools and lower grades is that <i>there is no consensus.</i> That poll is perfectly good gotcha material and I should have at least said touché when someone pointed out an inconsistency in my vote on that poll and a vote in a particular VfD, but it's not a generally accepted current consensus. If someone really thinks there is consensus now, they need to state what that consensus position is and conduct a discussion and see whether people agree. I don't think it's possible to obtain consistent conformance to a policy unless it is <i>current</i> consensus. And I do mean "consensus," not "majority." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:07, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree that the poll doesn't show any kind of a consensus. And there obviously is not a consensus on the school matter. So I wonder if we can resolve this matter somehow? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 09:21, Mar 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

It looks to me like this wasn't written by him, and there's no harm in keeping it. I don't know your system exactly.</li>

<li>That looks better, and I agree the topic is encyclopædic but I'm concerned about the copyright - the liscence style you quote is for <i>Resarch or private study</i> purposes only <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/copyright.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/copyright.asp" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, I'm not certain that wikipedia qualifies there.

<li>Quoting from statistics.gov.uk: "All the material featured on this site may be downloaded to file or printer for the purposes of research and private study without requiring specific prior permission.

<li>I agree with that, but <i><b>all</b></i> text on wikipdeia is explicitly released under the GFDL (images have more leeway), and afaik that would mean someone is able to remove or edit the copyright statement on this or a mirrored version, meaning we violate the Crown copyright (never a good plan.

<li>The point of a "notability" is to exclude things that are of interest to very few encyclopedia users, things like ordinary people, shops, and amateur bands with no audience.

<li>I see your point, but what would you do about a high school that is small, non-influential and very similar to several other high schools? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 19:57, Mar 27, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, most high school articles I've read on WikiPedia do not in any way demonstrate that said school is influential or different from other schools. So personally, I would be in favor of merging the lot of them (by city or district or something) into an annotated list. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 08:22, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is no decision or policy, it is just a poll. Also, it is broken down into levels of notability, and for the more obscure kinds of school, there is a clear majority to <i>delete</i> them. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 08:15, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Polls are perhaps the most widely recognized method for creating official policy. Note that the page states "rather than discuss this repeatedly on VfD every time a school article appears, it would be more sensible to gain a consensus which could be applied to all of them. That's what this page is for." Moreover the only types of schools that have conseunsus for deletion were those with under thirty studetns, preschools, and bulk automated entries. The poll is old, perhaps it would be a good idea to re-run it or a similar poll to show where the current consensus lies. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 13:34, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)

<li>According to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicy_66bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Policy">Wikipedia:Policy</a>, <i>policy is created by consensus</i>.

<dd>Actually, "Gene", I have done exactly that, voting based on Wikipedia policies around notability and whether articles have a chance to become encyclopedic. Thus, unlike "Centauri", sometimes I vote delete, sometimes keep. As for you, "Gene", perhaps you should straighten out just exactly which userid is "Centauri", and which is "Gene Poole"; that way there won't be those embarrassing episodes where you get confused about whether you should respond as "Gene Poole" rather than "Centauri" (or vice versa).<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Irate&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10516600" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Irate&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10516600" rel="nofollow">[15]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Irate&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10523323" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Irate&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10523323" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:32, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Behavior of this sort is uncalled for. It is improper and impolite to imply that Gene is a sock puppet. It is also rude to suggest that Centauri casts votes without "actually looking at their contents or thinking about them." Perhaps you should consider a Wiki-vacation and cool off before you find yourself on the receiving end of an RfC. --"GRider"\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 23:15, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have not stated that Centauri and Gene are sockpuppets; why on earth would you even bring that up, unless you think there is evidence to support the idea? As for your advice about Wiki-vacations and "cooling off", considering that in the past couple of weeks you have become the subject of two RfCs and now an Arbitration, with a suggested injunction to ban you from editing these kinds of pages because of your provocative edits, perhaps it might be wise if you took your own advice. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 15:44, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is no evidence to support your impolite insinuations.

<dd>Did you happen to note the two links I provided following that comment, in which "Centauri" replies to a comment addressed to "Gene Poole" as if he were indeed "Gene Poole", then deletes the comment, realizing his revealing error? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:11, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>GRider, while I agree that Jayjg could have phrased what he said more gently, your response is also sailing rather close to the wind. Jayjg, if you beleive that Centauri and/or Gene Poole are abusing sockpuppets and/or behaving otherwise improperly, then I suggest you open an RfC (if you do let me know as I'd be interested in knowing the answer to this). Alternatively, perhaps mediation between the different sides in this debate would be more apropriate? (I admit to not knowing a huge amount about the mediation process). Any further discussion on this matter would probably be best on the talk page. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 23:30, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not only is this original research, it is also wrong. The events 1, 2, etc. (as used in the calculations) are obviously <i>not</i> independent, so the calculations are irrelevant.

The result of the debate was difficult. The core objection to this article is not whether the topic is encyclopedic but whether this particular article can be salvaged given the poor (to me, unintelligible) use of English and the lack of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> sources. Noting that no corrective edits have been made to this article in almost a month, I am going to call this one as a delete.</p>
<p>Comment: This decision should probably not be interpreted as precedent if an intelligible article on the topic is created. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:06, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

-Under these denomination stay indicate the japanese plans agains Soviet Union. this if similar at plans against United States (Operation "KO or "A"),plans against China(Operation "HEI" or "C"),figth against Great Britain(Operation "TEI" or "D") and last attack to Soviet Union (Operation "Otsu" or "B").</p>
<p>this is stay in one historical context,stay relationed with WW2 Times in Pacific war,and proceded from "Kogun" one Japanese Military Manual of these time why are translated to English.for your historical nature this term no appareing in any common web finder.additionally i see why for more near at Japanese pronunciation if use in certain times h in certains words how for example "Otsu"(more western translation) are replaced for "Othsu"(more near at Japanese usual writing translation).</p>
<p>i advised why this information no proceded from fiction or imaginaire sources and none similars,are this one historical information of ww2,based in "Kogun" military manual text and the book "Goodbye Japan" writing for one american journalist why living in Japan in last times before at Pearl Harbor attack in december 1941.</p>
<p>One curiosity if why acase all terms debt to sense or having finded in web finders? if certain why exist more vandalist or very ocious persons dedicated to molest or writing hoaxes or lies,but in this case this writing are based in historical documents,reiterrally lamentably for having scarcy know in web sources this considered for yours and others how false or non existant term,but this no indicate why precisally are this.mentioned other similar case,fuyioru ancient Jap old denomination of nikolayevsk,at first,this term for no appareing in official recent list for your ancient nature(this appareing in ancient russian map)obviously no appareing in present web finders, but if appareing in web russian map and this confirm your existance. i see the long list for deletion and encounter more articles digns for delete but no stay accord with why for why one word no appareing in contemporary list debt to sended to deleting list.</p>

<p>Not only is this pure dicdef, it's wrong. The writer purports that "hacker" only means someone who is very interested in computing, and so it has been misinterpretted. Checking Wiktionary, though, one of the defs is "A cracker; one who breaks into computer systems with malicious or criminal intent." See the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hacker#Usage_Note" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hacker#Usage_Note" rel="nofollow">usage note</a> to see where the writer gets this idea.

<li><b>Merge</b>. Inspite of the "Hacker" page discussing that the press has been misusing the word "hacker", it doesn't quote any examples. It doesn't help if the press continue to misuse the word unless we make them aware of this. By the way, we must not forget that hackers were the ones who gave us the Unix operating system in the early days of computer science. I suggest that the hacker misinterpretation page be merged with the hacker page.</li>
<li>Perhaps <b>merge</b> a specific example or clarification to <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacker.html" title="Hacker">Hacker</a>, otherwise <b>delete</b>, do not transwiki. Nominator shouldn't argue from dicdefs, especially one from the same project we're editing. The fact that one "incorrect" use has gotten frequently used, even by John Ashcroft while he was USA Attorney General, doesn't mean that WP should list it as a standard meaning without a note right there in that def, although it does mean we should acknowledge the corrupted version.

<p>This page should be kept but reworked. Internet handles are encyclopedic if that is the name by which a body effects change. Beyond the poop that flies around on this page, Stem is creating and fostering an entirely new genre of music. Porn Stars are in this enclopedia under their porn star names, Joseph Stalin is in here under the name Stalin. We should re-work it to be less glib, but what this man is doing is impressive and deserves to be documented.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Probably could be speedied as patent nonsense but as long as it's on VfD it might as well be discussed. Seems like a good example of "Content that, while apparently meaningful after a fashion, is so completely and irremediably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to try to make head or tail of it." This may be unfair since it may be the product of weak English language skills, but unless it can be clarified it must go. I think it is very likely that were it to be clarified it would turn out to be original research and quite possibly have POV problems. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:50, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 24 "delete" votes (one user voted twice but looking at the date stamps, I'm going to give him/her the benefit of the doubt and assume it was an innocent mistake), 12 "keep" votes (two troll votes and one comment by a very new user discounted) and one comment too ambiguous to call. On 8 April, the article was substantially expanded however voters after the expansion continued to express a split opinion. I do not consider the expansion sufficient to overturn the concerns raised by the prior "delete" voters.</p>
<p>Looking at the specific comments in the voting, I note that the majority of those arguing for deletion took the time to present arguments which were specifically applicable to the facts of this particular article while the majority of those argued to keep replied with formulaic variations of "keep all schools". I must admit that influences my decision slightly. I am going to call this one (barely) as a delete decision. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:50, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The purpose is to build an encyclopedia, within <i>some recognizable meaning of the term.</i> Almost everybody agrees that Wikipedia should be more inclusive than traditional encyclopedias, but there is disagreement on how far it should be extended. I think the essence of the matter is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_general_knowledge_base" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. These sorts of short articles that give a few generic facts are better handled by a database of schools, such as www.greatschools.net. Anyone looking for this sort of basic information would be far better served by the comprehensive and up-to-date information on such a site, or by Googling for the school's own website, than going to Wikipedia for stale second-hand low-quality articles.</dd>
<dd>We are a secondary source, but we add value to our articles by selecting, synthesizing, and using editorial judgement as to what and how facts should be presented. I don't think this happens in the case of articles like this one. Oddly enough, my judgement is similar to yours but in the opposite direction. A "cruft" article doesn't damage Wikipedia very much, because it doesn't affect anyone who isn't looking for the information. But I do think each and every low-quality article does do a little damage to Wikipedia.&#160;::The usual counter to this is that articles grow and improve over time and only remain in the low-quality state for a while.

<li>???? You get that from that poll? Wow. I've always thought the results of that poll were so hopelessly muddled that no intelligent person could make head nor tail of it, to coin a phrase. The one thing that comes through to me crystal clear, on each of several attempts to establish policy, is that there is no consensus. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 10:47, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I didn't say there was a <i>consensus</i>, as there clearly isn't. And I agree that it's very muddled. But the majority is for keeping of notable school articles, and deleting of non-notable school articles. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 13:30, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Our interpretations of this clearly differ; all public educational institutions are notable, therefore all of them should be kept so long as they are not a copy vio.

<ul>
<li>I think the most NPOV way of summarising that would be to say that some people consider it a mandate to delete non-notable school articles, while others consider it validation that all schools are inherently notable. In my book that means there is no consensus, and thus there is no point in either side of a debate trumpeting it as endorsing their cause. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 21:41, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>The poll I mentioned obviously has no consensus, and it certainly isn't policy by <i>my</i> book. But some people do consider it policy so I pointed that out.
