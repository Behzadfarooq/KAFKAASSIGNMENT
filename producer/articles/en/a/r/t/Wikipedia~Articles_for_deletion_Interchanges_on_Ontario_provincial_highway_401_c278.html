<dd>I'm surprised, shocked, and dismayed at the community's reception to this article's content. Has anyone in the community actually <i>tried</i> to contact authorities in Ontario to see whether they would use this information? I actually raked up a large long distance bill doing so to find out that people in the transportation sector, law enforcement, truck drivers, government agencies, postal offices, delivery services, long term care facilities all use this information - on a regular basis, and for their livelihoods. Sometimes we need to go a bit further than our own intuition to determine whether something is encyclopedic or not - and certainly, this is material that is of utility for a large sector of people - many of which can conceivably find it here on Wikipedia. Simply put, if this is deleted, this is one AfD where I feel the community failed in doing its full due diligence in evaluating content worthiness. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 17:44, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per SPUI. JAranda's claim that this is just a list of intersections is false, as it also has references and information on possible extensions of the highway. Also, while I agree that Wikipedia is not a road atlas, that doesn't mean we can't have articles about roads. Wikipedia is not a math textbook, either, but we have plenty of useful articles about mathematical theorems. Given that there have been no other arguments for deletion, and keeping it will retain useful and verifiable information, it seems clear to me that this article should be kept. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 01:09, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't think including those images would be acceptable under our license. Also, they're not well-suited to simply showing the interchanges on one highway. It might be nice to have a stylized representation of the road, with the interchanges clearly indicated in order. Providing other geographic information around it would just be distracting. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 05:17, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, nor is it an informational garbage dump. As Gamaliel said in a different discussion (and note particularly the last sentence and clause:
<ul>
<li><i>Wikipedia is not paper, but it is also not the Library of Babel, nor is it an endless and tedious compendium of every bit of trivia and gossip and useless, insignificant "facts". It is an encyclopedia, not a dumping ground. That means we have a duty not to mindlessly compile facts but to present them in a concise and usable manner, making judgments about which facts are important and which are not.</i>
<ul>
<li>I don't think the article in question is useless or insignificant. I also don't think it was created mindlessly. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 02:56, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not paper covers more than just the amount of information we can include. It looks like this article exists as extra information for the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_provincial_highway_401.html" title="Ontario provincial highway 401">Ontario provincial highway 401</a> article. I'm not arguing that in a paper encyclopedia there would not be enough space for the info (trees will keep growing) but that it would be almost impossible to organize it sensibly. By braking the extra information out onto a seperate page - in a different dimention not avalable to users of paper - the editors of <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_provincial_highway_401.html" title="Ontario provincial highway 401">Ontario provincial highway 401</a> have found a good way to arrage things while trying to limit the length of there main article which helps readability. Wer should be considering the future of this page in the context of <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_provincial_highway_401.html" title="Ontario provincial highway 401">Ontario provincial highway 401</a> and not as some isolated list. Do you really want to make <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_provincial_highway_401.html" title="Ontario provincial highway 401">Ontario provincial highway 401</a> worse or not have that article? Then delete this page. Do you think we need an article for <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_provincial_highway_401.html" title="Ontario provincial highway 401">Ontario provincial highway 401</a>? Then I think this page needs to stay too. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreww_9f2f.html" title="User:Andreww">Andreww</a> 09:49, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Extreme roadcruft. Wikipedia is not an atlas, and any geographical information should be, at best a summary or illustrative. I keep thinking of the <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jorge_Luis_Borges_2dc9.html" title="Jorge Luis Borges">Borges</a> about some mythical mapmakers:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>In that Empire, the craft of Cartography attained such Perfection that the Map of a Single province covered the space of an entire City, and the Map of the Empire itself an entire Province. In the course of Time, these Extensive maps were found somehow wanting, and so the College of Cartographers evolved a Map of the Empire that was of the same Scale as the Empire and that coincided with it point for point. Less attentive to the Study of Cartography, succeeding Generations came to judge a map of such Magnitude cumbersome, and, not without Irreverence, they abandoned it to the Rigours of sun and Rain. In the western Deserts, tattered Fragments of the Map are still to be found, Sheltering an occasional Beast or beggar; in the whole Nation, no other relic is left of the Discipline of Geography.</i> --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:29, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Somewhat of a tangent: it occurs to me that with Wikipedia, we can provide geographical information of whatever precision users desire, and still have the whole thing be no larger than a laptop (from the user's point of view). This way, we approach Perfection without having the flaw of Magnitude. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 02:56, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Normally I'd prefer to keep highway articles, but so far as I can tell, this information just comes right out of the external links without really adding anything.

<li>While I think this information is useful, I agree that it may not be displayed in the best way, here. Perhaps create a map with the information and store it as an image? However, even that's problematic, because to include it on an article, it will be too small to see the information. Then the user will have to click on the graphic and wait a possible eternity for it to load. Also, text is easier for people with visual impairments than a tiny squished map is, so we wouldn't be helping them out any. Unfortunately, I can't find a way to include this information in Wikipedia in a way that works. <b>No vote</b>, just pointing out the current limitations of our encyclopedia. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_92a1.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M Schedler">★</a> 00:14, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</sup>

<li>A list of freeway interchanges is not something that merits its own article. Roads just are not <i>that</i> inherently interesting (and I'm speaking as a self-admitted map junkie here). An interchange list is reasonable enough in the highway's article, but it <b>never</b> deserves its own distinct article.
