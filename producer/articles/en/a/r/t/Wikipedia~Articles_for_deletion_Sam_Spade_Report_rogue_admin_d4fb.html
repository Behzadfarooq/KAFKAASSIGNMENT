<li>Mgm, Jack has no compelling evidence. Note how historically-vulgar his "evidence" was against myself. This is why he resorts to making such allegations on his user page rather than following policy and appropriate channels (of which he is well aware). A quick glance reveals that his evidence reflects more poorly on him rather than myself. His evidence on socialism: I withdrew out of the Socialism article because Jack used <a href="../../../b/s/_/BS_9a23.html" title="BS">BS</a> in an edit summary to revert my changes.

</li>
<li>In that case, I would like you to rewrite the introduction of the page to state its intentions more clearly. As they are now, it's completely incomprehensible to me. Secondly, I'd like to ask you to make the signature a bit smaller and maybe make it say just "Report admin abuse", so it's shorter and doesn't take as much space while still being quite visible. Keeping it a normal size and changing the color may attract just as much people and is less intrusive on others. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:23, May 29, 2005 (UTC)

<li><strike><b>Delete</b>.</strike> <b>Abstain</b>. While it is true that many users do keep 'evidence' pages in their user space, for example in preparation for possible ArbCom disputes, the way this page is structured ("Report Rogue admins below, and / or contribute specific cites of their policy violations"), and also advertised through the signature, circumvents the established process for dealing with complaints against admins. This is not an evidence page, it poses as <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>. This may very well confuse newbies and others.

<li>Sam, would you be willing to change more text in the intro. <i>Admins have more than job security, they have a mandate to abuse, harass and shame ordinary users and anons.</i> and <i>While they protect one another in the same fashion in which they bully others</i> are generalizations which could well be considered an personal attack against all admins. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:15, May 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is a tricky one; I don't see this benefiting wikipedia in it's current form though, and in the end that trumps any legalism or ideals about freedom on user pages. If Sam wants to prepare an arbitration case he's free to do so, many people have done so on subpages of their user page without any serious objections, however this is just trolling. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../w/e/y/User%7EWeyes_aab8.html" title="User:Weyes">W</a>(<a href="../../../w/e/y/User_talk%7EWeyes_0fbf.html" title="User talk:Weyes">t</a>) 04:54, 2005 May 29 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. Something needs to be done about rogue admins, and I don't mind Sam working on whatever he works on in his userspace anyway. The fact that this would be VfDed and people would vote delete strongly suggests that criticism of admins is not acceptable on Wikipedia and will be punished—essentially, that people are not allowed to criticize the actions of people in positions of power. I suppose some people can justify that, but I think authoritarianism in the project is dangerous. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:28, 29 May 2005 (UTC)

Of course, if there were no attmpt to remove <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html#Use_of_administrator_privileges" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC#Use of administrator privileges</a>, then your claim wouldn't make any sense, but... oh, wait... <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 11:55, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's Sam Spade's own user space, so we don't place as many restrictions on the content as perhaps elsewhere on the wiki. Sam Spade is not the only user to list in his personal user space the admins he does and does not like. However, I'd appreciate it if he toned down the content of the article to resemble less of a personal attack, and more of a simple log of information. I understand that there are always some nasty conflicts between users on Wikipedia, but the less the outside world sees of it, the better. I am pleased to see, however, that Sam Spade has agreed to change his signature. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 07:23, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It is a personal attack to post people here because of (for instance) the page title. You are in effect saying that they are lousy admins which is a personal attack. If you want to build a case against someone, do it on the page User:SamSpade/RFC against XXX. And most importantly <i>don't advertise it</i>, that makes it 100x worse. <a href="../../../g/k/h/User%7EGkhan_3d68.html" title="User:Gkhan">gkhan</a> 11:24, May 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Still, it affects others, and it sets a bad precedent. I agree with Silversmith, though, that there should be a policy on this, not just a case-by-case debate. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 11:55, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Keep. (anon vote) I suggest for the sake of fairness, balance, and symmetry that the existing anti-Sam Spade group formalize its existence with a user page to "compile data for upcoming RfC's and Arb Com cases against Sam Spade." They admit they attack him when he does things they wouldn't attack others for because they say his past behavior makes it ok not to give him the benefit of the doubt. Well, let BOTH sides keep track of their complaints on these twin user pages and all of us can see by the evidence they gather who is doing what. I bet both sides would act better. 4.250.168.100 20:40, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Withdrawing a nomination only stops the voting if it's done before other people vote, or if everyone voted "keep". Of course, to avoid discussions, usually someone else who voted "delete" steps up to replace the original nominator.

<li>I do not recall seeing any set guideline either. But as long as there are people on both sides on the debate, I think it should be continued so that others can make an opinion (like me). <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 21:43, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Abstain</b>. I do not see that there is any point to just delete user pages if they want to use them to criticise admins. On the other hand, I am unsure where to draw the line between constructive criticism and blatant personal attacks.
