<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> I don't see how being an artist automatically makes a person notable. Neither do I understand why created by an administrator is relevant. jmd 01:15, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Being an artist is not itself notability, but it is a <i>claim</i> to notability, which is all that is required to prevent being a speedy delete. And the fact that it was created by an administrator is relevant because we can assume that user has a grasp of the policies which apply here, although that doesn't trump a consensus we find here. (<a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a>)<sup>(<a href="../../../e/s/k/User_talk%7EESkog_7643.html" title="User talk:ESkog">Talk</a>)</sup> 02:47, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I refute your statement that being an artist equates to a "claim to notibility" --- at least notable enough for a wp article. There's an artist in all of us --- it's just that some are more artistic than others. Or perhaps you mean that it must be a <em>paid</em> artist, in which case a) you're discriminating against some very talented (and notable) unpaid amatuer artists; and b) why can't this apply to other jobs (doctors, laywers, butchers, dustmen ....)&#160;? If the article said that "YY is a <i>notable</i> sculptor", then that would be different, but the article doesn't say this. jmd
<ul>
<li>I think you're misunderstanding me. I'm not saying that Yamaguchi is necessarily notable. However, speedy criterion A7 requires that there be no claim to notability at all. (<a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a>)<sup>(<a href="../../../e/s/k/User_talk%7EESkog_7643.html" title="User talk:ESkog">Talk</a>)</sup> 07:22, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly. As deletion is supposed to be a serious matter, I'm pretty strict with the application of the speedy criteria.

<li>Now that this article has been expanded, I'm withdrawing my deletion vote. But I'd like to point out that when I listed this article, there was indeed no claim of notability whatsoever. The article listed the person's name, occupation and education --- nothing else. What if your hypothetical article said "Joe Schmoe attended New York University, works for as a town planner for the City Council and likes to drink beer," would that have made it notable? jmd</li>

<dd>Changing vote to <b>Keep</b> - this is hardly an artist of much note, and the padded CV posted by Pburka contains a lot of shows of largely indecipherable notbaility, but her inclusion in a few galleries of note means she meets the threshold for inclusion. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 18:05, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>After looking through about 10 pages of Google hits I have decided that her notability is not quite high enough to warrant inclusion, so I have changed my vote.

<li><b>Comment</b>: This is not the run-of-the-mill teenage vanity article, a few seconds of googling indicates some notability, and it is an article created in good faith by an established user. As I have repeatedly pointed out in the discussions on academics, I also think we need to ask: <b>is this person really <i>less</i> notable than the least notable professional baseball or hockey player who would be included according to our current notability criteria?</b> Is an artist who is represented in several public museum collections, has had numerous exhibitions at both museums and private galleries (who presumably expect either some income from sales or to enhance their own prestige by exhibiting a certain artist), and has had a large number of articles or reviews written about her or her work in major newspapers and art publications really <i>less</i> notable than some 22-year old who has just played hockey in the NHL for a year? <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 08:51, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is indeed an interesting topic for discussion. The crux is, that <i>notable</i> is not the same as <i>noteworthy</i>. For example, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Bryant_da7e.html" title="Martin Bryant">Martin Bryant</a> is certainly more notable than (say) <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frits_Zernike_4349.html" title="Frits Zernike">Frits Zernike</a>, but IMHO less noteworthy. I would certainly agree that the huge majority of sports personalities are totally unworthy of any special notice (what's so clever about kicking a ball around?) but that's just my POV. That fact remains that the world has and does take notice of many of these persons who have not managed to outgrow their teenage infatuations (or have found a way to make money from them), and are therefore by definition <i>notable</i>. I'm not saying that this isn't a very sad inditement on society, but that's just my POV. jmd</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I question the Amazon search results as the basis to Keep this article. The results show how many times a word was used anywhere in any of the hundreds of thousands (or is it millions?) of quotes from books listed on Amazon. Just because a word is used in a book, or 30 books, does not make it notable. Second, regarding the claim that it has been "very well known" since the 1970s, again I disagree. People can, and often do write about the 1970s using terms from the current era. It's necessary to see the entire context. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 13:39, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The results are impressive because most books are not full-text searchable through Amazon and the feature is generally only available for the most recent books. Hence, books from the 90s and earlier are not going to produce many hits and, in any case, are frequently out of print. Regarding the dating of the term, I’ve found the concept, i.e. “<i>the Jewish afro</i>” going back to 1970. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:35, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The Amazon search also doesn't differentiate among words used in dialogue and in other ways. All kinds of non-sensical, slang and odd words are used in dialoge. I think it's important to understand the context and not just focus on the raw numbers. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 16:46, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as I've not been able to verify any of the information is correct. I'm a JSU fan (class of '03), attended every home game in 2005, and don't remember this guy. It's shame; we needed a good DB. The ESPN reference must be an error.

Anyways, at this point, I figure I don't have to be a football expert to know, this person is not famous.

<p>I'm a bit conflicted about this one, but I see no way to keep it. A list of states considered "independent" is surely POV; not to mention that the title will change when one nation's status changes. There were originally 32 states that founded the <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organization_of_African_Unity_74bd.html" title="Organization of African Unity">Organization of African Unity</a>, and I haven't gone through to check if these are those, but the successor organization has something like 50 now, and a list of the founding nations of OAU belongs in the OAU article. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 02:31, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>comment</b> yeah you guys are pretty good at this stuff. I am the author of the article and the book. I would like to say you found my meat puppets quickly, kudos. Also a kudo to Tom for handling the critisism well. Sorry old chap, all in the fun. Unfortunately I must say I am disapointed with Susan Larson for deleting TodayWarrior's vote. He is not a fake and has never before used Wikipedia. That is why his record shows no other posts. He is the big fan Taylor I mentioned in the "Chronicles of Friendship" post. I would also like to thank ManoaChild for the "good luck" on my book. And for one last puppet of the sock:</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This term has been used in newspaper articles and is widely used in the queer community and in student/university political organisations. Its a term that is more widely known and has been in usage longer than <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homoflexible.html" title="Homoflexible">homoflexible</a> for example.

<dd>I am not trying to come off as inconsiderate here, but this word is pretty much a textbook neologism (see my above link). If this word can be found used meaningfully in newspaper articles or books, rather than just alluded to, that's a start. I'm willing to help here... but the sparse Google coverage still makes me think this is a neologism not very widely used at all. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 05:55, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Seems notable enough for a neologism. <b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pansexuality.html" title="Pansexuality">pansexuality</a>. While the leading sentence of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pangender.html" title="Pangender">Pangender</a> talks about the difference between the word 'sex' refering to anatomy versus gender identity, the Pansexuality article is clearly talking about gender identity (not someone with all anatomies&#160;:) - so they're talking about the same thing. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_10.html" title="January 10">01-10</a>&#160;06:18<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span>

<li><b>Delete</b> - This page was created on the assumption that no overarching page existed for metal music as a whole, when one already does: <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">Heavy metal music</a>. Consequently the metal music page is highly redundant, not only repeating information from the Heavy metal music page, but also from the list of metal genres. Also, Metal music is of an inferior quality (for which it has been tagged) and is filled with POV statements. In comparison, the heavy metal music page has been a featured article and properly referenced. Current attempts to edit both pages in accordance with opinions that "heavy metal" is no longer widely used to describe the genre as a whole have not yet been adequately argued with sources and also threaten to dillute the quality of the heavy metal music page. Thus I suggest either a full deletion of the page or a merger with <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">Heavy metal music</a> WesleyDodds 04:10, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I created that page because nowadays there is a distinction about <i>Metal</i>, which is an umbrella term to define all Metal music, and the genre <i>Heavy Metal</i>, that today is referred to that particular type of Metal music played in the late '70 by bands like Black Sabbath and so on. My intentions was not to feature POV statements, but to give the best definition about the Metal style of music and about what makes Metal as we know. The Heavy Metal page feature a lot of information about history of Metal and so on, but lacks of a true definition on what is Metal music, what renders <i>Metal</i> a song. --<a href="../../../o/l/p/User%7EOlpus_10fc.html" title="User:Olpus">Olpus</a> 02:44, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you disagree with it, edit it in order to make it of better quality. But <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">heavy metal music</a> is intended to and is constructed in its present form to address <i>all</i> forms of metal as a whole. The problem with the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_music.html" title="Metal music">Metal music</a> page is that (as Oplus stated) is he wanted to indictate a difference between the usage of "heavy metal" and "metal" but he did it from the wrong avenue. While some may use "heavy metal" to talk about a particular subgenre of metal, the article itself does not function that way; consequently the articles continue to addresses the same topic because they address the same purpose, regardless of title. I can understand the desire to separate the form as a whole and what some now view as a distinct subgenre (which is still debatable, mind you, but not really the issue here). But the current approach does not address those issues. If anything, an article for heavy metal as a subgenre should have been created, and there should have been a discussion about renaming the main article, not the creation of another overrarching "metal music" page. The entire approach to the issue is backwards. WesleyDodds 09:48, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Its not been the best or easiest way to do things, agreed. But waste not want not. Whats done is done, and going even further backwards isnt worth it. What we have, is all the things we need, mixed and matched in different articles. Deleting this, deletes one of the needed parts. What im doing at the minute, is sumerrising in my own head, the best way forward in getting the following objectives done:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>An article that lists all the metal genres and references, plus history of metal as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An comphrensive and factual article on Heavy Metal and its place as both a genre and originator of the metal basis, something similar to Rock n Roll's article i would presume.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sorting out the articles as to not lose content, and merge the correct parts of each article with each other, keeping the articles seperate, and removing the overlap.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's still not the best way to do things, since an article already existed to serve the purpose you are trying to achieve. If anything, edit <i>that</i> article. Doing it this way, creating two articles that cover the same subject (just with different titles) and possibly later altering the older article (given the outline above you provided) -- which has been a Featured Article, has been peer reviewed, and is properly referenced to reduce any POV that might be associated with the subject -- in <b>order to narrow its scope</b> is deconstructing the hard work of others who have been working on the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">Heavy metal music</a> page long before any of us came anywhere near it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Wiki Category for the music form is "heavy metal". The heading on the genre template before it was altered was a link to <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">Heavy metal music</a>. Most references on WIkipedia when referring to the umbrella term link to <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">Heavy metal music</a>. This is an inefficient way of accomplishing these goals, and it's wasting a lot of time that could be used more effectively in regards to these pages.</dd>

</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Seriously, it would still be easier to just rename <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">Heavy metal music</a> or have <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_music.html" title="Metal music">Metal music</a> redirect to it. WesleyDodds 11:31, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Featured article or not, it is mostly wrong. A lot of it, is wrong. Sorting out the metal music page, and then merging the two would be good. Merging Heavy Metal into this page, saves the effort of renaming.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>An article also designed to fit the bill, doesnt mean it does. Many times something is reviwed as good, when in fact, it is not good. Yes, the article is well written. Yes, it does about explaining 'some' things well. Problem: Its outdated, wrong, and doesnt fullfill its purpose.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Later on today, or tomorrow, when im in a better frame of mind, i shall merge the Heavy Metal article's accurate parts into the Metal Music article. Then, i will set out on the process of making the Heavy Metal article better.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"Mostly wrong" by whose measure? I can look up all the books listed on the heavy metal music page and fact-check anything I need to. And they use Heavy Metal as an overarching term. Even if information is factually incorrect, it is still citable in order to reference conflicting viewpoints (which is what history is all about in the first place). If you are going to debate accuracy, you <b>need</b> to reference sources for a counter-argument! We really can't rely simply on your POV for reference. It may be right, but we need to be able to check that you are right. WesleyDodds 12:09, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fine when i have more time instead of borrowed scraps of time, i will go find a bunch of websites.

<dd>What do you base that on? Do you know anything about these authors? Ian Christe, for one, certainly comes from the metal culture. Additionally, a degree of critical distance is useful when studying subjects. Sure being in the thick of it all can lead one closer to "the truth", but there is always the potential for personal bias. An outsider's viewpoint helps to put an insiders' viewpoint of "the truth" into a greater critical context. You must factor in to you criticism that just because a number of members in a community hold a tenant as truth does not necessarily make it true.</dd>

I agree this is pointless, as both pages contain good information, whether they merge or stay seperate I do not care though, but it is pointless to even think about deleation until all sides of the argument agree, Ley do you need any help on the rewrite?

Is there anything you would like me to help you on, as I do not want to make any futher changes, unless they are lost during your rewrite. NykylaiHellray 1:19PM 10 Jan 2006</p>

<dd>I have the rewrite in a text document. Im doing it as a step by step, as im doing Nu Metal. Its in about 4 different documents actually, as i need to keep juggling things about so they are in subsequent order, and in the right place, as well as rewrite a lot of parts.

The Heavy Metal article was started before many of us even registered to wikipedia, it was meant to be the article describing the music we call Heavy Metal or simply Metal in general. It do not try to explain every and each subgenre of (heavy) metal, one of it is "Heavy Metal" (as a strict term meaning the bands that started this musical style). Heavy Metal has a dual meaning, one of them a synonym to Metal. This article was a featured article on wikipedia and is considered a high quality article as such. It is a shame trying to enforce this difference of Metal and Heavy Metal by destroying the hard-work spent by fellow wikipedians on the Heavy Metal articl just because some people think this difference is worth this debate! <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 13:08, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Its not anyone trying to force a difference when the difference has existed almost a decade. Hence such terms as Metalhead, Metal Bands, Metal Music, Metalfests - If, by your reconing, it would beHeavy Metalhead, Heavy Metal Bands, Heavy Metal Music and Heavy Metalfests.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, by that defination, we would have such things as Punk Rock N Roll, Gothic Rock N Roll, Alternative Rock N Roll, Death Rock N Roll, so on, so forth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The usage of it was the same as Rock N Roll, and its no longer a double meaning. Yes, people with little knowledge of the metal scene, commonly refer to it as Heavy Metal sometimes, depending on generation. Most people however, call it Metal. The same as most people who arent big on it, use 'Rarrgghhh' as an insult to music with distorted vocals, regardless of genre.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That is the way things are. Heavy Metal Music = Heavy Metal. The same as Rock N Roll Music = Rock N Roll. Not all forms of metal are Heavy Metal, mainly because they lack core features of Heavy Metal, which, if you read the article, is explained. Also, ive seen featured articles, that get considered featured, when they have little to no accuracy about them. Remember, that the FA council, normally has little to no knowledge of the subject of an article, and reads it in the same way as i write, in the form of someone who knows nothing about the subject matter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>An article being well written, doesnt mean its factual, accurate or correct. Using FA as a veil to hide behind doesnt work, not with someone who will quite happily point out the flaws in the veil.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I dont wish to keep arguing this, and yes a merger is taking place. The talk page is currently discussing 'how' to do it, in a manner that suits 'all' the editors of the page. So instead of going 'this needs doing, that needs doing, and the other needs doing', how about doing something constructive towards helping the discussion of how we go about it to achieve the best results, without losing information, factual accuracy, or prose. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 15:03, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> because I agree with Leyasu that heavy metal is a subgenre of metal, which encompasses much more than heavy metal, such as <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphonic_metal.html" title="Symphonic metal">symphonic metal</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/_/Nu_metal.html" title="Nu metal">nu metal</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_metal.html" title="Power metal">power metal</a>. I can understand the viewpoint that the article on <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">heavy metal music</a> includes information not really appropriate for the article if taken as a subgenre, however this does not support an argument to delete <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_music.html" title="Metal music">metal music</a>; instead, this just shows that there is work to be done. --<a href="../../../q/i/r/User%7EQirex_bef6.html" title="User:Qirex">Qirex</a> 09:57, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I dont read magazines, dont have a video player, and dont buy anything other than books by Graham Masterson and Shaun Hutson. Yes, what you said is true. But again, experts in the subject are normally right, even when biased.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For instance, a group of outsiders to rocket science could tell several rocket scientists that they are wrong about how to build a rocket. The rocket scientists devoloped how to builed a rocket, have built rockets, and studied the subject intensely. They are bound to be correct.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Its worth mentioning that some people still refer to Metal as Heavy Metal music, sure, i wouldnt say it was foolish to point that out, but it is now Metal Music. Thats what it is. NPOV records all POV, yes. But it also lends to fact being the way things are, and then alternative POV on things, such as the smaller group that still calls things by its old name. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 13:46, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Most of the informed people don't even use it at all.

<p><b>Keep</b> 82,789 registered users at DemocraticUnderground.com would find this a meaningful description. I think the way to get out of the political quagmire is not to determine which side is right, but to rise above the issue. I applaud Wikipedia's attempt to civilize this discussion. Good luck with that. The White Rose Society is a part of the fabric of today's world. To choose not to like it is fine. To censor it, proves many of the points made by those the website features. --Tigress DEM 04:37, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For the conspiracy theorists out there. I'm not a sock puppet. Had to look that up. And I made a novice mistake. I copied a previous post because all the html formatting made me think I had to have a text descriptor. I thought 'nondomesticspying' was 'nondomestictyping' and needed to complete a format loop.

<p><s>*<b>Delete</b> . I don't think this article has useful purpose. Wikipedia should strive to remain an encyclopedia on par with other well-known references. Putting up an entry to serve as a portal amounts to turning Wikipedia into a directed google search. I would be inclined to keep this article if there were some educational merit to the content, but currently it reads as an advertisement for another website. What's next, an article for cheaptickets.com extolling it as place for bargain airline fares? While I'm sure The White Rose Society website serves a large user base that enjoys what is has to offer, I don't think that neccesitates a need for an entry. Wikipedia is not a place to advertise your favorite website. Also, currently <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=364x98575" class="external text" title="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=364x98575" rel="nofollow">DU</a> has been called on to "DU" this site so expect to be flooded with keeps.

<dd>I agree it's a marginal case for retention, but I think the thing that swings it into the "keep" column is the fact that it is an archive, a resource, rather than simply a soapbox that endlessly editorialises. Although liberals might find its content more palatable, the site is potentially useful to everyone with an interest in politics or broacasting, as would a similar conservative site.

<dd>Well, I agree the White Rose Society Website might be useful to people interested in politics. But there are plenty of useful resources out there on the web -- does Wiki really need to link them all? I mean, could you explain why the Wiki entry is useful, as it merely links the site? I look at it like this: anyone interested in The White Rose Society website already knows it exists and can easily find it. If someone were to search Wiki for it "The White Rose Society Website" they'd come up with an article that links to thate site. So who exactly is that article for? -m00</dd>

<dd>The poor quality of the wiki entry is an argument for improving the wiki entry, not deleting it. I think that this entry, Ben Burch's own entry, and several other entries in the same "genre" such as those for DU, CU and William Rivers Pitt, are very inadequate, probably as a result of coordinated edit campaigns by both sides.

<dd>Well, then write some useful content! As it stands, the entry is totally useless, and adds absolutely zero to Wikipedia. It's just a link. If someone wants to add content where I could see a case that the article might possibly be of use to someone, I'll change my vote. And you are correct these topics end up being biased due to edit wars. Maybe we need to merge CU, DU, Will Pitt, and everything that's basically two warring Internet factions into a single article called "political activism on the Internet." I'd be for that, since I agree this is getting out of hand! -m00</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The website in question, White Rose Society, is a very useful archive of radio talk shows. If a user hear would like to hear more from such personalities as Randi Rhodes, Mike Malloy, and others, they can go to the website. While I personally believe the website needs a face lift, I am supportive of it being mentioned on Wikipedia. Frankly, I enjoy coming to this site because it leads to websites AND information I had previously been unfamiliar with. One such website that I found via Wikipedia is the White Rose Society. I HIGHLY recommend that the article remain. Getting rid of the article stinks of book-burning. User:JeBousley

<li><b>Comment:</b> I do find it disappointing that some of the decisions here are being made due to personal political affiliations and motivations, and what really should be under observation is the article's merit as an encyclopedic entry. It is my impression that this website is an archive of other radio shows, so does that in itself make it noteworthy enough for an article in the Wikipedia? I, personally, think not. While many of the original radio programs were created by notable people, and featured on notable radio stations, I do not think an archive of those radio shows in itself makes a website notable. Regarding "website notability guidelines", yes, they are "just guidelines", but many Wikipedia users consider these guidelines useful for personally determining the notability of a website. Alexa gives the site a ranking of 181,810 <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.whiterosesociety.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.whiterosesociety.org/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. Now, if articles were created for all of the websites that have higher rankings that the whiterosesociety.org, assuming they have not yet been created and using the article count as of now from the English Wikipedia (912,698), websites would take up nearly 20% of the Wikipedia. It should be noted that "the Wikipedia is not infinite", nor is it an Internet directory. Personally, I do not like how Alexa works, but for lack of a better ranking system, it is what we tend to use. Another way of establishing notability (at least for forum websites), is to check the number of forum users. Currently, the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Underground_d747.html" title="Democratic Underground">Democratic Underground</a> has 82,820 registered users, which does make it notable in my eyes, and deserves its Wikipedia entry. (While not an entirely fair assessment since WRS is not primarily a forum community) the WRS society forum has 510 registered users (short of a generally accepted guideline of 5000 registered users). Please remember: deletion of the article does not mean the end of "the White Rose Society (website)". If the article is deleted, there is always the possibility that in the future the WRS will do something notable enough to warrant re-creation of the article and expansion. Now, if this website has made any other notable contributions to society, acheivements, or accomplishments, please say so and post related evidence, since everyone here still reserves the right to change their personal decsions at any time. Thanks for reading.&#160;— <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKMan_941b.html" title="User:TheKMan"><b><font color="#0000FF">The</font><font color="#FF0000">KMan</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKMan_98f4.html" title="User talk:TheKMan"><font color="#000000"><sup><u>talk</u></sup></font></a> 21:27, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>KMan... My argument against Alexa is that is basically CANNOT measure a site such as White Rose. It can only measure a site that people visit to read the pages. Since White Rose has become primarily a podcasting site, and Alexa misses ALL of that traffic, it doesn't bear any resemblance to the traffic to the site at all! And trust me, I have looked at this before while attempting to work on the visibility of the site, and decided it was close to worthless. Basically, if a totally unscientific measurement is good enough for you, that is up to you, but expect much more difficulty with such things in the future if you continue to use the work of a spyware vendor as a means of assessing the importance of a multimedia web entity. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 21:41, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Correct, Alexa measures website traffic. Now, it is my understanding that the podcasting content that is archived on your website does not require a user to visit to your website, but this content was not actually created by the WRS. I am examining the notability of The White Rose Society (website), the website, not the notable content of others that it archives. Does the website make any notable contributions of its own? — <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKMan_941b.html" title="User:TheKMan"><b><font color="#0000FF">The</font><font color="#FF0000">KMan</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKMan_98f4.html" title="User talk:TheKMan"><font color="#000000"><sup><u>talk</u></sup></font></a> 21:54, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, created? Yes, some of the material was created by broadcasters who were given program development grants by WRS, and all of it was recorded, compressed, and archived by WRS. This involves four dedicated recording machines, not an insignificant task. (You try to do it.) And obtaining the rights to provide this material to the Internet public was a major effort in some cases. Also, in the case of the Thom Hartmann program, I pay big bucks in royalty payments for sole Internet archiving rights to the material. Basically, is the publisher who publishes Steven King's novels notable? I am an Internet-age publishing house. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 22:54, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Comment - Honestly, though I believe this is an appropriate Wikipedia entry, I didn't create it, and I don't care what gets done with this; I think it is nice to be in Wiki and all, but I wouldn't have even questioned this except for the fact that the motivation of so many seems to be political, and that offends me. But, as others have pointed out, having a White Rose external link on the page for each of the show hosts would be the only advertising that would make any difference, anyway! Nobody is going to come here and type in White Rose Society (website) who did not already know that it existed! Besides, I foresee a constant barrage of vandalism... <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 01:55, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>merge</b> into <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a>] DTC makes a good point, but the problem is the way in which <i>Stalinist</i> as a label is itself a shifting, uncertain, and historically determinative one. For example, it is used disparagingly post-56 (Khrushchev Secret Speech) to justify purges (Beria was a Stalinist); for collective identification (47-53) in Eastern Europe as part of the Soviet bloc integration, as well as later on a contradistinction to Titoism; as a label for different splits within different communist movements as well as their leaders, each with their own post-56, pre-56, as well as *sigh* post-37, pre-37 significations (esp. France); as a badge of identity in the Spanish Civil War, both as a ready-made identity against anarchism and anarcho-socialism, as well as Trostkyism; as a label of attack both in 1956 and 1968 (Prague), and again in 1991 following the coup-attempt in Russia; and most recently in the last Russian elections, and I am sure I am missing a bunch of additional significances. So what, I ask, is a Stalinist? And who gets to decide which of these many options counts and which do not? <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 05:06, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> As DTC says, we have other unverifiable uncited POV lists, that doesn't mean we should keep this one. By personalising it as Stalinists rather than, say, Communists or Marxixts, this is simply an attack page. Also, it contains no actual ancyclopaedic content: there is no context regarding why each of the listed has been called a Stalinist, or indeed by whom (self-identification is not, after all a terribly reliable guide here), or how often, or in what media. Most of all, when the <i>sixty</i> contentious entries were removed, what was left was 17 more-or-less statist political leaders and a couple of hangers-on, one of whom repudiated the claim in later life.

A - probably big enough to justify its being split into more than one article. Surely no one disagrees with that.

<li>I usually agree with Malthusian, but in this case I am on the opposite side of the fence.

If the <a href="../../../e/l/d/Elder_Scrolls_da19.html" title="Elder Scrolls">Elder Scrolls</a> article is too long to accommodate this, then it should be trimmed (I mean it <i>IS</i> just a video game) to allow this type of content to be domesticated. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 15:55, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

This article is so well-written I thought it might be a copyvio, but some key phrases don't Google as exact phrases. If everything in it were sourced, I'd vote "keep" on the grounds that I find it interesting and it's long enough to stand on its own as a separate article. Unfortunately, at present almost nothing in it is properly sourced or verifiable, so I see almost nothing in it to "salvage." Too bad, as the incidents in it ring true, are probably accurate, and would be worth keeping if sourced. Will change my vote if the article is greatly improved before expiration of AfD.

<p>Does lack of fame make a vanity article?</p>
<p>An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia. Borderline cases are frequently nominated for deletion and discussed on WP:AFD. Lack of fame is not the same as vanity. (OFFICAL WIKIPEDIA EXPLANATION)</p>
<p>There you have it! It is not vanity - just lack of fame!!!</p>

<p>This band was marked for speedy deletion as a non-notable band, but the article's author makes an assertion of notability on the talk page (and there are a few assertions of possible notability in the article text), so I have moved it here to AFD. —<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 12:56, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I did some research on this last night, and they seem notable enough so that speedy delete is perhaps too harsh. However, IconDevelopment (the label they recently signed with) doesn't seem to be important enough to count as <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria, and they don't really meet any of the other requirements, unless they're popular enough to merit enough demand for an article. <font face="futura"><a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnurks_9a10.html" title="User:Snurks">Snurks</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/n/u/User_talk%7ESnurks_2400.html" title="User talk:Snurks">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snurks_439e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snurks">C</a></sup></small></font> 21:36, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - 'Icon Development' is starting up as a label/distributor/promoting agency, and does not have many noticeable bands in their "portfolio". That doesn't change the fact that the band is known in the "underground" Metal scene, and all over the world, especially in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're striving to get more "successful" and I think our hard work will compensate in a few years. We hope that our new EP will help on making us more "notable". And again, if u compare FMC to Hand Fated (in their "website" no news since 2000), why r they more noticeable? Why does HF have a Wiki and FMC doesn't? It seems to me that it's not fair...And btw, Moonspell is great, I love them, but not the only Heavy Metal band in Portugal...</p>
<p>Tnx to Snurks for the support also. Cheers!</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Ok, I agree we aren't that notable, but can someone explain to me where's the notability in the band Hand Fated? And they r at Wiki since April 2005...</li>
</ul>
<p>So why their article is not purposed for delete also? I just wanna a fair chance and equal rights, if someone could explain why HF is more notable than FMC I would appreciate and repent (lol)... I've done my best to assert our notability, I realize it's not enough...I understand what u do here in Wiki, I honestly do understand that we r not notable enough to be in a Enciclopedia, but I found other band even less notable (IMO) than us...and seems no one cares about their "notability", and even I that live near the place were they (suposedly) play, never heard of them before...and I get around in music since 1993/4 I've seen also some 'stubs' and vanity articles and I've tried not to do one... Cheers! --ThunderDrum 10:47, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. According to the article the band is notable enough. Unfortunately, article seems to have been created and maintained by a member of the band, so it's nothing but a serious <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> violation. ThunderDrum, think of it this way: your band is notable enough when someone else writes the article. Writing one yourself is the worst you can do. (By the way, next time you see less-notable bands, nominate them for deletion. Just because an article exists, doesn't mean it's worth it.) -- Parasti 22:47, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Parasti u r absolutely correct, I understand your POV...</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll wait until someone writes it again...Cheers! --ThunderDrum 19:12, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, yes, clearly it's not a real party but rather more of an art project. I believe this is quite apparent from the statement made in the article: "The Brown Party of Canada is not a registered fringe party. Voting for The Brown Party of Canada will spoil your ballot."</p>
<p>It does, at the very least, exist semiotically. That must count for something, no?</p>
<p>I should add, that if you want to get rid of this entry you'll be required to apply the same logic to the article for the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Extreme_Wrestling_Party_0289.html" title="Canadian Extreme Wrestling Party">Canadian Extreme Wrestling Party</a>, which does have an entry.

<p>I nominated for these reasons - 1. The subject is not notable. Presidency of a student club, young employee of a bank seems to be his only claims to fame. 2. The article appears to have been created to allow (or at least has served the purpose of) the publication of potentially libellous claims about subject, perhaps by a rival at work (the person who attempted to introduce said claims was called "Morganstanman" and he claims to work at same place as subject. 3. Much of information (which I deleted) which made up the article consisted of total speculation about the subject's future role in British politics despite no indication that he is currently or has ever been involved in politics other than as President of a student debating society.</p>

<li>Did you even read the vanity page you cited: <b>"people such as college professors or actors may be individually important in society." — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-3 17:10</small></b></li>
<li>As for the CSD you cite, that is a confusion of the criterion: it is referring to articles that simply talk about a person in a non-important way, such as "Bob Jones was born in 1990. He currently lives in Los Angeles, California, and attends the local high school." Now if it said, "Bob Jones was the boy stuck in a well for 6 weeks in 2001. He currently lives in Los Angeles, California", then the article asserts importance. As for vanity, that refers to articles that are written in a highly positive tone, such as if the article was written by its own subject. Vanity is pretty easy to spot, and this article is definitely not vanity. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-3 17:12</small>

<li>The irony is that this article was originally about a different Paul Crowley, the one who writes about Shakespeare. When I challeneged that person's notability, someone Googled for "Paul Crowley" and added information about this other Paul Crowley. When I pointed out the confusion, information about the first one was deleted, leaving only the information about the second. You may draw your own conclusions about what this says about the notability of either party. — <a href="../../../c/i/p/User%7ECiphergoth_5225.html" title="User:Ciphergoth">ciphergoth</a> 08:50, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The Show existed theres no doubt of that, Australians know that however its not notable enough to be a wikipedia article really has no interest maybe on a list of Australian shows but not its own article especially seeing as how short it is. There could be a article written about the American version with a short part about the Australian version however the Australian version alone does not qualify for its own article. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbeckham_9c82.html" title="User:Michaelbeckham">Mike</a> 05:04, 11 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: If the show actually existed, and was broadcast on a major Australian TV network, it seems hard to imagine that it was not notable enough to warrant an article, even if it did not last long. Minor Australian TV shows are not less notable than minor US ones, and we have articles on minor US shows like <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Network_Stars_6fd7.html" title="Battle of the Network Stars">Battle of the Network Stars</a></i>; see also <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>. I'm in no position to confirm that the show actually aired, other than the fact that it appeared to be confirmed by the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Ferguson_0a41.html" title="Tim Ferguson">Tim Ferguson</a> article. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 12:53, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Unless you know anything about this show and/or live in Australia now or during that perioud I dont think your fit to comment on "whether it existed" it did exist however is not notable as most people (australians) dont know about the show as it was on for such a short period a while ago. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbeckham_9c82.html" title="User:Michaelbeckham">Mike</a> 03:04, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>History first. This article began as a section in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio_20a5.html#Districts_and_communities" title="San Antonio">San Antonio</a> (SA) article. At one point a large amount of information was added to the section, greatly increasing it's size. The section was then broken out into it's own article to bring the size of the SA article back under control. Then, it was discovered that all the extra text was a copyright vio, and the text was removed, bringing the article's size way back down. The remaining small amount of text was then copied back into the main SA article, where it now exists.</p>
<p>End result, the reason this article was created no longer applies, and the contents of the article are duplicated in the main SA article.</p>
<p>So I see no real reason for this separate article to remain at this time, though I could see it's recreation at a future date if the section in the main article were to grow again. <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 16:00, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

You might find it to be nonsense, but in Manhasset High School, barely anyone can be asked "Who is Invader Tim" and have no response. The Invasion is widely known by the people, and it should be considered a part of the culture. People know it, people participate, and all events recorded in the entry are true.

<li>I am shocked that you want to delete this page. Ditherals is not widely used by the mainstream media, but is much more commonly used in regular speach and very common in political blogs <i>especially in this election season</i>. If someone is reading a blog, and comes accross Ditherals, they should be able to go to Wikipedia to look it up. Why delete it? I strongly object to the deletion request. There is no "common usage" criteria in Wikipedia's deletion protocol.
<ul>
<li>There most certainly <i>is</i> a "common usage" criterion in Wikipedia's deletion protocol; to merit an article, things on here have to be (a) verifiable, (b) notable, (c) encyclopedic, <i>and</i> (d) neutral and unbiased. This is none of the above. Consider it <b>speedied</b>. And before you make the accusation I <i>know</i> you're just itching to make, I am <i>not</i> a <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_1b0c.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada">Liberal Party of Canada</a> member, supporter or voter. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:32, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I protest and repeat that there is no common usage criterion in Wikipedia's deletion protocol. A word does not have to be in common usage to be (a) verifiable, (b) notable, (c) encyclopedic. There hare thousands of Wikipedia entries in <i>uncommon usage</i> that are all verifiable, notable and encyclopedic. The definition was not written in a baised manner. You have deleted the page without 'Wikipedia community consensus' and in violation of Wikipedia's deletion protocol which requires community consensus. Please revive the page to aviod going throught the deletion review process. <i>Readers of Canadian Poltics blogs are coming accross the word Ditherals every day.</i> Lastly, you accuse me of "itching to make the accusation that you are a member of the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_1b0c.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada">Liberal Party of Canada</a>" without justification and I request that you retract that statement. -Palmerston <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmerston_5643.html" title="User:Palmerston">Palmerston</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmerston_34e3.html" title="User talk:Palmerston">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Palmerston_1b6d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Palmerston">contribs</a>) 11:43, 11 January 2006 (UTC-5)</small></li>

<p>Vanity - not factual - of no interest Optime 17:25, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Carrying on from discussion:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Any link from that list that might be seen as commercial, you're free to edit them out. A discography for an artist is not "of no interest". The blog one, sure, it's arguably personal, but i'd be surprised to see a blog link being deleted from Trent Reznor's page for instance. Bias.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When biographical information is central to the subject matter, i'd reckon it's relevant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The page is not a personal tribute. I can do that on my own site thanks much, and i have. It is meant to be an explanation of sunjammer the musician. Bands *are represented on wikipedia*. Deal with it. For instance, <a href="../../../s/y/s/System_of_a_down.html" title="System of a down">system of a down</a> or <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_inch_nails.html" title="Nine inch nails">nine inch nails</a>, both more elaborate than the Sunjammer entry by far. Why? Because you argue more have interest in them because it is a broader subject matter? Your argument falls flat. Bias.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Empty of interest to anyone" is a pretty bold claim. Empty of interest to YOU perhaps, but considering the amount of shows Sunjammer has played, to fair critical acclaim (being compared with artists such as <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venetian_Snares_33ac.html" title="Venetian Snares">Venetian Snares</a> for instance, who i might add also has a more detailed page).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then, your first statement is riddled with bias. "Notable" wasn't even added by me, but by DragonFly in the first revision. Check the rev history before bringing up specifics. Stating i am not an artist is ignorance. I am a musician with a fair history of shows, releases and backing the scenes i've been a part of. I am as much an artist as the aforementioned Venetian Snares, and as such i am entitled to an entry for the project. Your personal bias belongs elsewhere.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'll make another revision taking heed to the issues you have brought up, much like i'd appreciate it if you also did, rather than vandalize and delete the contents. If Sunjammer is of no interest, what of Knifehandchop? This entire argument smacks of personal bias.</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't take it personally if this didn't seem like an openly personal attack.

<dd>You're quite tenuous, considering you've left represented artists with NO releases at all out of the equation, this in addition to your personal insults leads me to believe you have an agenda. On the notability subject:</dd>
<dd>"Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability." - Sunjammer is along with Petrochemical the *only* norwegian export of gabba and hardcore techno.</dd>
<dd>"Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network." - Playlists for NRK P3 can be found here: <a href="http://www2.nrk.no/spillelister/sending.aspx?prog=578&amp;tid=2003-12-30%2022:05:00Z" class="external free" title="http://www2.nrk.no/spillelister/sending.aspx?prog=578&amp;tid=2003-12-30%2022:05:00Z" rel="nofollow">http://www2.nrk.no/spillelister/sending.aspx?prog=578&amp;tid=2003-12-30%2022:05:00Z</a></dd>
<dd>NRK being the national radio network provider for norway.</dd>
<dd>"Is cited in notable and verifiable sources as being influential in style, technique, repertory or teaching in a particular music genre." - How this can be verifiable is beyond me, but have a chat with DJ Producer or Hellfish, or (i'm told) Aphex Twin. Sunjammer is deep underground. It's more about playing shows than releasing records and making money.</dd>
<dd>"Has established a tradition or school in a particular genre." - Established is an open term. I know Sunjammer has inspired an interest in combining classical music with noise and industrial. This is about as verifiable as anything in such a limited scene.</dd>
<dd>I'm not going to fight this anymore, there isn't much more i can say. "Verifiable" quickly becomes me dropping a bunch of links, which doesnt feel worth it because it really is a niche thing. I'm not going to bicker any more. If an admin feels this article is worth deleting in spite of all my argumentation, that's the end of that matter as far as i'm concerned. It does feel like this article has seen unjust attention from people with a personal grudge however (though i consider myself a pretty nice guy, what'd i do wrong hey?); There is far less "relevant" material on wiki at the moment, which leads me to believe verification of the importance of subject matter, in a lot of cases, is limited to a google search.</dd>

<dd><b>keep</b>. It's a list that could be added to (for example, Oprah can be added, as can others). It seems like the people on it are people who are known especially for being heavy for a significant period of time, as opposed to people who are transitorily heavy, like Kate Winslet or Renee Zellweger. Much of other lists - like Feminists or a similar "Notable Obese People" - is POV as well. Raedyke 19:18, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Delete</b>. Inherently POV. No definition of "large." Both Jack Black and Whoopi Goldberg are on the list. I don't think they are "large." And Mao Tse-Tung? I've never heard of him described as "large"! Such a list lends itself to such arguments. It's an opinion list. Not encylopedic. What do you when someone loses weight? If the list were, for example, notable people who have weighed over 300 lbs., that's another thing, but even then there would have to be documentation of the weight and we would have to ascertain that the people are notable. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 19:34, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Ok I have looked at everything I can find. A College is notable, but I am no longer sure this is real. The only hits are to Wikipedia, and to the so called British Accreditation Council, which is not a well known body. I can't find a reference on the (local government) Council web site, nor any student that goes there now or ever went. I think we should delete this as un verified until there is a solid reference that it is real. As mentioned below, they are using Wikipedia on this site as a pseudo endorser for the College. Can anyone tell if the Cherie Blair photo is real or an edit? Oh and it is said to be part of Worldwide Vancover University, a virtual university with no apparent link to Vancover BC.<a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 22:56, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>There seems to be a pattern of gaining from the reflected glory of others here, be it wikipedia, Stephen Timms, or NVSC. What is lacking is any independent verification of his notability. A visit from an MP is interesting, but on its own not enough to verify his status.

<li><b>Don't Care</b>. Calm down, folks. I knew this was going to be deleted, I just wrote it because it's called <i>humor</i>. Common Era is just as ridiculous as "Secular Era" if you think about it, and if you all had your way you likely <b>would</b> make this "secular era" a reality, or at least, create another time era that isn't based on Jesus. Did you even read this section of the article?</li>

<dd>Darwiner, "obvious humor" does not make an article a candidate for speedy deletion, so as things stand we need to keep the article up for a week and let this discussion to proceed to a conclusion. If <i>you</i> were to request that it be deleted I would stretch a point and delete it (CSD G7, though strictly speaking that's only for accidentally created articles). You can make the request here, or you can implicitly make the request by editing the article to remove everything AFTER the line that says "End of AfD message, feel free to edit beyond this point" (you'll only see this line when you edit the page). If you think other people will enjoy the humor, you could copy it to your own user page (the one that says "Darwin rules") first. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:18, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I just got in somewhat of a disagreement with a user in regards to the <a href="../../../l/u/a/Luas.html" title="Luas">Luas</a> smart card. First she wrote an OK article about it, then replaced it with coying and pasting what was on the Luas page to the new article. It is my opinion that to the extent possible that information regarding these smartcards should be kept in the article on the transit system, as your average person looking for information on <i>any</i> aspect of the XYZ bus system, will probably go to XYZ bus system page. In <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_card.html" title="Chicago card">Chicago card</a> case, where lawsuits are involved, and the Chicago Transit article is already large, there is an argument for a searate article. But some of these articles are either redundant with material already in the main article or make more sense merged with the original article. Many of them cross link each other, or all tell similar histories about smart cards. I am wondering if these articles are defended just because it is newfangled technology. If these were tokens would they be even considered for different articles? It is still just they way people pay their fare.--<a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEsprit15d_69ef.html" title="User:Esprit15d">Esprit15d</a> 16:17, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep:</b> I disagree with the deletion nomination, for obvious reasons; being the author of an article will do that. That aside, however, I'd say that it is a relevant article. I quote from what I presume is the relevant section: <i>"Original inventions. If you invent the word frindle or a new type of dance move, it is not article material until a secondary source reports on it."</i> The Toady emerged through hubbub on a high-traffic fanfic site, and has been published on said site in - to my knowledge - at least two independent fics by different authors, not counting my own ones. In my view, this should qualify as "secondary sources", and also rejects the "unpublished fiction" criticism. The verifiability requirement is also satisfied, as the comment threads in which the Toady is discussed are easily available on the SIYE website.<br />
I also refer you to the article on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thestral.html" title="Thestral">Thestrals</a>, which is in itself an original invention, albeit by a published author. Its main use by secondary sources is, of course, in Harry Potter fanfics. The fact that there have been no moves to delete this article suggests to me that similar articles are equally permissible.<br />
Supporting evidence of fanfics and pure-fanon inventions being permitted include <a href="../../../d/r/a/Draco_Dormiens_b356.html" title="Draco Dormiens">Draco Dormiens</a> and The Tale Of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westala_and_Villtin_e0b4.html" title="Westala and Villtin">Westala and Villtin</a>.<br />
If the motion to delete is carried, I request a 48-hour delay (on grounds of imminent travel) to allow me to comment on any counter-arguments and save a backup of the article on my home computer.<br />

<dd><b>Comment</b>:Thanks for taking the time to come by and discuss this. I'm not sure that the precedents you cite are applicable in this case, in that they apply to specific works of fanfiction, rather than specific aspects of those individual works. It's also worth noting that The Very Secret Diaries (the redirect destination of Draco Dormiens) was nominated for AFD once (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Very_Secret_Diaries" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Very_Secret_Diaries" rel="nofollow">link</a>) and closed with a 50/50 keep/delete split, and that many of the keep votes did so with the claim that it represented a "notable internet meme", a claim that probably would not apply to Burundian Kowtowing Toady. It is also unlikely that individual fanfiction stories would qualify as secondary sources, in that they are not themselves independent analyses of the Burundian Kowtowing Toady, or historical/media accounts of its creation. Rather, they are additional examples of primary sources.-<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 19:57, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Two comments on this; in what way is an article about a single fanfic more eligible than an article about a single fanfic construct being used by multiple authors in multiple fics?<br />
Secondly, as far as the other fics go, it's a bit hazy whether they're primary or secondary sources; parts have fed into the construction of the Toady, parts have featured the Toady based on its appearance in the original discussion thread, and there have even been a few meta references directly referencing its creation. Not sure if that has any bearing on it, just thought I'd fling that out there.<br />

<li>From the Fancruft page: <i>"Well-referenced and well-written articles on obscure topics are from time to time deleted as well, but such deletions are highly controversial. It is also worth noting that many articles on relatively obscure topics are featured articles.

Original research does not apply, as the article documents the creature's inception over some time, including use <i>prior to my own</i> in several fanfics.<br />

<dd>Sometimes when we get an article that's of value but not really encyclopedic, we decide to move it to a different wiki project, either affiliated with us or completely independent but with a compatible license. Dictionary definitions go to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a>, how-to articles go to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a>, non-notable webcomics go to Comixpedia, etc. This process is called transwikiing, and I was asking whether anybody knows of a wikiproject for stock fiction resources, since your article might be a good fit for such a project, if there is one. "<a href="../../../d/e/r/Derivative_work.html" title="Derivative work">Derivative work</a>" is a legal term, which basically just means a creative project that incorporates aspects of some other preceding project, like a hip-hop producer who uses samples in a song or a cartoonist who draws a picture of the Mona Lisa sticking her tongue out. A Harry Potter fanfiction is a derivative work, since it uses characters and settings devised by <a href="../../../j/2E/k/J.K._Rowling_a858.html" title="J.K. Rowling">J.K. Rowling</a>. I mentioned it here because a sentence in your article released the Toady for use in derivative works, and I thought that might bolster a claim for a transwiki to the hypothetical source I described earlier. It's not likely to help or hurt your case for Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 14:33, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Was nominated for speedy as hoax, but I'm bringing it to AFD instead as it was nominated earlier and kept. I copy the following from the article talk page: <i>No one seems to have noticed last year, but no one of this name ever played major league baseball (Bruce Sutter is the only Sutter to have done so). Also, Bruce Sutter had no relatives who ever played professional sports;</i> The Sporting News Baseball Register <i>routinely lists any relatives in pro sports for all major leaguers, and the 1988 Register (the last one in which Bruce appeared) listed none for him.

<p>This article is about a valid game developer. if you look on google you will find many articles on this person (over 14 pages of interviews news articles and comments to be exact). All the people posting complaints here is from a coder forum and has a personal problem with clyde. Personal issue should not be taken into account when deleting a post.</p>
<p>The game Control Monger was in many video game magizines (at lest 6 in 4 different countries) and on many game news sites and his game FreeWorld is in the news of many MMORPG websites on a monthly bases. I think if you look into this you will find that Clyde is a notable game designer.</p>

<p>Do not delete - I am surprised that people want to delete this article about Clyde Bielss. I have known Clyde for two years, when I was working as senior editor at Warcry.com. He was at the time involved in his FreeWorld project which had an open beta while they were testing. I was one of the beta testers, and considered FW an enjoyable game and good entertainment for many people. He is currently redoing and upgrading FreeWorld for better graphics and enjoyment of the game. I also know that Clyde has also helped other people in the industry get a start, since he asked me to write articles for these folks and their games in Warcry. I am logged in but not sure how to make my name appear. Anyhow, I am...

<p>how does wikipedia work? I thought this was about sharing and expanding knowledge. I didnt even get a chance to post the facts of Wulph and you are ready to delete it.

<li>This is an encyclopaedia, so we only share and expand knowledge that we know is actually true.

<li>It seems to me the discussion is about those television series not <i>fitting</i> in <i>that</i> category because they reference time travel rather than being about time travel.

<li>I'm going to vote <b>delete</b> here because this is, in the end, a list of <i>arbitrary entertainment medium</i> which has used <i>arbitrary plot device</i> at some point. Time travel is a fairly popular fictional meme, I can see the merit in the category and maybe even in a list of significant fiction which uses time travel as a plot device for one episode (although probably not, to be fair), but the fact that, for example, <i>Blackadder Back and Forth</i> (generally regarded as far and away the worst example of the entire faranchise) relies on time travel really tells us nothing about either time travel as a fictional concept or <i>Blackadder</i> the entertainment phenomenon. I might even have been swayed if this was anything other than a bare list, but as it stands the reader is left to guess in which episode(s) and to what extent, with what significance, exploring which of the multiple plot lines of time travel (causality, comic anachronism, whatever), with what degree of unpredictability (it is more or less inevitable that any sci-fi series will eventually cover this ground) and even how good or bad it was (which in the Blackadder case is: very lame indeed).

<li><b>Do not delete</b>, first, let it be said that contrary to ScienceApologist's accusations <b>I did not create this fork</b>. This stub was a consensus reached decision from a previous discussion on whether or not to include a popular creationist claim regarding the second law of thermodynamics in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_law_of_thermodynamics.html" title="Second law of thermodynamics">second law of thermodynamics Wikipedia entry</a>. It was decided that the issue, being a significant minority view, was nonetheless best put somewhere else and this stub for it was created. See for instance <a href="../../../s/e/c/Talk%7ESecond_law_of_thermodynamics_5a68.html#Mediation" title="Talk:Second law of thermodynamics">this mediation section</a> and especially the end of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Talk%7ESecond_law_of_thermodynamics_creationism_d827.html#Comment" title="Talk:Second law of thermodynamics/creationism">this section</a>. The link BTW ScienceApologist is referring to is owned by me <b>but it is not a personal web page</b> (i.e. it is not <i>about</i> me, it is about science, philosphy etc. and contains no actual <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">vanity content</a>). It is also not original research, as it consists of more than a dozen verifiable citations. I have had a dispute with ScienceApologist before, and he is now trying to remove web pages of mine both here and from the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontological_argument.html" title="Ontological argument">ontological argument</a> section. I didn't actually put the link there (some other user did, apparently finding the page useful) but ScienceApologist wants it removed nonetheless.

<li><b>Keep</b> I created this page, not tisthammerw, as a solution to a very extended discussion on <a href="../../../s/e/c/Talk%7ESecond_law_of_thermodynamics_5a68.html" title="Talk:Second law of thermodynamics">Talk:Second_law_of_thermodynamics</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Talk%7ESecond_law_of_thermodynamics_creationism_d827.html" title="Talk:Second law of thermodynamics/creationism">Talk:Second_law_of_thermodynamics/creationism</a>, following the direct suggestion of the appointed WP mediator to that discussion. The joint feeling in that discussion was that a detailed treatment of this pseudoscience topic was not appropriate for a frontline physics article. Therefore this page was created to allow a detailed examination of the history, sociology and whatever else for this topic here, rather than in <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Law_of_Thermodynamics_723b.html" title="Second Law of Thermodynamics">Second Law of Thermodynamics</a>. The article is clearly flagged as a stub, because to start it I merely cut and pasted the material that had previously been on the Second Law of Thermodynamics page -- which putting here allowed us to remove from there. A detailed treatment of this topic is by consensus not appropriate for <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Law_of_Thermodynamics_723b.html" title="Second Law of Thermodynamics">Second Law of Thermodynamics</a>, not appropriate for <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entropy.html" title="Entropy">entropy</a>, so it is ++useful for those articles to have this article that they can hand the discussion off to (including links, references, etc). Of course, at the moment the article is just a stub; but I very much doubt it will stay so short for very long(!). Like any other article on WP, the contents of this article are up for editing and change -- I'm not going to make any defence for or against tisthammerw's link. But the bottom line is this: having this separate article here in WP's namespace <i>is</i> useful, and has helped resolve a lengthy discussion elsewhere, so please don't delete it. -- <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheald_bb56.html" title="User:Jheald">Jheald</a> 23:58, 10 January 2006 (UTC).</li>

<dd>Given creationists never-ending litany of objections to evolution that cover such fields as physics, chemistry, cosmology, biology, mathematics, philosophy, theology, geology, paleontology, archaeology, etc., if we allow this article to stay, we'll need articles on such diverse topics as "Dendrochronology is suspect because two or more rings can grow per year", Light moths increased before trees got lighter", "Dinosaurs may still be alive in the Congo", "There is not enough helium in the atmosphere for an old earth", etc. But, having said all of that, I'm not going to vote because I had some involvement in the genesis of this page.

<dd>My point has always been that creationism objections to scientific viewpoints do not belong in every single article about a topic that they object about. I have to agree that making a new article is not reasonable for each topic's controversy, and that it should be in creationism, however I'm beginning to think that the article on creationism is hopelessly bogged down with comparisons between it and science. Maybe there should just be one big article similar to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_science.html" title="Religion and science">religion and science</a> or something like that? I suppose I am <b>delete</b> but for <b>relocation</b>. This stuff needs a home. I think <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> would be better if it talked about <i>creationism</i> instead of objections to scientific evidence and theories, and that the articles on scientific evidence and theories would be better if they were similarly limited in scope. Call me a reductionist, I guess. There are plenty of things in the Bible that do not have to do with creationism and yet violate the scientifically accepted laws of physics. --<a href="../../../i/g/n/User%7EIgnignot_131a.html" title="User:Ignignot">Ignignot</a> 21:17, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article could be expanded to include arguments against evolution, and geological time, dating back all the way to <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelvin.html" title="Kelvin">Kelvin</a>. Kelvin argued (before the discovery of radioactivity) that the earth was too warm to be as old as geologists claimed and Darwin's theory required; when he presented his argument for a max age of 20,000,000 years (which was solid, if you don't take into account the heating due to radioactivity) in a popular form (MacMillan's Magazine, volume 5, 1862,pp. 288-293), it was in the context of the recent publication Origin. And in 1872, he presented a short essay on the origin of life, based similarly on thermodynamic arguments; after an invocation of the "solid and irrefragable argument" of Paley's Natural Theology, he concluded,: "...overwhelmingly strong proofs of intelligent and benevolent design lie all around us; and if ever perplexities, whether metaphysical or scientific, turn us away from them from a time, they come back upon us with irresistable force, showing to us through Nature the influence of free will, and teaching us that all living things depend on one ever-acting Creator and Ruler." (Report of the Forty-First Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Edinburgh, August 1871, pp lxxxiv-cv)--<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 04:14, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whilst Kelvin's calculations was important to establishing the ancient <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_the_earth.html" title="Age of the earth">age of the earth</a>, (given the radioactivity issue which when discovered pushed it back further), that is not how modern YEC creationists ("<a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_scientists.html" title="Creation scientists">creation scientists</a>") use the term. The more modern "sophisticated" IDists don't use 2LOT because it is <i>so dumb</i>. Kelvin recognised the importance of evidence over scripture and recognised evolution but with "divine guidance" <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_1.html" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. But the thermodynamics and the age of the earth is a different to creationism and the second law of thermodynamics, and is therefore OT. — <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 11:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And yet, strictly speaking, Kelvin did make the connection between his work based on the 2LOT and creationism, broadly defined. I'm not saying it's the same thing as modern YEC invocations of it, but it fits the title and potential content of the article; there is enough history of 2LOT-based arguments related to creationism, from both a geological and biological perspective, that the article could contain significant content in the future. The article is potentially broader than just "YEC creationism and the 2LOT applied to biology". And even for just recent arguments, the article has a lot more potential content, including arguments that the 2LOT didn't operate until the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_of_Man_58ca.html" title="Fall of Man">Fall of Man</a>, and a more extensive treatment of the detailed arguments and criticism. As Banno argues, we can't just relegate everything to do with creationism to the controversy article. 2LOT arguments are extensive enough (and different enough from other aspects of creation-evolution) to merit the existence of this article. The creation-evolution article is largely not about the details of the intellectual arguments in the debate, but about the nature of and participants in it. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 05:08, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why is this band non-notable? I am a fan and I run their website, I feel they are very notable. Any music group in commerce can be considered notable. If you feel they have not gained a level of success to be added to this medium I will agree with your choice, and complain about "wikipedia" for the rest of my life. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Drgonzo1978 (<a href="../../../d/r/g/User_talk%7EDrgonzo1978_2f13.html" title="User talk:Drgonzo1978">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Drgonzo1978_fa99.html" title="Special:Contributions/Drgonzo1978">contribs</a>)  20:40, 3 January 2006.</small></li>

<p>This article has apparently been used as a battleground between supporters of two rival rabbis, resulting in cases of blanking and complete replacement of the article. In both cases, the entry is very problematic. <b>The current version</b> refers to a small town in <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galicia.html" title="Galicia">Galicia</a>. No data is provided and the name looks misspelled. Google only comes up with family names. Given the context of the other version, it must refer to a location in the province located in Poland / Ukraine, but that's not even indicated, and Spain has a region of the same name. Again, the name "Kartshin" looks like is a misspelling / <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglicisation.html" title="Anglicisation">anglicisation</a> (it is definitely not correct Polish, but I have no knowledge of Ukrainian.) <b>The old version</b> was an article about one of the two rival rabbis. Problem I: both persons already have an article, see <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Zion_Halberstam_%28The_Second%29_f048.html" title="Ben Zion Halberstam (The Second)">Ben Zion Halberstam (The Second)</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mordecai_David_Unger_25e7.html" title="Mordecai David Unger">Mordecai David Unger</a>, and so has the object of the dispute <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobov_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_3422.html" title="Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)">Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)</a>. Problem II: no rationale was provided for giving a biographical article this name.</p>
<p>I propose deleting this entry including its redirect Kurchin (I've tried googling that too, but I've found no town, village or whatever. The only references are as a family name.) <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> 23:26, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
