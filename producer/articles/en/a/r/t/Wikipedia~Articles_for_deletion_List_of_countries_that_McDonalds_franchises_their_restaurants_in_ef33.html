<p>I am completely at a loss. This extreme inclusionism has gotten totally out of hand. What is there to keep in this article? <i><b>It is nothing but a list of countries</b></i>, and incomplete at that.

<li>Of the countries I've been too in the last five years, Belize, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Namibia, Uganda, Kenya and Botswana didn't have Maccie D's. Fiji, Thailand, South Africa, etc etc etc did. Did your eyes glaze over when I listed them? The Snopes article in a way made my point, it's better to discuss a subject than just quote lists.</li>

<dd>Tell you what, I'll drop my delete vote and change it to a <b>keep</b> vote if the word list is dropped from the article title (change it to MacDonalds around the world or something like it). We can then have an article, which can discuss the worldwide reach (and limits thereof) as well as mention the myth, and the business paradgim, resistance to MacDonalds in certain settings (like the Spanish Steps). The list, with dates, can then be part of an article, like each biological family article has an article and then a list of the species in that family. (Calling something a list, to my mind, discourages anything but listing.)</dd>

I do not see why we cannot just talk about the size of these companies in their own articles, these lists are pointless.
