No further edits should be made to this page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was: <b>Speedilly kept</b> due to overwhelming consensus.</p>
<p><br />
Keep: No proof exists either way and their are many problems with the traditional account of the moon landings and gaps in the information that is currently in the public domain. Beisides this it is still very much a phenomenom that exists in popular culture and therefore does not need to be "True" or "false". The entry may need some sort of disclaimer but that is as far as it should go - DO NOT DELETE</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> mandates that "Text that does not conform to all four policies is not allowed in the main namespace", the first of those four policies being the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>, which includes the mandate that <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Giving_.22equal_validity.22" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV does <i>not</i> mean giving equal validity to pseudoscience.</a> There could be an interesting and relevant article on the belief among some that the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax; but in practice, this article has been tended by editors who matter-of-factly refer to the Moon landings as "the hoax" and who clearly give equal validity to the idea that they are a hoax, as if this idea were equally valid as the evidence that the Apollo missions landed on the Moon. These pro-hoax editors have zealously reverted edits that try to replace hoax-as-equally-valid wording with neutral wording, such as by reverting to references to the "landing believer community" and "landing advocates", as if these were equally valid alternatives to their opposites according to the mainstream consensus. It is simply not NPOV for a purported encyclopedia to use such loaded, pro-hoax terminology, that would never be referred to by anyone who does not buy into the "moon landing hoax" idea. Since they are unwilling to avoid reverting repeatedly to blatant violations of NPOV, particularly by presenting fringe views as equally valid, this article has persisted in qualifying as "Text that does not conform to all four policies" and that therefore "is not allowed in the main namespace". Let them userfy it if they want, or relent to contributions by NPOV editors, but otherwise Wikipedia will be far better off once its policy of removing NPOV material from the main namespace is carried out with respect to this article. - <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReaverdrop_37ac.html" title="User:Reaverdrop">Reaverdrop</a> 00:10, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Definitely Keep</b> this is a totally legitimate page. NASA have officially answered questions on this topic, so if NASA can take this topic seriously, Wikipedia should also.
<ul>
<li>I think most of the answers have come from what might be called "NASA defenders". I don't think NASA themselves are nearly as interested in this topic as the moonbats like to fantasize that they are. Of course, when someone gets in someone's face and assaults them, like they did with Aldrin, they get smacked, and rightly so. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:03, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> - It is a notable and worthy topic - but in practice it is kept in persistent violation of NPOV to the point of making Wikipedia’s credibility a joke.

<li>I'd remind you that there is text on the Roman gods (after whom the planets are named), who are no longer widely believed in and are widely believed to have been a hoax/made up.

<li><b>Reply</b> - I haven't been involved in the editing of this article, so my comment is based soley on the notability of the topic. From a quick glance at the talk page, there appears to be a fair amount of conflict here. And I suspect that this is one of many topics which will always have conflict. However, I don't think the answer here is to delete the article. If it were to be deleted, it would be recreated and the same conflicts would exist. <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">There has to be another way to deal with this</a>. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 00:59, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>More to the point, there's a writeup on the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">Flat Earth</a>. Admittedly, it's not quite so controversial.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think a strength of Wikipedia is the highly controversial and contended over articles that no one is ever happy with, but which give a fair minded reader a pretty good sense of the arguments on both sides. I worked on the Apollo project during the summers of 1966 and 1967 and know how ludicrous the hoax notion is. But I was impressed with this article as it stands right now. It's far better to vent these kinds of theories than to let their supporters claim they are being suppressed. Another precedent is <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a>. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 04:14, 17 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Aha! A member of the vast NASA coverup that's more impregnable than the Mafia was. Awesome. So, how does it feel to be called a liar by the moonbats, and to be further told you should be OK with that and not pop somebody in the mouth when they get in your face, like Aldrin did (or should have)? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 04:32, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>I'll say this again: Of course it is a noteworthy topic. But there's a huge difference between explaining about belief in Roman gods or alternative medicine or Holocaust denial, and writing about any of these things in a way that gives equal validity to whether or not they are true. I've tried several times to make <b>modest</b> modifications to tone down the pro-hoax bias in this article, and each one was simply swiftly reverted by pro-hoax editors. I think the controversial and contended over articles are great too - but not controversial articles that don't incorporate any contending because single-POV squatters revert anything outside their own single fringe take on it. I think this article deserves to be here, but only if it is edited by the community at large who can make it NPOV, instead of pro-hoax hobbyists camping out on it and reverting any non-pro-hoax edits over and over. In other words, only if <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Giving_.22equal_validity.22" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia's policy on avoiding NPOV violation by giving equal validity to fringe beliefs</a> is actually practiced and is not just empty words. If we can't effectively make that happen then we'd be much better off with no article. - <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReaverdrop_37ac.html" title="User:Reaverdrop">Reaverdrop</a> 04:43, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, It's <b>so</b> pro hoax - the opening paragraph - "<i>The Apollo moon landing hoax accusations are a series of claims alleging that the Apollo Moon Landings never took place, but were instead faked by NASA. Nearly all interested scientists, technicians and space enthusiasts have rejected the claim as baseless.</i>" People could come away thinking that equal validity is given!

<dd>Any reference to "landing believer community" or "landing advocates" frames the issue as if hoax advocates were on equal footing and by itself violates <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Giving_.22equal_validity.22" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia's policy against giving equal validity to fringe beliefs</a>.

<li>It could be said that choosing truth over fantasy <i>is</i> a point of view. The fact that Moonbats are here actually gives us credibility because it shows that we can't do straw man arguments.

<li><b>Keep</b> With doubts. I have looked into the hoax theory, and I am convinced that the moon landings never took place. I am also convinced that the thruth will come to the mainline media some day, and Wikipedia should have an article about it until that day. But the hoax article in the Wikipedia is really telling anyone interested that the Apollo program was for real. I mean the opening sentences, the pictures, text under pictures, the longvinded "rebuttals". This article is not showing the hoax claim in a clear and fair way. That is why I am having doubts with "keep". The Apollo believers makes this page an Apollo propaganda page. (Axlalta 19:40, 17 May 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>The moonbats' seemingly simple questions do sometimes require "longvinded" explanations. I have also looked into the hoax story (it's not a "theory") and found it severely wanting. But apparently it will remain an open question, at least for a few folks, until somebody decides there's a reason to go back to the moon. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Speedily. This article needs editing and serious slimming down, but the moon hoax is very well known (as the links tesify) and the article is very well referenced. This nomination is clearly in bad faith. --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamsReign_4de7.html" title="User:DreamsReign">DreamsReign</a> 23:58, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think this is an example of bad faith. There is a legitimate question of how to cover fringe group theories without appearing to give them additional credence. AfD is just not the right mechanism if the fringe group is notable. Editors sometimes get too involved (I know I have) and forget that Wikipedia is a group process with a pretty good record of self correction. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 09:55, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This topic is notable enuogh to merit its own article. Someone please speedy close this AfD discussion. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_090d.html" title="User:Andylkl">Andylkl</a> <sup>[ <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndylkl_776e.html" title="User talk:Andylkl">talk!</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Andylkl_d01c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Andylkl">c</a> ]</sup> 08:52, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a part of world history now. User:70.130.179.63 01:08, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, notable. -<a href="../../../l/t/n/User%7ELtNOWIS_fcfd.html" title="User:LtNOWIS">LtNOWIS</a> 12:43, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and make plenty of re-directs and links, so it's easy for people to find. So long as this lunacy (pun intended) is floating around out there, shouldn't Wikipedia be a place they can come to find the truth about it? If NPOV reversions are a problem, perhaps the article can be locked. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarguz_Parsilvan_019f.html" title="User:Darguz Parsilvan">Darguz Parsilvan</a> 12:46, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, of course</b> Very good compilation of information on this subject, and a great starting point. Lalala1087 13:34, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Certainly keep</b> Lots of info and very much edited after long discussions rendering it useful and interesting. Educative! DrMilton 13:45, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I prefer to read this online than wait for FOX to rerun that special with that Mitch Pileggi guy from the X-files. <a href="../../../e/w/l/User%7EEwlyahoocom_d1b9.html" title="User:Ewlyahoocom">Ewlyahoocom</a> 20:52, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see the rationale for deleting this. I think the accusations are garbage, yes, but I also think we should let the facts speak for themselves. There's no harm in keeping this information available that I can see. 70.132.23.187 04:55, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Well known belief held by several people.--<a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENot_a_slave_2058.html" title="User:Not a slave">Josh</a> 14:36, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
