<dd><b>Comment.</b> Thanks, Ohnoitsjamie. But fwiw beware Alexa. It skews very steeply toward underaluing non-huge sites. I have friends running small, medium, and rather large sites who all agree Alexa underrates by a factor of magnitude. They get the super big ones right, though. Just FWIW!

<p>I haven't been doing any work on wikipedia in ages (just busy), so I don't know how much cred I have at this point. However, most of my work dates back to before "Advanced Yoga Practices" came into being, so I'm at least not a new face. This is certainly not a new "branch" of yoga, Ohnoitsjamie. They haven't added any in a few millennia. So that's not a fitting benchmark. However, it's a fresh and innovative approach, it reveals a lot of information previously kept secret (one had to be initiated and stick around for years to get this stuff), and it integrates a lot of obscure, esoteric, and far-flung elements into one very well-written and exceptionally clear system purged of superstition, doctrine, and lots of the other junk that inevitably gets added on over the millenia. It's a brilliant work of integration, IMO. And since Yogani has been called "the first yoga eGuru, having come to prominence on the Internet" on a patently independently web site (<a href="http://www.globalserve.net/~sarlo/Yyoga.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.globalserve.net/~sarlo/Yyoga.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalserve.net/~sarlo/Yyoga.htm</a>), the topic deserves inclusion. Though I agree some work needs to be done on the article to make it a bit less boosterish. --O. Pen Sauce 03:02, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Thanks for the contribution, O.Pen. Other editors please note O.Pen's contribution history: many quality edits in 2003-4 on articles relating to yoga and its schools, and no contributions either recently or to the article up for review. A genuine, expert, outside opinion is rare on AfD. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 04:55, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment.</b> That was nice, thanks, especially 'cuz I feel like Rip Van Winkle here. Listen, I'll commit to doing a once-over on this article once it goes live to purge the hype. As you can see from my old edits, I'm one of the rare yoga practitioners with a balanced eye toward the different schools. The problem with yoga people is they tend to be dismayingly sectarian. This creates a problem for Wikipedia that I ought to start pitching in to help fix anyway, with respect to some of the other yoga entries.----O. Pen Sauce 14:57, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AYP is a very new approach to Yoga and is catching on very fast among people around the world. It is a guruless system.. wherein you are given all the tools and enough guidance through lessons and a forum to take you ahead in the spiritual path.</p>
<p>All these yoga techniques have been around for ages, however AYP picks the best and most effective tools.. and has come up with a system that is the most efficient for both meditation and pranayam.</p>
<p>The reason for not having many hits when you google is because it is still new.. but catching on very fast. AYP online memberships in the AYP Yahoo groups and the AYP website forums total nearly 10,000 people. The AYP websites have been visited by over 50,000 people during the past few years, and are currently receiving over 20,000 page hits per day.</p>
<p>It may not be at the Wikipedia popularity level.. but it is getting there.. it can only increase with addition of new online lessons and the publishing of the remaining 5 books in the AYP enlightenment series.</p>
<p>Thousands of people who have been following AYP have had very quick progress in their spiritual path.. You can find testimonials of this <a href="http://aypsite.com/Testimonials.html" class="external free" title="http://aypsite.com/Testimonials.html" rel="nofollow">http://aypsite.com/Testimonials.html</a></p>
<p><i>"The creator of the article immediately set about linking numerous other Yoga-related articles to this one which supports the suspicion that the intention was promotional".</i> - The reason for this was because I was told to add link to other Wikipedia articles <i>{{<a href="../../../l/i/n/Template%7ELinkless_f9ea.html" title="Template:Linkless">linkless</a>}} template to orphan article).</i> Once I was done with that, I was told to link other Wikipedia articles to mine. <i>"The category and the tag both just mean that links to Advanced Yoga Practices (AYP) &lt;/wiki/Advanced_Yoga_Practices_%28AYP%29&gt; need to be created from other articles. You're on the right track, just add Advanced Yoga Practices (AYP) to other articles and that will do the trick."</i> I have been following orders. And now that I have done both way links I have been tagged as trying to promote AYP.</p>
<p>Finally <i>search for "Yogani," yields only about 730 hits, many related to a few books</i>.. is because Yogani wants to remain anonymous.. AYP is not about him.. it is about Yoga and getting the best and most efficient techniques out to everyone who may or may not have a guru.</p>

I would really appreciate if you would consider this topic for Wikipedia. If the writing does not fit in with the Wikipedia standard and style I will gladly re-write it. However, this was not meant to be an advertisement or a promotion. I just thought it would be a good topic for people looking for a fresh approach to Yoga and let them know that there is something available for people interested in spirituality who don't have a guru.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and patience. Shantiayp 21:11, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b>Comment</b>: I cant really speak to whether the topic is encyclopaedic or not, because I'm not sure what the notability criteria should be here. I just thought I should share the information that, when I accessed some of the Amazon links to the books provided above, several of them had fairly high ranks. Ranks above 75,000 change frequently over time, but most of the books had ranks (either today or yesterday) below 300,000, and several had ranks well below 200,000, which is a commonly-used cutoff for notabiliity. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 04:46, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

If and when it is approved, I will be happy to add informative articles on the practices you have linked, plus some more. Very few are covered on Wiki so far.

<p><b>Comment</b> I don't see the promotion in this article, it is written in a very objective way and I find it useful and informative, what's the big deal? how would I find out about it otherwise? The more yoga information the better! Anthem, 22:31, 23 July 2006 (UTC).</p>
