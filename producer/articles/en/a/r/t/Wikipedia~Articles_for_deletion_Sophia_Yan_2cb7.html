<li><b>Delete.</b> Impressive sounding but further investigations seems to reveal that the awards, competitions and "tour" are all youth student activities.

<li><b>Comment.</b> The reason I'm fighting this so much it that I think it sets a dangerous precedent for including articles for every young person who particpates in these young peoples music competitions, maybe wins one and gets written up in their hometown paper. It's easy to make it look impressive and if we allow this, Wikipedia will be inundated with articles of talented kids. This is not <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midori_Goto_780c.html" title="Midori Goto">Midori</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Groban_1fa6.html" title="Josh Groban">Josh Groban</a>, not even close, and I do not see that she was "featured" in the NY Times. The article was from the New Jersey local news section of the Times (she lives in New Jersey) talking about teenagers that weren't getting into trouble. That's a long way from a feature story in the Arts section of the Times. With all due respect, I really think AfD submissions like this deserve more careful analysis. It's nothing personal against Ms. Yan, who seems like a perfectly charming, intelligent, and talented young lady who will go very far in music, or whatever she decides to pursue. It's about keeping to the WP:MUSIC and WP:BIO guidelines. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 12:48, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> There's a difference between the Spokane metro area and the New York metro area in terms of notability. The NYT has a very high standard for news articles, and the article in question was not just a filler blurb, but made its way into the Metro section of the number two newspaper in the country. That says something about the quality of the talent and/or potential. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 05:32, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The NY Times article was not about youths not getting into trouble; it was merely an opening. The rest of the article features two young pianists, Dae Hyung Ahn and Sophia Yan, both NJ residents. I believe the same article was later distributed in the Metro section of the Times. In addition, some of the competitions are now registed under a different name, but the winners do not change. From what I could find, she seems to have placed first a number of times in various competitions. You win a Steinway in one of them (cannot remember which) as the first place winner! Also, Midori can no longer be considered a youth. The difference is this -- while Midori and Groban have careers, they are professionals. Yan is a rising star, which is why I am intent on following her career path. Exactly that makes her a notable youth. There are some more details that I suppose can be included to fit the bio requirements. Mozart250</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If Wikipedia is about noting rising young stars with potential then we should Keep all the new young rock bands we keep Deleting here. As for Midori, I meant Midori when she was young and competing on the stage on equal footing with adults. Same with Groban. Also, I don't see anywhere that the Steinway Society competition "gives away a Steinway." According to the Web site, "The Steinway Society is a tax exempt, piano scholarship organization" which people pay to join. Also, people pay to attend the conerts. They take the proceeds from the membership and the concert admissions and divide it up into scholarship funds for the winners. Last years it was "$3-4,000" to all the winners. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 18:36, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>'<i>Comment</i>. Thanks. I'm sorry about that. I still don't see anything on the MTNA web site about giving away a piano, but I trust you're right. IN any case, I'm not sure if the value of the prize is any relation to the notability of the perfomer. Speaking of the MTNA competition, it does say that the purpose of the national competition which Yang won is "to provide educational experiences for students and teachers and to recognize exceptionally talented young artists" which again just puts her in the really talented student category, not qute in the WP:MUSIC league. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 21:22, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
