<p>This article is ostensibly about the Ngangangese language, which is supposed to be one of two languages spoken by the "Ching" people. I could find no reference to a language by this name either using Google, nor on the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologue.html" title="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a> (which lists over 6,900 languages, and is the definitive authority for all of the languages currently spoken on earth). Likewise for the "sister language" Inginese.

<li><b>Delete</b> I think the main thing that gives it away is that it's supposed to be related to "Inginese", but the examples of "Ngangangese" and "Inginese" at the bottom are completely different. Also, it says that the language is monosyllabic (like chinese languages) but the example contains words like "limnada" which can't be expressed in a single syllable. <b><a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltra-Loser_fa06.html" title="User:Ultra-Loser"><span style="color:#112B84">Ultra-Loser</span></a> <small><sup>[ <a href="../../../u/l/t/User_talk%7EUltra-Loser_53db.html" title="User talk:Ultra-Loser">T</a> ] [ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ultra-Loser_4117.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ultra-Loser">C</a> ]</sup></small></b> 06:35, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for the heads-up. The appropriate action is to restore the AfD tag (and the hoax in this case, although the fact that we're talking hoaxes <i>at</i> the AfD probably makes it less than strictly necessary) with a revert and then to warn the author with the drmafd template, since removing that tag is a form of vandalism.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> Ethnologue does NOT account for different dialects and merely classifies them under the same language, DESPITE the fact that dialects are NOT the same. For example in the Korea section they say there is only Korean and Korean Sign Language used in Korea. That is true but there are lots of other Korean dialects as you can see in article about it in Wikipedia. Therefore how do you know that it lists EVERY language, and therefore it cannot be proven for any language to be real off of a site, is every language known to us in the United States?

<li><b>do not delete</b> I found that the comment about the dialects not being connected is false because not all dialects are the same. example, in Chinese languages, Cantonese and Shanghainese differ completely in that Shanghainese uses multiple syllables in words while Cantonese is strictly monosyllabic.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Signing is actually really, really easy - just type ~~~~ and it will automatically put in your username and the date and time. As for sources, keep in mind why others do not allow Wikipedia as a source is because of hoax articles and random nonsense often inserted into articles. While this page may not be a hoax, the best way for you to prove that is to provide sources to verify the information, so that it can be seen as true <i>encyclopedic</i> information. –- <strong><a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKungming2_bd1a.html" title="User:Kungming2"><font color="blue">kungming·</font></a><font color="green">2</font></strong> <a href="../../../k/u/n/User_talk%7EKungming2_b479.html" title="User talk:Kungming2"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> | <strong><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Kungming2_59d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Kungming2">Review</a></strong> 18:20, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
