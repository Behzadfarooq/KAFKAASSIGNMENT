<dd>Hi, Adrian, it's even worse than that, this article is mostly <i>not even wrong</i>. I just added a critique of the first half of the article to the <a href="../../../h/y/p/Talk%7EHyperspace_3508.html" title="Talk:Hyperspace">talk page</a>. <i>Every single sentence</i> is nonsensical or in a few cases makes an identifiably incorrect claim. Please see the list--- it is really amazing. This is without question one of the absolute worst articles I have seen in the WP since I got here in late May 2005. It is entirely pointless and should be deleted as nonsensical prattle by someone who had absolutely no idea what they were talking about, or even what they were trying to say.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 21:52, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You said <i>there's no reason to delete an article [simply] for repeating other concepts</i> and of course I agree, but that's not the point.

<dd>I appreciate your sentiments but all I'm seeing is bad editing. There is a term "hyperspace" in common parlance and Wikipedia needs a factual article on it; if what's there isn't right at all, then it needs fixing, not deletion. --<b><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwcovington_2ca2.html" title="User:Alexwcovington"><font style="background:#000088;" color="#FFFF88">AlexWCovington</font></a></b> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexwcovington_ddca.html" title="User talk:Alexwcovington">talk</a>) 01:09, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Unless the references are all not true or say something different.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Obina's comments. If the nominator (or anyone else) can provide proof the article is a hoax, then it should be fixed or the appropriate tags added to the article.

<dd>I can't prove it's a hoax, of course. I can prove it's gobbledygook.

<dd>Sorry, that's not enough to justify deletion since there is no proof of bad faith. Correction, maybe, but not deletion. I don't have time to go hunting through books. If you believe this is gobbledygook then replace the offending content with something that is not gobbledygook -- you seem familiar with the above book, so I would start with that. I do agree with Agateller, below, that perhaps a renaming of the article is in order and change Hyperspace itself to a disambiguation page that leads to this article and to the science fiction concept. The fact that there may <i>allegedly</i> be factual errors in this article is not grounds for deletion. That's the same as saying the article on <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelina_Jolie_ff96.html" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a> should be deleted because someone erroneously stated that she was the first woman to walk on the moon. If it's wrong, <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> and correct it -- but be prepared to defend your corrections with sources, is all. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 01:51, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Abstain</b></s> - The references are legit (I've met Cliff Pickover) but may not apply.

Or, alternatively, an expert opinion (from a physicist) on whether there is merit to the article. What I find concerning is that CH gives the appearance of being on a personal vendetta against this article. The comments on the talk page are not very friendly and the followup to every comment here is disconcerting. (the equations seem legit as far as they go but don't seem to explain much about how one would do anything useful with hyperspace). If this article is kept, I suggest that the disambig be reversed to make the article currently at <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperspace_%28science_fiction%29.html" title="Hyperspace (science fiction)">hyperspace (science fiction)</a> the proimary one, and have it point here. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 23:17, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Lar, the references are to popular works. I mentioned in my allegedly "unfriendly" (I'd say frustrated and apalled) comments that the term <i>hyperspace</i> is applied in popular writings by some authors who also write legit scientific papers. If you're not willing to take my word for it, why not ask Pickover? I'd be <i>astonished</i> if he did not agree with my critiques in the <a href="../../../h/y/p/Talk%7EHyperspace_3508.html" title="Talk:Hyperspace">talk page</a>. As for "personal vendetta", I don't know who (plural) wrote that article, so it can't be personal. In fact, my motivations are concern for reader who come here seeking an <i>encyclopedia</i>.

<dd><b>Incidentally</b> the correct category for an article on hyperspace is surely “speculative science” - the same category as gravity engines, cold fusion, time travel, over unity machines, “intelligent” design, and (the other theory I have been working on for 15 years) - Strong AI.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Contribututions to this AfD are 86.133.47.213's only edits. Searching on "Robert Lucien Howe" indicates that this person is not employed as a scientist by academic or government-funded research institutions; instead, he seems to be an enthusiast who writes online about a "transiator" device, which allegedly is a device used by the US government to examine possible futures, and which also is alleged to exist naturally in humans. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 18:03, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
