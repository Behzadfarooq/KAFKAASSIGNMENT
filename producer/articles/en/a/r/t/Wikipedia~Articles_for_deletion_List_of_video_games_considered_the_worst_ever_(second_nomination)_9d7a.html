<p>This article has been acknowledged for a long time to be nothing but POV. Additionally, much of it appears to be original research. Despite this acknowledgment, the article remains the same: uncited, unencyclopedic, and unprofessional. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 12:21, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s>OK guys, I will dare and remove the AfD tag as the result seems to be "Keep" with little or no doubt (and no, no ballot stuffing here). Plus the AfD tags insist on calling this the "second" AfD nomination, while it's the third one. Oh well...</s> <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 15:47, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>My bad, forgot that only admins can do that&#160;:-) <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 23:10, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, the nominator did not disclose that this article has been nominated for deletion twice; there was no consensus first time and keep (by a wide margin- 13 to 5) the second time. Much like the <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a>, there's no reason to keep re-nominating an article. Second of all, while I feel that this list is POV, it's at least POV that pretty much everyone can agree with- not many people are going to tell you that <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Rigs_345a.html" title="Big Rigs">Big Rigs</a> was a particularly great experience. The fact that there's already a note to use the talk page before adding to the article certainly helps its cause. As a huge gamer, I greatly despise gamecruft on WP, but in my opinion, this isn't it. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 12:56, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And, by the way, if you look at the talk page, the note in the main article is true- each game somebody wants to put on the list is first proposed to the community (via the talk page), or else it's simply removed from the page. Thus, while the article is POV, at least there's a consensus as far as what belongs on the list and what does not. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 13:02, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> this was listed for deletion several times unsuccessfully. I don't see how this time it would be different. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 13:03, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While at first it may sound POV all entries are seemingly backed up by references to calims that said entries are in fact terrible. it is after all <i>list of games considered</i> not <i>list of games that are</i> the worst ever <a href="../../../y/d/a/User%7EYdam_9ecb.html" title="User:Ydam">Ydam</a> 13:14, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep but rewrite beginning</b> While the list itself is a good collection with references, the article before the list itself is indeed very POV, especially the "2D as out-of-fashion" section which is disputable from many angles including the many popular 2D games released for newer handheld consoles including not only the likes of the Gameboy Advance but also of mobile phones. The part before the list definitely needs an NPOV-rewrite. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamDobay_1d3b.html" title="User:AdamDobay">AdamDobay</a> 14:07, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> <b>Rename</b>. <s>Listcruft</s>. Horrible name for an article: "considered" (<a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a>), "worst ever" (<a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperbole.html" title="Hyperbole">hyperbole</a>). If it is kept it needs to be renamed. 70.108.111.17 14:17, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> per precedent. I invite 70.108.111.17 to suggest alternate wording that won't render the title POV. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:44, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> If individual games within the list is notable enough, give those games coverage in their own individual articles.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, as not only it has survived two AfD nominations before, but the current revision of the list is much more mature and well observed/mantained than older versions. Plus, there are similarly named articles (one example for all: <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="Films considered the worst ever">Films considered the worst ever</a>) which are suspiciously not subject to as much AfD nominations and criticism, neither for their name, nor for their content. And about the "2D out of fashion theory": the only systems where they're considered "hip" are lowly handhelds and Java games (for technical reasons, mostly, but even on those platforms, developers and manufacturers are striving for "3D at all costs" strategy too, so there's definitively a bias or policy in the industry. <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 17:47, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and quit listing it for deletion. It's ridiculous to list articles over and over when there's a consensus to keep them. 81.170.50.197 18:40, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> — Per above. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 19:07, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>By my current count, 11 people are going with keep, 3 with delete, and 1 with rename.

<li><b>Keep</b>, this actually have have some use as suggested eariler, as a repository of games that are considered bad; most of them give reasons for why, allowing the reader to do further research as many have their own page dedicated to them. And I would think that 12-3-1 (The 1 being a Rename) would be considered to be a legitimate vote, since ballot-stuffing would imply that someone is logging in under different accounts to do this. <a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoyote42_caf6.html" title="User:Coyote42">Coyote42</a> 22:36, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but rewrite beginning. <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="Films considered the worst ever">Films considered the worst ever</a> is an exemplary list in my opinion... This has attracted more negative attention I think because the intro is way too long and messy. Clean it up, but I know this can be made into a well-sourced and unambiguous list. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="green">ka</font></a> 05:01, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep but rewrite article title</b>. Having a weasel word right in the title undermines this article from the very beginning. Aside from that, I vote this article should be kept because making it finally work would provide an excellent testament to the power of the Wiki community to tackle tough articles. <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act_51fb.html" title="No Child Left Behind Act">NO ARTICLE LEFT BEHIND!</a> --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetron4_6924.html" title="User:Metron4">Metron4</a> 17:11, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> It needs work, but is a worthy subject to be included. If <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="Films considered the worst ever">Films considered the worst ever</a> and other subjects can have their own 'worst' lists, I do not see why video games cannot have their own 'worst' list either.--Cini 18:58, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As long as an authoritative source (magazine, etc.) can be found, I'd say that this list is fine, if worthy of keeping the {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisputed_d59f.html" title="Template:Disputed">disputed</a>}} tag. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsopropyl_2165.html" title="User:Isopropyl">Isopropyl</a> 18:24, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Big time delete</b> Pages like this are too subjective to be included on a encyclopedia (even if many people believe Wikipedia is not truly an encylopedia).
