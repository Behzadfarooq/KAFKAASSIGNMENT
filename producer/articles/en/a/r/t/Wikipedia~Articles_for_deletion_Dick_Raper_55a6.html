I think that we should avoid making a judgement about this article on the basis of Mr Raper's name and try and make it on the basis of his notability for an article. I suspect that someone who is CEO of a company with a 14 billion USD turnover is of sufficient standing within the business world to merit an article. In view of the scatalogical and sexual nature of many of the episodes of vandalism that appear on Wikipedia it is perhaps natural that we should assume that the article is a hoax, but in this case it appears not to be the case. I agree that it does need to be expanded at some point, but I thought it was important that the consensus on this one should be challenged. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitepunk_094c.html" title="User:Politepunk">Politepunk</a> 08:38, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Other than his name, there is unlikely to be <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html#People_still_alive" title="WP:BIO">a good deal of public interest</a> in him and thus he doesn't satisfy WP:BIO. (Tangentially: a case could be made that the WP:BIO criteria should be slightly expanded to include notable businesspeople.) Despite amending my vote I'm pleased that we considered the merits of Mr Raper's inclsion on the basis of his notability rather than on the basis of his name. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitepunk_094c.html" title="User:Politepunk">Politepunk</a> 08:55, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I know we live in the internet age, but couldn't somebody (who is in the US) do something old fashioned like walk into a library and check this out? Or call whoever keeps corporate records in the USA? Mr Raper's name comes up top in a Google for "masterfoods ceo" but most results are old, I'd think the most likely answer is that he's former CEO. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 09:45, 12 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I have access to Bloomberg People Directory. Mr Raper is indeed the current CEO of Masterfoods, and has been for the last several years, and prior to that had a successful career. This page shows the problem of consensus being deemed more important than knowledge of the matter. Just because someone doesn't come up in Google, doesn't mean they are not notable. Raper is interviewed in national magazines on a near-monthly basis, it's just that they don't reproduce all their articles onto Google. CEO DR 14:47, 12 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Uhh.. reproduce all thier articles onto Google? Google is a search engine. If Dick Raper's name was that important and he was featured monthly in articles, <del>he would probably get more than 1 google hit</del>. Besides, there isn't enough information on Dick Raper to produce more than there already is. The only external link we have on him is from 2001. I suggest recreating the page when you have more information on him. <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoe_Epsilon_7345.html" title="User:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#FF0000">M</font><font color="#EE0000">o</font><font color="#DD0000">e</font></a> <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#0000FF">ε</font></a> 15:42, 12 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By "reproduce" I meant there being an online version of the paper edition, eg reproduced online. Whilst newspapers may archive everything online, the business magazines Raper is featured in are more exclusive, like IFR magazine which costs $100 a copy, so obviously they won't put content up for free online. CEO DR 16:13, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Relooked and he has 64 total as shown in a link above. But there still isn't enough information there to sustain an article. <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoe_Epsilon_7345.html" title="User:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#FF0000">M</font><font color="#EE0000">o</font><font color="#DD0000">e</font></a> <a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoe_Epsilon_62b6.html" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon"><font color="#0000FF">ε</font></a> 15:46, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>As I said above Moe, not everything is on the net. It's quite possible indeed that this guy is featured in who's who books and business magazines which are not archived on the net.
