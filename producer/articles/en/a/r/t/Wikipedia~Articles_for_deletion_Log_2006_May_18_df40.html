<p>This is a strange case. I found this article in the Wikipedia namespace, and moved it, thinking that the creator made a mistake. When checking the backlinks, though, I found out that it had been deleted before. I would vote <b>keep</b> if that is allowed, because he appears to be an actual person, despite what the previous AfD debate said: he has three albums on amazon.com, an <a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/holly_pete/artist.jhtml?_requestid=415010" class="external text" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/holly_pete/artist.jhtml?_requestid=415010" rel="nofollow">entry</a> at VH1.com (for what it's worth), etc. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdric47_8ef5.html" title="User:Ardric47">Ardric47</a> 00:15, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep and clean up A LOT</b> Aside from this article being diiiiiiirty, being a voter for the Grammys means nothing, as you just have to be credited on six songs, and getting "first round" nominations means nothing, because like a jillion (give or take a jillion) artists get first round noms.

<dd>Do websites not count as "reputable media"? Although I can see how almost all of the web hits might have been heavily influenced by Pete Holly himself (akin to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_publisher.html" title="Vanity publisher">vanity publishers</a>).

<dd>Are there multiple non-trivial works published about him on web sites? Some web sites are reputable media but others clearly do not count as such. Note that his entries on VH1.com and Allmusic.com include minimal information at most. Furthermore, the fact that his web site still makes false claims about him being nominated for multiple Grammy Awards, which is verifiably false, raises questions about the accuracy of other information he may have submitted here or elsewhere. (The "first round" does not constitute an award nomination. <a href="http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY%5FAwards/Voting/FAQs/#one" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY%5FAwards/Voting/FAQs/#one" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 05:26, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not really talking about Grammy procedures per se, just how claims Pete Holly makes on his web site are the opposite of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. For example, his home page says <i>-4-GRAMMY NOMINATIONS FOR "PETE HOLLY III"- -INCLUDING ONE FOR THE VIDEO "HEART OF GOLD"-in 2006-</i> <a href="http://www.peteholly.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.peteholly.com/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> yet <a href="http://www.grammy.com/Grammy_Awards/Annual_Show/48_nominees.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.grammy.com/Grammy_Awards/Annual_Show/48_nominees.aspx" rel="nofollow">the official list of Grammy nominations</a> for the most recent year never mentions him or "Heart of Gold". In other words, not only can we <i>not</i> verify that he was Grammy-nominated, we <i>can</i> verify that he wasn't. This raises questions about how accurate other published information about him may be. Adrift* suggests below that he appears notable, and maybe he meets some <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criterion like having a national tour, but I'm not going to give him the benefit of the doubt until we get some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 02:03, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Strongly disagree with Mr. Dillinger. Authors themselves will be the first to agree that some authors are more notable than others, and some books are more notable than others. The Wikipedia is not here to encourage the false idea that every collection of words between two covers is equally worthwhile. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <small><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></small> 12:53, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Agree with <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a>. The tangible output from scientists are scholaraly papers, yet publishing a paper (even in the most illustrious journal) does not make a scientist or the paper notable. Publishing an important/seminal/high impact paper does. By the same token, why should all published books be inherently notable? Surely, as in any field, there are levels of notability. Placing the bar at all 'non-vanity publications' appears to be very low, compared to other disciplines. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">Rockpocket</a> <a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket">(talk)</a> 17:43, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ditto for me. I envision book notability paralleling <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, i.e., notable books have won notable awards, been bestsellers and/or critical success [even Oprah book club (*cringe*)]...This situation is hazier because the author is famous not for being an author--I'm not a fan of the idea of every B-list (non-literary) celebrity book automatically gaining encyclopedic notability. As for, books <i>with a notability above that of an average cookbook or programmers manual would qualify</i>, it's unfortunately nebulous. Has this book ecliped an "average cookbook"? Convince me and I'll change my vote. -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 20:04, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Why don't you deletionists just allow anyone who wants to create a article about a real, published book the ability to have a page on the book on Wikipedia. If nobody cares about the book, then the book would be non-notable by the fact that nobody wanted to create a page. By the way, the navigation on amazon.com sucks, so using the resources and popularity of Wikipedia as a book database is the proper idea, but the world of knowledge would be worse off page if pages like this get deleted.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Dillinger_2c06.html" title="User:Nick Dillinger">Nick Dillinger</a> 04:01, 20 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your argument for notability is a <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tautology_%28logic%29.html" title="Tautology (logic)">tautology</a>--if one has written an article about a book, it is notable and should be kept; if there is no article about a book it is not notable and shouldn't have an article. And while your statement that "the world of knowledge would be worse off page if pages like this get deleted" may be true, and is certainly melodramatic, the vast majority of the voters here want to keep this information available, just on the <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violet_Blue_1d8d.html" title="Violet Blue">Violet Blue</a> article. -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 18:30, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't think, in its current incarnation, it really counts as an "attack page." If the page simply says, "these people did such and such terrible things, and all of said people went to Harvard," then- <i>if only stating truths</i>- it can't really be an attack. Thus, in my opinion, it's not a speedy deletion candidate.

<li><b>Comment</b> I find it odd that no one has elected to delete the Nelson page, despite the Doran one having more information. That he created a novel form of haiku is one of the reasons i started the page -- not many people create a new poetry form, especially in haiku.

<li><b>Comment</b> As i just wrote on my blog, i don't really agree with keeping this page, either. Though i'm confused, also, why J. D.'s page hasn't had any delete request. In what way is J. D. more notable than i am? As i outlined, the only difference between him and i is the country we were born in -- it's interesting that the person who first requested the delete (a self-confessed new-page delete nazi) is American. I have no problem with seeing this go, but unless you request a delete of J. D.'s page, also, i'd consider a retract (if that's at all possible); though it seems as though the first request has already set the ball in motion. ...As i don't refer to myself as a poet, a Google search of 'Kevin Doran poetry' might be better. 'seems still to be at college. Blog indicates youth and zeal rather' -- i know a 70-year-old man who went to uni to study a B.A. in Art. ...If there's a question of balance in the page, i can add info on several editors with whom i've had public (in a 'Net sense) 'disagreements', and where i've gone on to actually publish poems about it. If there's a question of bias in the description of the 'zine, there are a dozen name-attributable quotes on it from people in the publishing world, on the site itself. Am i permitted to edit such things in myself? As i said, i don't mind a deletion, just be fair to whoever wrote this. --KD</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Similarly, you appear to misunderstand how Wikipedia works. An editor nominating one article is under no obligation to search for and nominate related articles of a similar level of notability (though they often do). Moreover, of the 10 deletionists whose motives you question in terms of nationality, please note that at least four are not American (three Brits and an Aussie). The great thing about blogs, is that errors can be corrected promptly. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">Rockpocket</a> <a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket">(talk)</a> 19:25, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> '(not all about him though)' -- all but one link on the first three pages reference me. I wasn't aware i was that visible via Google. 'claims of notability are not obviously citable. Will reconsider if sources are found' -- what kind of sources? Does blog, listserv, and forum discussion count? 'two blogs don't cut it for notability' -- how about three? and one is a 'zine on blogger, anyway; there's several around. 'Please be more careful before bandying about implicit accusations of national discrimination' -- sorry, i thought you were overlooking the other page.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Although the article makes claims of notability, I question them. Being "under contract" means works for. Traveling and giving seminars ... lots of people do that. Doesn't make them notable, it is just a feature of their work. A colorist in Austin, Texas ... doesn't sound notable. The only notability claims that may be "above the bar" might be her celebrity clients.... however, I don't think every stylist who works on a celebrity is notable... Only the last paragraph about magazine features might make her notable. However, all of this is unsourced. And if it is the case that she was the stylist for models appearing in the magazines, as opposed to having articles written about her, then this is not notable. —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 05:09, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>It would have been interesting. So, we even created a story around that. In the end, it sounds greedy, but the deal couldn't be made. We as an entity...

<li><b>Question</b> - What are the criteria for inclusion, aside for the vague "notable".... awards? Attention in the popular media?

<li><b>Comment</b> This list is totally unstructured. Advertising campaigns have regional variations, are time-bound and a lot are region/market-specific. If I was researching this topic, I wouldn't want to have to wade through a huge list of irrelevant adverts to find the few for which I was looking. If this can't be structured by date/region/subject or other criteria then it should be deleted, as it will quickly grow to be useless. <span style="border: 1px solid #800080;"><a href="../../../%28/a/e/User%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User:(aeropagitica)"><font style="background: #800080" face="Ariel" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;(aeropagitica)&#160;</b></font></a><a href="../../../%28/a/e/User_talk%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User talk:(aeropagitica)"><font style="background:#FFFFFF" face="Ariel" color="#800080"><b>&#160;(talk)&#160;</b></font></a></span> 06:22, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Do we need to have articles for individual roller coasters? I would have used prod for this, but there is no official guideline that applies.

<li><b>Keep</b> There are over a hundred and sixty articles about individual rollercoasters and as already mentioned this was certainly the most famous in the UK at the time. It is at the UK's leading theme park. It is certainly more notable than dozens of the American rollercoasters with articles. Seven other rollercoaters at Alton Towers have articles and the nominator has not given any reason for singling this one out for deletion. They are linked by a template, so deleting this would break the series and create at least seven red links. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoalbaton_1480.html" title="User:Choalbaton">Choalbaton</a> 06:04, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Let's take this to its logical conclusion; suppose Spitzer wins the NY gubernatorial race? Well, as it happens, the wife of Massachusetts' governor doesn't have an article. Neither does the spouse of Vermont's governor. Jon Corzine had a very messy, public divorce, and his ex- doesn't have an article. Jodi Rell's husband isn't even named in her article, never mind have one of his own. Ed Rendell's wife is the only one of any nearby state governor's to have an article, and at least she's been a Federal judge on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals for the last decade. If governors' spouses aren't notable by definition, a state attorney-general's spouse sure as hell isn't. What is the basis for assuming that Wall is either "prominent" or "highly successful?" That she worked for a giant law firm once? <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:31, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's not a nomination, it's a vote. Since AfD is not a vote, it's helpful to have the nominator take the lead in doing his (or her) best to provide good reasoning for deletion. Nominations can be short, but they really <i>don't</i> need big bolded "delete" notes, nor the phrase "Prod removed without explanation" (Prod can be removed for any reason, by anyone).

<p>This one perplexes me, and I've decided to bring it to the attention of the community. I found it after clicking "random article" a few times (which I rarely do.) He was an early 20th century "secretary to the editorial board" of a journal. Its creator has a <i>very</i> sporadic edit history, so asking him about it probably isn't going to prove too useful (although I will leave him a message anyway.) To me this is not an adequate assertion of notability per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but perhaps someone will find some new piece of info to save it. Google is, of course, useless for this.

<li><b>Delete</b> Well, I was going to AfD it, but first was giving interested parties a courtesy period to explain this. I guess Srikeit beat me to it.

<p>De-prodded by anonymous (likely article's creator) without explanation. This article is an out-right copy of <a href="../../../g/o/d/Goddess.html" title="Goddess">Goddess</a>, with the only difference being that it's a few days out of date now (and that "goddess" was changed to "lovegirl" in a couple of places). Non-notable neologism does not require a redirect. No definition at dictionary.com or urbandictionary.com, first five pages of google hits are totally unrelated.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricgrimwade_Lindsay_Gollehon_bce5.html" title="User:Ericgrimwade/Lindsay Gollehon">only page</a> that links to it is a subpage of the article's creator's userpage, which is about his girlfriend. The subpage was originally an article that was moved to userspace for being non-notable. Same for the user's main userpage. User's only edits are related to these pages.

<li><b>Comment</b> I wanted to tag the article for speedy deletion, to be sure, but it doesn't seem to really fill any of the criteria for speedy deletion. It's not <i>exactly</i> patent nonsense, not <i>exactly</i> a non-notable bio... I was hoping it would quietly die from the prod, but of course the creator had to go remove that template for no good reason. There really should be some ammendment allowing prods to be re-posted if they're removed without explanation by the article's creator, because I see that happen a lot. I was unaware of <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>, but I hope the next admin to stop by decides to invoke it. If ever there was an appropriate circumstance, this would be it! It's not actual policy, though, so I'll understand either way. The important thing is that whether it takes another hour or another week, this vanity/girlfriend-cruft/pain-in-the-butt-waste-of-time-to-even-delete article will bite the dust. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 09:03, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Strong Keep!!!</b> There may be some larger questions as to how organize food articles but there certainly are other individual sandwich articles. Check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sandwiches" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sandwiches" rel="nofollow">category:sandwiches</a> Egg sandwiches are common diner food all across america and more notable than many sandwiches with articles (such as <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fried-brain_sandwich.html" title="Fried-brain sandwich">Fried-brain sandwich</a>). I am usually ready to delete anything with little thought but this seems like a mistaken nomination. At the very least it should be merged into sandwich along with the other 50 sandwiches but I'm not sure that would be the best organization. There are undoubtibly people (maybe some here) who have never had one and to whom this article would be informative.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 19:49, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is a strong consensus has been that <i>recipes</i> go into Wikibooks, not because they are food, but because they are how-to's and the current consensus is that how-to's don't belong in Wikipedia. AFAIK there's no objection to articles on food or food items just because they are food items. It all comes down to the usual question of importance, how much can be written about them, how much verifiable, published material there is (as opposed to personal essays, or even collaborative personal essays). Obviously <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Mac_9141.html" title="Big Mac">Big Mac</a> as legitimate, and so is <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburger.html" title="Hamburger">hamburger</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheesesteak.html" title="Cheesesteak">cheesesteak</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've removed PROD tags from this article twice, so don't count me as an independent opinion. That said, I think egg sandwiches are notable and encyclopedic.

<li><b>Provisional Delete</b>: The subject is valid, as we let in any Olympian, but the way that it's written now, it presents as a college athlete page. Because I think a valid article requires a total rewrite to make the emphasis totally on the international experience, that would be a "scrap and start over," which is delete. However, if it were rewritten before the end of AfD to talk about this person as an international athlete rather than a Witchita State athlete, it would be fine to stay. The distinction may seem fine, but the reasoning is sound: college sports teams will field dozens of athletes on varsity alone, and these will change year to year to year. Attempting to profile each and every one, when well over 99% will not achieve further fame, is folly, so college sport team profiles are very properly out. Olypians are in because they are inevitably and by default written up in national press and go into international record books. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:29, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>That article is fishy. There is a claim by proponents of <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remote_viewing.html" title="Remote viewing">remote viewing</a> that it was developed by the CIA, a claim which appears calculated to lend it a credibility which scientists reject. As far as I can tell the only cited source for the existence of the contracxt which underpins that claim is a (falsifiable) copy on a scientology website which does not actually imply anything much other than funding to investigate and certainly does not imply that the CIA originated the idea; CIA sources indicate that they gave some support to several programmes investigating psychic phenomena but that all such support is long-since terminated. Much use is made of the fact that it's all so secret that of course the Government won't talk about it, but I have never bought the idea of leak-free conspiracies (it didn't work for Richard Nixon and I don't see it working here either). So all articles which make these claims need ot be viewed with a sceptical eye. I think their comment on the remote viewers is along the lines of "the guy died, we haven't heard from him since". As far as I can tell it's a minor if interesting sidenote to the lunacy of the cold war, made out to be a massive endorsement of psychic phenomena by a bunch of scientologists pushing a barrow. I'd say that everythign that can encyclopaedically be said about these characters is already at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_Project_91b3.html" title="Stargate Project">Stargate Project</a> anyway. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 17:27, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> on condition of a rewrite. I agree with Dominick, but think the article has notability. SRI is a very shady connection, anyone who knows their past, and is more or less a joke (partially financed by tax dollars better spent on scientific projects or housing the poor). The article reeks of POV to support remote viewing as an actuality and needs to be fixed. Thus, some explanations that the CIA project NEVER revealed anything of value in remote viewing and SRI never proved anything other than parapsy. can be fooled by sleight of hand should counter balance the claims. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 10:21, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Fancruft" doesn't mean articles written with malicious intent, it just means things that are only of interest to people who are already fans and probably already know the content. Most fancruft is written in good faith by people who just don't realize how narrow their subculture/fandom is.

<dd>Once upon a time, I'd have agreed with you there. But what the speaker <i>meant</i> tends to be unimportant when it comes to insulting words; the speaker's targets tend to get upset regardless. I don't doubt Metros232 (or anyone else who uses the phrase) intended any offence, because back when I was throwing it about with gay abandon I didn't mean to offend anyone either; but offence is, nonetheless, the end result.

<p>This could arguably be speedied as A7 since it makes no assertion of notability, but there is some chance that this might be a notable subject just stated in a horribly precious way. That part of the article which is vaguely encyclopaedic hints that it is a copyvio from an exhibition catalogue. Absent any evidence of notability, though, I'd say it's not worth the effort of finding out and fixing the article. I can't claim to be an aret luvvie but I have been known to visit Tate Modern and I loved the white boxes installation, so this is not a "delete all living artists" nomination. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:37, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to request that the nominator withdraws this AfD for the time being. It was proposed for deletion only 8 hours after I put a notability tag on the article, the purpose of which is to give the chance for establishing notability with a warning that, if this is not done, the article will be proposed for deletion. I do not regard it as proper etiquette to completely ignore this and propose for deletion regardless, particularly as the nominator has even stated, "there is some chance that this might be a notable subject." I left a message on the editor's talk page and he has come back to me with some substantial references, including exhibiting with the likes of <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damien_Hirst_e56d.html" title="Damien Hirst">Damien Hirst</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Lucas_dd1e.html" title="Sarah Lucas">Sarah Lucas</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/v/Gavin_Turk_cf49.html" title="Gavin Turk">Gavin Turk</a>, and being acknowledged by, amongst others, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisa_Buck_fa58.html" title="Louisa Buck">Louisa Buck</a>. I was, furthermore, already familiar with this artist before the entry on Wiki even appeared. I am a member of two relevant Wiki projects, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Contemporary_Art_507d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Contemporary Art">WikiProject Contemporary Art</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Visual_arts_ab0a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Visual arts">WikiProject Visual arts</a>. We are trying to improve the poor coverage of art on Wiki, my interest being particularly in contemporary art. I request co-operation from other Wiki editors to this end. It would be helpful if proposed art/artists AfD could be run past members of the projects first, as we have some knowledge of the subject, which may not always be clear from a cursory investigation. Some artists, for example, can achieve huge hits on google via various blogs etc, but are not necessarily notable. Others can hold a reputable position via shows, catalogues and books etc, which may not equate with google hits. I am in the middle of a dialogue with the editor of the article, and the material being provided at the moment, when it presented correctly, looks as though it will pass muster and make a proper article. We need to encourage new editors in this area, who by definition will probably make a mess of their inital editing attempts, not being familiar with Wiki's particular requirements (which are different to the way art may be written about elsewhere) but that is no reason to <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">BITE</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Assuming that the nominator chooses not to withdraw, and having read your exchange with the writer, my vote stands. Campbell's "claim to fame" appears to be interpolating his works into others' exhibitions, and exhibiting at spaces that, when I lived in London anyway, were available for rent. If the writer comes up with any of the claimed press coverage (even issues and page references will do), then it'd be time to change the vote. There's more than enough time to do so.<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 08:39, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe. That is why I put the notabilty and other tags on the article, and what I am in the process of finding out. It would be better to start an AfD, if necessary, knowing the facts, rather than guessing them. However, whether the subject meets wiki notability requirements or not, the information given, if correct, certainly shows the subject has received proper art school training and is a committed practitioner, involved with the contemporary London art scene. Some of the comments made in the AfD are, to say the least, frivolous. Established editors may not realise the effect of these on newbies. In this case it is as follows: <i>I hadn’t counted on my innocent contribution Re: The Artist - Andrew Campbell - being met by such a cynical and – quite frankly – offensive...response from a bunch of people who blatantly know little about art.

</ul>
<p>They are one the sport's most historic clubs and have a long history of playing the sport at a high level. I understand why people would not wish for any University Club to be allowed in to the Wikipedia but in deleting Edinburgh University Shinty Club one would have to delete all University Sport pages such as the following, <a href="../../../u/c/l/UCLA_athletics_5cab.html" title="UCLA athletics">UCLA athletics</a> and also delete any club or team in any sport with an academic connection in their name such as <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Academical_F.C._7572.html" title="Hamilton Academical F.C.">Hamilton Academical F.C.</a>. Edinburgh University have always catered for non-students as well and until very recently played against non-academic teams.</p>
<p>In giving a complete picture of the sport of Shinty it is necessary to give a list of all teams who play the game. I have no vested interest in promoting Edinburgh University Shinty Club.

<li><b>Keep</b> Shinty is not a small Sport, whilst it is mostly confined to Scotland, it is a very popular game with important historic linkages to communities and peoples, to merge all clubs into the one article would be small-minded and petty.. For example, Edinburgh Univeristy merits a mention at least in connection with <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorley_MacLean_efd4.html" title="Sorley MacLean">Sorley MacLean</a>, the famous <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Gaelic_b039.html" title="Scottish Gaelic">Gaelic</a> poet as well as their long history of competition. One is of the opinion that "University" should not necessarily tar a club as being a "University" club per se. (See my earlier point.). the clubis not a drinking club or some jolly fraternity, it is a copmetitive club competing at a national level.<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESologoal_a1a7.html" title="User:Sologoal">Sologoal</a> 10:36, 21 May 2006 (UTC)<small>—This comment was really added by User:Cabers</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - This subject is one of the most highly notable figures in Internet history, and I'm rather surprised that this has been renominated yet again -- if, for instance, a section of the article is considered A6 fodder, what is preventing editors from deleting it rather than sending yet another AfD?

<li><b>Keep</b>. On the contrary, there are very good reasons. The Little Flames article as it stands could have been speedy deleted as an article on a band with no assertions of notability. The other article asserts notability by saying that they have toured the UK in support of the Coral and that they will be supporting the Arctic Monkeys, which would qualify them under WP:MUSIC. The best thing would be to expand the correctly titled article to establish notability to avoid the prospect of deletion. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 23:33, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is not an opinion. This is a discussion on Mythology. I'm not saying "This is what I think about mythology." This is the same as saying that not every person has the same fingerprints. No two people can see a story in the same light. It isn't an opinion, it is truth. You may not ike to be wrong, but this article is NOT an op[inion, and it will NOT go away! If you can cite one statement that is an opinion, do so. Otherwise, find some else to bother. JonnyLaw2121 17:05, 18 May 2006</p>

<p>Savvy Miss is a brand new web community for women, which launched last week. Wikipedia has pages for almost all of the current women's magazines, and should therefore include Savvy Miss in its database. Savvy Miss is unique, because instead of tauting unhealthy body images, dieting, archaic beauty rituals or doing anything to make your man happy, it instead empowers and inspires women. The content encourages women to pursue careers outside the realm of more traditional female jobs and promotes nonprofit organizations and volunteering. --Missshmu 17:02, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Deprodded by me; Rbanzai latter added the afd1 template to the article but didn't complete the rest of the process, so I'm finishing it for him. Brenda Barrie is an author with a published novel, The Binding (2005, RockWay Press, low Amazon sales rank, but stocked by Amazon itself, not an affiliate). She has also published a collection of poetry, <i>Full Speed. Full Stop</i> in 2003, also from RockWay press, which I couldn't find on Amazon. RockWay press is not a vanity publisher, I checked. Her official website includes a "reviews and comments" section, but no reviewers give affiliations with press. The damning stroke for me is <a href="http://www.brendabarrie.com/my_writing.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brendabarrie.com/my_writing.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, which lists the WP articles on her and her novel on her own web page: apparently, these are here for promotion.

<p>Although I hate to do it, I nominate this article for deletion. It is hardly enycyclopedic and it will never end! The title, (List of songs with the word "song" in their title or lyrics), is what really got to me. Do we really need a dynamic list of songs and albums that include a single word. What's next, <i>List of songs with the word "of" in their title or lyrics</i>?

<li><b>Delete</b> at a quick guesstimate there's over 1,500 entries here and they barely step outside the bounds of the last 20 years. Any serious attempt to make this list ocmplete would result in the servers imploding. Do we include Dowland's books of songs because they incuded the word song in the name of the book? Do we include lute songs? Lieder? Lieder ohne worte? A list whose selection criteria are utterly arbitrary and of no known significance, which potentially contains many huyndreds of thousands of songs going back hundreds of years. Did I let slip the fact that I don't think much of the conept of this list?

<li><b>Keep</b> The article has existed for more than three years and has been edited over 500 times by a lot of different users and IP-numbers; apparently there is some kind of interest from the community and readers in this list, and I don't really like the idea of just throwing away their work. In the absence of a general policy on "lists of songs according to this or that", and with the above-mentioned lists and AfDs as examples that we keep and maintain many strange things in this field, I'd rather err on the inclusionist side.

Even though it does have a long history, I still can't get over the fact that this is listcruft.

Furthermore, the likening of "The Swedish Lie" to the "Joy Luck Club" was made by the author herself in her own press releases. This appears to be a case of 1. claiming to win an award that was not won and 2. self-promotion. Any buzz about the author is a result of the author herself. {{unsigned|71.16.188.227}</li>

<li>Weak Keep - in spite of the controversy - if she IS the first American novelist to write about the concept of Jante's Law, that would seem to be not nothing. I agree with the rest, that most of the hype appears to have been generated by the author herself. I also agree with the first poster that it may seem to be a "remove without prejudice" thing - if she does ever accomplish anything independent Wiki writers would find noteworthy, then a nonbiased article can be created. I'm going to stick with the weak keep because if she has introduced Jante's Law to non-Scandinavian America, that is something to consider. If the issue is that it probably meets Wiki standards for autobiography/self-promotion but does not meet the standard for notability, then I sway to reluctant delete. My official vote stands, however.Littleshakespeare 21:59, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>True - but the Amazon site for one of her books says it's basically sold out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1892161249/104-6543228-7683950?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1892161249/104-6543228-7683950?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> - I suspect that probably means &gt;5000.

Couple this with the 1.7-2.1M ranking on Amazon, we are led to nn-bio. So let's wait till she hits the big time, and hope she cleans up her act along the way.

<li><b>keep</b>. It is not one of Massenet's best-known operas, and apparently it was a failure in its own time (according to an obituary I looked up), but it seems to be available on CD, and a whole opera by a well-know composer must certainly be at least as notable as most of the six Ashlee Simpson songs or singles which have articles in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 12:39, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>haha, I sort of agree but Simpson's songs are notable according to Wiki guidelines whereas there are no guidelines to establish notability for operatic pieces so your reasoning is a little off when you cite Simpson's songs as reason for establishing notability of this piece. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 20:01, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Guidelines should, as I see it, be used to establish common standards for <i>inclusion</i>, but can never establish standards for <i>exclusion</i> of anything but the most typical cases. Where no guidelines exist, one either has to use common sense or extrapolate from existing guidelines and practices by making rough comparisons like the one I made above. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 20:22, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I simply disagree completely with the first statement. Guidelines must establish a standard for which items must meet otherwise they should be discluded. Regarding the second statement, any extrapolation of the current standards to apply to this article would be reaching since those standards are largely created as a judge of contemporary creations. Thus debating on this piece as notable is merely subjective opinion regardless of whether one believes it should be kept or deleted. A standard for this time of work should be created. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 23:35, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment/Question</b> NY Yankee Boards is a major piece to the Invision Free forum directory and is one of the most popular New York Yankees message boards on the internet. This article's purpose is to not advertise, but to inform of such a big-time place. Can you please tell me what would be required to change in order to keep this article up? --Fazio 20:19, 18 May 2006 (ET)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, a link on the Yankees article is sufficient. All the same, can you provide some objective verification that this board is in greater use than other Yankees forums? -- <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStubblyhead_0a29.html" title="User:Stubblyhead">stubblyh</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">ea</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">d</a> | <sup><a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStubblyhead_555f.html" title="User talk:Stubblyhead">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_stubblyhead_ad64.html" title="Special:Contributions/stubblyhead">c</a></sub> 01:10, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep/Comment</b> I have put up some information in the first section of the page, explaining how NY Yankee Boards leads Invision Free in most hits by a baseball forum and has attracted many members from numerous amounts of places. Members tend to choose us over the message boards of the YES Network, the Yankees' official television station, and Yankees.com, the team's official site. If there is anything that needs to be added or elaborated, please tell me. --Fazio 21:22, 18 May 2006 (ET)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Keep this page. It is a good board and contributes to invisionfree, which is a major message board host. If you have an article on invisionfree, you should have an article on examples of invisionfree boards. --Yankeestom 22:02, 18 May 2006 (ET)</li>
