<p>This page is an attempt to make a collection of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precedent.html" title="Precedent">precedent</a>-setting <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Votes for Deletion</a> decisions. These decisions are either a record of the first time Wikipedians have confronted a certain issue, or the first time a convention-breaking decision was reached. It only includes those decisions that have the potential to decide the fate of large numbers of articles.</p>
<p>While pages like <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a> play an important role in VfD decisions the body of precedent also plays a crucial role. However those precedents tend to be only vaguely remembered and only by veteran Wikipedians. It is hoped this page can act as a quick reference to remind old users and educate new ones of previous VfD decisions.</p>
<p>It is also hoped this page can also help reduce the arbitrariness of deletions by creating a more concrete body of examples of what merits inclusion.</p>
<p>Note that some of these precedents are long outdated and should probably be revisited, after that is done this page should be updated.</p>

<li><a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_flux.html" title="Quantum flux">Quantum flux</a> The definition is absolutely wrong. "Quantum flux" is not a term used in any branch of physics I'm aware of. -- <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECYD_b425.html" title="User:CYD">CYD</a>
<ul>
<li>The term is used in at least one journal article I found on google (abstract: <a href="http://flux.aps.org/meetings/YR9596/BAPSMAR96/abs/S3230008.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://flux.aps.org/meetings/YR9596/BAPSMAR96/abs/S3230008.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), but I can't glean enough information from that usage to figure out what it means. Some searching through the physics SPIN journal database indicates that it's been used in 41 indexed articles in prominent peer-reviewed journals over the past decade, so it appears to be a legitimate but not very common term. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 05:10 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've got full text access to those SPIN hits, here's what I found. The SQUID people (like what Delirium found) seem to be talking about a magnetic flux -- some kind of magnetic effect which is inherent to the device rather than externally applied. There's a paper in Phys Rev D called "Quantum flux from a moving spherical mirror". They use it to mean particle (or probability) flux. It's closer to what Reddi's talking about. I'll quote some of it at Talk:Quantum flux. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 05:44 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The SQUID term refers to the magnetic flux quantum, which is a magnetic flux that is quantized due to the presence of a supercurrent. Using "quantum flux" to refer to it is okay, but it's not a precise technical term. The mirror stuff is obviously referring to a flux of photons. I'm putting up a temporary page, but I still think the page should be deleted -- there's really nothing to say except that the term "quantum flux" is confused. -- <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECYD_b425.html" title="User:CYD">CYD</a></li>

<li>Is there a policy supporting the presence of interwiki redirects? I don't like them. If someone clicks on an internal link in the Wikipedia, they expect to stay in the Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. In traditional Chinese society, surnames were one of the most important determinants of social standing. Up until the twentieth century surname-based organisations were the largest corporate bodies in China. Because of their important as a sociological phenomenon, Chinese surnames should be kept. --<a href="../../../j/i/e/User%7EJie_a3c2.html" title="User:Jie">Jie</a> 13:34, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Since I contributed the bulk of the page, let me explain the value of the page. First, the number of Chinese surnames are very limited compared to those of other cultures. There is a few hundred for almost 1 billion people. There are almost 15 million Zheng/Cheng. If only a small percentage of those people cared to know about the history of their family-clan, then it is sitll a large number of people. Why would they be interested? The family plays a very central role in most Chinese families. The history of one's family-clan is as important to some as the history of one's nation or state. With 15 million or more members, Zheng might be bigger than some states or even nations. One need not look beyond the "Tongs" of the various China Towns to understand the importance of the family-clan to the Chinese. These "Tongs" are organizations that only has the surname as a requirement to join. In the past, these organizations helped Chinese immigrants to foreign countries despite the fact that many of its members are strangers to each other and share only a common surname and family history. Once again, the family-clan serves its role in Chinese culture. Thus, the history of a family is of interest to a signficant number of people. The bulk of information here is probably better than what can easily be found on Google. It took some effort on my part to find even this much -- the rest of it is in Chinese. I don't see why the existence of 20 or so such articles on the the Wiki should be such a problem as long as the content is good. With 20 or so Chinese surnames, you can cover the family-clan history of 50% of the Chinese population, which is 1/12 or so of the world's population (assuming China still has 1/6 of the world's population). Lastly, there is a complete listing of all the Chinese surnames in the Wikipedia. This and other articles serves as an extension of that article so as to give depth to it. Chinese surnames are of great value to anyone seeking to understand the culture and history. Personally, I would love to see the expansion of these articles so that the history of the houses of other cultures can be known. It is another way to tie people into history and generate interest. Perhaps these articles are not the most scholarly but they are certainly of interest to a large number of people. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComatose51_3c23.html" title="User:Comatose51">Comatose51</a> 09:33, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<li>I considered members of what I consider to be equivalent local government in my locality and decided that <i>they</i> didn't merit inclusion.

<li>Personally, my line is "effect outside of the local realm." It's the same as a local restaurant. If it affects only the town, it's not encyclopedic. If it affects beyond the town, it is. So the Mayor of New York City is in, because he leads in a number of ways. Borough Presidents, though, affect only their particular 1/5th of NYC. Thus, the political leader of a city, even a small one, gets in, but legislators and office holders usually don't. Some, though, like <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliot_Spitzer_3963.html" title="Eliot Spitzer">Eliot Spitzer</a>, or several like him in California, make the news, lead the nation in prosecution, regulate important industries (like the NYSE), etc. I try to distinguish between the purely local and the local but notable. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:37, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<li>Political leader of a city? That would depend how you define 'city'.

<li>Again, this is my personal criterion. However, all mayors, even of cities with tiny populations, get state duties and representation, have rights with regard to state actions, etc. I.e. they affect the world beyond their towns, and not in the "has many friends" or "was enjoyed by children of all ages" way. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:04, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hmm, I was going to agree with deleting, but that is quite a major and professionally done site, and the counter indicates it's gotten over 2m visitors. If accurate that's probably on the borderline of encyclopedic, though the article should be slightly changed to note that his 'claim to fame' is the website, not his academic work in egyptology. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 21:45 25 Jul 2003 (UTC)

<li>I agree with Delirium--the site would be his best argument for inclusion.

<li>I doubt this article will ever be useful due to the lack of any acceptable definition of what counts as an ethnic group. (i.e. my grandmother will punch anyone that calls her Italian, but few people actually recognize Sicilian as a distinct ethnic group and language.) The only direct link is <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_group.html" title="Ethnic group">ethnic group</a> (a redirect) which should be an actual article IMHO. <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokerboy_c727.html" title="User:Tokerboy">Tokerboy</a> 04:29 Nov 15, 2002 (UTC)

<li>According to <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/language_index.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/language_index.asp" rel="nofollow">the Ethnologue</a>, there are 6,800 main languages--virtually all of them (except sign languages, Esperanto, etc) are probably a distinct ethnic group. There are also 41,000 dialects, according to Ethnologue. If even 1/10 of them are also ethnic groups, we're talking about a list 10,000 long. It would be nice, but not feasible. <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokerboy_c727.html" title="User:Tokerboy">Tokerboy</a> 09:47 Nov 15, 2002 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is Everything2ish. While it might be fun, it's trivia and doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. Also, these lists will necessarily become overwhelmingly long when it's more than the pet bands of a few contributors; if people started adding in all of the songs from many different musical genres and locations.

As for who should be the judge, I'm not going to propose any new decision-making policy; I followed normal procedures and put it on votes for deletion for discussion. As for the fact that many people find it interesting, that is not and has never been one of the criteria for whether something stays in Wikipedia. Many people on Wikipedia find long, drawn-out debates interesting, but we try to discourage that stuff anyway, because this is an encyclopedia and not a debate forum. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanKeshet_ba33.html" title="User:DanKeshet">DanKeshet</a> 22:08 Mar 5, 2003 (UTC)</li>

<li>Gee, you almost convinced me.

<li>EncyclopÃ¦dias <i>do</i> list countries, and <i>do</i> list prominent gay/lesbian/bisexual people. They don't list rubbish like this list.

<li>Don't think that reviews should be in Wikipedia, inherently NPOV. <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheijmans_2d7f.html" title="User:Jheijmans">Jeronimo</a></li>
<li>Agreed. I had this here before, but <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Cunctator_a9b6.html" title="User:The Cunctator">user:The Cunctator</a> removed it. I forgot why. But glossing over a review and attributing it to the reviewer (e.g. Roger Ebert) is not the same as including the entire review as an "article" of its own. Collecting reviews is, IMO, not what we're here for.

<li>An article on this kind of jokes is fine, and one or two examples are also fine, but this many is useless. It is impossible to list all such jokes here, and unnecessary as well.

<li>I respectfully disagree -- having complete source material of this length is counter to our stated mission: we are an encyclopedia (hence we condense and summarize human knowledge, not regurgitate it), to be <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">NPOV</a> (hence we can't have POV material -- and a speech is inherently POV), we are a wiki (hence people should be able to edit and change material (therefore changing what GW said). Now having an article on the speech would be a very good thing. Then it would be appropriate to extract short passages for explanatory purposes (still not the best for a wiki but less material means there is less text to keep track of to make sure it is what he actually said).

<li>Food for thought: This was a vandal's nonsense, which was removed and replaced with a stub. But it's an awful stub. It's a single sentence that serves only as a definition. There's actually more content on the redirect page <a href="../../../p/l/u/Pluto.html" title="Pluto">Pluto</a>!

<li>The reason is that seeing a live link to [A] in the article [B] gives the impression that [A] has been written, which in this case was not true. (Well, it was written at <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hades.html" title="Hades">Hades</a>, so I redirected it there. But the principle remains.) [A] should also appear on <a href="../../../w/a/n/Special%7EWantedpages_a3ac.html" title="Special:Wantedpages">Special:Wantedpages</a>, which can't happen if a worthless stub is there. A page can definitely do more harm than good if it makes readers more likely to follow a useless link, or makes writers less likely to write a new needed page. If I can't write a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_stub_article_271a.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect stub article">good stub</a> (see point 5 in particular), then I'd rather not have one at all, for these reasons â <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7EToby_Bartels_e090.html" title="User:Toby Bartels">Toby</a> 02:35 Aug 15, 2002 (PDT)</li>

<li>As the initial author of how to demonstrate osmosis with eggs [but not potato slices]] I can't see what your obvious reasons are. If you'd be kind enough to spell them out explicitly I could defend the page better but: here goes anyhow. Osmosis is an important topic and IMO experiments that demonstrate the principle liven up the topic. This is a particularly simple experiment, which any potential reader who has an interest in osmosis can perform. In writing the article I was guided by the <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow-to_dba1.html" title="Wikipedia:How-to">Wikipedia:How-topage</a> which states that instructions for doing things are suitable for wikipedia even if they do not ordinarily occur in a paper encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa knott</a> 20:12 Feb 26, 2003 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am against howtos on Wikipedia, because it is very hard to write them in an NPOV-compliant way. The existing Ä§ow-tos demonstrate this very well. The original author usually has a particular idea how to do a certain thing and does not care to supply or research alternatives. Moreso, an NPOV HOWTO would probably read terrible ("Do this .. but you could also do this. Some people suggest doing that first.

<li>Bush family conspiracy theory - for all the rewrites this is still a ludicrously paranoid fantasist's dream article. It is neither encylopÃ¦dic nor NPOV just some garbled wacky theories from those who believe the Bush family should really be renamed the 'Antichrist' family. The fact that after various attempts by competent contributors it is still bordering on the looney suggests this is an article that deserves the bin or its own page on the 'nutty conspiracies' website, not a page in a credible encyclopÃ¦dia. (The fact that it has <i>me</i> defending the Bush family is indicative of how nutty the page is, for I am not exactly a fan of the political version of the Brady Bunch!) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÃIREANN</a> 02:33 12 Jun 2003 (UTC)

<li>As it stands now this article doesn't seem to me to be anything like as bad as you are making out, Jtdirl.

<li>It isn't widely held, it is not a common theory, stating it is true is POV and the article at present in paranoid rubbish.

<li>I really don't think it is appropriate to infer that I am "paranoid" for believing such "rubbish". Just because you support Bush, doesn't mean everybody does.

<li>As an actual US resident, I can state authoritatively that various conspiracy theories are indeed widespread among the Democrats, and it should be Wikipedia's duty to at least list the claims and the factual tidbits on which they're based, as well as the other facts tending to discredit. It's hard to find NPOV writeups on many of the theories, this is the kind of thing that would make Wikipedia stand out on the web. For instance, my wife the Bush-hater hears some of these theories from her friends, and I'm always wishing for an objective source that explains the situation. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 21:26 12 Jun 2003 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Agreed, no reason to delete any of them. Forever free, not tied to any commercial concern, etc. etc. One thing that could certainly be said about Wikipedia's articles on movies and TV shows, though, is that they would benefit from some standardization (especially in terms of the nice things that IMDB does, such as links on all cast and crew), but that'd be hard to implement in the Wikipedia format (since we prefer linking on commonly-used names; disambiguation would be a nightmare for larger collections).

<li>Keep. "Notable" is a dubious and subjective rule of thumb. At least merge and redir to its municipality. The information is useful, if trivial -- which makes accurate information on the topic hard to find and is reason enough for inclusion. I urge you to read Jimbo Wales' comments about this topic here: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" rel="nofollow">Wiki is not paper</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavodd_2d13.html" title="User:Davodd">Davodd</a> 18:02, Sep 3, 2004 (UTC)</li>

It is the duty of the article to establish notability when first inserted. The bar should be set low, but it should be there. Notability is important because topics that are not notable are very unlikely ever to get verified and may not even be verifiable. Saying "all high schools deserve entries" is, I think, equivalent to saying anything goes. Either anything goes or not just anything goes. I'm darned if I see a principle that would rule that "high schools are in but primary schools are out," whereas I have no trouble with "notable ANYTHING is in, and non-notable ANYTHING is out." I just re-read <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWiki_is_not_paper_5ec4.html" title="Wikipedia:Wiki is not paper">Wikipedia:Wiki_is_not_paper</a> and saw nothing there that would argue that low-information articles on non-notable trivia should be kept.

<li><i>It is the duty of the article to establish notability when first inserted.</i> This is not Wikipedia policy, and it begs the question as notability is what this page is all about determining. <i>Notability is important because topics that are not notable are very unlikely ever to get verified and may not even be verifiable.</i> Notability is important because if something isn't notable then it's not worthy of note, so by the very definition of notability it shouldn't be included. But as for verifiability, all high schools in Ottawa are verifiable through government documents. <i>I'm darned if I see a principle that would rule that "high schools are in but primary schools are out," whereas I have no trouble with "notable ANYTHING is in, and non-notable ANYTHING is out."</i> Non-notable ANYTHING is certainly out. This follows from the very definition of notable. But if anything notable is in, then all high schools are in, because the decision has been made that all high schools are notable. Would you similarly argue against a rule that "all US Presidents are in"? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 18:32, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<p>Note that the above result is an anomaly -- most of them do in fact get voted for deletion, and only a few, depending on who shows up to VfD, and sometimes particular facts about the school/article length sway things. --<a href="../../../p/g/u/User%7EPgunn_d038.html" title="User:Pgunn">Improv</a> 06:32, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Which ones get voted for vfd is a precedent, not a fundamental truth on a subject's worthiness. I've seen many school articles up for vfd, and I've never seen one without potential. I've never seen a school article which would confuse or misinform users actually looking for information on a different subject, and I've never seen a school article with <i>no</i> notability, <i>no</i> way to verify facts, or inherent, incurable bias (which would always be good reasons for deletion). --<a href="../../../l/3/3/User%7EL33tminion_371f.html" title="User:L33tminion">L33tminion</a> | <a href="../../../l/3/3/User_talk%7EL33tminion_b015.html" title="User talk:L33tminion">(talk)</a> 23:40, Nov 1, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>High schools are currently on heavy debate. Universities are by nature notable, but for high schools this is doubtful. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 22:37, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>All secondary educational institutions are inherently noteworthy. Then when you take into consideration that we have <b>plenty</b> of room on Wikipedia for minor Star Trek characters who appear in a <i>single episode</i>, Pokemon gymnasium instructors, minor Nintendo power-up items, and Star Wars planets, technologies, battleships and even Star Wars <i>laws</i>, it really begs to be asked why we're even discussing the notability of high schools. --GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 19:17, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)
