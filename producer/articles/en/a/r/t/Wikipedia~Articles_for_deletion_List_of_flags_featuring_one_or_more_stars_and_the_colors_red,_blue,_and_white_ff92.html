<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was delete.</p>
<p>The community consensus was clearly for deletion with 19 people unconvinced by any of the arguments in favor of keeping it. I count only one "keep as is", 3 "keep as redirect or merge" and one that was too ambiguous to call.</p>
<p>Phil is correct that the merger which happened while the discussion was on-going complicates the decision. This is exactly why we <b>strongly discourage</b> any mergers while the discussion is in progress.

<li><b>Delete</b>, <b>Delete</b>, <b>Delete</b>. The flag of my country feaures one or more stars and the colours red blue and white but someone decided that it doesn't qualify. Let me say again in case I haven't made it clear, the title of this page lists flags ''<i>featuring one or more stars and the colors red, blue, and white"</i> but there are flags <i>"featuring one or more stars and the colors red, blue, and white"</i> which are not permitted on the page.

<li>Again, the relevant section of <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_the_United_States_f8f6.html" title="Flag of the United States">Flag of the United States</a> seems to make the point more clearly than the title of this article, making a merge there appropriate. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 02:30, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Negative. The <b>Flags with a similar design</b> section of <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_the_United_States_f8f6.html" title="Flag of the United States">Flag of the United States</a> features 12 flags. Six of them do not have stars, and six of them are not coloured red white and blue. What an earth could the point be of merging <i>List of flags featuring one or more stars and the colors red, blue, and white</i> in that section. What on earth is the point of <i>List of flags featuring one or more stars and the colors red, blue, and white</i> anyway, when a flag fitting that specification is not permitted in the article? <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 02:48, September 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point was apparently the same as that of "Flags with a similar design", only with stricter and more arbitrary criteria. Clearly, the point is better made in the newly merged version of "Flags with a similar design". — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 02:57, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If the topic of the article is <i>flags featuring one or more stars and the colours red, blue and white</i> then the flag of New Zealand qualifies. No one ever said it was <i>flags featuring <b>only</b> one or more stars and the colours red, blue and white</i>. Heck, if it was, over half of those flags in there would be disqualified, as they obviously feature stripes, which are not stars. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 07:37, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Do your homework. You will see that User:Blahma removed the New Zealand flag September 3 because although it is red white and blue with stars it has a red white and blue something else in the corner.
<ul>
<li>I repeat, where does it say the flags have to <b>only</b> feature one or more stars and the colours red, blue and white? <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 08:59, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you hard of hearing? ):- ..Do You Homework. The introduction criteria in the article specified the following - <i>"This is a selected list of 'flags featuring one or more stars and the colors red, blue, and white'. <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag.html" title="Flag">Flags</a> listed here contain at least one star and contain three different colors: <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red.html" title="Red">red</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue.html" title="Blue">blue</a>, and <a href="../../../w/h/i/White.html" title="White">white</a>"</i>. So, I added the New Zealand flag which qualifies under that specification, and on September 3 User:Blahma removed it, stating <i>"removed flag of NZ <b>(features the Union Jack)"</b></i> and announcing some sort of nebulous change to the criteria. The fact is, it doesn't matter where you want to put a list of XXXX, if everything that qualifies as XXXX isn't allowed to be included, then the article about XXXX must not be allowed to exist on Wikipedia. Unless there has suddenly been a new policy adopted that censorship rules. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 09:39, September 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, my reply was too confusing. I know the New Zealand flag was removed because it contains other pictures than stars. But what I wanted to say was that nowhere in the title <i>List of flags featuring one or more stars and the colours red, blue and white</i> can I find anything saying other pictures aren't allowed. If the Union Jack isn't allowed it should be mentioned in the name of the list, not as an additional rule added later. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 10:28, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do not understand what is the aversion to the inclusion of the Union Flag! The Union Flag is red, blue and white (perchance the founding fathers of America used the same colours since it was prior to their UDI a British colony), and therefore if the list includes or or more stars New Zealand DOES qualify. As does <a href="../../../t/u/v/Tuvalu.html" title="Tuvalu">Tuvalu</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cook_Islands_1c39.html" title="Cook Islands">Cook Islands</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/y/Cayman_Islands_08a3.html" title="Cayman Islands">Cayman Islands</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/u/Niue.html" title="Niue">Niue</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Dependency_a6ce.html" title="Ross Dependency">Ross Dependency</a> and more .... or do not ANY of these count since they are not US-centric nations. <b>STRONG DELETE</b> for this very badly written article!!!! <a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhyddfrydol_22ef.html" title="User:Rhyddfrydol">Rhyddfrydol</a> 22:51 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, but before insulting the article as being <i>very badly written</i>, maybe you could bother to read through the whole discussion and find what its original purpose was and so what cause did that "aversion" against the Union Flag have. As I told below, I won't repeat nor evolve here anything further, but just two hints are: 1. The purpose was to distinguish between some very similar flags which consist a virtual group, so mixing them with flags from other groups does not do much good. 2. The flag of NZ was deleted at the same time when the criteria was clarified, but later someone for some reason generalized the criteria again, so now really the flag of NZ would qualify. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahma_d385.html" title="User:Blahma">Blahma</a> 00:03, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Not only is the article very badly written, it is extreme in its generalisation, an insult to the science of Vexillology, and as such no place in Wikipedia.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. I am the original creator of the article and would like to defend its purpose here. But first thanks to <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">User:Henrygb</a>, who put the AfD template to the article's page, because without it I would not notice this discussion at all. Well, and now: I got the idea first while at <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Youth_Day_2005_e961.html" title="World Youth Day 2005">an international event</a>, where there were thousands flags displayed by individual participants. I could easily recognize a lot of them, but there were some which kept both me and all my friends confused and uncertain. If you live in Europe and do not meet those flags so often, you really can't tell the difference between e.g. the flags of <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Texas_d8c6.html" title="Flag of Texas">Texas</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Chile_996a.html" title="Flag of Chile">Chile</a>, or the flags of <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Cuba_e6de.html" title="Flag of Cuba">Flag of Cuba</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Puerto_Rico_5ccd.html" title="Flag of Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> (which is often a crucial difference, in terms of the language and/or the general background you may await while addressing the person who is waving this flag). That's why I thought it'd be handy if also we here in Europe could have an easy way how to make the things clear and see all those similar flags in one place, without having to look them up in the list of all existing country flags. Now I hope I have made it a bit more clear while e.g. the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_New_Zealand_c485.html" title="Flag of New Zealand">flag of New Zealand</a> has not been included (please don't feel offended for that just because you come from there). Also, to all you U.S. guys over there, sorry, but the similarity with the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_the_United_States_f8f6.html" title="Flag of the United States">U. S. flag</a> was also not the original idea, though now it has become a considerable one. I agree that maybe the article title as is now is a bit confusing, too long and looking to be too specific. Still I suggest the article should not be deleted (because of its prospective usage described above) - maybe rather splitted into several articles like "List of flags similar to the flag of Texas", "List of flags similar to the flag of Cuba" etc. But I just alert that with this solution, another problems appear like which flag is the "base one" and which are the "derivatives" etc. Also, I think that unless you prove that all of the listed flags have been inspired by the U.S. flag, this article should not be merged with that one, since then its original purpose will vanish as you will have to either break up the list (and along with that its original purpose) or introduce false facts into the article on the U. S. flag. I hope I have not sounded too bossy or boring, just wanted to explain my motives and opinions. I am open to any further discussions. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahma_d385.html" title="User:Blahma">Blahma</a> 11:55, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>OK, can I feel offended about the New Zealand flag not being included when I don't come from there (in fact I come from pretty much directly across the entire world from New Zealand)? If the title of the article is <i>List of flags featuring one or more stars and the colours red, blue and white</i>, it doesn't make sense not to include a flag featuring one or more stars and the colours red, blue and white, as the New Zealand flag does. If you want to amend the rules to exclude flags that feature the Union Jack, rename the article to List of flags featuring one or more stars and the colours red, blue and white but not the Union Jack. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 12:12, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, let's do that and rename the article. Anyway, I too am not really contented with its current name. But first we have to settle on some name, which would clearly describe the list. I think that you too will agree that the title you just proposed ("...but not the Union Jack") would make the title even longer and less straight-forward. I have tried to give explanation on the purpose of this list above, but fail to find out a good name so far. Probably we should start from the other end, and not give the name according to what the flags feature, but rather to the similarities. Still, my worries about listing it simply as being derivates of the U. S. flags are expressed above. If you propose a fitting solution for another name, I am for <b>rename</b> as well. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahma_d385.html" title="User:Blahma">Blahma</a> 12:24, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yet something worth thinking over: Originally I did not intent to include the U. S. flag in the list and the goal was just to list all flags which feature a <i>single</i> star and the colors mentioned. Also the title, which originally was <i>List of flags featuring a star and the colors red, blue and white</i>, respected this original intention. However, somehow also I got influenced by the ubiquitous U. S. flag and decided to include this as well, maybe also because of historical reasons and its relationship with some of those flags already listed. Now I think I could withdraw from it (also in order to make the original purpose of showing just <i>really similar</i> flags together), so we could resign on listing the U. S. flag, which would make it easier to find a suitable title for the article (maybe something which would include <i>lone star flags</i>, as this is a common enough term which could constitute a group of flags - but take this just as an idea). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahma_d385.html" title="User:Blahma">Blahma</a> 12:31, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A <i>gallery</i> of flags by design would not be a bad idea at all. Actually I recall I originally wanted to include this group of flags in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_flags_by_design.html" title="List of flags by design">List of flags by design</a>, but after finding out a list would not satisfy the purpose of the article (distinguishing between similar flags), I decided to start a new article. If we would make the present <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_flags_by_design.html" title="List of flags by design">List of flags by design</a> into a gallery (which I think would be a good idea, since if one is focused at the design, it would be good if they could see the designs immediately and all at once, instead of having to click on each of the links), then we could also easily incorporate the contents of this article into such a gallery and this article would become superfluous (and could be also redirected to that gallery). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahma_d385.html" title="User:Blahma">Blahma</a> 12:39, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, but I really do not consider this work of mine US-centric.

Also because of that job being almost done at this moment, I think we have reached a consensus and there is not much sense in discussing this further.
