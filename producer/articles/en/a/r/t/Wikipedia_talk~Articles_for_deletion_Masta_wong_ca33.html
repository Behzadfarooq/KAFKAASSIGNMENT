	    <p>What makes you think that this show is not "wide spread"??CNN &amp; New York times can cover the show and its contestant's and not wikipedia?? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Trppo (<a href="../../../t/r/p/User_talk%7ETrppo_d572.html" title="User talk:Trppo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trppo_d15b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trppo">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>As I said, this guy does not appear to be notable. The show, yes, but not its contestants. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 21:37, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is what you said about the show..."The show is not as wide spread as American Idol".What statistics do you use to compare between different shows.Those arguments that i have heard are very biased till now. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Trppo (<a href="../../../t/r/p/User_talk%7ETrppo_d572.html" title="User talk:Trppo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trppo_d15b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trppo">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>One more thing,you are forgetting,"Shows are run by the presence of its contestants &amp; just not by the name itself and the guy i mentioned won the show 3 times"...I would like to see,why are you only interested in mentioning the name of the show &amp; not the contestant who has won it??Notability does not only constitute the show's name itself but also the winning contestants who participated in the show.Lastly if you are denying the presence of the show itself in the visual media (where the show is quite nascent,in its second season only)then obviously it would be hard for you to believe in whoever wins it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Trppo (<a href="../../../t/r/p/User_talk%7ETrppo_d572.html" title="User talk:Trppo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trppo_d15b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trppo">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Because this show is only seen on a cable network and is only seen by those who have the network. American Idol is on a national broadcast station and has millions of people watching and voting; Pants-Off Dance-Off does not probably have half of that viewership. I've seen the show on separate occasions, it's a pretty ridiculous idea, and I haven't really watched much of it. I am in no way biased, where as you appear to be. This guy won three times; and he is not being written about in the New York Times or CNN, the show itself is. And please sign your comments with four tildes (~~~~), not by typing your username after your comments. --<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 00:29, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, I saw your commentary at the village pump. Please realize that you do not <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> what you put up on Wikipedia, it is editted and monitored by all of the users. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 00:35, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Question is still the same,How can you write about a show without mentioning its contestants???Those who win it,still deserve to be mentioned.(Trppo 00:39, 16 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because the show itself is not very widespread. There is no major prize at stake for stripping on camera. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 00:51, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I guess this is a pretty biased judgement about the show &amp; its contestants.The show is new and its sole concept is front camera stripping.Not anyone and everyone participates in the show and not anyone &amp; everyone wins the show!(Trppo 01:00, 16 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not being biased. This show is a year old, and anyone can participate on the show if they go to Fuse's studios and the show (as stated on the show's article) is the "dumbest show on television". Yes, there are articles on contestants of other shows (several <i><a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivor.html" title="Survivor">Survivor</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28TV_series%29_c8a7.html" title="Big Brother (TV series)">Big Brother</a></i> contestants have pages), but an article on a contestant that is longer than the article on the show itself is ridiculous. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 01:04, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>What i am trying to say is that not anyone/everyone has the courage to stand in front of the camera and strip,obviously you can go to any shows audition &amp; enter the show.Times are changing &amp; if it is allowed to strip in a show in front of the camera then it should also be allowed to mention about it... (Trppo 01:09, 16 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is not the issue here. The issue is whether or not the article on this single contestant should be included as part of Wikipedia according to guidelines set forth about notability. Stripping in front of a camera on a year-old cable TV show does not make him notable. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 01:12, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I guess this is the problem here,you are dissing the Cable TV,the show,the Contestant and the stripping....I still don't understand you want to have an article about the show and not its winner contestant??(Trppo 01:18, 16 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not dissing anything. Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> on your fellow editors. And there are plenty of articles about game shows that do not include anything about the contestants. <i>Pants-Off Dance-Off</i> will be one of them. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 01:23, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again,question is, why not???I haven't seen any good reasoning yet??My reasoning is ,we should accept new things and ideas even if they are in their nascency and are allowed to mention about those who participate in them..(Trppo 01:36, 16 August 2006 (UTC)).</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is not why the article is up for deletion. It is up for deletion because I have serious doubts as to the notability of the subject. Not about the newness of the subject. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 01:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am sorry i haven't seen an authentic reasoning yet? Personal "Serious Doubts"??...But anyways,i myself think that this article should not be up for deletion especially for above mentioned "Notability" issue! (Trppo 02:04, 16 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, then that decision will be made through the deletion process. I am not withdrawing my nomination for this deletion, and if it is decided that the article will not be deleted, then I will not try to get the article deleted in the future. The Wikipedia community will decide. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 02:06, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Lastly as we don't "own" the article , there should not be any "one" viewer deletion as well.(Trppo 02:06, 16 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please see <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>; and as I said above, this week of discussion on the article will decide whether or not the article should be deleted or kept. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 02:07, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And as a side note, this article will not be deleted because I believe it should, this article <b>may</b> be deleted if others decide my argument for its deletion is correct. Since you feel about the article so much, please make your ideas known in the actual AfD discussion, and not just this talk page. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 02:11, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>My final suggestion is that all deletions should be done weekly by "voting" only .That would then be free &amp; fair and would certainly allow a little bit of freedom of writing &amp; would check a restricted feeling!(Trppo 02:13, 16 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>Yes i do feel "very much" about what ever i write(otherwise i won't write them)...I would agree with the argumentative nautre of discussions if they are supported by a wider community...but again i do respect others views being supported by their own arguements...Thanks!(Trppo 02:16, 16 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>But that is not how deletion works, and that is not the problem here. AFDs are not votes, they are discussions on the merits of the article and whether or not it should be included. Again, as you strongly feel that the article should not be deleted, make that statement <font size="8"><b><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Masta_wong_f2a8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Masta wong">HERE</a></b></font>, not on the this talk page. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 02:17, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
