<p>Neologism. Apparently only Wikipedia and its mirror sites use this term: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22academic+seduction%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22academic+seduction%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Also contains lots of unsourced content for an article that boils down to "professors and students sometimes date each other". <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 00:46, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since the article begins by connecting the issue to sexual abuse, it's hardly an article about "professors and students sometimes date each other". Mary Kay LeTourneau used the same techniques, as do other predatory teachers. (I've revised the article to include relationships with underage students.) The "Mother-father figure" outlined on the <a href="http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/TypesOfHarassers.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/TypesOfHarassers.html" rel="nofollow">SHS Types of Harassers</a>page would be a good inclusion here as it outlines how these types of personalities operate. I think the article should stay, but be expanded upon to include the effects of such relationships, the psychology of the teachers who engage in the behavior, and all information should be sourced.<a href="../../../a/i/n/User%7EAine63_4c1a.html" title="User:Aine63">Aine63</a> 00:56, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually the direct sexual abuse connection is one of the statements I have a problem with, since there's nothing <i>inherently</i> abusive in a teacher-student relationship. It's good that you're interested in the subject, but maybe there should be a more general article, or subsection of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_abuse.html" title="Sexual abuse">sexual abuse</a>, dealing with power differentials in general. This title is a total neologism and the article history has more removals of dubious content than additions of good content. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 01:05, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Good point, and one that should be added as there are some good student-teacher relationships, and even some happy marriages that have come from student-teacher relationships. A move to sexual abuse would be very appropriate for the type of behavior that this article is <b>really</b> discussing. Either way, if the editors decide to do this move or not, I volunteer to flesh out this section myself, using good source material, and there is quite a bit of it. <a href="../../../a/i/n/User%7EAine63_4c1a.html" title="User:Aine63">Aine63</a> 01:56, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>here are some real life examples of the problem, in both universities and secondary school: <a href="http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9932/" class="external text" title="http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9932/" rel="nofollow">Naomi Wolf: The Silent Treatment</a> <a href="http://www.sesamenet.org/survivor.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sesamenet.org/survivor.html" rel="nofollow">SESAME survivor stories</a>.

<ul>
<li>I just corrected various links. To put it simply, the article is currently a mess and needs <i>much more</i> outside sourcing, in particular it needs to source the connection between "seduction" and "abuse". For a recent article that got shot down because it tried to discuss a single academic source at length, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Research_into_health_benefits_of_Falun_Gong_701e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Research into health benefits of Falun Gong">here</a>. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 18:23, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep but move</b> to a better name. If this title is only used on Wikipedia, then that's a problem.

<li><b>Keep,</b> legitimate topic, move to better name, mark for cleanup and as needing references. The first thing that came to mind when I saw the title was the novel (no, I haven't read it) <i>Professor Romeo</i> by Anne Bernays. Anne Bernays, apparently a redlink, was the daughter of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Bernays_21ec.html" title="Edward Bernays">Edward Bernays</a>, and her novel was a bestseller in 1989. In fact, Bernay's novel got <i>two</i> reviews in The New York Times. One of them speaks of "an old and familiar analogy: that teaching is a surrogate love affair, a complex form of seduction. Throughout history (remember the <a href="../../../p/a/o/Paolo_and_Francesca_3457.html" title="Paolo and Francesca">Paolo and Francesca</a> affair) there have been teachers who have taken that analogy all too literally. So on occasion the professor or tutor has been the Don Juan, doing with the body what he (or sometimes she) hopes to do with the mind. Universities are always strangely erotic as well as intellectual communities. That, presumably, is why they have become one of the principal battlefields in the gender wars of the 1980s." (Bradbury, Malcolm, 1989: "Professor Romeo." <i>The New York Times</i> July 23, 1989, p. BR1) <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:41, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Strange title. Contains original research. Yes, the phenomenon exists. Abaelard and Heloise exist. People have witnessed it, myself included.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom "Neologism" and per Dr Zak. Even all three of the references label it "<i>Sexual Harassment</i>", I'll change my opinion after it becomes an actual phrase of common usage, perhaps in the press, or when "Presidential seduction" or "CEO seduction", or other similar phrases start to appear.

<li><b>Keep</b> per AdamBiswanger. I agree that the article needs more time and a little clean up. It has a good start though. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne27</a> 03:11, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Renaming article: At this point, the majority say the article should stay, but some feel it should be renamed.
