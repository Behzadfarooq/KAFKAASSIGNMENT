<li><b>Delete</b>. This is already listed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Toronto_parks_12ab.html" title="List of Toronto parks">List of Toronto parks</a>, and the article adds little additional information. This park isn't notable, and there are several dozen others just like it in the city. The parks that _are_ notable in Toronto are <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downsview_Park_53ab.html" title="Downsview Park">Downsview Park</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Park_527a.html" title="High Park">High Park</a>, the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Islands_cf48.html" title="Toronto Islands">Toronto Islands</a>, and maybe Ashbridge's Bay Park. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 20:48, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Non-notability is not necessarily a factor when deciding whether or not to keep an article. Moreover, in his above comment, <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> severely misrepresents the state parks in Toronto, as well as their converage on Wikipedia. Not only are there many parks deserving of articles, there's a whole category that includes a substantial portion of them. While the article is rather paltry at the moment, it does provide useful information, and it is frequently the case that great articles start out small. Another consideration is that this appears to be the first article Daloonik has created. While this alone can't be a reason not to delete, it can be a reason to err on the side of <i>keep</i>, as destroying the work of a contributor who took the initiative to learn enough about Wikipedia to create an article, including apparently going out to take pictures specifically for the article, is only likely to discourage a user who has shown he can make useful edits from continuing to participate on Wikipedia.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't get it. How is a 1 block park a "notable public resource"? Look at a Google earth or something and you'll see what this is: a park with a baseball field and a basketball court. Any city the size of Toronto has about 100 of these. So even by a conservative estimate there are hundreds of thousands of parks like this all over the world. I don't see how any future editor will be motivated to expand this. <b>Half of the edit history is due to racist vandalism</b> created by user:Daloonik and user:Stanfordandson (who incidently voted above to keep the page).

<p>'<i><b>Do Not Delete the list'</b></i> - this list does have value to researchers - Irish American studies as with other ethnic groups is common among sociologists , geneologists and other individuals who are carrying out various research projects at different levels. The Irish were the first great wave of immigration and it is important that a preliminary data-base of notable people is available. However I do beleive that only "sourced" entries should remain on the list - I take the point that it is possible for an individual to talk about their Irish ancestry yet there may be no "source available on the net - but the source can be a book or other material as long as the details are noted/cited. This list like all wikipedia lists and articles is subject to vandalism, silly and un-substantiated entries but as with all articles and lists is also subject to policing and these entries ultimately are corrected or removed. This list is valuable to other Irish studies including historic events such as the Irish Diaspora and The Irish Fammine. It should not be removed. If teh debate is over the name of the list - I really do not care if it is called "List of Irish Americans" or "List of Irish Americans or Americans of Irish Descent". The list is an excellent first level for research - particulalry around St Patrick's Day that is celebrated World-wide and as such generates numerous articles about "Irish Americans" "Irish Culture" "Famine Descendents" "Irish Actors and muscians" - The Irish hold a unique place in the world in that there is no corner of the world where they did not go and it is also unique that this identity can remain strong after many generations - as stated previously in Ireland many visitors arrive to trace their roots from several generations ago. In talked about in previous discussions on the article talk page, people world-wide but particularly in America can have an Italian, Polish, German, Spanish etc. etc. surname yet claim to be or feel Irish because of a close or remote ancestral connection and this is not only unique but has been acceptable to the Irish who experienced the first "ethnic" cleansing at the hands of a colonial government who did their best to wipe out "Irishness" but rather by doing so only enforced it. Therefore the Irish traditionally held on to their identity as something very precious and whether it is 1 or 10 generations in the past it is as valid to them. The Irish Government has also acknowledged the irish connectiosn throughout the world and has made numrous references to it and the waves of Irish that were forced to leave their country due to opression is as important to the Irish and to world history as is the Holocaust. The list should not be removed. Vono 17:18, 5 July 2006 (UTC) 86.12.253.32 07:18, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> These lists are useful. Anyone who has an article on Wikipedia, or should do, and is eligible for a given list should be included. Lists are better than categories, because they can be annotated and can have redlinks for people who should have articles but don't yet. And categories have exactly the same problems as lists regarding comprehensiveness and adherence to policy.--<a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewport_447f.html" title="User:Newport">Newport</a> 11:21, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm torn, leaning <b>Weak keep</b>. Obviously, we CANNOT delete just one of these lists by ethnicity - it needs to be an all or nothing proposition. Lists on Wikipedia are useful if they either (a) provide meaningful information that you can't get out of a category (eg a table like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_NCAA_Division_I-A_Football_Programs_9349.html" title="List of NCAA Division I-A Football Programs">this</a>) or (b) include redlinked elements to assist in the creation of articles. This list contains really only a citation ... so there is no added value from that standpoint for having a list vs a category - the citation could just as easily be in the article itself. It contains very few redlinks ... and really, in the time you take to add someone to the list, you could create a stub for them. So I don't know that these lists really serve any good purpose that couldn't be accomplished by a category. However, because it would be wholly inappropriate to delete them piecemeal, keep. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 13:04, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> the problem is it is just not clear what can be considered a reliable, reputable, verifiable source that a person is an Irish-American.

If someone says "I am proud of my Irish heritage" is that? If someone says "I have Irish blood running through my veins" is that? What about "My heart is in Ireland" or "I feel as Irish as can be" or "I consider my Irish heritage a fundemental part of who I am"? All these statements would suggest to me that these people consider themselves Irish Americans, but some people think that only if they say "I'm Irish" on St. Patrick's Day that is enough or some people think only if they say specifically "I am an Irish-American" or are described by someone as exactly that in a reputable reliable verifiable source (what is a reliable source for who and who is not an Irish American again?).

<li>Arniep, this has been explained to you by several editors who are very familiar with policy. You either have a source saying someone is an Irish-American, or you don't. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Welsh_Americans_77a7.html" title="List of Welsh Americans">List of Welsh Americans</a> for how these lists need to be done. Don't worry, Arnie, "I" isn't too far up from "W" in the alpha-bet and I will get to doing this list in no time. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 16:08, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also note that you guys are saying what is a reliable source for Irish-American.

<p><b>Do not Delete</b> - Agreed that this list cannot be deleted in isolation - I for one am not concerned with what the verifiable source is other than that somewhere it should be on record that this person has been identified as Irish American either by their own statements or that of others whether it is only on St Patrick's Day or or through continuous identification is irrelevant - most well known historic figures or celebrities have family ancestry included in their biographies. The list provides that initial starting point that is key for research allowing the researcher to make the determination if tehy wish to pursue further detail and also it serves to encourage stubs and articles. I think that identity is a very personal thing and open to individual interpretation which is why there needs to be a minimum requirement for inclusion otherwise names are simply added because they "sound" Irish or maliciously to vandalise the list for some personal agenda also names can be removed for personal agendas - for instance say Robert De Niro or Liza Minnelli - both have documentable Irish ancestry and both have spoken about it in some form over their long careers, yet someone uninformed may determine that because their names are Italian in origin they do not belong on the list of Irish Americans or similarly that because of irish ancestry do not belong on a list of Italian Americans (of course they belong on both) or it could be that individuals are simply "portective" of their celebrity and want exclusive ownership by their (the editor's) chosen ethnic identity. Reliable citations avoid this for accuracy and research.Vono 17:18, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

He was born to Irish immigrants Thomas Costello and Ellen Fitzgerald in 1877. Yet, I have searched far and wide on Google and I can find no source that says he was specifically an "Irish-American", and, according to some users, this means that he cannot go on the list of Irish-Americans.

<li>Maybe he didn't consider himself Irish-American. If you dig a little deeper, you can find a few sites that say he was part Spanish. Though those may be incorrect.

<dd>Come on, this case is a perfect example of why I am arguing against this list as it stands. He is surely a lot more Irish than a large amount of people currently on the lists of Irish Americans for making some vague statement about Irishness. Would I be permitted to use <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Costello_38dc.html" title="Maurice Costello">Maurice Costello</a> as an example of an American who traces their ancestry to Ireland on the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_American_b5d5.html" title="Irish American">Irish American</a> page but not on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Irish-Americans_092c.html" title="Lists of Irish-Americans">Lists of Irish-Americans</a>? Clearly a non sensical situation. Something needs to give. Arniep 23:13, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nope, nothing needs to give. You have given no evidence at all that we are "stealing away" Costello's right to be Irish-American. You have no evidence that he considered himself as such, and you can find, so far, no sources that have referred to him as such. If you do, that would be great. Until then, he should be kept off the list. Oh, and I suppose you could say "Costello traces his ancestry to Ireland" on Costello's page and on the Irish American pages, though that would be pointless. Surely some more prominant Irish-Americans can be found to illustrate the main page. No need to use Costello, who we are not even sure about. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 23:19, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK fine. Just so it is clear to everyone who wants to keep these lists, we are including people who say "I am Irish" on St Patrick's Day, but excluding the children of Irish immigrants if we can't find a source that says specifically that they are an "Irish-American".

<dd>What is this St. Patrick's Day thing? I don't think there's a single person sourced to a link where they say "I'm Irish" on St. Patrick's Day (i.e. an article dated on St. Patrick's Day - you get the point). I am also not sure why you are once again inquiring on this, since it's been explained to you so many times, dating even back to the List of British Jews. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 23:52, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't matter whether anyone actually is sourced as speaking on St. Patrick's Day. The fact is, if someone is reported as saying "I am Irish" on St. Patrick's Day you will accept that. But not "I am of Irish ancestry" or "I have Irish blood" which probably mean exactly the same thing in that context. And not if we have a source saying a person was the son of Irish immigrant<b>S</b>. NO NO. Even though all those sources accord with the definition of Irish American as an American who traces their ancestry to Ireland. Arniep 00:48, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, just like the fact that the definition of plagarism matches your opinion that Jones did not commmit it, but yet.... if no sources say that he didn't, you're not allowed to under Wiki policy. Specifically. So I ask you, politely, to stop mentioning this "Defintion", which, besides being ambigious and essentially meaning that there are <b>no</b> non-X Americans out there at all, is explicitly prohibited from being used to match a person to a term, because it is indeed a definition. I also beg you to stop using the St. Patrick's Day "argument", because, as you have been unable to find a single example like that, is moot. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 00:51, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's in no way moot. If a person says "I'm Irish" you have decided you will accept that to put them on the list, but not if they say "both of their parents are Irish", or "I am proud of my Irish heritage", all of which are convey the same meaning that the person is an Irish-American in accordance with the definition in major reference works (including Wikipedia) which define an Irish-American as an American who traces their ancestry to Ireland. I want to make it clear that I am in no way arguing for people of distant Irish ancestry who have never muttered one word on their Irish forebear/s to be included, just that we use some common sense and if necessary invoke <a href="../../../i/g/n/WP%7EIGNORE_187e.html" title="WP:IGNORE">WP:IGNORE</a> if some users believe that policy may prevent, for example someone of two Irish parents not to be included.

<li><b>Keep</b> until there is an overall consensus guideline on lists of ethnic Americans generally. I do think there's a huge difference between Irish-Americans who immigrated from Ireland, Irish-Americans who are children or perhaps grandchildren of immigrants who grew up in a household strongly informed by Irish cutlture, and Irish-Americans whose ancestors happen to have come from Ireland but who have no strong inbred connection to Irish culture. I would prefer to see the latter types not included in these lists.

<p>Mad - jack yes referring to the latter group mentioned in the penultimate entry above I agree that quite often the fact that an individual has remote Irish ancesrty does not always qualify them for inclusion in that perhaps they do not feel "Irish" However it is also possible for someone to have remote Irish Ancestry (I consider remote 1 great great gandparent on ones side of teh family) and still feel Irish because that identity was preserved within their environment therefore it is difficult to exclude them - I think at the very minimum there should be verifiable evidnece that somone in their ancestral heritage came from Ireland. An example of this is Mohammed Ali - one great grandfather came from Ennis County Clare - does this make him Irish-American? - Superficiously - yes - but does he feel Irish? I don't think so but because of clear lineage he should be on the list. Researchers can determine what entries they wish to pursue - quite often it is those latter people who are the more interesting because their Irishness may not be common knowledge and much of the value these entries have to for instance; journalists or academics doing serious work to use as examples of how the Irish have succeeded in America so someone like Ali presents a more interesting or unique slant around issues such as the Irish Diaspora rather than extolling the virtues of Irish beauty, charm, wit etc etc that often permiate St Patrick's Day journalism we all Know that Maureen O'Hara, Bing Crosby, Judy Garland, Grace Kelly etc etc were Irish Americans and reading it over and over in numerous publications can become boring but the wider issue for the users of thsi list is to lay-out how this remote Irishness has influenced the person's success that is more of a challenge and ultimately more interesting. Of course as with all these type of lists - they are seen as a "badge of honor" for the entrants and can also contribute to study and analysis - e.g how has their Irishness influenced them? Are their ethnic traits or predisposition responsible for their fame - e.g. Maureen O'Hara was/is as famous for being Irish if not more so than as an actress - infact her Irishness may be more well known than her extensive film career, however the ethnic identity in some cases goes hand-in-hand with the accomplishment for which they are noted and could be a career initself for soem people. I don't think the list is about the subjective issues such as "do they consider themselves Irish everyday or just on St Patrick's day" The reality is that identity is not something that you are conscious of every day and usually needs something to trigger it and St Patrick's Day may be the trigger that some people need once a year to remind them - others may be triggered more often and by other stimulants such as a trip to Ireland, or an image, a memory, a song etc but for the most part Irish-American identity is not challenged if the individual can at least elaborate on it e.g. they know where in Ireland they originated - in my experience the only Irish Americans not accpted by Irish born people are those that do not know anything about Ireland, Irish history, Irish culture, Irish language etc etc. They are not concerned with how close or remote the actual blood connection is if the individual can demonstrate an affinity founded on real knowledge and mutual understanding and this usually does not occur unless the individual "feels Irish". There is nothing more offensive that an American claiming to be "oirish" that has no idea about what that means.145.229.156.40 11:52, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes definitely I agree. Some people with remote Irish ancestry feel Irish and refer to themselves as such, or are referred to as such by others, which is perfectly fine for inclusion, and in fact helps weed them out from all the others with the remote ancestry. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 15:44, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some caution seems prudent about possible bias on the part of <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanbrogger_b0ef.html" title="User:Janbrogger">Janbrogger</a> and his relation to Øyvind Eikrem. Brogger is the son of <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Br%C3%B8gger_4dcf.html" title="Jan Brøgger">Jan Brøgger</a> – a Norwegian professor of social anthropology and a clinical psychologist who died in February of this year. Eikrem is also a Norwegian philosopher, clinical psychologist, and social anthropologist. Eikrem has edited the article on the Norwegian Wikipedia about <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanbrogger_b0ef.html" title="User:Janbrogger">Janbrogger</a>'s father (they both have the name "Jan Brøgger") and the corresponding article on English Wikipedia was created by Eikrem.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Eikrem only has two out of a total 24 edits on the Norwegian <a href="../../../../no/j/a/n/Jan_Br%C3%B8gger_4dcf.html" class="extiw" title="no:Jan_Brøgger">no:Jan Brøgger</a> article. More importantly, the content of Eikrem's edits introduced undocumented information about Jan Brøgger (sr.) being a controversial figure in Norwegian public discourse. I will take the liberty of translating the paragraph that must have appeared contentious to Jan Brøgger jr. as he proceeded to delete it in <a href="http://no.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jan_Br%C3%B8gger&amp;diff=1009324&amp;oldid=1009320" class="external text" title="http://no.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jan_Br%C3%B8gger&amp;diff=1009324&amp;oldid=1009320" rel="nofollow">consecutive edit</a> citing violation of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> (the English WP policy guideline as Norwegian WP doesn't currently have this) and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> (<a href="../../../../no/o/b/j/Wikipedia%7EObjektivitet_61b8.html" class="extiw" title="no:Wikipedia:Objektivitet">Norwegian version</a>):</p>

<dd><i>Apart from his work as professor, Jan C. Brøgger was well-known in public discourse. He often took side asserting unpopular views, and his entire life he polemicized strongly in favor of his views on the role of the family as the supporting institution in society and against authoritarian movements (particularly on the left side of poltics).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It is curious that Jan Christian Brøgger jr. being a physician should happen to step forward to assert a lack of notability warranting the removal from Wikipedia an article about a humanities scholar who just happened to hold the same credentials as his father and who had inserted information about his father in a (Norwegian) Wikipedia article that Brøgger jr. took offense to. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 10:08, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>First, to put it all in perspective, please not that the entry for Stein Erik Johansen, the PhD thesis advisor for Øyvind Eikrem, was nominated independently for removal by a Wikipedia editor who has &gt;5000 edits with an interest in the same fields. After this, I nominated Øyvind Eikrem for deletion. If his thesis advisor is not notable, clearly his never-cited student is not notable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, to bias. The edit given above is completely incorrect. The paragraph above has been retained. The paragraph that I edited out was a different one, and was removed because it was POV and unsourced. Later my edit was commended by a Norwegian social anthropologist and other respondents (see the <a href="../../../../no/j/a/n/Diskusjon%7EJan_Br%C3%B8gger_3ee9.html" class="extiw" title="no:Diskusjon:Jan_Brøgger">Norwegian discussion page</a>). In the discussion page, I stated that while the viewpoints were interesting and might have some relation to actual fact, Wikipedia is not the place to start a discussion over the contributions of a deceased researcher, without sources (official Wikipedia policy <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>). With sources, it would be a different matter. As a matter of fact, I have found and entered sources for other controversial statements in this biography. I don't object to negative attention, it is just that unsupported personal opinion should not be prominent in a biography (or really any kind of unsourced slant in any direction). The actual paragraph removed was (my translation):</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Brøggers position in Norwegian anthropology was disputed. On the one hand he was given a lot of attention in public, but on the other hand he was not well regarded - at least not within the scholarly community nationally."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I happen to know Øyvind Eikrem because we went to the same school, and thus took an interest. I would not have noticed his entry if he hadn't edited Jan Brøgger's entry on the Norwegian Wikipedia, but that is the way of things. I've proceeded to take up to discussion on the <a href="../../../../no/t/i/n/Wikipedia%7ETinget_1935.html" class="extiw" title="no:Wikipedia:Tinget">Norwegian Wikipedia signpost</a> the criteria for lexical notability, and a majority of respondents thought that simply a PhD and a clinical degree isn't sufficiently notable - especially without <b>any</b> citations or media attention. Some on the Norwegian Wikipedia hold that being elected to county office or getting a PhD is sufficient for notability, which means &gt;500 new Norwegian PhD entries and 2000 county office entries per year - nearly impossible, but they are a minority. It should be noted that all respondents favored deleting the <i>Norwegian</i> Wikipedia entry on Øyvind Eikrem. If it is deleted there because of no notability, clearly it does not belong here. This nomination for deletion is clearly consistent with the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia person notability criteria</a> (cant link directly to Notability:People.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've contributed to some Norwegian and English Wikipedia pages over the last year (within my scientific field or personal interests). The debate between inclusions and deletionists has not yet been concluded. But it is my policy that all articles I contribute to should be properly sourced, and this will be borne out by my contributions. Also note that I do not consider myself notable enough for a Norwegian or English Wikipedia entry, even though I have &gt;10 papers in the international literature and have been cited &gt;60 times internationally, including in the <a href="http://www.bmj.com" class="external text" title="http://www.bmj.com" rel="nofollow">The British Medical Journal</a> and editorial comment in the Quarterly Journal of Medicine, Thorax, European Respiratory Journal, and International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. If this entry is retained, perhaps I should reconsider.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I thus stand by my nomination for deletion, and hold that it is unbiased and criterion-based, not based on personal animosity. However, I've come to appreciate the debate between inclusionists and deletionists. WP is not paper, and if there is some support for retaining this entry, by all means do. However, I predict that it is only going to be edited by the author or his friends (probably anonymous edits). Time will show. -- <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanbrogger_b0ef.html" title="User:Janbrogger">Janbrogger</a> 21:05, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I rest somewhat assured. I did translate the wrong paragraph, which I'm glad to see has been rectified. However, I would have been even more happy to have seen <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanbrogger_b0ef.html" title="User:Janbrogger">Janbrogger</a> present a full disclosure at the time of nominating for deletion that this could raise questions regarding his neutral point of view. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 00:03, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This entry, stated by indefinitely banned trouble-maker <a href="../../../j/j/s/User%7EJJstroker_fe91.html" title="User:JJstroker">JJstroker</a> (<a href="../../../j/j/s/User_talk%7EJJstroker_e88c.html" title="User talk:JJstroker">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JJstroker_c39a.html" title="Special:Contributions/JJstroker">contribs</a>), is inherently problematic. The page will likely attract anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi POV-pushers, who argue that there is some sort of a connection between Communism and Judaism. Moreover, classifying who is a Jew is often a difficult judgment call outside the competence of Wikipedia editors. For example, Karl Marx, who is listed on the page, is a paradigmatic example of the difficulty of determining who is a Jew. Marx’s family converted to <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutheranism.html" title="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a>; and, later in life, Marx, like many communists, rejected organized religion. <b>Strong delete</b>. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 04:55, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Active: Could you explain to the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peanut_gallery.html" title="Peanut gallery">peanut gallery</a> <i>exactly how</i> you arrived at the conclusion that <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> belongs on the List of Jewish communists? Since when does <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> = <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>? I must be missing something, right? Hmm, it must have been the day I missed that <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberation_theology.html" title="Liberation theology">liberation theology</a> lecture on "<a href="../../../k/e/r/Kermit_the_Frog_5361.html" title="Kermit the Frog">Kermit the Frog is a communist</a>" ("frogs of the world unite -- before you croak!") and thus he is a very vulnerable "Jewish" frog. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 10:32, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, Christ isn't communist in my perception. Nevertheless, (1) the phrase that "Christ was the first communist" is quite a common - whether I like it or not. (2) <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberation_theology.html" title="Liberation theology">Liberation theology</a> is indeed a good argument for adding the name (with some reserve) (3) The term 'communism' is not only used for modern-day <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a> since Karl Marx. For example, there is also <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primitive_communism.html" title="Primitive communism">Primitive communism</a>. (4) The prominent leader <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Kautsky_a48e.html" title="Karl Kautsky">Karl Kautsky</a> wrote a long article on Christianity and compared Christ's ideology to that of communisms. You see, many reasons not to ignore the connection laid down by many people - even though it is not my personal opinion. <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 10:41, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Active: The problem with all this stuff is that it is <i>not</i> mainstream and until such time as it's accepted by the mainstream churches this type of "information" will always run afoul of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and hardly ever be fit to be <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. You know, Jesus lived so long ago you can call him anything you like, but that does mean it's valid to do so. Communism is associated with the likes of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stalin_46d2.html" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_Tse_Tung_ead6.html" title="Mao Tse Tung">Mao Tse Tung</a> and it is doubtful that Jesus could or should be placed in the company of such modern-day figures. Why is it that there is this desire to connect anything significant to the Jews when the Jews and Judaism utterly reject such connections on their behalf? <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 11:30, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, it's hard for me to defend an opinion that is not mine. But I think the argument goes something like this: the vision of communism is a classless and egalitarian society; communists are for the redistribution of wealth and organizing social security. A particular communist zionist movement organized kibutzim. It is not all that different from a Jesus who chases the rich out of the temple, shares bread and fish, and says the poor will be taken up in heaven and the rich should first share. <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 15:42, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wow, I think that nails it, it is not more controversial to classify Jesus as a Communist than as a Jew, and it's hard to argue that he was not a Jew... I of course think of Jesus first as a Jewish Pacifist, which is hard to reconcile with Communism on one level because of the call for revolution, but if that revolution can come without bloodshed... //// <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific.html" title="Pacific">Pacific</a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/PanDeist_8c11.html" title="PanDeist">PanDeist</a> <a href="../../../p/a/c/User_talk%7EPacific_PanDeist_8d93.html" title="User talk:Pacific PanDeist">*</a> 08:15, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - You're very right anti-semites have no business here or anywhere, and therefore your warning is a valuable addition to the pages and talk pages. Not oposing that, the combination of the two subjects (the love-hate-relationship of Communism-and-Judaism and the Jewish communists caught in the middle) remains a very interesting object of study since it is connected to many questions in history and politics; it is just like the similar complicated love-hate-relationship of Judaism-and-Zionism (see <a href="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com" class="external text" title="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com" rel="nofollow">Jews against zionism</a>). Why did the people of one of the most backward countries in the world, and certainly the most anti-semite country, chose Trotsky (and other Jews) among their communist leaders? How very different where the personal and political fights of these particular communists against racism from outside, isolation from inside, opposing the zionist racism? Jewish communists have a very interesting history of their own no other Jew or communist has. Rather than deleting this list in order to prevent possible abuse (call it pre-emptive deletion) and thereby also preventing any normal use, I would suggest: (1) to add your warnings to the pages. (2) also to start an article on why it is difficult to determine who is a Jew and who not. How the term "Jew" changed during history from its original religious meaning to a new racial meaning and all the confusion and abuse inbetween? Then a "list of non-Jewish Jews" as illutration? <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 06:19, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I find the topic somewhat interesting as well, as a historian who is of Jewish background. Still, as <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7ERelevance_46d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Relevance">Wikipedia:Relevance</a> instructs us, just because a topic is interesting does not mean it is encyclopedic. The object of study you describe is beyond the scope of Wikipedia, as it is not Wikipedia's place to decide on the difficult question of who happens to be a Jew. (Religious affiliation is one criterion, but it does not apply to the bulk of 'Jewish' Communists, who, like Karl Marx, did not practice Judaism.) Thus, I cannot imagine this page continuing to exist within the framework of Wikipedia's content guidelines. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 06:55, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(1) Well, I've seen many well written articles on problematic subjects. Atheist authors and believers cooperated on the <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existence_of_god.html" title="Existence of god">Existence of god</a> article, not deciding whether God exists or not, but displaying the whole spectrum of arguments evenly. With similar caution the different interpretations of the word "Jew" can be described. (2) Also, the list of terrorists is about who is 'generally considered' as such, and the list of humanists is about people who 'self-identify' as such - whether they are or not is thereby left out of the question. The perception of them being so is an important real power in itself. Likewise, Karl Marx is generally considered being 'Jewish' even though he wasn't religious. So, it means we should choose our words carefully here, indeed. We must also reference to the article <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a>. <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 08:28, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

This is similar to claims by communists that it is "Jewish capitalists" or "Jewish financiers" who are behind the world's ills. Then there is the claim that there is "Jewish racism" versus the power of "Jewish liberalism". So its "Jewish-this and Jewish-that" and it's all quite meaningless. This madness can go on and on unless it is stopped, and now is as a good a time as any to do so. <i>Perhaps</i> a better title may have been Communists of Jewish descent or The role of Jews in the history of Communism written in a very delicate and professional manner, but as this article stands it is nowhere near that. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 09:47, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I would also oppose a list of Catholic fascists. The conceptual frame for both is one that amplifies historic stereotyping while obscuring encyclopedic content. These--and similar diads involving a religion and an object of scorn--need to be enclosed within broader discussions in order to minimize their use by bigots by placing the discussion in a detailed and nuanced context. This is the approach at <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism_and_religion</a> that helped calm down edit wars and exploitation by bigots. In addition, the underlying assumption of the existing entry is that Jews appear to be a biological or genetic concept, rather than a religion and ethnicity with a wide range of forms. Some of the people listed clearly walked away from both the religion and the ethnicity. What is left is the non-existant racial or biological "Jew"--the core concept of Hitler. Wikipedia should avoid taxonomies favored by the Nazis. The page looks just like dozens of others I have studies...on neonazi websites. Same claims. Same list.

<li><b>Comment</b> I took a look at the article and three questions came to mind. (1.) Are there many lists of communists by ethncity and lists of communists by religion and if so for which ethnicities and religions do such lists exist? (2.) Isn't there a lot of tension between communism (as an ideology) and the sectoralism of non-national identities as well as between communism and religion? (3.) If such tension does exist, how well can this be covered in a list? Regards, <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 04:13, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good questions. Let me first say that I didn't start the 'article' (it seems to be done by someone with not so best intentions) but I did try to make it into something more decent yesterday. So I might not be able to answer everything as good:
<ol>
<li>You can type in "american communists" and wikipedia gives you the CPUSA party. You can type in "german communists" and wikipedia gives you SED party. Etcetera. Etcetera. However, when you type in "jewish communists", wikipedia does not give an article about a Jewish communist party. We cannot refer to a <u>Jewish communist party</u> since there existed none (or not for long) in history, so we can and must refer to a list of Jewish individuals (Leon Davidovitsh Bronstein / Leon Trotsky was a very prominent example). <b>(</b>* <b>Comment</b> - Israeli party <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadash.html" title="Hadash">Hadash</a> made up of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Israel_12ff.html" title="Communist Party of Israel">Communist Party of Israel</a> remnant of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Palestine_d151.html" title="Communist Party of Palestine">Communist Party of Palestine</a> --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheYmode_df1a.html" title="User:TheYmode">The<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 17pt"><font color="green">Y</font></span>mode</a> 04:10, 8 July 2006 (UTC) <b>)</b></li>
<li>The difficult debate about the <u>definition of "Jew"</u> (religion, ethnicity, race, culture, etc. etc.) is dealt with already in the article <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a> Therefore this list starts with: <i>This page is a list of people identified as Jews, either by themselves or by others. "Jewishness" has the meanings both of "adherence to the religion of Judaism" and "membership in the ethnic group 'Jews'. People of both groups are listed here. By other criteria, these people may be listed under other nationalities as well. See: Who is a Jew?</i> This warning is copied from other <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Jews_93a3.html" title="Lists of Jews">Lists of Jews</a>. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Nobel_Prize_winners_e504.html" title="List of Jewish Nobel Prize winners">List of Jewish Nobel Prize winners</a>, for example. So Leon Trotsky and Rosa Luxemburg are considered "Jew" because of ancestry.</li>
<li>There are many forms of "communism": it is the vision of an egalitarian society, it is also the communist movement for social change, even distribution of wealth and social security. So communism is not necessarily bad. It is also the good/bad legacy of communist individuals, the party bureaucracy, etc. There are pre-Marx communisms: <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primitive_communism.html" title="Primitive communism">Primitive communism</a>. There are <u>combinations with religion</u>: <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_communism.html" title="Christian communism">Christian communism</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_communism.html" title="Religious communism">Religious communism</a>. So, why would being Jewish (religiously or ethnically) and being communist then be impossible?</li>
<li>Communism has its distinct tactics and strategies against anti-Semitism, through workers unions, and workers revolt, "workers across the world, unite!" etc. However, no other communists but Jewish communists were the direct victims of anti-Semitism. This makes this group especially interesting: 1. no other communist but <i>Jewish</i> communists had the "inside" view of being direct victims, 2. and no other Jew but the <i>communist</i> Jews were trying these communist <u>strategies against anti-Semitism</u>. Their views and position are unique, special, interesting, and valuable. That's why I also added the articles on "The Jewish Question" (the old name for fighting against anti-Semitism) in which they describe their strategies against anti-Semitism. <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 08:46, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are partly right. The Kibbutz movement was communist, indeed. However, it was only one particular form of communism. The majority of Jewish communists were on odd terms with the Kibbutz commies. They'd rather fight in the country they lived, loved and worked in, than move away into hiding somewhere near Jerusalem. See for example my super hero <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marek_Edelman_a8ba.html" title="Marek Edelman">Marek Edelman</a>: he fought the nazis (<a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw_Ghetto_Rising_3b04.html" title="Warsaw Ghetto Rising">Warsaw Ghetto Rising</a>) and after WWII the Stalinist dictatorship (<a href="../../../s/o/l/Solidarity.html" title="Solidarity">Solidarinosc</a>).

<dd>Jewish is an ethnicity and a religion, it cannot be neither. Thanks. The Bolshevik leaders weren't religious, but they were still ethnically Jewish. It wasn't used an an "epithet".<a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukirat_7a93.html" title="User:Yukirat">Yukirat</a> 17:14, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Their leaders weren't religious, to be certain, and they were ethnically Jewish, and I think it's pretty bizarre that no mention of the fact that what caused them to storm out of the Congress where they became dubbed as "mensheviks" was in response to the excessively antisemitic remarks (which would have made Göbbels proud) made by the "bolsheviks" is never mentioned in either <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menshevik.html" title="Menshevik">menshevik</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolshevik.html" title="Bolshevik">bolshevik</a>... That notwithstanding, there are two things you mention here, both of which are easily refutable wrt the usefulness of this category. (1) "Jewish" is both an ethnicity and a religion, to be sure, but that's not really relevant to anything anyone's said here in arguing against the usefulness of this category... the problem is that there is nothing demonstrable about their Jewishness that makes these Communists' Jewishness notable, as such. If it were "ethnicity" that were important, then <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> should be included as in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Category%7EGerman_communists_07da.html" title="Category:German communists">Category:German communists</a> since his family was originally from Germany, Category:Christian communists and/or Category:Lutheran communists since he was raised as a Lutheran Christian and <a href="../../../e/n/g/Category%7EEnglish_communists_da2b.html" title="Category:English communists">Category:English communists</a> or <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_communists_46a4.html" title="Category:British communists">Category:British communists</a> since he lived most of his life in England and Category:White communists (since he was white). The fact that his father [I've never seen anyone presentation of evidence that his mother was Jewish] is irrelevant since he's [if his mother wasn't Jewish] not Jewish according to <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">halakha</a>, but that notwithstanding, his father's [and even his mother's, if she was Jewish] Jewish ancestry is rendered allthemore irrelevant, at least inasmuch as the merits of this category are concerned, because of his father's and family's conversion to Lutheranism while he was still young (if he was even born yet...our article on him doesn't discuss even <i>when</i> his father converted to Lutheranism), and because at no time in his life is there any record that Marx even <i>once</i> identified himself, even in an effort to openly disparage his "bourgeoisie" ancestry, as "Jewish". On the other point (2), the business about "Jewish ethnocentrism" I was referring to, is the indisputable fact that the phrase "Jewish ethnocentrism" is used almost <i>exclusively</i> as an epithet by antisemites. The assertion of "ethnocentrism", vis-à-vis the Jews, generally is tangled up in a grotesquely mangled misperception about the meaning of "<a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews_as_a_chosen_people.html" title="Jews as a chosen people">Jews as a chosen people</a>", which always ends up coming out as an indictment against the Jews of such "crimes" as "exclusivity", "aloofness", "superiority-complex", etc. [which generally describe the claimants of "ethnocentrism" far better than they've ever described Jews...but when these people suffer from a severe inferiority complex coupled with poor education, there's no accounting for the illogic they'll come up with to support their conspiracy theories...] That notwithstanding, the assertion that it was "Jewish ethno-centrism" that made communism attractive or naturally compatible with Judaism as you imply, is a non-sequitur on two fronts...not only did the early communists-who-happened-to-be-Jews not suffer any sort of "Jewish ethno-centrism", they in fact eschewed <i>any <u>signs</u></i> of ethno-centrism (and reserved their most venemous vitriol for observant Jews), but also the idea that they had some sort of "Jewish ethno-centrism" is utterly erroneous since, as you yourself acknowledge, they didn't identify with Judaism at all! The only thing that made them Jewish was their ancestry, and that ancestry played no significant rôle whatsoever in their communist ideology.

<dd><b>&gt;&gt;</b> Yukarit, the supposed "ethnocentrism" is nonsensical and racist. You neither listened to Tomer an TShilo's arguments, nor read anything about / written by these communists. And I don't think the way you'd like to see this article go, is gonna be my way too.</dd>
<dd><b>&gt;&gt;</b> TShilo12, Tomer, Gidonb, et al, even though I think an article on Jewish Communists is legitimate and can be well written, I am very pleased to see the overwhelming number of people voting 'delete' here. It shows that editors are vigilent against any possible anti-Semitism. Although it is blocking the article, the knee-jerk automatism ("Jewish? Communism? Oh no, it <i>must</i> be anti-Semitism!") is a good first reaction. But think about it twice: Yes, the combination 'Jew' and 'Communism' has been abused many times by anti-Semites, but does that mean we need to give in to their nasty POV?</dd>
<dd>Communists were <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proletarian_internationalism.html" title="Proletarian internationalism">internationalists</a> calling for workers of all backgrounds to unite against an economical system of exploitation -- an international workers victory. They were not "anti-Russian", not "Jewish ethnocentrist", nor "anti-Semite". Just like the French non-Jewish communist <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emile_Zola_78bb.html" title="Emile Zola">Emile Zola</a> was one of the few to defend <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Dreyfus_b173.html" title="Alfred Dreyfus">Alfred Dreyfus</a>, so were the Russian communists defending Jewish and Christian minorities against the Tsarist pogroms. In the most anti-Semite country in the world, the Russian communist movement voted (among others) for Jews to lead them.</dd>
<dd>However, communism has a different side too. There is a difficulty with the word 'communism' which is almost analogous to the difficulty of the word 'Jewish'. In history new meanings have been added and now there are several communisms like there are several ways of being considered 'Jewish'. The name has been long abused by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">Stalinist</a> powers for the exact opposite: anti-internationalism (because of economic competition with foreign economies), anti-worker (because of exploitation of the working class), anti-Semite (in order to divert attention). To put it plainly: Stalinism is anti-communism. That's why he had <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotsky.html" title="Trotsky">Trotsky</a>, <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Bolsheviks_c332.html" title="Old Bolsheviks">Old Bolsheviks</a> (of whom many were Jews) and their followers killed in The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Purge_75df.html" title="Great Purge">Great Purge</a> (the Stalinist Counter-Revolution). The whole sharade was wrapped in red banners and portraits of Marx, but Marx, communism and Communist Jews obviously had nothing to do with that kind of 'communism'.</dd>
<dd>Again, what legitimizes an article on Jewish Communists is that they were singled out on many occasions by anti-Semites. Because they were singled out so often and so harshly, they had a unique position as Jews among communists and as communists among Jews. They had unique experiences and strategies of fighting against anti-Semitism. Other communists and Jews did not have both. They have written down their valuable lessons (see List). What makes these valuable is <i>not</i> that they were 'religiously Jewish' (most were not), <i>nor</i> that 'race' should somehow be of importance (it should not!). What makes their lives and lessons valuable is that they were forced by the historical circumstances (by anti-Semitism and by social change) to become the unique combination of experiences and to do something about these circumstances. Not the Jewishness-in-itself played a role in becoming communist, but the being a direct victim of anti-Semitism that was haunting your 'Jewishness' was. (We could name it "List of Communists haunted by anti-Semitism because of their ancestry" but that would be a bit strange). It would be a waste to ignore this in an encyclopidia.</dd>
<dd>Yes, I do also think a longer article "history of Jews and Communism" is better than just a list of individuals and their works. No doubt in my mind this list will be deleted. A massive numbers voted against - that's good and sad at the same time. Still, we have to start somewhere. <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 11:49, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>ActiveSelective: I think you'll find that pretty much everyone who's voted "delete" would be perfectly content to see an article such as Role of Jews in the history of communism or History of Jews and communism. The problem with this article [<i>i.e.</i>, this "List of..."] is that, as a list, it makes no room for actual discussion of the rôle Jews played in the development of communist ideologies, nor is there any room for coverage of the fate of Jews living under communist régimes. As I mentioned earlier, there is such a thing as "Jewish communism", and it's covered briefly at <a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibbutz.html" title="Kibbutz">kibbutz</a>. As you mention above, Jews (among other groups) suffered horribly under Stalin's "communism"...when you talked about the goal of communism as the deshackling of workers worldwide, that's true, but Stalin's communism wasn't as "anti-communist" as you describe it...instead it was bolshevik philosophy in action (the masses are too dumb to "do communism" themselves), indeed the very philosophy that the mensheviks had so vehemently rejected. Anyways...I think this discussion, if it goes much further, should prolly be moved to the talkpage...

<li><b>Delete</b> per answers of ActiveSelective above. Yes, he does try to make something out of an extremely problematic (if not bashing) list, but, as his answers illustrate, it is a unique list among among non-national ethnicities and religious groups. It seems unique even among nationalities! Perhaps this is not without reason. A list is not the correct form to deal with the deep conflicts between communism, (non-national) ethnicity and religion. Instead I would recommend a history of Jews and communism article, which would include the intellectual and other contributions to communism, the Jewish and Arab-Jewish communist movements in Israel/Palestine and the long history of Soviet policies and practicies with respect to and against Jews and Judaism. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 10:55, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> No. None of my objections have to do with sourcing. This list could be the most meticulously documented and verified list ever listed, and it would still be a list that exists only for the sake of being a list.

The reason it was probably not found on google searches is due to the fact that it did not play during the time of the internet's general usage by the public. This does not negate the play's historical significance. If the play were created ten years later, in 1996 instead of 1986, then it would have certainly yielded numerous successful searches at least. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward352_6e2d.html" title="User:Howard352">Howard352</a> 02:11, 10 July 2006`</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Agreed with Musicmaker. Also if you look at the creator's contribs, they show him making changes mostly to assorted Shermans, which leads one to believe they are related to them. While most do seem to be legit, this person seems to be a no name director.

<li><b>Comment</b> There aren't that many articles on her in the major newspapers, but what there is is WP gold: <i>First off is the news from Lochcarron mountain guide Martin Moran, that his five-strong Anglo-Indian expedition succeeded in their attempt to repeat Eric Shipton and Bill Tilman's epic, and nearly fatal, 1934 crossing between the Hindu temples of Badrinath and Kedarnath in the Garhwal region of the Indian Himalaya. Moran, who arrived back in Scotland last weekend, recommended the 14-day crossing as "a good way to lose three-quarters of a stone". He continued: "We were not exactly in prime condition. I had just recovered from injuries sustained falling off my roof, Brede Arkless is in her sixtieth year and John Harvey in his fifty-seventh. That we did succeed was due to good teamwork, enthusiasm and determination for the project, and considerable luck with the weather which stayed good for the crucial col crossing."</i> — The Herald (Glasgow) June 20, 1998.

<li><b>Keep</b> - firstly my apologies to the lady for obviously not having done her justice in my original stub. But I would have thought that even your most dismissive posters would have paused for thought when noting that she had an obituary in each of the UKs 'liberal' newspapers. Her fame rests in her success as being the first female alpine guide at a time (late 1960s) when that profession was both _completely_ male dominated, and also dubious of UK mountaineers. Her dedication in the 70s to the developing of all-female mountaineering was also a very important and pioneering contribution. (Her subsequent contribution to NZ mountaineerng has also been noteworthy, I gather, though largely unrecorded ). She is clearly much more important than say some minor male US-football player, and a failure to recognise this in WP is both blinkered and arguably sexist.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't buy the argument that high schools (sic) are notable, yet elementary schools are not. Just because there is a tradition of attending high school reunions in the USA does not make high schools more notable. All schools are notable, each have a profound impact on 1000s of people over the years, equiping them with the ability to enjoy wikipedia, for one. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 07:26, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: and to concur with Markb and add to my Keep vote above: All public schools are public institutions no matter the grade, and are administered by the same authorities. Enrollment in elementary schools is mandatory whereas not as much in high schools traditionally, and probably have a greater impact on the development of a person than high schools do. They also tend to be institutions as old or older than high schools. High schools granted are larger institutuions, but it is one factor among many to compare notability. I do not see the obviousness of how high schools are inherently so much more notable than elementary schools. And in my eyes, the reason why notability has any concern to a non-paper encyclopedia is because of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and as public institutions there should be enough information available via these public agencies to ensure verifiability. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 08:03, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The problem is that most of the borderline school articles have no source citations but the school's own website... while easily obtained official sources usually contain only basic statistics that would be better presented in tabular form than as a stubby paragraph.

<dd>Yes, it's a fact. They've been using it in various forms for at least a century. AFAIK it's not trademarked or anything. I don't believe for a microsecond that Jimbo is unaware of it. I don't know for sure but I rather think Jimbo expects people to catch the reference. "The sum of human knowledge" means "something sorta-kinda-vaguely-like the Britannica, not some whole totally 'nother thing." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 03:21, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It's a fact that the Britannica used it as a slogan, but I was wrong about Jimbo intentionally referring to it. I emailed him and he said "I had no idea actually. It could perhaps be that I subconsciously got it in that way, of course." He credits the line as you quoted it to Erik Moeller and himself, when preparing his first public talk about Wikipedia in Berlin circa 2003. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:20, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result of the nomination was <b>delete</b>. If we are just vote-coiunting, it's 60% delete (15 delets, 10 keeps). However, a number of those keeps are either 'No, it's not a list!', 'I think it's useful', or 'If you have THESE, this should be kept'. None of which are ever great arguments. Most of the deletes refer to either the article being superceded by categories, or it failing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. both of which are strong arguments (except two votes).

<li><b>Really needs Wikification</b> and <b>Keep</b> for the most part.

Although it's definately a list right now, this duly needs to be <b>Wikified</b> in order to examine how SciFi Channel changed over the years, especially since 1998 wherein which much of the "<i>classic</i>" reruns, namely the now defunct second-run programming, seem'd to have disappeared and likewise prompted the start of more original series aside from <i><a href="../../../m/i/s/Mission_Genesis_23cf.html" title="Mission Genesis">Mission Genesis</a></i> and movies produced by SciFi Pictures (however, they are usually rather horrid aside from their unintended[?] humour). <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorWho42_7447.html" title="User:DoctorWho42">DrWho42</a> 03:43, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Those films that have importance rightly have (or can have) their own article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Information about what network a show is broadcast on is found in the article for each show as it is - the shows are not linked other than by virtue of being broadcast by a particular channel. Lists should really have a decent nexus, not just any particular common characteristic like who has aired them. There will be any number of these lists which repeat-mention popular shows, with only minor variations from list to list as you go from country to country. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 22:42, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and Wikify</b>. As others have said above, this has the potential of becoming an important article on the history of Sci-Fi Channel. Even in this form, it is highly informative. It's easy to forget, when turning on Sci-Fi once a week for SG-1 or whatever, how large a role Sci-Fi has played in producing, airing or rerunning science fiction series over the last decade, and how much it has changed over the years. It's also obvious that the list is already too long to fit in the parent article, and categories don't really give the big picture here. To delete this article as listcruft would be shortsighted, a loss and a shame, IMO. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> 07:57, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I nominated this page for deletion a month ago; <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Skull_and_Bones_historical_connections_b153.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Skull and Bones historical connections">the discussion</a> terminated in no consensus. As before, with minor changes marked:</p>
<ol>
<li>The length of this article (approx. <s>250</s> <b>241</b> kb) is unacceptable. This is an encyclopedia article, not a book.</li>
<li>The writing style of the entire article is inappropriate. The whole thing is filled with innuendo, speculations, uncited accusations, and gossip.</li>
<li>Finally, and most importantly, virtually nothing is cited. The article makes a number of extraordinary claims about the involvement of the Skull and Bones group in drug dealing, but there are only <s>20</s> <b>18</b> citations in the entire article, most of which are for auxiliary points. To put that in perspective, that's about one citation for each <s>12</s> <b>13</b> kilobytes of text.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the serious concerns with the article - the presence of large direct quotations from books and other sources - has been dealt with. However, little else has changed since I first nominated this article for deletion about a month ago. It's quite likely that the sheer size of the article simply makes cleanup an impossible task. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 03:22, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, having articles whose only content is "A short story by Rudyard Kipling. The .007 is probably meaning caliber-number. This story has no relation to secret agent James Bond (codenamed 007)" makes WP a laughingstock. If it still looks like that after it's been on AfD for a week, there is clearly not enough interest among editors—and thus, presumably, WP readers in general—to make it worthwhile, at least at this time.</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Poisonous Poets, are one of the biggest acts in British hip-hop, and suggesting them for deletion is in my opinion ludicrous. They have received HEAVY rotation on mainstream radio, toured nationally, and in UK hip-hop at least, mixtapes are the main format of distribution, as there is far less backing from major labels compared to the US scene.

</ul>
<p>Unless I'm misunderstanding WP:MUSIC, the artist only needs to meet ONE of the criteria, so whether or not they've released an album thats featured on allmujsic is irrelevent, as they have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network. (<i>BBC Radio 1</i>)</li>
<li>Has been the subject of a half hour or longer broadcast on a national radio network.</li>
<li>Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (Hip Hop Connection, Mixmag)</li>
<li>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country</li>
<li>Is frequently covered in publications devoted to a notable sub-culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Poisonous Poets and therefore its members qualify for all of the above, so I fail to see why this article is at all being considered for deletion. <a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeanold_Viskersenn_c023.html" title="User:Yeanold Viskersenn">Yeanold Viskersenn</a> 16:05, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Poisonous Poets, and especially Lowkey, are one of the biggest acts in British hip-hop, and suggesting them for deletion is in my opinion ludicrous. They have received HEAVY rotation on mainstream radio, toured nationally, and in UK hip-hop at least, mixtapes are the main format of distribution, as there is far less backing from major labels compared to the US scene. Check my edit history for UK rap knowledge reliability. <a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeanold_Viskersenn_c023.html" title="User:Yeanold Viskersenn">Yeanold Viskersenn</a> 11:59, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>Unless I'm misunderstanding WP:MUSIC, the artist only needs to meet ONE of the criteria, so whether or not they've released an album thats featured on allmujsic is irrelevent, as they have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network. (<i>BBC Radio 1</i>)</li>
<li>Has been the subject of a half hour or longer broadcast on a national radio network.</li>
<li>Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (Hip Hop Connection, Mixmag)</li>
<li>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country</li>
<li>Is frequently covered in publications devoted to a notable sub-culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowkey and Poisonous Poets qualify for all of the above, so I fail to see why this article is at all being considered for deletion. <a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeanold_Viskersenn_c023.html" title="User:Yeanold Viskersenn">Yeanold Viskersenn</a> 16:05, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>'"Keep"'. Lowkey is without doubt one of the biggest up and coming hip-hop acts in the UK, has had several articles run on him in magazines such as Hip-Hop Connection and Undercover and has received heavy national airplay for the single Mad World (Donnie's Lament) released with fellow Poisonous Poet, Doc Brown. He has also toured nationally (though I'm not sure how to substantiate this).</li>

<p>I doubt the possibility of an NPOV article at this title. I think the title frames matters in a way that guarantees POV (including simply the phrase "Anglo-American Foreign Policy"). Certainly the current article is highly POV (e.g. "There have been criticisms on the real motives of the United States and Britain to intervene in Iraq.Critics point out that fact that the only Iraqi government ministry that was not attacked was the oil ministry.The involvement of Halliburton in the Iraq has provided credibility to these charges," all this in Wikipedia's narrative voice, without clear citation (there is a lengthy set of ostensible references at the bottom of the article, but the current state of the article does not suggest something that has particularly used these references). I'd love to have someone prove me wrong and bring it toward NPOV—I'd probably settle for a few experienced Wikipedians promising a rescue—but I suspect that anything substantive here should simply be merged elsewhere. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:57, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Indeed, I am actually employed by the company eye4you, we do distribute HDGuard which in turn is somewhat of a competitor of Deep Freeze (Deep Freeze has little presence in Australia and Europe). I absolutely love wikipedia, and thought it may have been a good idea to post articles on our company which is well known throughout the Australian public/private education arena, however, after reading through the WP articles I do agree that both the HDGuard and eye4you articles should be removed. Notability doubts and corporate _influence_ are present, please delete this article.

<li>People <i>will</i> put their name into print, just not the most visible (and by extension, those considered most reliable) outlets. GNAA will not, ever, be found in Time or Newsweek, or any daily newspaper in any major or minor city. Some of the sources cited may be unacceptable if the subject were something well-covered in other sources, but in this context, many of the sources used in the article appear to follow <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>'s use of dubious sources criteria.

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I am not a regular wikipedia contributor but I would like my argument to be heard. Most of the dismissals of GNAA on this page are directly antithetical to the very goals and nature of Wikipedia. To suggest that an organization is irrelevent merely because it could only exist within the recesses of the internet is negating everything this site is trying to establish regarding the validity of collectively established information that only exists in a constant flux. The majority of GNAA's activities are often deleted or censored as they are intended to be parasitic or disruptive to the sites they were placed on. As such they may seem to be less prevalent and pervasive than a polling of the internet zeigeist will clearly show that they are. However, GNAA's antics have been mentioned on G4TechTV (though not by name), as well as on major news sites. They are responsible for numerous changes in the 'slashcode' and are certainly as well-known as many of the memes given ample coverage on this site. The offensive nature of this article is not valid grounds for deletion. To assert offensiveness as a grounds for deletion would be admitting that Wikipedia values the taboos and political sensitivities of the minority over the freedom of information.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would also like to address the dismissal of the previous VFDs. You are allowing Wikipedia to spite itself by argueing that a topic's history on this site is not noteworthy. The number of discussions and VFDs this article has generated SHOULD count for the group's significance. By suggesting that GNAA's contention and considerable debate does not provide notoreity, you are arguing anything documented on Wikipedia that involves the history of Wikipedia or happenings on the site should also be deleted. How many hundreds of references and articles would that negate? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.223.117.181 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.223.117.181_5777.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.223.117.181">contribs</a>).</small></p>

There's certainly a lot more content in the article than can be gleaned from the available source material. I would say it's a lot of original research, which has been around for so long because its supporters have been so persistent, and we haven't been strict enough about insisting on verifiability.

I don't see why I should bother adding references to articles if totally unreferenced articles will actually be allowed to remain.

<dd>Policy is not policy.

Like all shrews, Policy is known for its need to be the centre of attention, but we can safely ignore it much of the time — we do what policy says when it's a good idea, not merely for the sake of it.

<p>Either a mistake, a hoax, or extremely non-notable. The "alternative title" 'Only a Hobo' is an existing song, which has been available officially, and "like a hobo" is part of the lyrics to another Dylan song (Bob Dylan's 115th Dream), which make sit hard to separate potential Google hits for the subject of the article from other, unrelated ones, but even so, at first glance I can't find any references to it. So at least it is unverifiable, which is enough reason for a deletion <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 11:48, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, strikes me as a mistake/non-notable. Google searches for the song in reference to the one event where it was apparently played (Concert for Bangaladesh") doesn't reveal anything. Author of article probably confused it with "Bob Dylan's 115th Dream." <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 17:28, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do-not Delete</b>, this song does in fact exist and is not simply a mistaken version of "115th Dream." It is hard to name sources when stictly speaking there are none apart from the recording itself. However, this reference has been added to the page. If it did not violate copyright, a sample of the song would have also been added to the page.--The-Folk-Master 02:18, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, how do you reference a piece of music that is not documented anywhere except a bootleg recording?! If you could post an exaple it'd be greatly appreciated, instead of trawling through the link you provided and finding no help. The fact the song is NOT documented anywhere else is precisely the reason i wrote the article in the first place!!! The song may not be of huge significance but i thought it noteworthy that there are TWO recordings of a completly undocumented song by the great Bob Dylan!
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, how can we possibly know that it exists then? References include reputable sources that talk about it. You're also likely violating the guidelines on <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, ok ok. It's not original research because the article is simply stating the name of the song and its content. However, the only source of the article is the recording itself. Is there any way i can upload the song itself to give credibility to the article? If not, what is the real problem?--The-Folk-Master 05:39, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Original research: you found out about, listened to, and "researched" the song on your own. The Wikipedia is not a place for unique research, ideas, discoveries, but for those which have already been researched by someone outside the Wiki and published (hence the need for sources). Again, read those links. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 06:28, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Surrender</b> Fine. You win. So there is no way possible that this song/article can be mentioned on Wikipedia? I think that is sad.--The-Folk-Master 06:53, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can understand it being an offensive term, but that itself does not merit deletion. Deletion would have to be judged upon (sigh, I can't believe I am saying this) on whether or not it is a notable form of somekind of sexual assault. There are quite a few of sexual slang terms that exist on Wikipedia that are ptobably a felony or considered immoral. But that exist on here because in someway, shape or form, they are notable. Some examples are: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teabagging" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teabagging" rel="nofollow">this</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputee_fetishism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputee_fetishism" rel="nofollow">this</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_fetishism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_fetishism" rel="nofollow">this</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_steamer" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_steamer" rel="nofollow">this (which survived AfD twice</a>, and others. So, I don't think how offensive, degrading, or revolting the term is merits deletion in this circumstance. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 11:33, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Whilst I have yet to find any sources that actually describe the process explicitly, research turns up enough ancillary material to convince me that there <i>is</i> a cinematographic effect known as bipacking. However, some references to the process (<a href="http://www.fredcamper.com/afilmby/0013301.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fredcamper.com/afilmby/0013301.html" rel="nofollow">example</a>) imply that it is an effect performed using an <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optical_printer.html" title="Optical printer">optical printer</a> not an <a href="../../../i/n/-/In-camera_effect.html" title="In-camera effect">in-camera effect</a>.

<li>This is Kate, a fan of James Hyman's. I've e-mailed him and he has no problem with this Wiki page. I would re-iterate that what James Hyman has achieved is valid to list just like other presenters on here who similarly para-phrase their bios e.g. <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Pilkington_74e5.html" title="Karl Pilkington">Karl Pilkington</a>, another <a href="../../../x/f/m/Xfm.html" title="Xfm">Xfm</a> DJ like James.

I understand you all have to do your jobs round here but I'm only trying to maintain a listing for James + his work!!!! Phew!!! There is this grey area on what's allowed/not allowed/notable.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I count about 43 or 44 "original pop videos" listed on the unverified non-independent source, the Green Bandana client list. Also the roles are simply listed as "Production/Direction" for the Green Bandana company - it does not specify what role this exactly was (support for production/direction? assistant producer? amorphous executive producer credit?) or if James Hyman himself was directly involved.

<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b> I listen to XFM a lot and I'd say that out of the current roster (after the actual celeb DJs) James Hyman is second in notability to <a href="../../../l/a/u/Lauren_Laverne_62a9.html" title="Lauren Laverne">Lauren Laverne</a> thanks to his TV and film work. The first version comes over as pretty fanboy/girl (and used too much bold) but as the version currently stands it is reasonable entry - it could still do with some work (there is still information on other TV work that could be extracted for example, as should that info about his CD being one of the top 5 albums of 2004, if it can be confirmed) but he is notable and it'd be a pity if the initial tone of the article distracts from this.

<dd>The first version was taken directly from his own website, and was posted by User:JamesHyman.

<dd>Thanks for the clarification - as I say the tone was wrong but it had plenty of useful information that can be wrangled into making a decent entry. On the "actual celeb DJ" front I should probably expand the XFM entry to look at the distinction I was trying to make. What I am getting at is that XFM also have DJs who aren't "proper DJs" but are usually already famous in another arena (usually comedians as they come over well on the radio). These have included <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Gervais_3315.html" title="Ricky Gervais">Ricky Gervais</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carr_ae3d.html" title="Jimmy Carr">Jimmy Carr</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_and_Joe_4b99.html" title="Adam and Joe">Adam and Joe</a>.

<p>James Hyman is an innovator and educator of the masses. His understanding of music and pop culture is a breath of fresh air. He respects all styles and musical genres. His cult radio show "The Rinse" on XFM showcases groundbreaking new music today. He was responsible for the music sountracks of two British films[Revolver and Kidulthood]for which he won critical acclaim.He is at the forefront of a new generation. --MaitresseMarlene 21:44, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b></li>
</ul>
<p>To start, I'm a little bit shocked at the cattiness of the comments above. Secondly, I don't understand where people are coming from by trying to get this entry deleted. Hyman is a fantastic innovator in music. He doesn't play to a 'set list' which is dictated by a huge radio station (read back on your Peel biographies and his early days, please). A Peel of our day if you will, with his own eclectic taste in music. If you think his biography isn't factual, why not ask him for proof rather than pulling punches at him and making sly person remarks, or comments about his 'hot' assistant? Wiki is not meant to be smut.com.</p>
<p>I refer you back to the court case of Wiki vs Encyclopedia Britannica, and specifically:</p>
<p>For its study, Nature chose articles from both sites in a wide range of topics and sent them to what it called "relevant" field experts for peer review. The experts then compared the competing articles - one from each site on a given topic - side by side but were not told which article came from which site. Nature got back 42 usable reviews from its field of experts.</p>
<p>So where is your consultation with the experts here? It seems that the 'keep' people above know their stuff when it comes to the facts. I'll take their word for it because I don’t have the time to trawl the internet to back them up. However, regardless of ‘fact’ or not, I fail to see why anyone would want to delete the entry of someone who clearly breaks the mould on a musical front. I don't want to go back to the days when Heart FM or Capital Gold was all that the mass British public would (or could) listen to, and you guys are not helping the case here. We're in a completely different era of music - one that one that embraces originality and creativity. Don't try to stomp it out. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.3.227.62 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__82.3.227.62_e91a.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 82.3.227.62">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p><b>Comment</b>: I know it has rather fallen afoul of the non-promotion angle but I'm sure its not the first time a useful entry has arisen from such activity - the main criteria surely has to be whether the topic is notable enough. I am quite suprised this is an issue (I would have voted for notability on what I knew but reading through the early version of the entry I ran across various other things which I wasn't aware of which would have also counted towards his being notable like headf**k and his directing Fatboy Slim's first video) and things here seem to have got bogged down in claim and counter-claim so I did a bit of digging for information based on the criteria listed in the section on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html#Musicians_and_ensembles" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Notability in music</a>: "<i>A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, <b>DJ</b> etc) is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</i>"</p>

<p>Of course this doesn't include work in other fields (TV for example) but the above should be enough to prove notability within the music field using the criteria as it is currently laid out.

<li><b>Keep!</b> When searching for info on mr hyman,i find a bunch of people arguing over wether he's notable??????????</li>
</ul>
<p>this doesnt surprise me as i hadnt heard of him until a few months ago,but this guy is supernova huge.no matter wether you've heard of him he's been the underlying force that was put in charge of curating the rave movement(so to speak).as a twenty something i'm starting to find all the music i love wouldn't be in the mainstream if he'd failed.(think jacque lu cont or The egg from the french car adds)i dont get london radio but i know the statistics &amp; he's heard by nearly200'000 people every week(2-3% of the london!).i think with a fanbase like that you can call him famous.he's all over nightclub flyers/festival line-ups at the moment,so i started researching how he's contributed to alternative music,&amp; can assure you he IS the new john peel.i think he was even the 1st person to ever air gnarls barkley(months before its release).his position in the british underground scene as a dj means he is realy good friends with some of the biggest names in music from before they were famous(just like john peel was).he's pushed many an artist into the limelight by having a massive influence on what other dj's play(just like john peel).And is in the british media on a monthly basis being interviewed or asked for a whats hot list.i think any directorial work he's done doesn't even need to be brought up.just think of how different pop music is nowadays,it's all beats.without him putting so much effort into making beats cool,getting them on air &amp; in adverts, we'd all still be listening to the spice girls &amp; aqua, condemning breakbeat as something only drug using ravers listen to.vinyl2008</p>

It should then be possible to build the entry back up piece by piece focusing on the most notable work (DJing, film work, music videos, TV work, etc. - broken down into sections) with each stage getting a thorough factchecking as we go.

<dd><b>Comment</b>, KarenAnn, the difference between your Ookawara nomination and the Aurora-con nomination is that Ookawara is very notable in Japan, but not as notable here. Aurora-con, however, is in Alaska so it would be easy to prove notability with English sources (<a href="../../../a/-/k/A-Kon_4ad9.html" title="A-Kon">A-Kon</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_North_396a.html" title="Anime North">Anime North</a> would be examples of anime conventions that are well known.).

<p>Aristasia is a fictional world of all females, that is, if notable at all, notable as a BDSM role-playing setting, and is also an anti-feminist group. This article probably should have been deleted almost 2 years ago; See Talk:Aristasia for the VFD debate from September 2004; I count 6 delete vs. 3 cleanup. I did a thorough websearch on Aristasia and found only one thing that looks like a reliable reference: <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/religion/0195152972/acprof-0195152972-chapter-12.html" class="external text" title="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/religion/0195152972/acprof-0195152972-chapter-12.html" rel="nofollow">This book</a> apparently discusses Aristasia, but I couldn't determine, online, what it says about it. Otherwise this article cites very unreliable sources: the Aristasia web site and their source text, <i>The Feminine Universe</i>, which is web-published only as far as I can tell, and isn't even complete. The article has two citations that are broken, and the rest are forum postings. There are references to Aristasia in other articles, but they are mainly of a throw-away sort: appearing in a "see also" list, for instance; none have references outside of the Aristasia web site. I had never heard of this topic before I found it via that {{<a href="../../../h/o/a/Template%7EHoax_4655.html" title="Template:Hoax">hoax</a>}} tag, and I apologize if my ignorance offends anyone who does know about this topic... but this article really doesn't conform to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> at all.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I believe there is a misunderstanding of Aristasia. I too have done extensive research. Aristasia does not exist. The article need to be rewritten. It is actually a counter-femist concept which arose in pop culture. Urbandictionary and other websites, also acknowledges the existance of this society as a mythical fastasy of male submission. Its ideology is one that formed from modernization and is very real. Some information on that page is false and need to be edited not deleted. However this article has passed deletion once before and should not be targeted again.Killerhun00 06:47, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I really don't think we should take crosslinking into account here. If this article is on a topic Wikipedia can't realistically include, the crosslinking that does exist is likely the result of the Aristasia article being allowed to exist here for so long (as I pointed out above, it probably should have been deleted after its first VfD). Besides, most of the crosslinking is non-useful; inclusion in see also lists and such. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:09, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> the "delete" arguments seem woefully under-informed. The Feminine Universe has been available in book form for over ten years. Several other Aristasian books have been published over the years. Here is a list of three of them on Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/WJF1WXW8B9YG/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_full/103-4980857-1419041" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/WJF1WXW8B9YG/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_full/103-4980857-1419041" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> including <i>Children of the Void</i> - a full length novel about Aristasians in London which is said to be only slightly fictionalised. The list is not complete. It excldes, for example, <i>The Feminine Regime</i>. Britain's Channel 4 did a full-length documentary on Aristasia that made such an impact that there is a Yahoo group (not run by Aristasians) devoted solely to trvia about this one documentary <a href="http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/missmartindales/" class="external autonumber" title="http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/missmartindales/" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>. There were numerous other television apearances. Articles about Aristasia have appeared this year in the <i>Fortean Times</i> and <i>Bizarre Magazine</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Claims that Aristasians do not live according to their own priciples, aside from being irrelevant, are based on a misunderstanding of what those principles are. Aristasians have repeatedly stated that imitating the past is not their aim. Pre-21st-century existence of Aristasia is well documented and many Aristasians live in private households and are not online. The stress on discipline is much less among current Aristasians, though even the previous generation despised BDSM. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.153.88.14 (<a href="../../../8/1/2E/User_talk%7E81.153.88.14.html" title="User talk:81.153.88.14">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.153.88.14_4b6e.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.153.88.14">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> The books on Amazon are not actually available through Amazon, but rather are only available through affiliated resellers, which really doesn't mean much.

Unfortunately, the article doesn't appear in their online archives, but then, not all articles do, apparently. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:30, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> I believe the books may be out of print, like the Gor books. The point is that they do exist and have had influence. The prices that second-hand copies are going for indicates the strength of demand among a "cult" market. These books are mid-90s (for the time-sceptics) and earlier versions of two of them appeared in paperback editons during the late 80s. There have now been three "generations" of Aristasians. Admittedly the first is not very documented as they didn't publish books or give media interviews, but the second generation certainly seems already to have a history behind it. A number of different Aristasian sites have come and gone over the last ten years, with rather different styles, that certainly seem to have been run and habituated by different groups of people. In other words, a core set of ideas and philosophies has motivated a number of people over likely three decades (they claim four) in a variety of ways. Various spin-offs and quasi-Aristasian groups have sprung up over the years, but there has always been an accepted "official" Aristasian group. Aristasia has decidedly (and by choice) been fairly small and exclusive and existed outside the mainstream, but it does seem to be a distinct minor cultural phenomenon.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Re prehistory: in the early to mid 80s a series of stories about a character called Amelia Bingham appeared in the British lesbian magazine <i>Artemis</i>. These stories have decidedly proto-Aristasian characteristics and were written by one of the first-generation Aristasians. The series has recently been privately published as a "novel" and can be seen here <a href="http://www.lipsticktheatre.co.uk/blondie/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lipsticktheatre.co.uk/blondie/index.html" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>. The introduction (apparently written in the late '80s for an abortive attempt at publication in book-form at that time) throws some light on proto-Aristasians at Oxford in the late '70s/early '80s.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> I first encountered Aristasia through an interview on the radio and have read several newspaper and magazine articles relating to it. It is counter-cultural, so you would not expect widespread coverage. It is unusual, well-thought-out and highly literate. <i>The Feminine Universe</i> certainly exists in published form. The Wikipedia article does not come across as particularly partisan.</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> Based on all debate so far, it's highly likely this article will be kept. The problem I have with this is that the article as it currently stands is entirely unsourced. That is, we have no reliable sources on this. Out of print books by the head of this Aristasia movement/whatever, an online book by the same person, and other text on the woman's website, none of these are reliable sources. I tried to find info online on the channel 4 program on Aristasia, and I did find this: <a href="http://members.aol.com/bonfessee/cinema.htm" class="external free" title="http://members.aol.com/bonfessee/cinema.htm" rel="nofollow">http://members.aol.com/bonfessee/cinema.htm</a> While this source may not be the best either, according to it the channel 4 program was not about Aristasian philosophy, but instead about spanking and other BDSM activities. We seem to have enough info to state that this woman is a dominatrix, I suppose. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 13:02, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I was responding to the request for citation in the origin wikipedia entry. Although my work has been central to the development of OSINT I am trying very hard to avoid citing myself. Also the way the US Institute of Peace posted the piece, there is no easy way to link to the specific page, and rather than expecting people to look over the whole page (remember, someone else asked me to provide the citation), I thought that extracting it and then linking was the way to go. This was a way to illiminate and cite with a link to the US Institute of Peace. IMHO, it is both worthy of distinction and part of the emerging encyclopedic knowledge, but I am new to this, trying to fit in with the culture.

<dd>Okay, I consider myself a fair person, so I've quickly reworked the article to a more neutral tone to give you an idea what is required of a Wikipedia article (to put on my Joe Friday hat for a moment: "Just the facts, ma'am."). There are still problems with it, as marked by the tags showing that the information needs to be confirmed, but see what you think. However, the article still needs to go through the AfD process to decide whether it still meets other criteria on notability and so on. ~ <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus78</a> 19:50, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>ok, I'm going to do updates, I've got some more information. The Corporate Structure, is found on the phone extension lists - as of now, this is all I can find. I'll see if I can get my manager (Gal) to put up the structure on the "History" page. I hope he will. If not, I'm going to work on 3rd party resources with the Rotman library in Toronto Canada to back track all info on incorporation etc etc.</dd>

<dd>There's no need to fly off the handle. As I explained above, the article as it stands does not meet various criteria for a valid Wikipedia article, so it needs to be drawn to the attention of patrollers and admins, not to mention yourself and other Wiki editors. A lot of people try to create articles that advertise themselves, their businesses and so on, mostly just for the publicity, and many of these articles get deleted within minutes. I saw that you were a business of a reasonable size, so didn't just stamp you with a speedy delete tag. You still have several days in the AfD process to rework the article to a more acceptable standard. All it needs is a couple of links to reputable business journals, newspapers, etc. that have written articles about CDI Computer Dealers, and to remove all the "biggest, best, we believe this, we're changing that" kind of language from the article. Give us some figures, some facts, some more verifiable information, and your article stays. I've scoured Google myself, but couldn't locate any relevant information besides links to your websites and press releases and suchlike (press releases are not valid third-party sources, BTW). ~ <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus78</a> 19:27, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Delete</b> I totally agree, going around fishing murderers from a particular ethnic group, all more unrelated one from the other, like the example of the 16 years old kid is unencyclopedic. First, many of those murders have nothing to do with nationalists, example, Behbud Han Jevanshir killing was an act of vengence. Also, giving such a precendent, any person can decide that any ethnic groups murderers can be classified and an encyclopedic article could be formed out of it. To have such a classification, such an encyclopedic position should exist in the first place.

<p><b>Comment</b> I would like to present my apologies to Gökhan (and to him only) for having drafted such unencyclopedic content. How could I forget (even for a moment) that the angelic Armenian mind and such ghastly acts like politically-motivated assassination could never be associated. I am sorry Gökhan! It was such bizarre points as, some of these murderous political organizations still being active in one way or the other, sometimes under the same name (we can partition the article according to the different organizations, by the way!), some of the assassins having monuments erected to their memory (such as in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, of all places!), an entire industry functioning around propaganda, for what was it again, oh yes! for "vengence", these people killing priests, mayors, diplomats, without mentioning simple folk, for "vengence", the list of victims reads like the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, for "vengence", and during all that time, their country sinking more and more into the mud, no one investing there, except to keep the hate machine alive. And since a hungry chicken will think itself to be in a corn barn, as we say in Turkish, history is built and re-built again to suit present needs. <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krikor_Zohrab_06cf.html" title="Krikor Zohrab">Krikor Zohrab</a>'s books become best-sellers in Turkey, and there are Armenians who don't know who Elisha Tourian is (from what I could see from a peek in a chat-site). For a moment I had the impression that it seemed familiar and that there was a sickly pattern, which prompted me to start the draft. I thought a list would do good.

<li><b>Comment</b> The list you made is inconsistent and incoherent and many of the assassinations range from the 1890s to the latter half of the 20th century. What purpose would that serve to a reader on Wikipedia? to show that Armenians have had a history of assassinating and killing diplomats? What does the <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khojaly_Massacre_2d3e.html" title="Khojaly Massacre">Khojaly Massacre</a> have to do with "Assassinations committed by Armenian nationalists"? Again, to establish the jurisprudence that Armenians have always had a knack for indiscriminately killing including that of civilians? I might as well create a "Turkish assassins" article that picks up on every single assassination of a foreign diplomat, citizen, innocent, civilian up to and including to the deeds of the Grey Wolves and Ali Agca.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 16:07, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Include those on foreign diplomats or other foreign nationals or in localities abroad. Including notable ones that have been attempted. You can put a "See also" link to mass-killings of civilians which have occurred in enclaves (or exclaves, regardless:) where they were known to be influent. Ranging from the 1890's. Including non-definite cases for which notable references have been made to them. (like Ahmet Özkan case in <a href="../../../c/h/v/Chveneburi.html" title="Chveneburi">Chveneburi</a> article where, despite that article's wording, their implication could not be fully established...although it is reasonably likely) I certainly won't put your list on deletion, but let you develop it.

<dd>Being cynical or sarcastic isen't an argument at all. No one is telling you to not creat pages about certain individuals. Here the question revolve around the article which you have created. <i>Assassinations committed by Armenian nationalists</i> say it all, it is a list of names, and there is no way that from such a subject there could be an encyclopedic article. I don't appreciate your tone, words like 'angelic Armenian mind' evidence(and I hope not) an ulterior motive in creating such an article, which would justify its existance.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> There is such a concept as ethnic terrorism - there is no question about the veracity of the data, although it is incomplete, many more names can be added. In case of so-called assassinations committed by Armenian nationalists it can be re-phrased as assassinations (inlc. attempted) by Armenian Secret Army of Liberation of Armenia (ASALA, on US State Dept list of terrorist organizations), or Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutsyun party), or Hnchak party, or otherwise "Armenian terrorism". If there can be Islamic terrorists, Irish, Basque or Kurdish terrorists ("nationalists"), Iranian or Syrian state sponsorship of terrorism -- i.e., all pointing to a specific nation or ethnicity -- why can't there be Armenian terrorism or "Assassinations committed by Armenian nationalists"? The latter is actually a less harsh wording. The page should undoubtedly be improved, perhaps rephrase its title -- but removing it completely? It obviously shows a certain pattern, and that pattern has been identified as such by several sources. Also, I've raised a similar question here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ramil_Safarov&amp;oldid=62438842" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ramil_Safarov&amp;oldid=62438842" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> - there is a page about a certain Lt. Ramil Safarov of Azerbaijani army. Whilst more famous than perhaps any other Azerbaijani Army Lt., at the same time there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of Azerbaijani and Armenian (as well as other) junior officers in any given army who kill, or get killed, committ atrocities or are victims of such. Thus, I raise the question, why should Ramil Safarov have a page in Wikipeda -- he is just one of the victims, who has killed himself and saw killings all around himself coming from a refugee family -- and not Armenian Army Lt-Colonel, much more senior in rank, Pargev Abrahamyan, who also used an axe, but to kill his wife, not enemy combatant? Everyday rapes and murders and other grave crimes occur in both Armenia and Azerbaijan - whilst unfortunate, still, why should they be written about in an encyclopedia? --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 13:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I think they are worth copying in style, tone and nomenclature. However, it may be better to have an article for each of the ASALA/anything else you want to add.

<dd>I'll do that Angus. I changed my vote in that understanding. <a href="../../../a/s/a/ASALA_768c.html" title="ASALA">ASALA</a> acts are already on the article for that organization.

<p><b>Comment</b> For now, I will not take position and wait for the evolution of this RfD. I disagree that this cases is like <b>Assassinations committed by Armenian nationalists</b>, the other article can not be encyclopedic ever, because it is not an encyclopedic subject. This on the other hand, severly tainted and misrepresetation of the footnotes, does have some potentional(the subject I mean). I don't know what the community decides in such cases, delete it, work on an OK article, and creat an encyclopedic one? Or keeping the tags about the accuracy etc., untill the article is made encyclopedic. So, I could not tell. The name of the article should probably be changed for 'Van resistance' and having 'Van rebellion' redirected on it. It is either called Van resistance or Van rebellion in published materials, neither revolution or Van Uprising, while sometimes it is called by the second name, but to retrace an element of what happened there rather than the incident. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 19:23, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the nomination was <b>Keep</b>.

Other claims in the article are easily sourced to the BBC (eg <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2006/06/09/32818.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2006/06/09/32818.shtml" rel="nofollow">William Shakespeare</a>).

<p>Submitted on behalf of <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> who was not sure of the procedure. The concern is a possible lack of notability (the guy is only a city councillor) and none of the many statements are directly sourced despite several requests to the author. OTOH he does seem to have some colourful episodes and has risen above health problems. I am neutral on this. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 22:11, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks, TerriersFan. This article came to my attention several months ago via a wikilink to Tourette syndrome. I have been prompting the unsigned author of this article to reference it with primary sources and establish notability since April 28 (see Talk:Tim Crutchfield). It is not clear to me that notability is established for this local politician, the article has not been referenced, and I've had to constantly edit out unsourced, inappropriate references to his personal life (e.g.; ex-wife and marital issues). <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 22:24, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply:</b> The forum is not the subject of that page. Over 700 people have stopped by, although not registered on the forum and over 11000 hits, as seen in the statistics. Does that not count, when trying to figure out the notability of something? And please don't refer to 'House Lucius' as "mine". I am not here as an official representant of 'House Lucius', therefore I urge you to refrain from such comments.

<li>Well, first of all, we delete things all the time because of personal subjective views, or rather, a consensus of personal subjective views. On Wikipedia, consensus tends to be king. However, to make things a little easier, we do have various policies and guidelines to direct those views. One of those guidelines is called <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a>. House Lucius does not meet those guidelines -- it doesn't even come anywhere close to meeting them. Secondly, no offense intended, but I think you may need to get a little perspective here, because "over 700 people have stopped by" and "over 11 000 hits" since August, 2005 is, uh, pretty much nothing. (And incidentally, I have to say that it strikes me as more than a little dishonest that the site uses the phrase to describe itself on the forums. Having 700 people visit the site in one year (that's, what, less than two visitors a day...?) is not at all the same thing as having 700 members.) This is not an attack against the site, it's just that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, and House Lucius is a very small website. Very small websites are very rarely suitable topics for encyclopedia articles.

<li>Sorry, didn't knew how to do that. Yes, I agree that the site notability might be a little low, I just wanted to point out that it wasn't inexistent. And I beg to disagree, if 'House Lucius' is not interested in forums there is nothing anyone can do about it. What I'm trying to say that not ones forum denotes overall activity of something, so you should not judge it by the activity on the forum. And about the personal views thingy, like: " don't really care if these guys believe in vampires or just like to suck a little blood or pretend on the internet or what, I see nothing that makes them any different from any other bunch of vampire-obsessed people on the internet." So deleting their article of wiki, because of this? I can tell the policy and guideline regarding this view. DeltaOne 10:54, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>But I'm not judging it (only) by the activity on the forum, although I have to say that any site with a forum as devoid of life as that one is going to have a damn hard time convincing me that people actually, y'know, <i>use</i> it. But that's not the only criterion I'm using here; the user counter on the front page of the House Lucius clearly indicates that only a few people use it. But if that doesn't work for you, how about an <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa_Internet_43d9.html" title="Alexa Internet">Alexa</a> ranking? At the time of this writing, that'd be <a href="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=lucian.goobergunch.net%2F" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/search?q=lucian.goobergunch.net%2F" rel="nofollow">873,557</a>. That's nothing to write home about. And yes, as I said, I don't really care if these guys believe in vampires etc. That's a personal opinion, absolutely, but that's <i>not</i> why I think the article should be deleted. You see, the people who frequent the site might believe in Santa Claus or be avid kite fliers or obsessively enjoy a rousing polka -- I don't care and it doesn't matter, because the site does not stand out. It's not notable. It's not encyclopedic material. If you want to believe that I just look down on the poor vampire enthusiasts and unfairly want to delete the article because of that, I can't stop you from doing so, but the bottom line is that the site doesn't even remotely meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. This is not persecution, and it's nothing personal. The purpose of Wikipedia is not to let everyone create an article about whatever they like. Very few sites merit Wikipedia articles, and articles about much larger and much more popular sites than House Lucius get rejected all the time. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 13:05, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't want to look like a bugger. I see what you mean, and thanks for the Alexa link, didn't knew the existance of such site. If the real purpose of Wikipedia is, as you say, not to let everyone create an article about whatever they like, as few merit to be featured on Wikipedia as it's an encyclopedia of very important things, then I fear that I have made a bad choice submitting it in the first place. Thanks for sharing your views, my respect for wikipedia has fallen tremendously.(sp?) DeltaOne</li>

<li>Well, have it your way. For me, that's the kind of a thing that <i>increases</i> my respect for Wikipedia, because if we weren't discriminate about what kind of topics we have articles on, we could have articles on, say, your cat (if you have one) or your lack of cats (if you don't happen to have any). Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.

<li>But, until an administrator checks this article, I will try to sum the reasons why it was meant for deletion.
<ol>
<li><b>Hoax</b> (<i>I yet haven't received any info regarding this</i>)</li>
<li><b>Not-Notable-Forum</b> (<i>at that time there was a link to the forum, link removed. Also, there has been a discussion about the fact that, as few people are on their forum, their website is not notable, thing that I completely disagree with</i>)</li>
<li><b>Not-Notable-Organization</b> (<i>poor wording in the article, it has been edited to better reflect the issue</i>)</li>
<li><b>Not-Notable-Website</b>. This one was controversial to one point, when <i>Captain Disdain</i> explained that from an <i>Alexa Ranking</i>, it's not notable, and I have been also explained that wikipedia, as a respected online encyclopedia shall not have articles on things that are not very notable. I also, respectfully, disagree with this.</li>

<dd>I suggest you read the articles at <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia:Five pillars</a> and think about how they relate to your article here. You can argue your case here, but honestly, I think you're wasting your time. This is not some kind of a weird legal process or a bureaucracy where you can find a loophole or interpret the rules in your favor. The bottom line is, it's exceedingly unlikely that this article will remain on Wikipedia -- unless, of course, you can turn it into a properly sourced and verifiable article that also establishes why this website, out of, what, millions of other websites, is significant and notable enough to deserve an article, even though it's not widely used, it only gets a few relevant Google hits ("House Lucius" gets about 270 Google hits, but only a few of them are actually about the site). I mean, what do you want me to say? It's not a popular site. I don't mean any offense here, but allow me to be frank: it's not widely used. It's not widely discussed. It's not widely linked to. Seriously, my blog -- which is not the subject of a Wikipedia article and definitely <i>shouldn't</i> be one, either -- has a considerably larger Internet presence than House Lucius. So I don't think you can get an article out of this one, but if you could, I'm sure we'd all willing to change our votes in this matter. That happens in AfD processes all the time. Personally, though, I think you'd be better off learning from this experience. I don't mean to be a dick here, but c'mon, face the facts. The fact that your site is not widely recognized doesn't mean it's a bad site (any more than my blog is a bad blog). This is <i>not</i> about quality or a judgement call about your site's content. It's a simple matter of us having certain <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">guidelines</a> and your site not meeting them. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 20:47, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>NN, also looks like original research. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=eversites" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=eversites" rel="nofollow">Google hits for "eversites": 78</a>. The article contains a quote from the BBB which I cannot locate on <a href="http://www.bbb.org" class="external text" title="http://www.bbb.org" rel="nofollow">bbb.org</a>. In fact, the phrase "eversites claims" (which is taken directly from the quotation) does not seem to appear on any web pages, save for this article. A URL search for eversites.com at the BBB site does yield some useful information - that there are "7 pending complaint <i>[sic]</i>" against eversites, and 1 resolved complaint with regard to sales practices, but it doesn't list the outcome. It looks to me like someone got scammed and decided to make a wikipedia article about it. Either way, 78 Google hits is ridiculous. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoe_Aboulkheir_cc7f.html" title="User:Moe Aboulkheir">Moe Aboulkheir</a> 00:26, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hmm, I was wrong about not being able to find "eversites claims" - google hides the result because the (long) quote in the WP article appears in both. I only see it if I click the "show omitted results" link, which includes matches that share long sequences of text with higher-ranked pages. Though the BBB PDF doesn't show up in any of the results for a vanilla "eversites" query, it appears on the first page, in the 8th position, if i include omitted results. Of course, my vote still stands. <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoe_Aboulkheir_cc7f.html" title="User:Moe Aboulkheir">Moe Aboulkheir</a> 22:05, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
