<p>Dicdef. Japanese word for the "world of entertainment". <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:57, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> and expand (and/or maybe merge with <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Japan_02eb.html" title="Culture of Japan">Culture of Japan</a>) . Entertainment is important to the Japanese.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Sure, entertainment is important to many folks, once their basic needs are met. However, that doesn't mean that the English Wikipedia (or the English wiktionary, for that matter) needs a separate article on all the words for <i>entertainment</i> that exist in a couple of thousand human languages Unless there is some evidence that the word is in the process of being adopted into English. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:16, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The english wiktionary certainly wants all the words for entertainment in all languages. What wikipedia doesn't have is an article for Japanese entertainment although <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Japan_02eb.html" title="Culture of Japan">Culture of Japan</a> is close, maybe it could be merged into that. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 21:18, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The remit of Wiktionary is <i>all words in all languages</i>. Being the English Wiktionary means that <i>the articles are written in English</i>, not that it only covers words in the English language. Thus article titles can be in any language, and indeed as per Wiktionary policy <i>should</i> be in the script of the language concerned. (So the articles at Wiktionary would be <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%8A%B8%E8%83%BD%E7%95%8C" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:芸能界">Wiktionary:芸能界</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%8A%B8%E8%83%BD%E4%BA%BA" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:芸能人">Wiktionary:芸能人</a>, and <i>not</i> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/geinokai" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:geinokai">Wiktionary:geinokai</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/geinojin" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:geinojin">Wiktionary:geinojin</a>.) In contrast, article titles in Wikipedia <i>are</i> in English (as per the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">naming conventions</a>). However, I'd like to see evidence of widespread use of these romanizations. If they aren't terms that English speakers would actually use, then they don't justify their being articles. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:36, 2005 Mar 7 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just googling "geinokai" gets plenty of hits from English speakers using the word in English. Incidentally wikionary will be pretty useless to me if I can't use romaji to find kanji. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:59, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, foreign dictionary definition. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 05:08, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, wikipedia is not the place of dictionary definitions, and the process of having these type of articles moved to the wiktionary seems to be completely broken.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 05:45, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as dicdef. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 11:06, Mar 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and expand, perhaps in another category. Frankly, I'm new to this and thought I understood the rules regarding categorization, so I'd be willing to see this put someplace more appropriate. That said, regarding BM's comment that this is just a dicdef of 'entertainment,' the Geinokai is an untranslatable concept in English, and as a social phenomenon does not map 1-to-1 with the 'world of entertainment' or 'entertainment,' etc. It goes beyond that, and is a much narrower concept, so I thought it would be useful to include an article about it, since there's articles about <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_idol.html" title="Japanese idol">Japanese idols</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarento.html" title="Tarento">tarento</a> and so on. If those things, which have obviously been recognized as independent concepts worthy of articles, are included, it would make sense to keep Geinokai. Of course, the article would have to be expanded to make this clear. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7EReldam_48f6.html" title="User:Reldam">Reldam</a> 21:22, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately while the policy says "dicdef '<i>with no potential for expansion</i>", in practise people vote delete anyway, so the expansion can't happen. Maybe wikipedia isn't the best place to try and cover non-English-using cultures. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:59, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Mabye this, and other Japanese (non-english) words would be better explained and less likely to be put up for vfd if they were included in some kind of article or list, like List of Japanese words related to entertainment- with the individual words are redirects to the list. I guess it would be like a glossary.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 02:07, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I completely agree with these comments. Japanese popular culture has taken on a life of its own among non-Japanese-speaking peoples (the US and France coming foremost to mind), and as evidenced by other articles specifically defining Japanese words in common use among such fans, there is clearly a niche. Maybe a category called "Japanese popular culture" could be created, under which everything from manga to tarento could be included. As I said before, however, I'm new to this, so I don't know how one would go about doing this. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7EReldam_48f6.html" title="User:Reldam">Reldam</a> 18:25, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unless someone can make a credible argument that Japanese entertainment is significantly different from everyone else's entertainment (and enough different that it deserves a breakout from <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Japan_02eb.html" title="Culture of Japan">Culture of Japan</a>), I have to vote to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:Transwiki">Transwiki</a> to Wiktionary. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7EReldam_48f6.html" title="User:Reldam">Reldam</a> hints that there might be differences but didn't provide evidence. If the article is expanded before the discussion period ends, I'll reconsider my vote. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:28, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course Japanese entertainment is different from everyone else's. Practically every country's entertainment is significantly different from every other's. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:25, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I thought you couldn't expand articles that were being voted on. Basically, there are so many articles specific to Japanese culture (<a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_idol.html" title="Japanese idol">Japanese idol</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mangaka.html" title="Mangaka">mangaka</a> (what other culture has its own list of comicbook writers? - and in so many languages?), <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarento.html" title="Tarento">tarento</a>, etc.) that Geinokai would be an umbrella for them all. If there's no room for Geinokai, then would we delete or transwiki all the other Japan-specific articles? An expanded Geinokai article would discuss the production company system, how scouting works, the Yakuza connection, and more. My argument is that there are so many Japanese pop culture-specific articles (and not just in the English Wikipedia) because Japanese pop culture is unique in the world today, and is beginning to have an influence (although in a different way) like US and British culture had in the 60s. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7EReldam_48f6.html" title="User:Reldam">Reldam</a> 07:16, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You certainly can improve articles during Vfd, although you may have to nag some people to reconsider their votes. An expanded Geinokai article would be a useful way to link the other J-culture items together, but they would still deserve their own articles. Another possibility would be to write about the geinokai in <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Japan_02eb.html" title="Culture of Japan">Culture of Japan</a>, then break it out when its a decent size <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:25, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, I'll do that, then. That seems like a more appropriate method. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7EReldam_48f6.html" title="User:Reldam">Reldam</a> 19:42, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unless significantly expanded, <b>merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Japan_02eb.html" title="Culture of Japan">Culture of Japan</a>, with potential for spinning it back out in the future. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:12, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sounds great. I'll look up how to do that, and do it. Incidentally, who's monitoring this and will make the final decision? <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7EReldam_48f6.html" title="User:Reldam">Reldam</a> 07:44, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Several people are monitoring in various degrees. I'm not sure exactly which admin or admins work out what the consensus is about each page, but they seem to be pretty good at it. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:51, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Japan_02eb.html" title="Culture of Japan">Culture of Japan</a>, which already has a significant section on Japanese pop culture. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 03:16, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Great! So should I just cut and paste, or is there a particular procedure for doing this, or what? I don't know what will happen to the actual entry, so I'll just paste what I've got so far into the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Japan_02eb.html" title="Culture of Japan">Culture of Japan</a> article, and let the powers that be do what needs to be done with the <a href="../../../g/e/i/Geinokai.html" title="Geinokai">Geinokai</a> page. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7EReldam_48f6.html" title="User:Reldam">Reldam</a> 18:55, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
