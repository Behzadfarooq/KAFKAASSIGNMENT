<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>EXTREME Cleanup</b>. I am entirely fed up with the opinionated 15-year olds going around on the article talk pages, vandalizing my talk page for protecting it, and other stuff. IT has no value, because we can't list every single group out there. Unless you want to start from scratch and only add groups with a news article source, my vote stands. If you'd like to do what is outlined in the previous sentence, then the extreme cleanup applies. — <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep"><span style="color:gray;">Ilγαηερ</span></a> <a href="../../../i/l/y/User_talk%7EIlyanep_ef6d.html" title="User talk:Ilyanep"><span style="color: #333333;">(Tαlκ)</span></a> 01:18, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm inclined to agree with the nominator. A few examples in the main <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">Warez</a> article should be sufficient for our encyclopedia.

<dd>I would say this is fairly good precedent that at least some warez groups are encyclopedic. If one accepts that premise, it is not much of a stretch to believe that a list of notable warez groups is also encyclopedic. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 08:41, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - unlike the category, it seems like this table provides pretty good concise summaries / short descriptions of the groups. Agree with Dragons flight above on the necessity of limiting the groups to sufficient notability, though that of course carries the caveat of flame wars, vandalism, etc. when someone decides that warez group X or Y is not notable. Verifiability, IMHO, should not be too problematic, either. <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">RidG</a> <a href="../../../r/i/d/User_talk%7ERidG_5b69.html" title="User talk:RidG">(talk)</a> 07:34, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, mostly <s>harmless</s> unverifiable (sorry, I have <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> on my watchlist). I'm with Ilyanep on this one. Either this article gets deleted because it's too secret, or it gets kept, but only with groups that are verifiable through news sources.

<li><b>Delete</b> - not notable.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Not to overtly criticize, but that's a rather unsophisticated comment. 95% of all released warez comes from a small number of well-established groups, with anywhere from 2 to 5 groups vying for the top position in a specific niche (i.e., PC games, DVD movies, etc.). Given the attention that piracy receives in this country and others, I would argue that such major contributors to piracy are indeed sufficiently notable. Infamy does not warrant lack of inclusion to the Wikipedia, at least as far as I am aware. <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">RidG</a> <a href="../../../r/i/d/User_talk%7ERidG_5b69.html" title="User talk:RidG">(talk)</a></li>

<li><b>Bicycle keep</b>. As it clearly states atop this article, this is a list of warez groups for the parent article on <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">warez</a>. It was created because the list of names was becoming too long for the main article and it was appropriate to export it; I believe this is an acceptable reason for the creation of a list on Wikipedia. If non-notable or non-verifiable groups are added they can always be removed, but that is certainly not a valid reason for the deletion of the entire list. Secondly, this list serves to document notable groups which do not yet have articles rather than create a host of stubs.

<dd>RaD Man brings up a good point. This article, while being placed on VfD, has not had a chance to be improved. That really weakens this VfD, because one of the benefits of a VfD is that the article itself often gets improved during that time. If this article gets deleted (and it's pretty borderline right now), that makes it a strong case for a VfU. Perhaps this article should be unprotected and placed on VfD for another week. I'd like to see how (or if) this article gets improved. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 17:29, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> for several reasons: 1) moved to sub page since <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">Warez</a> was getting too large 2) stops the main warez article (which has been a repeatedly used resource/reference by major media organizations NY TIMES, BBC) itself from being vandalized constantly by joe schmoe the 12yr old warez kiddie to hype his latest l33t group. 3) Its really easy to verify existance of groups, but many are not noteworthy enough to get a stub article. This is a way to list smaller groups, as well as larger more verifiable groups with a brief 2-3 sentance description of them, and save the hassle of vfd's of small stubs because one person decided group X was non notable. Sadly a category (which I do find useful) would get cluttered up way too fast if we were to start including data on each group since there have been probably 15,000+ warez groups worldwide in the past 20 years. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 00:17, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Many of these groups are very notable, some a little less. I'm offering my help in cleaning it up. It should definitly stay. <a href="../../../b/b/x/User%7EBbx_da7b.html" title="User:Bbx">bbx</a> 01:20, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Agreeing with RiDG, the fact that cracked/pirated software/media makes up such a large margin in the computer market (a given, since anyone somewhat knowledgeable on a computer has heard of p2p, and the general makeup of those networks is for distributing such files) should account for it's place it notability. Second, agreeing with RaD Man and ALKIVAR, the need for a seperate list to be created should be obvious given that someone that doesn't know what the term warez means probably doesn't want to have to deal with a huge list of groups on the same page. Also, not to be critical, but it seems that most of those giving a reason for deletion simply find the subject offensive. A wiki not only allows editing by anyone from mister PhD to his 4 year old daughter, but it also promotes free-speech. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHello_World_f110.html" title="User:Hello World">Hello World!</a> 18:02, July 19, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Warez groups are on top of their food chain. They're the ones responsible for nearly every illegal copy of software and games out there, etc. Wikipedia's not paper, as some say. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClaviola_cdbc.html" title="User:Claviola">claviola</a> <a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClaviola_9584.html" title="User talk:Claviola"><small>(talk to me)</small></a> 14:03, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Moderate keep</b>, mainly because all of the groups have their own articles already, and a list is more informative than a category. I don't really like the formatting, though. It should be more of a standard headers+&lt;dl&gt;-type thing. «&#160;<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlerante_1d6c.html" title="User:Alerante">alerante</a>&#160;<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlerante_c804.html" title="User talk:Alerante">✆</a>&#160;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Alerante_2a90.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Alerante">✉</a>&#160;» 15:45, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - but clean, perhaps, keep the POV out, etc. IMO this page was in its best state after Ilyanep locked it originally - it was POV, flame free, info was easily verifiable (defacto2.net, cybercrime.gov), and useful.
