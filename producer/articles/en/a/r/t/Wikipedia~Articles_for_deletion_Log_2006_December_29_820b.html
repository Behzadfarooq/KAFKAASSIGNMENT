<li><b>keep &amp; expand</b> WP guidlines call for multiple (2 or more) non trivial sources. (1) The "Egyptian Military Museum in Cairo" was implied by the nominator as a non-credible source; how can that be? At WP there is the assumption of Good Faith, and why wouldn't an exhibit exist featuring a display etc. on the nation's first Chief of Staff. (2) Under an alternative spelling several documents have been found which reference this man; one clearly demonstrates notability by discussing the changes in the Egyptian army and specifying him as Chief of Staff.

<li>Reliance on Google (etc.) for other than recent history is a dangerous practice, it is a tool for suggesting notability but not disproving notability.</li>
<li>Being a horse suggests being a mammal, but not being a horse does not exclude being mammal. Getting high G-hits suggests being notable, but not getting G-hits does not exclude being notable.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Please note that a museum, in and of itself, is not a reliable source. What exactly is being sourced? The front desk? An expert on this area within the museum (if so, name the expert)? An exhibit (name the exhibit)? You can't just reference the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum for every U.S. flight-related article. That having been said, please do not ignore that my comment on GHits is not without context. I used all of the comments in my nomination as deciding criteria for submitting this AfD. At the time, there was no secondary source (the article recently added) and the museum was the only source given. Combined with the poor quality of the article (little context, little claimed notability), I decided that it would be best to err on the side of deletion than keeping it, knowing that it could be created in the future with a better start. As it stands now, the article is much better than it was when nominated. A little better would even warrant a dismissal of the AfD. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 04:54, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

Anyway, I'm having a hell of a time trying to find any second source about him, so help is appreciated ... none of the hits in Arabic are about him, as far as I can tell, but other people with the same name. Nor does he appear in "Biographical Dictionary of Modern Egypt" and similar books; the only thing I <i>have</i> been able to find is a one sentence mention in Tripp's "Contemporary Egypt: Through Egyptian Eyes" on p51 as "Shukri Pasha".

<li>Dhartung, are there expandabilty guidelines? i.e., (1) can an article be too short when brevity is encyclopedic and (2) do we have a crystal ball telling us that someone from Cairo won't drop in next month with a wealth of info. So how do you measure expandability? --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 13:08, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, an article can be "too short". A <b>guideline</b> is just that. We are not bound by guidelines. WP:V alone does not mean we must keep everything that is verifiable. AFD exists in part to judge encyclopedic quality. There is obviously a dearth of English-language sources about this person, a situation I don't expect to magically change tomorrow. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:56, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Dhartung, based on your comments and research which I have seen elsewhere, you are intellegent and dedicated, but you can't just cite your personal opinion that an article is too short or unlikely to improve -- how is that being objective? --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 23:07, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

After <a href="../../../y/a/o/Yaohushua.html" title="Yaohushua">Yaohushua</a> was finally protected by an admin, the editor who repeatedly reverted that redirect opted to head to the nominated article and change it from a redirect to Yaohushua to contain the content that had originally been deleted from Yaohushua.</dd>
<dd>That content had been removed because it was unverifiable and most likely original research. No reputable sources have ever been cited in the existence of the Yaohushua article, and there are no findable references of note except those mentioned on the <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacred_Name_Movement_71aa.html" title="Sacred Name Movement">Sacred Name Movement</a> page which lists "Yaohushua"/"Yauhushua" among several other names.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - games he's developed have received multiple reviews from independent game magazines, and since he is the source of the games he's functionally equivalent to their publisher.

<li>Then the games would be notable but he would not be notable independently of them. There are no independent sources in the article, and if you can't find any independent sources that talk about <i>him</i> rather than interview him, include him, etc. in an article about <i>the game</i>.
<ul>
<li>This strikes me as splitting hairs. Wikipedia has hundreds (thousands?) of articles on videogame developers, and ordinarily the article on the developer is regarded as more worthwhile than the games themselves. In a case like this, where the developer and the publisher are effectively the same, I think it argues strongly for inclusion. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 02:42, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I doubt Wikipedia has that many articles on video game developers, but if their sources are as weak as for this one, then those articles do not belong on Wikipedia either.

The last entry in the freeware series is still played and modified to this day, despite being years old, and the upcoming update to the newer commercial series is highly anticipated although not as popular as the EWR release.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I have an opinion that all Extremism sites should be removed whether they are about Hinduism, Islam, Christianity or any other, because those extremist elements are not derived from the ‘Truth’ of those religions but from those of who were ‘Fanatic’ of those religions or misused those religions.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Jesus Christ never said anywhere to spread the God’s message in ruthless ways.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But the fanatic Emporors in the Old Europe, West Asia and rest of the world and their local rulers destroyed the most beautiful Pagan Temples in then Roman Empire everywhere in the Old Europe and West Asia. Islamic kings and Emperors were not second to others.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even the Hindu society was and is divided by various caste systems. But if you carefully analyze there is mystery on many things of their originality. Whether they really represent the original Hinduism or the derivatives, which was blended with.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So it is not prudent to observe Extremism in Christianity, but wipe out those weeds of customs, which were introduced within the Christianity from the pre-historical times and the fanatics who misuse the Christianity.</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> The present article actually does not seem that POV, since it does not say that all or most Christians are extremists, and mainstream media in even predominantly Christian nations agree that there are extremists among Christians. History books are full of descriptions Christian extremism (religious persecution, religious wars, bombings of abortion clinics). Granted, extremism may seem very mainstream and in accordance with the requirements of the religion to the extremists themselves. The thing lacking in the article is SOURCES! All it cites is a website. It would not be much of an exercise to keep what is there and source it from mainstream media, or the present article could be deleted without prejudice so that a well sourced article could be created later. The POV viewpoint is to claim there is no Christian extremism in the world and never was. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:10, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Edison. All religions can have extremist interpretations and its important to document it.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Edison; this is a valid and rather widely used concept and I'm sure there are plenty of sources out there, though they need to be cited properly. The article itself doesn't appear to be all that POV, though, as I've said, we need sources and in a 'controversial' article like this it's especially important to cite virtually everything in the article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:54, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per above points - cleanup needed, but the site is definitely of merit and worth an article (I've had game shop staff and customers refer me to it for advice and reviews) --<b><a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i><small><sup><a href="../../../c/k/a/User_talk%7ECkatz_91bf.html" title="User talk:Ckatz"><font color="green">chat</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ckatz_cb51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz"><font color="red">spy</font></a></sub></small></i> 10:10, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless notability can be shown, and it hasn;t happened yet. Existence of template being used to spam the site across tons of articles in no way in itself demonstrates notability, just that someone went through and places links everywhere. I think the template needs to be deleted more than the article itself, but the article, if it does stay, should not have all the thoroughly nonencyclopedic trivial and self-promotional details that were there. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 10:33, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I added several references, which I believe should help establish notability. BoardGameGeek <i><b>is</b></i> notable in the boardgaming community, regardless of the ability of editors here to demonstrate that. The presence of cruft is not in itself an argument against notability, but it does demonstrate that the article could use some work. That's a separate issue, I would think. <a href="../../../j/w/o/User%7EJwolfe_9fa5.html" title="User:Jwolfe">Jwolfe</a> 11:16, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Highly notable with many mentions in online interviews and articles and 100,000+ members worldwide, BGG is the primary internet website and database for board and card games. It is virtually impossible to do a google search for a board game and not hit this website. BGG is part of <i>WikiProject Board and table games</i> and it is certainly no less notable and encyclopedic than many other Wikipedia entries for online databases, e.g. <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Comic_Book_Database_32b0.html" title="Grand Comic Book Database">Grand_Comic_Book_Database</a>.

The article said that he was injured, so if he is first team but didn't play he could be notable. I think it fails by the school (club) having insufficient stature. <b>Delete</b>--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 12:54, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>He drives a Lincoln Navigator and has a penchant for drinking Jim Beam on the rocks and hooking up with Julia Hoyt. Scott frequently likes to blackout and get naked at inappropriate times. He is often said to have the biggest legs in the room. Rumors have also circulated around campus that he is a raging homosexual who enjoys particpating in bukkake events. It was reportedly during one of these escapades, that Scott picked up his infamous case of gonorrhoea.</p>

Even if the Asterisk Art Project is notable, Mason deserves a line or two in that article, not a whole article to himself.

<li><b>Delete</b> I am the author of the article. I have no problem with its deletion, as I am now aware of it's non-notability. Please feel free to delete it. It was part of an art project on archives and historical records for a university course, in which I had to put information about Josef Zirmer (a family member) in the the public domain. I will keep the article on my user page, as it will be needed for my final assessment. Sorry if I have broken any rules, but it won't be happening again. Thanks for everyone's kind words about it being a good article - much appreciated. Out of interest, how does one find the number of hits for a page? <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELetsfckpeaches_cfcd.html" title="User:Letsfckpeaches">Letsfckpeaches</a> 13:32, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I understand. You're welcome for the compliments.&#160;:-) We find the number of hits for a page by searching the article title on Google. For example, I searched "Josef Zirmer" (with the quotes) on Google, and came up with two hits. <a href="../../../s/u/e/User%7ESue_H._Ping_f714.html" title="User:Sue H. Ping">Sue H.

<dd>Well, the article itself is not objectionable. It's a list of seasons in a major-league sport. It's a no-brainer that well-done it would be kept. The thing is, this isn't well-done, and it's more or less abandoned. If <a href="../../../b/a/s/WP%7EBaseball_1931.html" title="WP:Baseball">WikiProject Baseball</a> was working on it, that'd be something, but as far as I can tell they're not.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Coasttocoast's comments. I agree that they should not have been redirected.

<li><b>Keep</b> Should be done other sports.

Same for basketball <a href="../../../2/0/0/Category%7E2000_in_basketball.html" title="Category:2000 in basketball">Category:2000 in basketball</a>. Basketball also seems to have an article for the sport year.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have restored the four season articles back to their original status. The person who changed these to redirects really should have discussed it before making such a drastic change, especially given how obvious the differences between <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_MLB_season_e4a6.html" title="2005 MLB season">2005 MLB season</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_baseball.html" title="2005 in baseball">2005 in baseball</a> are. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 05:55, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b>: I'm the person that redirected those articles. First, why didn't someone simply <i>ask</i> me why I did that rather than announce here that I was wrong while my back was turned. Second, I hardly consider a single redirect edit a drastic change. The original author noticed the redirect and also did nothing to try to contact me. I included a perfectly nice edit summary with the redirect edit which, to me, invited an explanation as to why the articles were created. Third, the content split was not done well. It resulted in huge amounts of duplicated content between <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_baseball.html" title="2005 in baseball">2005 in baseball</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_MLB_season_e4a6.html" title="2005 MLB season">2005 MLB season</a>. I could understand if the split was in progress but it had been in place for months and still contained a huge overlap, both in actual content and in concept. That's why I figured it was just a poor attempt at a split and had been abandoned by Coasttocoast who hadn't edited <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_MLB_season_e4a6.html" title="2005 MLB season">2005 MLB season</a> in over a month at that point. Another six weeks post-redirect with no complaints or communication solidified my hunch that the issue was dead. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 12:36, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think there was any intention of back stabbing here, just a lot of misunderstanding all the way around but I think it's worked out, yes? If coasttocoast will continue with this article then so be it. If not then it should be deleted without prejudice. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 16:13, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>(I'll keep comments here - I found this page after I left a message at <a href="../../../r/e/s/User_talk%7EResolute_4536.html" title="User talk:Resolute">User talk:Resolute</a>) I can't agree with a few things left on my talk page. As far as discussing before redirecting, when I see something broken that hasn't been touched in over a month, I generally figure that it's fallen off everyone's radar so I <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">fix it first</a> and wait for someone else to initiate discussion. (I'm still a little surprised that no one did that.) Next, I very much disagree that the 2005 articles are properly split. I estimate that 90% or more of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_baseball.html#Events" title="2005 in baseball">2005 in baseball#Events</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_baseball.html#Deaths" title="2005 in baseball">2005 in baseball#Deaths</a> pertain to MLB as well as 100% of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_baseball.html#Awards_and_honors" title="2005 in baseball">2005 in baseball#Awards and honors</a>. Last - and this is supported by the previous point - I'm not sure splitting the articles was even necessary to begin with. That's another reason I simply redirected - it was essentially a merge. Removing all of the MLB info from <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_baseball.html" title="2005 in baseball">2005 in baseball</a> would leave very little - almost a stub. If you want to do a split, it might be better to break out the large sections: 2005 baseball calendar, 2005 deaths in baseball... Sorry, but I'm not on board with this discussion so far. But I'm listening! <a href="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmiley.svg_d547.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/8/85/Smiley.svg/20px-Smiley.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmiley.svg_d547.html" /></a> —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 00:25, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>My biggest problem with the x in baseball series as it is presently constituted is that it assumes that baseball = MLB. Clearly that is not the case when there are dozens of minor leagues in North America, the Japanese leagues, etc. I would suggest that there is more than enough to separate each MLB season out of the x in baseball series, then expand the latter to include all other levels. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_baseball.html" title="2005 in baseball">2005 in baseball</a> does attempt to do this somewhat, but you are correct that it is imperfectly done. Regardless, I think it may be better to move this discussion to one of the related article's talk page, as this is the wrong forum, and this AfD will be closed at any time given the nomination was withdrawn. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 00:35, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, I think for a college show it is very notable, in that it is one of the only college sketch shows to release that many episodes with an intent to relase a DVD to the public. It is award winning, and while it is only campus-broadcast currently, as of 2007 it will be broadcast all over the Greater Milwaukee Area on cable-access, and there are also talks in progress about having the show syndicated on a new campus TV channel at Rhodes College in Tennessee. I think that is a first, to have shows produced at one college broadcast at another, non-affiliated college. --<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadStude_b77e.html" title="User:RadStude">RadStude</a> 06:39, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This seems to be exactly the type of radio tower article we should keep. There are a number of radio tower articles up for deletion. See, <i>e.g.</i> the five listed on 2 January at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Transmitter_Truc_de_Fortunio_3a42.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Transmitter Truc de Fortunio">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Transmitter Truc de Fortunio</a>. As I said there, I find these radio tower articles infinitely more valuable than stubs about individual Eurovision song titles, but I would classify them similarly, namely of particular interest to a small group of widely geographically separated individuals. As such I would question any "of local interest only" tag. In many ways they might be compared to the articles about individual botanical and zoological species. Now rather than piecemeal pick at these radio tower articles, it might be appropriate to ask those interested to develop guidelines for inclusion of individual tower articles, as opposed to general articles like maybe, Radio Towers of France, or maybe by mountain range Radio Towers of the Pyrenees. The general articles could have tables that provide the information now provided by these stubs, and where a full article is appropriate, say like say with <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swisscom-Sendeturm_St._Chrischona_890b.html" title="Swisscom-Sendeturm St. Chrischona">Swisscom-Sendeturm St. Chrischona</a>, then those articles could provide a link from the table. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 19:05, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Stub article refers to an obscure neologism (<a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>) or a hoax term that isn't actually used. In Japan, qipao is referred to as "China dress" <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">チャイナドレス</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">chaina doresu</span></i><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span>, so it is unlikely the term "Qi Lolita" comes from Japan.

<li><b>Delete</b> I feel uncomfortable supporting deletion of an article from an area I am not familiar with, but I can say as a linguist that this and the related term "wa lolita" just wouldn't fly in the language of the young and fashionable.

<p>I came to this page expecting to find a good encyclopedic article about home businesses, especially of the types I see offered online. What I found was a page entirely filled with original research, weird platitudes and, most importantly, nothing I can find that could be salvaged or cleaned up without entirely rewriting the article, in my humble opinion. I've never experienced such a difference in what I expected out of a Wikipedia page and what I got.

However, YesLogic has been deemed 'nonnotable'. Further, there is a single item of press coverage associated with the article rather than the "multiple" suggested by the notability standard.

It remains unfortunate that the originating comapany is not considered notable by Wikipedia standards, but that is not absolutely essential given other satisfied criteria.

<p>Non notable game, most of the 872 Google hits have nothing to do with the game<a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22snaps%22+%22party+game%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22snaps%22+%22party+game%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>: no sources outside of the homepage apparently. Furthermore, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a how-to guide, and if you remove those parts, there is nothing left of the article.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I've played this game many times and first learned about it from a book. The above suggested search was done with "snaps" "party game" which is a flawed method of determining whether an article should be deleted for pages related to the game may not use the word "party game" in an article relating to it. For example a page about its rules, or that it might just be described as a game. The webpage <a href="http://www.partyplan.co.uk/asp/game_166.asp?CategoryId=8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.partyplan.co.uk/asp/game_166.asp?CategoryId=8" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> is a good example where over 48 comments have been left about the game and where the game is described but the only place 'party game' appeared is the title of the company. <a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~sillke/PUZZLES/snaps" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~sillke/PUZZLES/snaps" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> is another example. Also, the article size is comparable to <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trouble_%28board_game%29.html" title="Trouble (board game)">Trouble (board game)</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pictionary.html" title="Pictionary">Pictionary</a>, and the majority of games listed on <a href="../../../p/a/r/Party_game.html" title="Party game">Party game</a>. If you assume <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> then the article is comparable to <s><a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahtzee.html" title="Yahtzee">Yahtzee</a></s> <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hopscotch.html" title="Hopscotch">Hopscotch</a>. Some encyclopedia articles will be small. I've made it a game stub which is probably the best solution over deletion. <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw"><span style="font-size: 13px arial; color: #3366FF;">Mkdw</span></a><a href="../../../m/k/d/User_talk%7EMkdw_2d50.html" title="User talk:Mkdw"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></a> 08:41, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b>: Have you seriously looked at <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahtzee.html" title="Yahtzee">Yahtzee</a>? The article is not comparable at all in scope, depth, ... The Yathzee article has many sections beyond the game guide. Even the "trouble" article is a lot better, and only Pictionary is similar. But that doesn't matter, we are discussing the merits of snaps, not comparing it to other, unrelated articles which may or may not be fit for deletion or improvement. As for my search method, it was the only way I coud be reasonably sure to find relevant links. Looking for "snaps" or snaps plus game achieves nothing since they are such common words. If the "snaps" article can be mad e to resemble the Yahtzee article (minus the gameguide, and plus references preferably), then I would be very happy to withdraw this nomination and keep the article. I have seen no indication of this though... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:58, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trouble_%28board_game%29.html" title="Trouble (board game)">Trouble (board game)</a> has at best 1 more paragraph in length. It's also a 1 reference article. I misreferenced the wrong game, my apologizes, I meant to link <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hopscotch.html" title="Hopscotch">Hopscotch</a>. Also, there is no need for sarcasm or that tone, it was a simple mistake. <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw"><span style="font-size: 13px arial; color: #3366FF;">Mkdw</span></a><a href="../../../m/k/d/User_talk%7EMkdw_2d50.html" title="User talk:Mkdw"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></a> 09:09, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I wasn't sarcastic, just bewildered. I notice you have added references to the article, but they are all user submitted ones, not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources, which was the same result I found with my Google search. The game exists, but doesn't seem notable, and nothing seems to be possible to say about it beyond its existence. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:13, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you learned about it from a book, then <i>cite the book</i> and you will address the verifiability concerns that other editors are raising. Currently you have cited three simple mirrors of this very article, an article on a self-submission web site that appears to involve no fact checking, and a web page that purports to be a copy of a Usenet posting. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:46, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A bare vote without a rationale (What you have written is merely a way of encoding the word "keep".) is likely to be discounted in the face of assertions that the article is not verifiable.

<li><b>Comment</b> I just clicked on 8 from the list and not a single one was in the category. So how is it information redundant? --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 06:33, 30 December 2006 (UTC) OK, I just clicked on another 8 and only one: <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_%28album%29.html" title="Britney (album)">Britney (album)</a> was in the category. Did anyone actually compare the category to the list before voting? I always like to assume good faith, but it looks like people are voting without actually doing any research. A category and a list are only redundant if they contain the exact same information. If you delete one or the other without making a comparison, you are losing information. Thats why lists and categories are 100% compatible. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 06:39, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I was afraid that some of the albums listed weren't in the category - we could add the category to the albums presented in the list before deleting it. A category is much better for this task than a list. The list is redundant since the category fulfills the task of the list and it really isn't needed. Even though the content in the list is different to the category, the content can still be added to the category regardless. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglasr007_d676.html" title="User:Douglasr007">Douglasr007</a> 09:03, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Not all information within the list is redundant. The list includes the CDs' year of release, which would allow a reader to determine trends in the use of enhanced CDs at a glance. Also, the list includes some red links, and the information that those discs were released in enhanced form would be lost if the list were deleted. Lists with red links are intrinsically good anyway, in that they suggest directions for further expansion of Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 19:14, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article on a video magazine was already deleted via prod but restored after a request at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. The content of the article only barely establishes a claim to notability (the magazine covered some notable bands), but offers no evidence that it itself was the subject of independent coverage (zero newshits on Newsbank). Only two issues as of March 2006. Not a procedural nomination, I believe it should be <b>deleted</b> unless notability is established via sources. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 10:21, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well... yeah. That's the precedent.

<li><b>Delete</b> This precedent, if it exists (which I am not convinced of), is not a good one. There are, as someone already mentioned, more than 6000 members of the Saudi royal family and other royal families are also of large size. Many members of these families are not notable in the least and will never be so and it would be ridiculous to have articles on all of them. Also, I seem to remember successful AfDs done on historical members of royal families who weren't notable. I highly doubt that this precedent would stand if a guideline were to be developed or if an editor tried to incorporate it into the current biographical notability guidelines. Also, the link provided by Smerdis above which seems to be offered as proof of precedent is a link to the highly notable Prince Charles of Wales which has absolutely no implications for this particular case. Even if it is established that this <i>totally unsourced</i> princess is notable for her achievements, the article should not be kept solely because she is a member of royalty. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:33, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I wouldn't be opposed with a redirect. The thing I'm not conviced of here is the actual existence of true City-States in the political sense. Please note that there is a conceptual difference between a city and a city-state and as it stands most cities in the article appear to have been part of larger empires which would mean they were not city-states. That, combined with a <i>total lack of sources</i> which could verify the existence of actual Kurdish City-States makes me lean towards deletion. Now, if sources are provided that actually illustrate that Kurdish City-States did, in fact, exist then this is a perfectly valid article topic, though it should be more than a list and it really should be <b>renamed</b> to draw attention to the fact that such city-states are not contemporary but rather historical. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 21:13, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well. whether or not there were independent Kurdish cities is a question that I don't know the answer to, I can believe that such did happen, so even absent some sources, I'm comfortable with a redirect.

<li><b>Delete</b> As poorly defined list. This list may be valid if it's referring to historical city-states. However, the article seems to at least imply that these are current city-states as the title is in the present tense and there is virtually no actually prose in the article. Given that there <i>are no</i> Kurdish city-states in existence today (I'm unsure of whether there have been in the past as I'm not all that familiar with Kurdish history, though I have a feeling that there weren't ever any truly Kurdish only city-states although I very well may be wrong) this should go or at least the title should be reworded and a brief introduction should better define what is being listed. I do, however, agree with Manticore that the argument that such cities shouldn't be sorted by ethnicity is false, as Ancient Greek City-States would be perfectly valid. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:43, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>The problem with this is that Assyrian and Kurdistan are more or less in the same area, just at different times. Thus that a city was originally Assyrian, and the Wikipedia article covers only that period, does not mean that the city was never Kurdish. It would help to have sources, mind you, and that is a problem with this list. Too bad the nominator didn't try that argument. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:29, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That would only be applicable if the intent were to make a list of Historical Assyrian City-states, and that would I assume, be taken care of in articles about <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyria.html" title="Assyria">Assyria</a>. As I said though, the thing is, many of these names might be in common, since the regions are in the same geographical area, just not at the same time. That's why I don't take saying "These are Assyrian cities" as proof that they weren't also Kurdish cities at some other time. Proving they were never Kurdish would require different sources. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:04, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem that I see here is that the burden of proof is on the articles creator and those seeking to keep it to provide sources that show that these were Kurdish city-states. Without sources we have no clue whether these Assyrian cities were every Kurdish city-states. Hell, we don't even have anything that actually proves that there ever have been city states that were strictly Kurdish! Without any sources and with what appears to be misleading/inaccurate information we shouldn't keep this. Also, just because the nominator didn't use the lack of sources as a reason for their nomination of this article doesn't mean that it can't be deleted for that reason. Again, finally, although I'm not particularly well acquainted with this region's history I do have a general knowledge of it and am personally unaware of there ever being anything that could properly be categorized as a Kurdish City-State. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 01:04, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I do agree that a lack of sources here is a problem, but merely showing a city was Assyrian doesn't disprove that a city was also independent and Kurdish at some point in time.

<dd>So, there's a variety of definitions of Kurdistan. Does that mean we should delete all articles on Kurds? No, it means the article should cover all the disagreements. The fact is, the Kurdish people do exist, and they had had prior minor governments. In any case, difficulty in writing an article doesn't mean deletion.

<dd>After checking all the blue links on this article, which is just a list, I am really convinced it needs to go. These 'principalities' weren't all principalities nor were they all Kurdish, some were simply cities. One link goes to a disambiguation page concerning two topics that are related to Mayans which obviously had nothing to do with the Kurdish people and one of the links is to Milan which is Italian.

<li><b>Clarification</b> Just to clarify my position, I'm not totally opposed to the concept behind this article. If there were indeed actual Kurdish principalities then an article on that is fine. However, such an article needs to state that it is historical rather than contemporary so, if kept, <i>it must be renamed</i> to illustrate this. Clearly, there are no contemporary principalities of any sort. Secondly, the article needs sources which it currently lacks and must be cleaned, the information in the article as it stands is misleading and incorrect. There has to be at the very least an introductory paragraph discussing what precisely constitutes a 'Kurdish Principality.' As it stands now this is just a list which isn't really acceptable, at least with the current title. I'm still not convinced that there were true Kurdish principalities, just as I'm as of yet unconvinced of the existence of true Kurdish City-States which is another AfD most of us are involved in. If this article is kept it needs to have sources that do show there were actual <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principalities.html" title="Principalities">principalities</a> of ethnic Kurds. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 21:08, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - prolific and popular feminist pagan/wiccan author. Just consider how many books she has written! I find it astonishing that this page has been even nominated for deletion, unless it be some sort of <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">pov bias</a> against subjects outside mainstream materialism. And even if that were a good reason (which it isjn't), there are heaps of articles on wikipedia, e.g. creation science, which are far more "lunatic fringe". Or if it is the fact that the page is stubby and incomplete has nothing to do with the notability or lack thereof of the subject. Typing in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22diane+stein%22+review&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2006-17,GGLD:en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22diane+stein%22+review&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2006-17,GGLD:en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">"diane stein" review</a> gives 40,800 hits on Google.

<li><b>Keep</b> With other editors, I contributed to the creation of this article to avoid the main page being too large. It was decided on the talk page that including the Qualifying Rounds in full for the first time provided a full and complete record of the FA Cup for this season. Unlike the month by month results <b>which I think should be deleted</b> the Qualifying Round article is a one-off article providing official record of the results for one season's competition. It shows that up to now Wiki's FA Cup pages have effectively ignored months of competition.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the month-by-month articles should be deleted, but I urge you to consider how Wiki is being used here. Rather than only holding the results from the First Round Proper - as BBC Sport does - Wiki is allowing fans, other editors, non-fans, to view full and complete results from the very start of the competition. Think about how, from here, the stub articles of smaller teams could be grown and improved. <a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktorbuk_af25.html" title="User:Doktorbuk">doktorb</a> <sub><a href="../../../d/o/k/User_talk%7EDoktorbuk_4b6f.html" title="User talk:Doktorbuk">words</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Doktorbuk_f540.html" title="Special:Contributions/Doktorbuk">deeds</a></sup> 07:49, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> These rounds are just as much a part of the competition as round one onwards, therefore there is no reason to delete them if the article on the rest of the competition is being kept. As stated above, this was broken out from the main article specifically because it was getting too large. Comparison with month-by-month results from the league is inappropriate <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 07:59, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The qualifying rounds are most definitely part of the competition, as they are in the current <a href="../../../u/e/f/UEFA_Cup_2006-07_d5b4.html" title="UEFA Cup 2006-07">UEFA Cup</a>. Merging it back into the main FA Cup article would make it too big for my liking, so it makes sense to have the qualifying rounds as a seperate article. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 08:53, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and precident. Game by game results in the NBA and NHL are also part of their competitions, however that level of detail is uncessary. Doubly so given these articles are completely lacking in context.

<li><b>Keep</b> per above. Coincidentally I was looking at this page yesterday, and found it very informative. Comparison with the NHL/NBA/Premier league don't hold, as neither of them is a major <i>knockout</i> tournament in the same way that the FA Cup is (if you lose an NHL match, you get to play again). As stated above, this stops main article bloat, as well. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 00:32, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and possibly merge all FA results pages to one; but, I can see a rationale for this page being kept separate from the later stages. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 12:18, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As per other comments, the qualifying rounds are as much a part of the competition as the later rounds, and including everything in a single article would make it too long. Splitting the qualifying results off into a seperate article was a sensible thing to do. <a href="../../../g/a/s/User%7EGasheadsteve_2c86.html" title="User:Gasheadsteve">Gasheadsteve</a> 18:33, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This individual exists birth records and Fijian afairs boards records and Native land trust board records will show this, David let me ask have ever even been to Fiji who have you asked and what authority do they speak on behalf, I question your sources David My sources are the Turaga Na Rasau himself which is the identy in question and he was put there by the Tikina of Lomaloma its elders and members of the cheifly clan Valelevu, which was endorsed and documented by the Lau provincial Council which was endorsed by the Fijian Affairs board which is also recognised and endorsed by the Great Council of Chiefs and also recognised by the Native Lands Trust Board.</dd>
<dd>The question is what are your source to comment so authoratatively on Fijian traditional titles and title holders and Fijian History, when you have no endorsement from any of these recognised Fijian institutions.</dd>
<dd>You also won't find in any books the title Taukei Nalotu of Solevu village held by Ratu Seva or the Turaga Na Ravouvou of Kadavu Island which is held by Ratu Kini, you probably won't have any references to the Malo of Kaba of Bau Tikina, nor references to the SauTuraga of Macuata to mention but a few, yet all these titles exist as do the individuals who hold them and have a very real history of which it has been documented by Fijian authorites, records which are not public domain but true record nevertheless and only accessable by the respective head clans and their senior kinsmen</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The above argument for keeping fails. We shouldn't have to go to Fiji to verify the notability of the article's subject. We can't just take your word for it, unless sources are provided which both verify the existence of this person and demonstrate how this person is notable then we have to delete it. You're statement that "you probably won't have any references to..." is an argument for deletion. It's not enough for the subject of an article to actually exist, the subject must of documentation proving their existence and importance and that documentation must be openly available to the public. Also, from what little information is provided in the article I doubt that this person is, even if sources are provided, notable enough for inclusion in the Wikipedia. Why is this person of particular importance? The article is a stub of only a couple sentences... --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:58, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Comment The person is of importance as he is the current Turaga Na Rasau, the Wikipedia Community is given me 2 months to properly format all artlcies in relation to the Turaga Na Rasau and the Tikina of Lomaloma and also provide verifiable references to show the legitamcy of the title and the title holders and variuos information on Lomaloma Tikina and it Villages, thank you for your imput and I will take in board during this process.

<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Maikeli, I appreciate your desire to develop articles related to Fiji which is something we need. That being said, our policies still hold and the Wikipedia Community has no means of giving anyone 2 months to properly format something. Unless proper sources are provided in the next day or two it is highly likely that this article will be deleted, however this should be done without prejudice to the article being recreated later when sources are found. I'd like to suggest that you copy and paste the article into your user space or save it to your computer so you can repost it once you have found proper sources. Also, please sign your articles by using for consecutive tildas (A tilde is this sign ~ ). Don't let this discourage you, we just need sources in order to keep articles. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 21:52, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Just a comment</li>
</ul>
<p>A large majority of the Fiji Articles have no source material at all and the ones that do have maybe 1 or 2 sources some of which don't load when clicked and some are not relible sources, does this mean if my article is deleted that there will be a deletion process for all of these? to be fair and if mine is kept will the same scrutiny be given to all these artlces and the "Ai Cavuti" artle used as a source is off a guys Blog spot, is that all you need? I will post all my sources and I tell I have alot more than all these articles combined, once you see me post them you'll realise, also the above comment applies to articles on Tonga but that is as far as I have looked as I need to spend my time verifying my article to you all. MALO MAIKELI <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMaikeli_7ec6.html" title="User:Maikeli">MB</a> 22:40, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Maikeli, two days is a general estimate. These AfD (Articles for Deletion) discussions can stay open for up to five days, after which an administrator will either delete or keep the article. As the article stands now I'd assume it will be deleted since it fails to meet notability and verifiability (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) policies which must be met in order for an article to be kept. I suggest you take a look through Wikipedia policies. Particulary important for you would be <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The link on reliable sources will tell you what kinds of sources are needed, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> will tell you how to cite those sources properly and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is a core policy related to these two guidelines. If other articles on Fiji contain no sources then they are probably good candidates for deletion as well and it indicates that editors simply haven't gotten around to nominating them for deletion yet. If you do have sources on them, however, it would be great if you'd read <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and use it to learn how to cite those articles in order to ensure they aren't deleted sometime in the future. Remember, if the article is deleted you should feel free to recreate it once you've found some sources. In general, its a <i>really bad idea</i> to create an article if you don't have any sources yet. Only create articles if you can cite them <i>when they are created</i>. Finally, you'll probably also want to read <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> as its closely related to what you are working on. Again, don't be discouraged! We need people like you to work on articles like this, but you'll need to take time to familiarize yourself with Wikipedia policies. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 00:51, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Creating a list of notable cellists, without creating criteria for inclusion on this list creates a never ending list like we have developing here.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Lists periodically have to be pruned of vanity/non-notable additions, to which they are particularly vulnerable, but they are a valuable information source on Wikipedia. Unlike categories they can contain redlinks showing us what articles need to be written still (e.g. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=joan+jeanrenaud&amp;spell=1" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=joan+jeanrenaud&amp;spell=1" rel="nofollow">Joan Jeanrenaud</a> leaps right out of there).

<li><b>Delete</b>. An unstructured list does not belong in the encyclopedia. Developing a page which has artists of style, genre, age, etc would be valuable.

<dd>Furthermore, in reponse to "Ivyrodnyc": the idea that the posting of a cellist's name in the august annals of Wikipedia is going to elicit a second thought by any other serious, professional cellist is ridiculous.

<p>My position is that the information on these characters would be better housed within the pages for the games they have appeared in, giving their plot importance and gameplay statistics (if any). The characters Lucia and Lady have only appeared in one game each (DMC2 and DMC3 respectively), while Trish appeared as an alternate costume in DMC2 (with no impact on the plot) and taking the place of Silvia for the unlockable Dante mode in the PS2 release of "Viewtiful Joe." I feel their notability beyond these individual games is negligible, and that the article fails to make a case for breaking them out of those game pages. By comparison, I do not see a "Women in Mario Games" page, nor a "Women in Final Fantasy Games" page, and those are much older game series with bigger rosters of characters with deeper backstories. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoradis_4577.html" title="User:Boradis">Boradis</a> 00:09, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> Alright, after perusing the articles some more I noticed that there's actually individual articles for most of the Devil May Cry characters though there aren't any links to them in the Devil May Cry template, strangely enough. Since none of the ladies appear in more than one game, I suggest merging the ladies to their respective games and leaving it at that. The portion of Women in Devil May Cry on Lady, for example, reads like a plot summary of the game. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 15:22, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> I would say merge to a List of Characters in Devil May Cry or a similarily titled page rather than putting the stuff on each game's page. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:55, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Dante, Virgil and Sparda all have their own articles. Aside from them, most of the characters in the Devil May Cry series tend to be confined to one game (although this may change for Devil May Cry 4). <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 17:01, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Doesn't mean that there's no value in having one page for all the characters in the series. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:53, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>At the same time, that most of the characters warrant an article speaks to the range. Currently the Women in Devil May Cry article is just a plot summary of each game, centered around the women in question instead of Dante. For the most part the women in these games are inextricably linked to the plot of the games (Trish was designed to appeal to Dante, Lucia was the catalyst for the events of Devil May Cry 2, Lady's father Arkham/Jester is a large portion of Devil May Cry 3) and any information regarding them is probably going to be duplicated in the articles in question regardless. Likewise the minor characters in Devil May Cry games tend to be, well, minor. They generally don't warrant much, if any consideration outside of the Plot Summary. This may be something to take to the Devil May Cry pages, however. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 18:22, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> to a List of characters in Devil May Cry series as Mister.Manticore suggested. A general character list is always good as long as it doesn't get too big.

<li><b>Keep</b> Is "stubbiness" really a valid reason to delete an article? Japanese rock has a history. It is distinct from rock music from other countries. It has its own stars and celebrities, many of whom probably have articles here. Is there another article that encompasses all of those things?

<li><b>Comment</b>. Well, some people say that the subject is notable (<i>contra</i> what it says at the moment), but without saying why.

<dd>I am not an expert on Japanese rock, but there are other aspects to consider beyond its stylistic differences. The history is unique to its country; for instance, how did rock develop in Japan and how was it received (both as a domestic and "imported" cultural aspect)? Rock in Japan is likely to have impacts on the country's culture that are unique. 206.213.209.31 19:01, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

Did you read the quotes? They were comments on J-rock from places outside of Japan. This phenom is global in nature. "Rock in Japan" is an oversimplification of the topic.

<li><b>Delete</b> First of all, to reply to Mesach, there <i>was no decision</i> in the last AfD that you cited; the result was no consensus so it is perfectly valid for someone to nominate it again. And furthermore, that AfD had very few votes and was arguably closed prematurely when it should have been relisted. That being said, this is unnecessary. The article is a stub so there is no reason for it to be separate from the main article as it doesn't help to shorten it which was its intended purpose in the first place, as the nominator mentioned. We don't need articles for individual aspects of television shows, it's unnecessary when that information can just as easily be included in the main article for that show which is also a more efficient way of doing it anyway. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 08:08, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Not sure people do Google checks correctly. I get quite a few more than 3, and far fewer than 600! Using various restrictions ("woolwich pastelist", "woolwich pastel", "woolwich madlyn pastel" etc.) the numbers fluctuate between ~50 and ~150 (this is because a ghits result may say 150 up front but when you check last page there's often a note that they're showing you x of y (total) because the rest are "very similar" i.e. duplicates. Her two books appear to have been published by reputable "arts and crafts" publishers: North Light Books (869 LC records) and Watson-Guptill Publications (1758 LC records). That said, I take no position because I'm not sure of her "notability" in the art world or the standing of the various societys she's a member/leader of. --<a href="../../../r/c/e/User%7ERCEberwein_ef62.html" title="User:RCEberwein">RCEberwein</a> | <a href="../../../r/c/e/User_talk%7ERCEberwein_897a.html" title="User talk:RCEberwein">Talk</a> 13:00, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<li>The alumni of any one particular college risks being such a small minority that in a fandom oriented topic we might consider detailed information on the subject to be cruft.

<li><b>Delete</b> As a totally arbitrary list. I could at least understand, though would probably still vote to delete, a list of anime and manga that <i>had</i> been released in the US, but a list of negatives is almost unexhaustable. Also, why is it particularly notable that these haven't been released in the US, rather than some other country? Seems like a case of systemic bias to me.

<li><b>Comment</b>: You seem to misunderstand what the term "POV fork" means. Read the article in question here, and compare it with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">Marriage</a>; someone has attempted to rewrite the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">Marriage</a> article by removing most of the information on same-sex marriages (while leaving intact practically all other information on other types of marriages) and filing this version under a different name. This isn't how things are done at Wikipedia. Same-sex marriage exists as a separate article because it's a major social issue; it can also be seen as a natural result of <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> editing on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">Marriage</a> article itself. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">-/-</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warren</a></span> 20:19, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete without prejudice</b> to re-creation with a <i>mostly original</i> text. This does seem to be a POV fork.

<li><b>KEEP</b> "Traditional Marriage" I agree with the last comment. Same-sex-marriage is already a conceptual branch off of the marriage article (even if the latter's content is not yet resolved). This article too is a branch with valuable information. That most of this data is repeated in the original article is not really the point. The information here can and should be rewritten to be more narrowly-focussed. Also, if "same-sex marriage" is a social issue, then "traditional marriage" is as much a social issue; the two terms reference one another and I'd say deserve separate entries. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverstarseven_e9b1.html" title="User:Silverstarseven">Silverstarseven</a> 02:54, 31 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverstarseven_e9b1.html" title="User:Silverstarseven">Silverstarseven</a> has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same-sex_marriage.html" title="Same-sex marriage">Same-sex marriage</a> is a distinctly different topic than marriage, in that it is a controversial, modern development in marriage. The article deals with its development and political history, as well as its status throughout the world. The <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_marriage.html" title="Traditional marriage">traditional marriage</a> article is just a cut and paste job of the original <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a> article, with all references to same-sex marriage deleted. That's what makes this a POV fork, while the same-sex one is not. Someone above suggested delete without prejudice. I second that. A fine article can be written about what traditionalists think of as marriage, and their efforts to defend that in a changing world.

<li><b>Comment</b> Although the creation of this article was pretty plainly a POV fork, the term "traditional marriage" is notable in the context of the same-sex marriage debate -- social conservatives <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22traditional+marriage%22&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22traditional+marriage%22&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" rel="nofollow">have made it a buzzword</a> similar to <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_values.html" title="Family values">family values</a>. Assuming this afd results in deletion, I hope this will not be taken as prejudicial to recreation of an article called "Traditional marriage" that discusses the political use of the term in a neutral way. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanB_DanD_1af1.html" title="User:DanB DanD"><font color="darkpurple">Dan</font><font color="black"><b>B</b></font>†<font color="blue">Dan</font><font color="darkblue"><b>D</b></font></a> 20:01, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - That's it exactly. "Traditional marriage" is now a political slogan with a non-obvious and non-trivial meaning. Opposition to same-sex marriage is often cast now as a "defense" of "traditional marriage". These usages are quite common - they appeared in every other political ad during the last US national elections, it seems - and surely deserve an article of their own. The text now under consideration is not that article. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 23:15, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>don't see the concern as the issue is that this deserving company has as much right be in this encylopedia as any, and more than some. Lets concentrate on the situation of relevancy and important, and not who is stepping up to give their educated opinions. It would seem that the purpose of Wikipedia is to encourage MORE people of good intentions to join in, and open up sites like this, instead of blocking their atttempts to do something positive. Makes absolutely no sense at all, and eventually you will simply be the losers, as you will chase away new customers. It may already be working to do exactly that. Is that really what you wish for Wikipedia, check out the Kansas City star today.. an interesting editorial, comments on giving more deference to less important and far less worthy, than those who should be encourged to come here.<a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOperadog_3f5f.html" title="User:Operadog">Operadog</a> 19:25, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, sorry for not addding my name. But I also wanted to ask Mr. Darcy if he would rather we come to this site with limited knowledge of what we are opening a page for, or go to our resources and ask for help, as I have done, in assembling the information that has been placed on the several sites, I have been a part of in developing. What is it yu have against people of good intentions working together for a good cause. It's called "Team work". Not some kind of conspiracy, as I've been made to feel, I am imposing on others.

<li>Let's fix it and be fair. I don't see why a reputable Opera company's article could be 'deleted' without any additional support. This can't be happening. Please let's not delete the article.

<li><b>Very strong Keep</b> I've just added information and links or references, and also asked for help in mediating this situation. This strong and young public minded Opera Company would be a valuable addition to Wikipedia. They would be enhanced to have such fine organizations as this, as part of this site. No reason whatso ever for deleting this group. They are fimly and professionally a thriving part of the Manhattan artistic community and do a lot of good work with young artists, even the recent USO fundraiser. An example of the best of any in their size and scope, that I've seen, in giving back to their community. Why in the world would anyone even consider removing this group.

<li><b>Very strong Keep</b> Attended several events there, definatly will see more of this exceptional group of artists. Absolutely outragous to even suggest deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> I removed the speedy and the prod. First of all; speedy <i>or</i> prod, please pick one and don't use both. I didn't think the db-context applied to an article that long; and as for the prod... Don't you think we should give a newbie contributor who is probably confused as to where their first attempt at creating this article went a chance to learn what's wrong with their article and create something coherent out of it? If this is an emerging cult, sect, or new religious group the article should be tagged for clean-up, issues mentioned on the talk page, and given a chance to evolve if possible. I watchlisted it when I tagged it for clean-up and if there was no change would have prodded it a few days from now. Lets give the creator a chance to look over the links in the welcome message I left them, and a chance to look at the issues pointed out with clean-up messages and on the talk page, and see if there is a change in the article. ~ <i><b><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="background:#0cc;color:#fff5ee">ONUnicorn</span></a></b></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup> 17:25, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The article creator appears to be attempting to address some concerns and remedy some of the problems in the article. Unfortunately, in doing so they have just asserted that, at this point in time the existence of Lavaeth Church is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. This quote from a recent edit they made to the article:
<blockquote>
<p>The number of members of the Lavaeth Church is not numbered greatly, and therefore is given the term "sect". Due to its foundation last year in the United Kingdom in the county of Kent <b>it does not have a great deal of publicity</b>. The reason for the Wikipedia article is to give a brief outline of the beliefs of the sect, with references to the scriptures.</p>
</blockquote>
[Emphasis added]</li>
</ul>
<p>If you cannot demonstrate via previously published material that this sect actually exists, then Wikipedia is not the place to give a brief outline of its belief system. Try another website like <a href="../../../m/y/s/Myspace.html" title="Myspace">myspace</a>, or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia.html" title="Wikia">Wikia</a>.

<li>Unfortunately, it seems to be that Hoax Religions appear with regularity on Wikipedia. I understand that this faith may be real and may be something by which you live your life (and I do, despite the implications of others, respect that), but without verification it's nigh impossible to seperate from Religions which might have been invented.

<li><b>Delete</b> Straight forward delete because it is not notable and not verifiable in published sources. Verifiablity is covered above. A prophet could be considered inherently notable, however, my understanding of the various Wikipedia guidelines would suggest that a prophet would have to attract a significant number of followers before achieving notability, or alternatively, a significant number of gainsayers.

As it currently stands this article seems to focus almost entirely on schools in the USA, despite the article professing to include a list of so-called UK and US-centric subcultures. However the term high school is not used in this context in the UK (we use the term "secondary schools" instead but would never talk about 'secondary school subcultures) so it is a complete nonsense to include any references to British youth subcultures under such a heading. Some of the British subcultures which are listed (eg, chavs, emos, goths and casuals) are not just confined to secondary schools in any case and can often refer to people in their twenties. Nearly all schools in the UK have school uniforms (I presume that is not the case in the USA) so the subcultures are mainly manifested in the clothes children wear in their leisure time. If there is a need for an article on American high school subcultures then the article should be retitled "High school subcultures in the USA" and should confine itself to American usage only. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahliarose_da64.html" title="User:Dahliarose">Dahliarose</a> 20:39, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Even aside from <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, one could argue that ClickBank needs a page based on <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. To fill editors in, ClickBank is essentially an affilliate marketing program that would most closely mirror multi-level marketing. You'll also notice quite a few links to get-rich-quick schemes based on ClickBank techniques. I believe an article on ClickBank would be good to have, not merely as an article to define what this widespread product/server does, but also to allow ClickBank's critics (and critics of affilliate-marketing programs in general) an opportunity to present a balanced description of the service. Do I think ClickBank is a great product or support what they do? (No, I have no opinion on that.) Do I want to lead people into shaky get-rich-quick schemes? <b>Definitely not</b>, but I think WP should have a balanced treatment of the subject. Here is a balanced review of ClickBank that I found while searching around:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.epublishingdaily.com/feature-clickbank-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/" class="external free" title="http://www.epublishingdaily.com/feature-clickbank-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/" rel="nofollow">http://www.epublishingdaily.com/feature-clickbank-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/</a></p>
<p>...That presents many of the negatives of the service. Maybe this isn't the sort of information that the creator of the ClickBank article wanted, but it is good information that probably needs to be considered in an NPOV article. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 22:12, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not necessarilly advocating that particular reference as a definitive source supporting notability, but merely to find one of the first things that came up in a search of the zillions of links found. I think it clear that something in such widespread usage is notable per se, and that there's both considerable criticism and controversy regaring the product--certainly enough to justify an entry here. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 22:20, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A quick trip to amazon.com and a search for "clickbank" turns up a few dozen books that include information on using ClickBank. Yes, a lot of these are self-published vanity works such as "How to Become Wealthy Selling Informational Products on the Internet", but then you'll also find some books such as "Build a Web Site for Dummies." I don't think anyone would claim the For Dummies series doesn't count as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-Site-Dummies-David-Crowder/dp/0764571443/sr=8-8/qid=1167431620/ref=sr_1_8/102-9031080-3452160?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/Building-Site-Dummies-David-Crowder/dp/0764571443/sr=8-8/qid=1167431620/ref=sr_1_8/102-9031080-3452160?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Building-Site-Dummies-David-Crowder/dp/0764571443/sr=8-8/qid=1167431620/ref=sr_1_8/102-9031080-3452160?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books</a></p>

<p>Essentially I think it is clear that there's so much out there on this subject that a good article on this company/service seems possible and inevitable.</p>
<p>I am in no way affilliated with ClickBank or their products, and I've never even used their products. But I *am* very familiar with Web technologies and companies, and I was incredulous when I saw this come up for deletion given that I'd heard their name so many times. I'm just against deleting articles off the cuff simply because the first version of them isn't that great. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 22:38, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The term "Hips Piercing" is a neologism for a specific placement of what is normally known as a <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surface_piercing.html" title="Surface piercing">surface piercing</a>. While many surface piercings have their own articles (<a href="../../../n/a/p/Nape_piercing.html" title="Nape piercing">nape piercing</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison_piercing.html" title="Madison piercing">Madison piercing</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corset_piercing.html" title="Corset piercing">corset piercing</a>), there is no commonly referred to placement for a hips piercing. Surface piercings can be and have been placed, with varying degrees of success, anywhere on the body, including the hips, but there is no specific placement, commonly accepted term, history or other factors that would justify an article for "Hips Piercing" at this time. Currently, a google search<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hips+piercing" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=hips+piercing" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> for the term "hips piercing" turns up very little other than this article and the video referenced in it. The first result is a <a href="../../../b/m/e/BME_7d6d.html" title="BME">BME</a> article that refers to a "surface hip piercing", which I take to be a descriptor, rather than an actual piercing term or name. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 17:58, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Unless we're going to get into Neckline Piercing, Wrist Piercing, Sternum Piercing, etc. Surface piercings are a dime a dozen and pretty much all of the ones which are in positions normally covered by clothes, especially at stress points like the hips or neckline, require jewelry made of flexible material. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 19:02, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Princess who is the subject of this article is non-notable.

<p>I think this entire entry is a spoof, since I can find no actual announcement that a sequel has been announced searching google.

<p>For starters, the concept of "The Delinquent Road Hazards" referring to a group of characters from the motion picture <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cars_%28film%29.html" title="Cars (film)">Cars</a> is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a> and is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

<p>Normally I would advocate cleanup of the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, but in this particular case, if you removed all the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, what you'd have left is information on the film and video games that should be at those respective articles, all at a namespace that is unverifiable in reference to this grouping of characters from the film.

Given the questions raised here though, I can't recommend a merge. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:39, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I herewith maintain that the page for The Delinquent Road Hazards should NOT be deleted. While I agree that information on each vehicle (viz., DJ, Wingo, Snot Rod, Boost, etc.) does not warrant individual entries, this one article is THE SOLITARY, yet primary source of information on that whole group of characters, which is priceless. Even just having a place for the JPEG photos of these cars argues for the retention of this article. Where else would the inquiring mind find useful information on these vehicles were it not for Wikipedia's diligence in creating this article in the first place? Please do not flush this valuable information into cyberspace oblivion!!!! We NEED this article to REMAIN in the cache of information on the CARS movie, as provided by Wikipedia! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, KEEP ALL YOUR GOOD WORK, AND DO NOT DELETE THE ARTICLE ... PLEASE!

<li>Wikipedia is most explicitly <i>not</i> supposed to be the sole source of information.

<li>I <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">think</a> that Rpaltza meant the only place <i>on wikipedia</i>.

<li>Right and that was my original reasoning for the AfD. This article is so far outside of what is acceptable as an article that it would be better to have a Characters in Cars article covering this.

<li><b>Keep</b> - (I don't know if unnamed passers-by can vote or not, so I apologise if this is a breach of etiquette). Don Ed Hardy is a major celebrity in some subcultures, and at least some of his celebrity name dropping can be verified by sources other than himself (the Needled blog for example). He is more than just a self-published author. Also becoming increasingly well known due to the highly successful eponymous clothing label. Deleting an article because it's poorly written is a knee jerk reaction - poor writing does not mean the subject doesn't deserve an encyclopaedic entry. --59.167.84.214 10:41, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b> By who's definition? Yours? If you work hard enough, every game listed here could be considered 'non-notable' in some way or other. And considering the article is nearly two years old, it'll take more than a single person saying it's non-notable to get it deleted. Also, considering half of the articles you contributed consist of <i>a single sentence</i>, it's kind of ironic.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The game has won multiple on-line awards. Simply because <i>you've</i> never heard of it, doesn't make it non-notable.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalfShadow_8ff1.html" title="User:HalfShadow">HalfShadow</a> 23:51, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't see any sources cited here. A review in <i>Web User</i> ("UK’s best selling internet magazine", allegedly) appears to be the closest thing to non-trivial independent reporting (the surest sign of notability per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>) my sad google skillz can find. Nothing on Google news, Factiva not checked, but Google news archive finds that this was "Amy's site of the day" in the Daily Mirror 14-Feb-2003, and there may have been some serious coverage in <i>Multichannel News</i>. I suspect that better legwork would find sufficient published material to produce a verifiable article, but I can't prove it and I'm not much of an eventualist. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 20:58, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>unneeded, there's an article on scottish football for those seasons</p>
<ul>
<li>I think this and all other seasons included in the RFCbyseason template (and the Rangers F.C. seasons category) should all be deleted. There has to be some sort of line set as to what you can add to this encyclopedia and what you can't and I think that the Scottish football 05/06 article is sufficient on its own (same for other seasons). If we keep this we could be setting a dangerous precedent, starting thousands of season articles for particular clubs. I really appreciate the amount of work put in by WP editors into these articles but I just don't think they're necessary. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatanh</a> 23:11, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - More than just the Scottish league info is included, such as the Champion's League games. I also don't see how thousands of season articles for clubs is a bad thing. A club's season-by-season history is encylcopedic, and would overwhelm the club articles themselves for teams with very much history. It also provides a nice place to put roster info (who else was on the team with XYZ in 2005), which have been turning up in more than a few places lately. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 12:25, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - This will be setting a precedent where you could have 50 articles for all of Falkirk or Bolton's seasons (if there's a bored enough supporter). You have to draw the line somewhere. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatanh</a> 13:45, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>Why stop there? We could have <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forres_Mechanics_d5f7.html" title="Forres Mechanics">Forres Mechanics</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caernarfon_Town_bf8b.html" title="Caernarfon Town">Caernarfon Town</a> seasons too! <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 21:01, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, too much info is a <i>bad</i> thing? There are already bars for inclusion of soccer teams. Adding info like this to each team's article is not against wikipedia's policies, and by creating a sub-page for a season, it keeps the main article relatively clean. Would we rather have all of the World Cup results discussed on the single <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_World_Cup_e470.html" title="FIFA World Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> page, or should we leave them split out onto separate pages? <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 00:14, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, Articles on the seasons for football teams are encylcopedic. Wikipedia does not have a limit to the articles created nor do valid articles waste space.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - these articles are supplements to the main club articles. They comply with all WP policies. They are entirely encyclopaedic. There will not be thousands of articles produced - these take a lot of work and will only be written when an editor is committed enough to do the work.

<p><b>Nomination for deletion</b> Fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for its claims of encyclopedic notability. This badly sourced article came to my attention and thousands of others when it appeared as a "Did You Know?" item on Wikipedia's front page on December 16, 2006. I was surprised by how badly referenced this front page DYK article was and commented at the time<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Operation_Show_Me_How" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Operation_Show_Me_How" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>:</p>
<p><i>This article has insufficient references and if it were not a current DYK, I would nominate it for deletion. The external link provided gives very little information on this operation - not even the year when it happened. I ran a <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> search for "Show Me How" and "Interpol" and received zero relevant hits. I found this magazine interview which gives the operation a mention and dates it as starting at around 1998 but gives no end year for the operation. BUt the interview does not support the article's claims that this was an encyclopedically notable operation <a href="http://www.cio.com/archive/061500/interpol.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cio.com/archive/061500/interpol.html" rel="nofollow">[72]</a>. The claims that this was an unprecedented drug bust involving unusual use of the postal system are so far unverifiable, as is the claim about the children's colouring book. Even if proven, I'm not sure how these amount to encyclopedic notability. I'm having difficulty understanding why this is a DYK too.</i></p>
<p>Despite being on the front page and being scrutinized by thousands on that day, the only further reference added was a History Channel documentary episode on heroin. This documentary episode is easily found on Youtube (I won't add the link here due to copyvio concerns) - I watched the whole thing and there is no mention of this international 1990s police operation at all (the most modern era part of the documentary focuses on the USA and ends in the early 1970s and ends with a mention of an "Operation Golden Flow" (I'm not kidding) - the first US government mass urine drug-testing operation - applied to US soldiers leaving Vietnam; possibly this is what the person who added the History Channel reference was thinking about but it is totally irrelevant).</p>
<p>It is has not been proven that this operation is sufficiently notable for an encyclopedia or even significantly more notable than the other operations carried out by Interpol that have been mentioned alongside it e.g. <a href="http://www.ncjrs.gov/nathanson/etranscrime.html#3.2.5" class="external text" title="http://www.ncjrs.gov/nathanson/etranscrime.html#3.2.5" rel="nofollow">Operation "Hostal" and Operation "Black Powder"</a>.</p>

<p>The person who painted these pictures, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_B._Sherman_02ab.html" title="Robert B. Sherman">Robert B. Sherman</a>, is clearly encyclopedically notable as an important <u>songwriter</u>. However, painting appears to be a avocation or hobby of his and these paintings do not appear to be sufficiently notable to warrant articles for themselves - or I would argue, even anything beyond very brief mentions in his main article. It is worth noting that a famous songwriter paints as well, but if he is not a particularly reputable painter beyond the association with his songwriting celebrity, I don't think individual paintings deserve their own articles - if they have not received attention from art critics and the images are also not in mass production and there is not other outstanding circumstance related to the painting itself. Furthermore, I am concerned that the articles seem to come across as essentially advertisements for buying the limited edition prints from a website ( and the "symbolism" sections - what there is of them - appear to be OR).</p>

A painting by <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> recently made headlines when it sold for £612,800. It doesn't have an article. These articles demonstrate that the paintings are part of the avocational oeuvre of a notable songwriter, but, per nom, they don't include multiple sources discussing the individual works and they do include a possibly commercial aspect.

<li><b>Merge</b> all three into the main article (with deletion of the commercial aspects). He's in my eyes a gifted artist and deserves to have his paintings discussed in Wikipedia.

The same for <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman_Brood_4a9d.html" title="Herman Brood">Herman Brood</a>, a Dutch singer who committed suicide in 2001. Even if I don't appreciate Brood's paintings, they also fetch high prices now. This two examples to stress the point that a person may have great fame in his / her principal occupation, but behind that person may lurk another artist who deserves equal attention.

<li>I proposed to merge the content of these three articles into the main article of Robert Sherman. As to his reputation&#160;: Imdb states&#160;: "The London Exhibition was widely covered by TV, radio and printed press. Robert subsequently enjoyed a succession of successful art exhibitions in the United States" (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0792567/bio" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0792567/bio" rel="nofollow">[74]</a>). Another appraisal can be found here&#160;: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0792567/bio" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0792567/bio" rel="nofollow">[75]</a>. In other words, his work as a painter is at least NOTABLE today. If I were to follow your reasoning about future reputation, then <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Van_Gogh_ee92.html" title="Vincent Van Gogh">Vincent Van Gogh</a>, who sold only one painting in his whole life (to the Belgian painter <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Boch_2b41.html" title="Anna Boch">Anna Boch</a>), would never have been mentioned in Wikipedia if he were alive today. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJoJan_2b10.html" title="User:JoJan">JoJan</a> 13:44, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. While useful for its listings, the IMDb is not really a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for biographical material. The text cited above is an unreferenced, user-submitted "minibiography" and includes a great deal of hyperbole and at least one glaring inaccuracy (I would hate to see it be used as a source indicating that "Her Royal Highness" is an appropriate appellation for the late Queen Mother). And you're quite right; in his lifetime, the estimable van Gogh was probably not, in WP terms, a <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notable</a> painter. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 14:08, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As Robertissimo states, IMDB is not a reliable resource and is not one which is typically used to assess paintings anyway. Absolutely if Van Gogh were alive today, he would not be <i>encyclopedically</i> notable for Wikipedia if he had no reputation. Wikipedia is not a crystalball and adding articles based on our own personal ideas about what unknown art should be appreciated is original research <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 16:35, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The fact that he is, on the other hand, a world class <a href="../../../s/o/n/Songwriter.html" title="Songwriter">songwriter</a> should; therefore not detract from his painting career. His work in both fields has received notariety. His painting is clearly more than a hobby, in as much as he sells prints of his work. That said, the article, for mentioning this fact, is not an advertisement, but a statement of fact which proves it is of a professional nature. There is no "click to buy" button on the article nor is this anymore an advertisement of the artist's work than is any article about a piece of intellectual property. One could use this arguement that an image of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris%2C_France_1fae.html" title="Paris, France">Paris, France</a> is really just a shameless bid for tourist dollars, when such is not the case. <b>More importantly</b> and to the point, after studying the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion</a>, there seems to be no valid reason for deleting this page. It should not be up to the editors whether or not a published and publicly displayed piece of art is "important" enough for inclusion on Wikipedia. For this reason alone, the article should not be deleted nor should the artist's other work, <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrifice_%28painting%29.html" title="Sacrifice (painting)">Sacrifice (painting)</a>. I have not endorsed "Merging" of this page with the artist's main page, because it would prove confusing and disturb the flow of the main article, whereas all out "deletion" would be inappropriate for the reasons I've cited above.<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward352_6e2d.html" title="User:Howard352">Howard352</a> 16:57, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The issue at hand is whether the works in question are <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notable</a>, and nothing in the articles makes a solid case that they are. If they have been discussed in multiple independent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, that's not apparent from the existing articles. You might - and I emphasize <i>might</i> - be able to make a case for a sub-article along the lines of Painting Career of Robert B. Sherman or similar, but I know of no other celebrity artist (see brief list above) with same. Note, too, that the articles in question are not being considered for deletion under the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>; if they could have been speedied, I believe they would have been.

<li><b>Comment</b>&#160;: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> states literally&#160;: Notable means "worthy of being noted" or "attracting notice", not "important" or "famous". It is not synonymous with fame or importance. It is not measured by Wikipedia editors' own subjective judgements. It is not "newsworthiness". -</li>
</ul>
<p>The question is thus&#160;: "Are these works worthy of being noted"&#160;? If there haven been major exhibitions of his work and if these exhibitions have been covered widely by the media (<i>answering the question&#160;: "Are they attracting notice&#160;?"</i>) then the paintings of Robert B. Sherman can be considered notable. I don't consider this a subjective judgment from my part as his paintings have been discussed in the media (= independent, non-trival source). Furthermore, his works have been judged worthy of several expositions in the UK, US and Switzerland. In my view these works have thus been judged "worthy of being noted" and have been "attracting notice", thus satisfying the guidelines of <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJoJan_2b10.html" title="User:JoJan">JoJan</a> 19:15, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Response to Robertissimo (above)'</b> The fact remains that this is a published and publicly seen work. The fact that Wikipedia does not yet have a wide library of visual artist's works should not be an argument for deletion of this artist's work, rather it should encourage the creation of a few pages of (for example) <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Bennett_59e9.html" title="Tony Bennett">Tony Bennett</a>'s better known pieces, if in fact there are any pieces which have been seen by large numbers of people, (as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_B._Sherman_02ab.html" title="Robert B. Sherman">Robert Sherman</a>'s work has and is). Please also see the following page: <a href="../../../m/o/s/Talk%7EMoses_%28painting%29_ae73.html" title="Talk:Moses (painting)">Talk:Moses (painting)</a> for further arguments made regarding this article.
