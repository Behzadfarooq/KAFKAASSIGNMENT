<dd>I would like to state that I am in no way doing this to make a point, or on an agenda, and that these are all in good faith. Yes, I did nominate one article for deletion by mistake. However, I changed my position to speedy keep. I got the list of these churches from Church stubs, not googling anything that says Church in it.

<li>Calvery Lutheran (Willmar, MN) would be worth keeping if it was the first congregation of the Norwegian - Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church, it is certainly one of the first. I would keep this up and give someone a chance to check on that.</li>
<li>Evangelical Catholic Church is a denomination (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Lutheran_denominations_16e2.html" title="List of Lutheran denominations">List of Lutheran denominations</a>, not a local congregation, if that matters.</li>
<li>Faith! Christian appears notable as it is pastored by the national Vice-President of the Assemblies of God in Australia and is the parent organization of a college.</li>
<li>St Mary's Basilica seems notable, because of its history and current function.</li>
<li>St John's Cathedral (Edmunton) seems notable to me, because of the previous bishop, its role as a major cathedra church.</li>

<li><b>Ouch</b>, we went through this with a bunch of historic synagogues a while ago, and those weren't even this many. Mass-nominating is a really bad idea in most cases. Some of these articles aren't really worth the trouble, but the subjects may well be notable and should emphatically not be knee-jerkishly re-deleted if they are deleted now and a better version recreated later. I am inclined to keep all cathedrals and any churches with a couple of centuries of history or more, as well as anything that stands out architecturally.
