<p><b>Things to consider:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>It is <b>important to read and understand the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a></b> which states which problems form valid grounds for deletion before adding comments to this page.</li>
<li>Use the "<b>what links here</b>" link which appears in the sidebar of the actual article page, to get a sense how the page is being used and referenced within Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Please familiarize yourself with some frequently cited guidelines, in particular <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>AfD etiquette:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Please be familiar with the policies of <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">not biting the newcomers</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_3717.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette">Wikiquette</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">no personal attacks</a>, and <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civility</a> before adding a comment.</li>
<li>Sign any listing or vote you add, by adding this after your comment: ~~~~.</li>
<li>If you are the primary author or otherwise have a vested interest in the article, say so openly, clearly base your vote on the deletion policy, and vote only once, like everyone else.</li>
<li>Your opinion will be given the most weight if you are logged in with an account that already existed when the nomination was made. Anonymous and new users are welcome to contribute to the discussion, but their votes may be discounted, especially if they seem to be made in bad faith.</li>
<li>Please vote only once. If there is evidence that someone is using <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">sock puppets</a> (multiple accounts belonging to the same person) to vote more than once, those votes will not be counted.</li>

<p>Somebody called this a hoax on the article's page. Checking it out I find no references to show this award exists. The web page looks like a email harvesting operation and the same user User: Andy Webster has only this edit and the addition of links to BCTA on other computer related articles. I think he is also the anon IP that has added similar links. I'm new and don't know how to track all this down, but it smells like bad fish to me.

At best, the info should be included on each movie/director/actor page. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlavlin_78b5.html" title="User:Slavlin">Slavlin</a> 02:17, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Not sure.</b> Normally when I'm not sure I don't comment, but this time I really see both sides of the argument. I would imagine that these records matter to film junkies the way that regular-season standings matter to baseball fans. We do have articles on regular-season standings, but I don't know enough about film to judge the true relevance of these data. Without solid ground for deletion, I would submit a vote to keep by default. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 02:24, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>: The above is a poor analogy, actually. Sports regular seasons have occurrences and information in of themselves. This, however, is a compilation of awards won elsewhere. Like others, I question the rationale for including some of those awards. They're potentially useful and informative lists, as such things go, but without some acceptable criteria for deciding which awards to include, this is a <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> violation. Beyond that, what's this "Road to the Xth Academy Awards" nonsense? Is there a particular source for that term, or any reason to believe that the worldwide perception of each and every one of these awards is as minor-league trophies en route to the Oscars? I'd think much kindlier on List of 2006 major film awards etc. "These award presentations all lead to the 79th Academy Awards ceremony on February 25, 2007."

<li><b>Delete all</b>. This is not an official compilation; there is no consensus among film fans about which critics' awards are worth paying attention to and which are not. I understand what the article creators meant by "Road to the ... Awards" but that is not a commonly used name for what this is about. I could understand listing awards won under the film or person's entry, or listing the winners given for a particular year in the article about the particular award, but this article is <a href="../../../i/i/n/WP%7EIINFO_2579.html" title="WP:IINFO">indiscriminate information</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 02:33, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b> if this is a list of <i>every</i> significant film awards from each year.

<li><b>Delete all</b> as a list of data not really suited to an encyclopedia. Information should be split and put on the relevant talk page of the movie/directors/actors/other relevant pages. Also, there's no way to make sure data should/shouldn't be put on the page- authors choice, as Croxley said? Or another sort of criteria?

<li>Reading this article, I was struck that it reads more more like an original paper than an encyclopedia article. Both are similar (citations, relatively neutral and professional tone) and there's that line that's crossed when you're taking various sources and using them to make some kind of an original argument not found in those sources alone. The argument here just seems to be implied, but it's such a blatantly obvious implication that it's hard to say it isn't there. That was just the gist that I got... it's hard to classify this as definently being original research, because whoever created this seems to have been pretty careful, but I would lean towards saying it is. Funny comment on the article's talk page, by the way. Or at least I thought so. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 02:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yeah, that comment was priceless although it felt kind of weird citing it in my deletion rationale.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article could stand some rewritting, and I am sure someone will place the appropriate tag on it soon. I did a quick reference check and found this <i>Whether or not prehistoric Native Americans were a significant ecological factor has been the subject of intense debate among generations of ecologists. During the latter half of the twentieth century, the pendulum of opinion has swung from the belief that American Indians had no influence on the composition and structure of plant and animal communities to the assertion that they were responsible for destruction of native habitats through over-exploitation of natural resources and widespread use of fire.</i> <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521662703&amp;ss=exc" class="external text" title="http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521662703&amp;ss=exc" rel="nofollow">Prehistoric Native Americans and Ecological Change</a> it is part of a book for $99.00 (American) on the Cambridge Catalog.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article now does read like someone's school paper, and suffers from vagueness and conclusory opinions in places.

I'd expect a fuller treatment to include such things as the apparent collapse of the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clovis_culture.html" title="Clovis culture">Clovis culture</a> and its possible relationship to late Pleistocene extinctions, to the use of Native Americans as symbols to promote ecological views in the 1960s and 1970s. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 03:49, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The references provided to support these claims were subjected to some basic scrutiny (not particularly rigorous), and failed to stand up.

<li><b>Keep</b> We have been here before. Major institutions of world-wide stature do not make indiscriminate lists of resources, The selectivity involved in adding this to their lists is an endorsement of its usefulness. the references deleted were examples of this use--the battle to delete this list has been carried out on several fronts. I think most of the major researchers in the subject do use the list. There are many academic fields where the mailing lists are the main information sources--of course this requires a moderated list with significant editorial control. This is now the way the academic world--or at least large parts of it--now work. I would certainly have been here saying this without the least need of canvassing, by the way--I think it is not wise to do so, for it does arouse suspicion. I can thus understand perfectly well the reason why some might vote to delete. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:09, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>DGG, again, you are not taking into account the difference between trivial, and non trivial mention. Does ANY notable institution give it more that a "that too" type mention? Do you see the real AMNH mention this in a non-trivial manner? Even a single paragraph of text focusing on how useful this list is not there. All we have is simple one line mentions. Other references are forged.</li>
<li>Also, you need to take into account "Trivial mentions". For example, research papers often have an acknowledgment section where there are similar one-sentence "Thank you" notes on various persons, that by itself does not make those persons "cited". As for the "Battle", no WP is not a battle ground, but we need to keep the random crap away, as WP IS an encyclopedia and NOT a fanblog. Until we learn to clean out fancruft and triviality, WP will simply degenerate into a spamblog. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 04:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - If we're scrounging through faxes and trivial lists of links, I think its pretty clear there are reliable sources at this point. No sources - even if a notable museum links to another website, it does not make that website notable. That is pretty much the definition of a trivial listing, regardless of who is performing it.

<li><b>KEEP</b>: This article is about something more then a mailing list, it is often referred to as the "NATURAL HISTORY NETWORK" of India or South Asia, it also serves as WILDERNESS TELEGRAM SYSTEM of sorts, the subject of this article has become an NGO in itself helping its members many of whom are grassroots workers in the fields of Nature &amp; Wildlife Conservation, students, scientists, prominent members of other NGOs, many "News Makers" in these field report directly to the NETWORK, simultaneously or before commercial news channels report on the matter, discoveries, poaching, habitat encroachments, proposed government protected area notifications and the unfortunate de-notifications, illegal wildlife trade observed, wildlife trade seizures, Endangered Tiger &amp; Panther etc. etc. bone and skin seizures, proposed government policy changes affecting the environment before they come into effect, proposed dams which will submerge large chunks of the last remaining pristine forests etc are just a few things reported and debated by this NETWORK many a times bringing corrective action in time. This is a list dealing with issues faced by Indian Naturalists, conservationists, and NGOs who network on it thankfully, including members of related Government institutions, IT CAN ONLY BE COMPARED WITH OTHER LISTS OF THE REGION dealing with similar issues and it stands head and shoulders above the rest, most of the top people in the field in the region are subscribers or know of its reputability. It is a notable achievement in India in its field, please understand that before taking the argument around the world comparing ORANGES with APPLES i.e. with just other sundry mailing lists.

<ul>
<li>Argument 1: <i>The list is "Natural History Network", "Wilderness Telegram System", "NGO in itself"</i>: The claim that it is the "Natural History Network" is based on a book endorsement, where the creator of the mailing list <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7601.html" class="external text" title="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7601.html" rel="nofollow">mentions</a> himself as "Co-oridinator, South Asian Natural History Network". Other such assertions are based entirely on perception of the creator of the article. Even if such claims are assumed to be true, the subject of the article still fails <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>.</li>
<li>Argument 2: <i>The list has been mentioned on websites of notable organizations</i> or <i>the selectivity involved in adding this to their lists is an endorsement of its usefulness</i> or <i>the list has been "recommended" by <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecological_Society_of_America_fdb4.html" title="Ecological Society of America">ESA</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Conservation_Union_6f54.html" title="World Conservation Union">IUCN</a>, and people such as <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Noronha_ddb7.html" title="Frederick Noronha">Frederick Noronha</a></i>: All the "references" provided for these arguements are actually trivial listing among many other URLs. For eg., the "reference" being provided to assert that the list is recommended by the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Museum_of_Natural_History_8ac9.html" title="American Museum of Natural History">American Museum of Natural History</a> is a <a href="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc97html/wwwnh.html" class="external text" title="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc97html/wwwnh.html" rel="nofollow">fax message</a> that mentions some useful URLs including these: <a href="http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~ramakris/indiacons.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~ramakris/indiacons.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a><a href="http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/phylogeny.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/phylogeny.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a><a href="http://herb.biol.uregina.ca/liu/bio/idb.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://herb.biol.uregina.ca/liu/bio/idb.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a><a href="http://aw.users.netlink.co.uk/obchome.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://aw.users.netlink.co.uk/obchome.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/tax.html/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/tax.html/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> (many dead links) -- do all these pages become notable enough to deserve an article on Wikipedia? Similarly, <a href="http://www.indianbirds.in/download/IB2005%5B1%5D.1%20FINAL%20web.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.indianbirds.in/download/IB2005%5B1%5D.1%20FINAL%20web.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a> mentions the list among eight others (most of them Yahoo! Groups). <a href="http://www.apnic.net/mailing-lists/s-asia-it/archive/1999/05/msg00015.html" class="external text" title="http://www.apnic.net/mailing-lists/s-asia-it/archive/1999/05/msg00015.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> is a list of 100+ links that includes several tripod, geocities, freeservers, 8m.com pages -- do all these pages become notable enough to deserve an article because they have been "recommended" by a highly respected journalist (<a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Noronha_ddb7.html" title="Frederick Noronha">Frederick Noronha</a>)? Other such "references" are also trivial mentions of list in newsletters etc.</li>
<li>Argument 3: <i>The list members are employees of notable organizations such as <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wildlife_Institute_of_India_74b8.html" title="Wildlife Institute of India">WII</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service_4db6.html" title="United States Fish and Wildlife Service">USFWS</a></i>: The "references" provided for this are messages like <a href="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc99html/ecoendf241108.html" class="external text" title="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc99html/ecoendf241108.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> (a Reuters news item forwarded to the list by a USFWS employee). How does this make the list itself notable enough for an article? I work with a very notable organization and I subscribe to many lists -- that doesn't make those lists notable. I'd vote keep if many participants of the list were themselves very notable or famous, which doesn't seem to be the case.</li>
<li>Argument 4: <i>The list that produced a number of noteworthy predictions</i> (the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Natural_History_of_South_Asia_mailing_list_%282nd_nomination%29_99f8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Natural History of South Asia mailing list (2nd nomination)">2nd AfD nom</a> was closed citing this argument by <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a>) -- the article doesn't contain (and never contained) any information about "number of noteworthy predictions". It contained information about speculation that a subscriber to the list <i>may have</i> predicted the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10009225" class="external text" title="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10009225" rel="nofollow">The reference</a> doesn't assert notability of the list. It just mentions the list once, as a place where one can verify that the prediction was made before the earthquake occured.</li>
<li>Argument 5: <i>The list is hosted at Princeton/some of the list members are professors, so the list is notable in academic circles</i>: Just because some of the list members are professors doesn't make it highly notable in academic circles. All the "references" earlier mentioned in the article were trivial one-sentence mentions of the list. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 10:32, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Game Informer Online wikipedia entry shouldn't be deleted. As said by another user, it's only the beginning of an effort to create a stable and useful page. There is an inherent difference between the Game Informer magazine and the Game Informer website. They both have their own culture, coverage, style, and impact upon the gaming community. While both may be Game Informer, there are enough differences and content for both entities to have their own page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Srkelley (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Srkelley_ede1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Srkelley">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Hello! There is indeed a guild named "Entarian Dominion" in World of Warcraft, and I'm pretty sure it is related to Entarians (Koreanic ethnicity living nowadays in Russia and Kazakhstan), which are also falsely being refered to as "Koryo Sarami". This is an unacknowledged ethnicity, however I have met actual descendants of Entarians in the United States and in Kazakhstan. I studied Entarian from very few remaining speakers, and it resembles many word similarities with Korean. Please do not make false conclusions. Do not support if you don't have enough knowledge, but do not disprove the topic either if you don't have ample evidence to state Entarians (Hentarissarmi) have never existed as a group. Thank you. Vunvjorhimm 23:19, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, hopefully this article will draw attention of specialists specializing in anthropology/history, and they will contribute to impovement/correction of the information. HENTAR in Entarian means "one", in Korean HAN means the same thing. RIS is dominion/area/realm/territory in Entarian; best equivalent for this word in Korean would be Sino-Korean GUG, which means country, state. In Korean Entaria would be HANGUG, but it has little to do with modern South Korea. Please read carefully the history of Korea to make sure nothing is contradicting. If you are interested in more information and the sources of it, ask me, I am ready to answer all the questions to the best of my knowledge. Be more critical.

<li>If my article will get deleted, the only conclusion a reasonable reader can make of it is that the users and administrators of Wikipedia can only rely on something that's easily accessible via internet, and they don't want to acknowledge something that is out there... Or may be someone wants to venture forth to Eastern Siberia and search for material findings, make system of them, and objectively describe what was it, Entarian Dominion. Entarians were basically (if not completely exterminated) deprived from their identity, their culture was disregarded, and the research done in the area was most likely biased. No one knows that Japanese archaeologists were digging in the area and how did they view Koreanics? Were they interested in disclosing any data from the northern Manchuria? May be so that Entarians won't have legacy to be acknowledged as a group forever in the history, that is being written by... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Vunvjorhimm (<a href="../../../v/u/n/User_talk%7EVunvjorhimm_ff8f.html" title="User talk:Vunvjorhimm">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vunvjorhimm_91ff.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vunvjorhimm">contribs</a>) 01:52, 30 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>I do not believe this topic deserves an article. Putting aside the correctable issue of a misleading title, a "list of people" is inappropriate in this case. An article on the supposed phenomenon of persons entering heaven while still living <i>may</i> be notable and should contain examples but this is not that article and, as far as I know, that article does not exist. An online search for information reveals that there are plenty of sources about <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22elijah%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22elijah%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Elijah</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22serach%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22serach%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Serach</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22enoch%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22enoch%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Enoch</a> that mention the aforementioned entry into heaven while still alive. However, that information belongs in the individual articles. So, I propose that this article be <b>delete</b>d because:</p>
<ol>
<li>The article does not prove the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> of the subject by providing at least one substantial or multiple non-trivial secondary sources, and I have been unable to prove the topic's notability through my own search.</li>
<li>The article does not provide clear standards of inclusion or exclusion, in violation of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a>. For instance, not too long ago, this list boasted <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheech_and_Chong_b5c0.html" title="Cheech and Chong">Cheech Marin</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_went_to_heaven_alive&amp;diff=111756796&amp;oldid=99156898" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_went_to_heaven_alive&amp;diff=111756796&amp;oldid=99156898" rel="nofollow">diff</a>).</li>
<li>Any listing of the handful of characters who supposedly entered heaven while still alive should be contained in an article on the phenomenon itself rather than existing as a stand-alone list.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I believe the problem to be endemic to the topic rather than the just the article, I am skipping the usual steps of tagging the article with various cleanup tags or requesting that the article's author (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Gausie" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Gausie" rel="nofollow">inactive for a month</a>) try to fix it. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:32, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In lieu of the changes made to the article within the past 20 hours (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_went_to_heaven_alive&amp;diff=118896092&amp;oldid=118692611" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_went_to_heaven_alive&amp;diff=118896092&amp;oldid=118692611" rel="nofollow">diff</a>), I am changing my recommendation to delete and now believe the article is worthy of being <b>kept</b>. The changes have made this a wholly different article that proves the notability of the topic, provides clear(er) standards of inclusion (as clear as we'll have with 2000 year old texts that are disputed), and addresses the general concept of ascension into heaven rather than merely listing persons who could fall in that category.</dd>
<dd>That said, I do not think this AFD should be closed early (i.e., I do not withdraw my nomination).

<li><b>Keep</b> because the list could be improved enormously. I take deep offense at calling this a joke. If you don't know enough about a particular religion, or religion in general, don't go calling subjects related to what people hold sacred a "joke". I'm no expert myself, but I know "People who went to heaven alive" is usually called "translation into heaven" or "assumption into heaven" or "ascension into heaven". From Christianity you could add <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_of_Nazareth_2b3e.html" title="Jesus of Nazareth">Jesus of Nazareth</a> and (at least in Roman Catholic doctrine) <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%2C_mother_of_Jesus_a284.html" title="Mary, mother of Jesus">Mary, mother of Jesus</a>. The day commemorating her assumption into heaven is a holy day of obligation for Catholics. See <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assumption_of_Mary_03d6.html" title="Assumption of Mary">Assumption of Mary</a>. It's also celebrated in art. See: <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assumption_of_the_Virgin_Mary_742c.html" title="Assumption of the Virgin Mary">Assumption of the Virgin Mary</a>. This hardly indicates that the "topic of people ascending to heaven is extremely minor within Jewish tradition, <i>let alone in the context of a general-interest encyclopedia.</i>" (Emphasis added.) Muslims might also beg to differ, since many believe that <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> also ascended into heaven at the Dome of the Rock. Wikipedia has a short article on it: <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitab_al-Miraj_5eab.html" title="Kitab al-Miraj">Kitab al-Miraj</a>. In Polynesian (or at least Maori) religion, there also seems to be a person (maybe more) who ascended into heaven, but I don't have time to read through <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/pac/grey/grey06.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sacred-texts.com/pac/grey/grey06.htm" rel="nofollow">Rupe's Ascent into Heaven</a>.

<dd>As a <i>subject</i> the list is certainly important enough for an encyclopedia. Since some explanation of which religion(s) consider certain figures to have ascended bodily into heaven is necessary to help a reader navigate through the topic, so a category would be inadequate. I haven't found any source that considers all bodily assumptions into heaven from all religions, but it seems to me it isn't origional research to simply state that the concept exists in various religions and describe how each religion treats the concept in theology and tradition. One day I expect we'll get individual articles on bodily assumption in Judaism, Catholicism, Islam, etc. Perhaps a fuller account of how assumption into heaven relates to how these people are understood is best left to the individual articles on these people, but something is needed for this concept, and I think a list with short descriptions is a worthy start. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 06:07, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Keep</b>, as problematic but salvageable. Although not a fan of lists, the nominators first two points, I think, are not valid. #1...Most, if not all, biblical person's existence and actions are attested to only through that document, all other sources derive from that and they are abundant. #2...Vandalism to an article is not a reason for deletion of that article and standards for inclusion could be addressed through a more qualifying title for the article. #3 Raises the best point but could be addressed through renaming...<i>in Christian/Jewish/Muslim theology...</i>, or some such way.

<li><b>Comment</b> Since this article is undergoing some revision, editors in this discussion should take a look back later and see if their opinions still apply. I've begun to make some changes, many more are needed and by editors who are more familiar with the various religions involved, but the article is already a lot different from what it was when nominated. I think this can and should evolve into something more than a list. I'm starting a discussion on the article's talk page about what to name it.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:27, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

As I mentioned in my nomination, the issue of a misleading title is correctable and <i>not</i> a reason to delete. My position from the start was this: an article on Translation into heaven may be notable and would include a list of such people, but such a list should not exist by itself without sources or additional prose content. If this list can be modified to that purpose, I will modify my position to simply requesting a change of title. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:07, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> This certainly isn't a joke, and there are sources for the individuals given. However, there are significant <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> problems not solvable simply by changing the title. One difficulty is that there are enormous differences between the degree of belief and sourcing for various individuals. In <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, for example, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah.html" title="Elijah">Elijah</a> is specifically mentioned in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>, while other figures are mentioned only in relatively minor <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midrash.html" title="Midrash">Midrashic</a> sources. Simply listing them creates an appearance of commonality of belief and importance which simply doesn't exist in the underlying religious traditions. A more fundamental problem is that the whole topic, as it stands, represents <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> -- it claimss a commonality among figures who have different stories. for example it presents them as going to a common, a place called "Heaven", which is impliedly represented as being common to every religion listed, even though not every religion listed has this concept. I'm not sure that changing the name would solve the problem. I'm not questioning that this could be a valid topic. It's the business of original researchers to identify common themes in disparate cultures and to provide explanations why regarding the themes as common is legitimate. But I don't believe it's the business of Wikipedia to do this sort of original research. And it's even less the business of Wikipedia to do it in a way that treats commonality as a hidden assumption which the reader is required to take for granted. The article should at least address the question of whether other religions actually have a comparable concept of "heaven" rather than fitting them into the framework of ones own worldview unquestioningly. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 01:18, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b> I've posted requests for editors to look at this article and deletion discussion at WikiProject talk pages for Bible, Christianity, Judaism, Islam and, I think, Religion hoping to get some useable insight of this general sort. But I have to respond that absolutely none of Shirahadasha's points show any reason at all to delete, only to further improve the Judaism section of the article (there's already a notice at the top of that section calling for improvements). There is a Wikipedia article, <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">Heaven</a>, which is linked to in the top paragraph of this article and where the Jewish concepts of the afterlife are discussed, and it would be proper to note some differences in the concept of heaven or note the absence of the belief in heaven in Judaism, if that's the case. Of course, that explanation would have to address the citations from Genesis and 2 Kings already in the article. I'm going to copy and cross post S's valuable comment above to the article's talk page and respond to other points about article content, which don't need to be addressed further here.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 19:05, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm under a bit of time pressure so I'll just drop a quick note. Noroton, can you discuss the pros and cons of just merging this article into <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">Heaven</a>? Does it really merit a separate article? --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 19:28, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sure. I think the only reason to separate one article from another related article is to keep article sizes manageable and help readers navigate. If this article and Heaven were smallish and couldn't be expected to grow more, then I think we could merge them. Heaven is 47 Kb long right now and, although I haven't looked closely at that article, I can easily imagine it could grow more (there's a lot of information out there). After Googling this subject, here are the areas where I know or have reason to suspect this article might grow: The entire Judaism section, which should show the significant viewpoints on ascension within Judaism, including, I assume, something on midrash; Christian views on Enoch and Elijah's ascensions; more information on Roman Catholic views, Orthodox Christian views and various Protestant views and how they differ and are alike each other; Islam's significant views on Enoch and Elijah; an adequate explanation on Islam's views on Jesus and ascension; the same for Muhammad; ascension in Polynesian religion; more information on Apollonius of Tyrana and ascension; possible ascension of Chinese emperors (I get intriguing whisps of this but can't find anything that really confirms it). All of these sections should eventually show similarities and differences. Ideally, every major part of this article would summarize better, fuller accounts in other, more specific articles, as well as discuss what reliable sources have to say about the similarities and differences of different religions and sects (this would be the best spot for that information and I'm frustrated that I haven't found it yet). This article is about ascension and belief, but it's not hard to imagine ascension in myth and ascension in fiction.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 20:35, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Articles can be and have been totally rewritten. What you need to justify a vote for deletion is a case that there shouldn't be any article on the general topic, under any title, EVER.

<dd>Springnuts, your comments are essentially incomprehensible because you offer no explanation for them and your citations are indecipherable. Give the specific reasons and citations your strong opinion actually demands. I'll be specific: (a) what precisely is inaccurate (a serious charge in an encyclopedia); (b) where is the confusion between ascension and assumption; (c) what is incoherent. If you're going to criticize the efforts of editors who are doing their best, then it seems to me that the attitude of someone who describes himself as a chaplain on his User page should display a bit more charity. You might even practice a bit of your calling by helping to edit the article, but you're the best judge of where your time and effort is most needed.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 20:56, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ouch! Well <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a>, not to waste a lot of time - (a) inaccuracy: the article lists Jesus as someone who entered heaven without dying, however it is a fundamental Christian belief that Jesus died on the cross. The article states "in Christian belief, the privilege of entering heaven without dying is reserved for those who are considered to have been without sin" - but most Christians do not consider Elijah sinless, yet he did enter heaven without dying ... the article states "Belief in the ascension of Christ is part of the Reformed churches tradition" but it is actually part of all orthodox tradition (b) ascension is after death (ie with dying), assumption is before death (ie without dying), (c) hence the whole thing is, imo, incoherent - and un-necessary. Clearly you disagree, which is your privilege, but I have to say that I criticized the article, not the editors, however your comments above do criticize me, and might be considered a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">no personal attacks</a> policy. <a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpringnuts_c117.html" title="User:Springnuts">Springnuts</a> 22:10, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Double-ouch! Those are valid points and I wrote one of the offending sentences so I cry "Uncle!", "mea culpa" and whatever else is appropriate. We should address the issues raised by Springnuts. However, those are just arguments that the article could be improved not that it should be deleted. As stated above, one argument for deleting an article is that there should not be an article on this topic because the topic is inherently unencyclopedic. A somewhat different line of argument would assert that the topic is encyclopedic but this particular revision is so hopelessly flawed that it would be better to throw it out and rewrite it than to attempt to save it. I don't think either of these arguments is applicable here. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 22:37, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> (Pasensya na ho kayo, Tito Pao). When I think of <a href="../../../b/i/s/BisRock_ddab.html" title="BisRock">BisRock</a>, Missing Filemon is the one that comes to mind. I think as time goes on, they will gain more notability. Their scope is limited to only the <a href="../../../c/e/b/Cebuano_language.html" title="Cebuano language">Cebuano</a>-speaking regions since Tagalog music has a grip on the whole Philippines. I'm not in the Philippines myself, but I have managed to download their songs (my favorite is Suroy-Suroy), which are available on <a href="../../../l/i/m/LimeWire_3013.html" title="LimeWire">LimeWire</a>. There are 59 fan videos of Missing Filemon on YouTube. BTW, there are 739 Google hits with about 17 mentions on the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.Star_Cebu_7626.html" title="Sun.Star Cebu">Sun.Star Cebu</a> website, so contrary to what Evergreens78 said, it's not a stupid garage band. I'd roughly consider Missing Filemon to be as notable as the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_catal%C3%A0.html" title="Rock català">Catalan rock</a> group <a href="../../../e/l/s/Els_Pets_459b.html" title="Els Pets">Els Pets</a>, whose fans are limited to Catalan-speaking regions in Europe and nowhere else. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Sundita_7a61.html" title="User:Christopher Sundita">Chris S.</a> 05:40, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Quite a lot of that rationale isn't relevant. That a band's songs are available for download isn't relevant. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Your own subjective opinion of what is and isn't important is irrelevant</a>. And counting Google hits is not research. What is relevant here is whether the band has been independently documented, in depth, in multiple published works. And research involves looking for such things. Please <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> to show that the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria are satisfied.

<li>Yes, I was aware of that, but my rationales were basically in response to the above comment saying that <i>Missing Filemon</i> was a "stupid garage band."

<p>This list defies NPOV, No Original Research, and WP's standards on Notabilty</p>
<p>First of all, the word "Unusual" is highly problematic as it is a very subjective word, on par with "good", "bad", and "normal". A death that may seem unusual to one person may not seem so to another, and even within different contexts of data may lose its seeming unusualness.</p>
<p>If we were to change this article's title to "List of deaths generally viewed/cited as unusual", we still would be doing original research, and this would still be only presenting a biased view.</p>
<p>If we were to change this article's title to "List of deaths refered to as unusual", all the remaining entries will be sourced, however, these will be hard to find, and barely representative of the subject, and be mostly lifted from published personal opinions. (Although this option will satisfy verifiability).</p>
<p>And if we were to change this article to focus soley on statistically unusual deaths, the whole article will have to be rewritten to include rare diseases, rare instruments of destruction, etc,etc. In addition, what aspect of the death and in what context will we look at look at to declare it statistically unusual? (Of course, this will violate NOR)</p>
<p>And lastly, the subject of the list itself, "unusual deaths" is hardly notable at all. It may often pop up in trivia books (which often repeat many myths and unverifiable factoids), but this subject, by itself, does not meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>.</p>

<li>“”Keep”” but perhaps with more specific criteria. The previous discussions are pretty comprehensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meets notability criteria for lists under WP:BIO: “Instead, the list should be limited to notable people: those that already have a Wikipedia article or could plausibly have one, per this guideline.” Re: Sensationalism. Listing Isadora Duncan’s death as “unusual” may be more emotionally-involved than listing it as “road accident.” That makes it more challenging but no less valid. Actually supports NPOV: “representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by reliable sources.” If the published sources perceived the death as unusual, the encyclopedia should respect and reflect that fact, just as is done with list of deaths by date or by cause. For instance, Toilet-related Injuries are real and the subject of medical research, and the article includes a section on Famous Toilet-related Deaths and as a theme in popular culture. Re: Litvinenko death. It's unusual because poisoning by polonium is not common and was perceived as a notable way to go. Canuckle 06:19, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, basically, you're saying we should change the article to be about Deaths refered to as unusual, of notable people? Although this will be verifiable, it still is a very narrow group defined by trivial criteria, and we would have to parse through biographies and text books and news pieces to find the authors' actual reference to the death as "odd", "strange", "quirky", "unusual", etc, as using anything else to gauge the authors' opinion would lean towards original research. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 07:06, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Specifically, "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not automatically mean it is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia." The list of deaths is interesting, certainly; I enjoyed reading it. But the information in it is collected together not because it addresses a topic that is itself notable, but rather because it has entertainment value. To me, this means that <s><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INFO</a></s><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> applies.

<li><b>Keep</b> The list has 35 references, and most of the deaths are certainly by unusual means. The normal editing process can via consensus delete any which are too common. There is no reason to limit it notable people who died unusual deaths. Since the persons share the feature of diying unusual deaths, the list is not indiscriminate. Similar lists have long enjoyed a place in such reference works. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 14:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you're saying that editors should decide which deaths are unusual and which are not? This would violate NPOV, because it would be declaring what's unusual from the perspective of ourselves. And our judgement of a death as usual/unusual would be original research. As I've said before, references would only validate an entry if the author expressed explicitly that the death was odd. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 16:09, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It is not too hard of an exercise to find a reference wherein a reliable and independant commentator will say the a British noble dying from the effects of a red hot poker being stuck up his rectum is an "unusual way to go." That would satisfy your worries about it being "original research" by a Wikipedia editor thinking that to be an unusual way to go. Googling shows that this particluar article has been widely and favorably cited on other websites, so readers of Wikipedia besides those arguing here for keeping it have apparently found it useful.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:17, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It is an interesting list, and I've read this one before, but I can't disagree with the nominator on this one.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The only real problem with this article is the criteria for unusualness, which (like inclusion of items in hundreds or thousands of other list articles) is handled adequately by editorial consensus. A consensus of editors applying common sense does not equal <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> in the sense meant by the policy. (If it does, most of those list articles should be nominated as well.) Other than the inclusion criteria, the article is reasonably good in that it requires the subjects to be notable persons (including people famous for the specific manner of their death) with existing articles about them, and requires attribution of the facts involved. Alternatively, if the article is not deemed worth of keeping in article space (although reading this discussion I see no consensus for deletion), it could be moved to project space <i>à la</i> <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_unusual_articles_5196.html" title="Wikipedia:List of unusual articles">Wikipedia:List of unusual articles</a>. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 20:36, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This one really bothers me, but I can't avoid the issue. It's one thing to say "nonnotable" about a minor league rapper who's just trying to promote his recent CD on Wikipedia. It's another thing to say "nonnotable" about a young girl who disappeared in the Great Smoky Mountains 30 years ago - especially when the article is 15 minutes old and was written by a good editor. Unless there's a basic assumption that all missing people are notable, I don't see a way to justify inclusion. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 03:59, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Suspected hoax. The list of references is impressive but I don't think any of them refer to Demeny, while at least some of the text has been plagiarised from here: <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB76/index2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB76/index2.htm" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> There are also no obvious Google results for anyone called George Demeny in the Revolt, which seems strange if he really was a top commander. Maybe someone who knows the history of this in detail should check it out? <a href="../../../m/o/y/User%7EMoyabrit_bd17.html" title="User:Moyabrit">Moyabrit</a> 15:22, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Important Note</b> I did indeed create the article on Dec 26th 2006 - but only in response to an AfC request from User:Phas3d (as you can see, I clearly noted this in the very first entry to the edit history) The original AfC request (and my reponse to it) is here: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-25_5f09.html#George_Demeny_.28Demene.29" title="Wikipedia:Articles for creation/2006-12-25">Wikipedia:Articles_for_creation/2006-12-25#George_Demeny_.28Demene.29</a>. I noted at the time that the list of references appeared to be copy/pasted and requested that the submitter fix that ASAP. I regret that I do not recall what background checks I did to ensure that the article was 'for real' - but I'm usually fairly sceptical so I probably checked something. In retrospect, it is a little unlikely that User:Phas3d would produce such a well-referenced article as his/her very first contribution...he/she hasn't produced anything else after that. At any rate, I have no personal attachment to the article - I don't really care whether it stays or goes. My profuse apologies if I allowed junk into the Encyclopedia - that was most certainly not my goal! <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 17:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - the hoax theory is quite likely. There is a French artist under that name on Google, but he does not appear to have any commonability with this article.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Poorly sourced means it needs to be sourced, not that it should be deleted. Notability doesn't seem to be an issue here; it is referencing an actual type of military occupation, and remember: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="meta:Wiki_is_not_paper">Wiki is not paper</a>. After reading the article myself, I can agree that that what it is trying to describe it fails spectarularly at. Nevertheless, it is in fact describing an actual condition specified by current laws of war, and deserves space in the wikipedia. It should definitely be heavily rewritten, both for ease of understanding and more sources. But it should <i>not</i> be deleted. — <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Herboso_fb30.html" title="User:Eric Herboso">Eric</a> <a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEric_Herboso_ef91.html" title="User talk:Eric Herboso">Herboso</a> 21:43, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not notable. An undistinguished author published by an undistinguished publisher.

<p>I am calling into question your inherent and very clear slanted bias concerning this article. You are POV pushing. I feel that you have no right to call another author "notable" or not notable and use that as your basis for deletion. The only reason that I can see from your User Talk page as your personal axe to grind is that of your vigilance against diploma mills. For that biasness, I feel that you need to do a bit more research on your subjects before marking them like the Fire Department in Fahrenheit 451.</p>
<p><br />
As for your comment concerning Hay House as an undistinguished publisher, I can only assume that you have been living under a rock for the last 20 years or more. Consequently, as you have been living under said rock, you have failed to notice the rise in metaphysical bookstore and literature populating the world. Hay House is a world wide multi billion dollar publishing house (Sylvia Brown, Dr. Doreen Virtue Ph. D., Dr. Wayne Dyer, Jerry and Ester Hicks, etc.), which again, puts another hole in your reason for deletion.</p>
<p><br />
For your liable sayings concerning Mr. Farmer's education as reasons for deletion, I fail to see how that warrants any of your time. Please look at Ms. Paris Hilton's page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_hilton" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_hilton" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_hilton</a>) if you would like to complain using your judgment that a lack of collegiate education leads to a lack of a solid foundation of decent morals and values. Before committing to a valuable career in metaphysical studies, Mr. Farmer was a noted person in the field of spiritual psychotherapy. Additionally, now he is a noted author of spiritual books, created a card deck on the subject of Power Animals, and hosts his own radio show on Hay House radio.</p>
<p><br />
Now, I can agree that the article should (and will) have more text information concerning Mr. Farmer's contributions to the metaphysical society. That will happen. However, I do NOT under any additional circumstances agree with your reasons for deletion. You simply acted our your biased POV with limited references and under another pretense of diploma mill research. However, as a admin at Wikipedia, I hope that you show more restraint with your biases - least other articles have the same aforementioned Fire Department treatment.</p>
<p><br />
If you are not interested in metaphysical studies, please understand that your bias is your challenge to overcome, not ours. Wikipedia is a free public resource for information for the world. Not just you.</p>
<p><br />
I know that you are making a difference and are valuable in your time in supporting the structure of Wikipedia and the goals and dreams of the vision. But here, concerning Mr. Farmer, you are simply in the wrong. Character defacement without a solid foundation is not something that should be taken lightly and tossed around like salt.</p>

<p>A mix of Dawkins's TV appearances (popular culture?), along with a few other references. Non notable, his 2 TV appearances can be mentioned in his main article along with anything else that's important, this doesn't need a seperate article. Plasticbottle 04:49, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

The consensus appears to be that editors don't want trivia in Dawkins's article so they sent it off into its own article, the clearest explanation was "we decided to create the Dawkins in pop culture article for the unencyclopedic stuff." That says it all really, it seems to be the reason behind most of these "In popular culture" lists. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroxley_5f28.html" title="User:Croxley">Croxley</a> 06:02, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

My understanding is that Dawkins's chief claim to fame comes chiefly from having written a number of popular science books in which he took stands on social issues involving religion, nature versus nurture, and so forth. That he was apparently satirized on <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a></i> surely belongs in his article in chief. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 13:51, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If it's claimed that "<b>merger is not an option</b>", obviously this should be kept.

That's all. Also, if this article does get deleted and you succeed in getting consensus for a merger later, an admin can undelete this and turn it into a redirect, which would give you access to the page history for merging.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Where did I say anything about a merger? Don't try and alter the meaning of my nomination in order to discredit it - I said <i>his 2 TV appearances CAN be mentioned in his main article</i>. Not <i>should</i> be mentioned. It was to prevent anyone saying "keep" because they don't want to lose these details. You are just attempting a poor <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> argument, but it won't work. In case anyone else became confused like Coelacan, my nomination was/is to <b>Delete</b>. Delete the whole thing, I have no interest in what you do to the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> article, just don't create any more articles like this.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - why so aggressive? All he said was that he is opposed to merging and prefers the material be either deleted entirely or left in a separate article. He didn't accuse anyone in particular of favouring merging; it's simply an obvious possibility that he felt moved to comment on. (read "she" thoughout if <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">Coelacan</a> happens to be female.) <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 03:00, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Coelacan <i>did</i> accuse me of favouring merging quite clearly; <i>this AFD has been proposed apparently as a merger</i>. I wasn't being aggressive, I was being assertive to make sure there was no possible doubt over my original nomination. Plasticbottle 03:27, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I was wrong on that point. Conceded and corrected; apologises for my error. He did say it was proposed as a merger. All the same, your language was <i>not</i> merely assertive. In talking about attempts to "alter the meaning", and to try "to discredit it" you were assuming ulterior motives, with no real foundation for doing so. That is quite aggressive language that you used, and hardly in keeping with the requirement to assume good faith. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 03:45, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Edit conflict) Plasticbottle, I'm sorry if it seemed I was trying to discredit you, this was not at all my intention. Your nomination is within the sphere of AFD. It did, however, read to some (myself included) like it carried along with it a merge proposal. Above, for example, Smerdis of Tlön has changed their&#160;!vote to keep after I made it clear that a delete result here <i>would not necessarily</i> result in the information being included at <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>. So it's probably good that I made that clear, at least from that editor's perspective. As to your proposal to delete, I do not oppose it. I have said keep or delete is fine; I am abstaining from that question. I am glad that you have also now made it clear that there is no merge proposal from you. I did misread your intention somewhat, but I think it's all clear now and I apologize for amplifying my misunderstanding. <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> — 03:35, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The other non-independent link is to support that the company is a part of the bigger company. Both company's websites make this claim. Why should this be disputed?

<p>Despite confident assertions to the contrary in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rajan_Sankaran_d416.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rajan Sankaran">the last AfD</a>, the article still doesn't assert notability, and no evidence for his notability has ever been provided. Indeed, it's practically at speedy delete level at the moment because of this. Certainly, if there's actual evidence that fits <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and so on that shows he's notable, and we can use them to improve the article, he shouldn't be deleted, but no such evidence exists in the article, and, even in the last AfD, none was ever provided.</p>
<p>Allow me to summarise the current article, because it might help anyone objecting to the deletion see why it needs improved:</p>
<p>Rajan Sankaran is educated as a homeopath, and has a business he inherited from his father. He developed a few theories about homeopathy, and self-publishes books <a href="http://www.thespiritofhomoeopathy.com/company.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thespiritofhomoeopathy.com/company.html" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> (note the company site is a subpage of his website) and has a computer program for sale <a href="http://www.thespiritofhomoeopathy.com/vquest/vquest.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thespiritofhomoeopathy.com/vquest/vquest.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. He has learned an effective way to get information from patients - just like every new practitioner of any form of medicine, conventional or alternative, does after a time.</p>
<p>If there's more about him that makes him unambiguously notable, please, please, add it to the article. Because the current article is not showing it. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 06:49, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> A very notable homeopath. His books are widely distributed and influential<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22influential%22+rajan+sankaran&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22influential%22+rajan+sankaran&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>. He lectures to sold-out audiences around the world. He is frequently cited in other publications in his field. His writings have been incorporated into the main homeopathic databases. Note that he's far more notable than <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Campbell_af7d.html" title="Anthony Campbell">Anthony Campbell</a>, a virtually unknown critic of homeopathy that <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinwalker_9c72.html" title="User:Skinwalker">Skinwalker</a> and others have supported in an AFD. It is especially fascinating that the points they used to support Campbell (i.e. editor of a homeopathic journal, prominent member of an association, author of a number of books) are, in Sankaran's case not given any validity. The only discernible difference between the two (other than Sankaran being obviously more well-known and respected) is that one has criticized homeopathy and one has promoted it. There has been an obvious effort to remove articles about extremely well-known and well-regarded homeopaths (the AFD for <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Vithoulkas_c798.html" title="George Vithoulkas">George Vithoulkas</a> was a striking, even breathtaking example) and to promote articles of insignificant critics. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 16:29, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. DGG has a good point in that we probably should be comparing notability to the notability of others in the field.

<p>This seems like nonsense or advertising, it is also biased as it claims that this company is "legendary" without providing any other information. The format of this page is a disaster, the writer seems to need some help if this is a serious article. Unfortunately, I think that even with the proper formatting it will be very difficult to make this article seem notable. I vote to delete. <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVaniac_bd53.html" title="User:Vaniac">Vaniac</a> 11:09, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually no, Deniz. The relevance in that article is the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey_a9ca.html#Kurdish_genocide_claims" title="Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey">sourced genocide section</a>. That section used to be an independent article called <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_Genocide_%28Turkey%29_a861.html" title="Kurdish Genocide (Turkey)">Kurdish Genocide (Turkey)</a>, but after a Turkish outburst it was merged into that article even though the relevant AFDs did not result in such a consensus (an unprecedented move, to my knowledge at least) and it was agreed that the redirects and/or a dab page should remain. This was later affirmed at this <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_discussion_Log_2006_December_22_12f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2006 December 22">RFD</a> which is how this disambiguation page came about.

I said in my nom "merfe (if possible) any meaningful content to Cyprus dispute". I also proposed another AfD that day. I am trying to make Wikipedia the most academic as possible, it has nothing to do with "elimination".

<li><b>Comment</b> - I would like the closing administrator to take a look at the AfD of "Kurdish Genocide" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> - I think that it is shameful that so many Greek editors are showing up one after another in some sort of a pie-throwing contest. I completely second what Deniz said above. Closing administrator should also note that the real deal behind this is a debate going on at <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontic_Greek_Genocide_85b7.html" title="Pontic Greek Genocide">Pontic Greek Genocide</a> which has been going on for months.

<li>Actually the relevance of Greek opinion on Kurdish issues is well-known. Hell, Ocalan was actually hiding in the Greek Embassy in Kenya when he was caught. Cooking up conspiracy theories to discredit large numbers of opinions is more shameful in my humble opinion.--<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomitius_c4a0.html" title="User:Domitius">Domitius</a> 21:09, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Conspiracy theory? Vote-stacking was proven in that AfD - as I said, to keep this AfD focused, it was only a note to the closing admin to check the AfD of the article "KG" (this one was created afterwards, and as such this AfD is the first one for the one with the small "g") <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:40, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>What is truly shameful is the suggestion that Greek editors should not exercise their right to vote on any article they see fit. <a href="../../../k/%C3%A9/k/User%7EK%C3%A9kr%C5%8Dps_4c7f.html" title="User:Kékrōps">·ΚέκρωΨ·</a> 21:13, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Any editor of any nationality can edit here. Anyway, the (ir)relevancy of Greeks is not important. I think you guys should not vote with anything other than the article in your mind. Please once again take a look what you are voting for, a disambiguation page for Kurdish genocide with one of the items being Human rights of Kurdish people in X. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 22:38, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>(edit-conflict) Of course you can vote - but Domitius's suggestion and implication in his vote is also shameful, trying to discredit the Turkish users with words like "TR POV-pushing" and "we have seen this before", when the <i>original AfD was proposed by an admin who is British</i>. As I said, vote along - but I would like the closing administrator to take a look at the vote-stacking that was done in the last AfD and the debate at the PGG article. I invite any of the keep voters to show a press release from any major news organization or et al which refer to the human rights of Kurds in Turkey as "Kurdish genocide" - if not, it is WP:OR and undue weight.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:28, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I placed the initial speedy tag as this seemed to be a local band of little note. A google search revealed many hits, but upon closer inspection, these were mostly for <i>another</i> band named Phineas Gage. If this article is kept, it should at least be moved to Phineas Gage (death metal band) and replaced with a dab.

<p>Believe it or not, there are many unsigned bands with the same name, this band name is not owned by any label in existance so that does not disqualify any of the bands who do use the name. This band you roadied for, is probably now defunct like the other one which was brought up. The bottom line is, this tab was not occupied, and now it is listed with the correct and accurate information about a band name Phineas Gage out of Orlando Fl. Thus there is no grounds for deletion.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> A detailed reading of the discussion page at the centralized discussion leads me to the conclusion that there was <i>not</i> consensus for stub articles for epsodes, but rather for only general articles until there was sufficient material to break it out into session articles, and then eventually into ones for each episode. These articles are none of them even approaching the stage of individual episode articles. The discussion frequently referred to school articles as a model, and I think its clear that discussions here are against individual articles until the material is sufficient. The bulk of the discussion was some months ago, and there were notes at the end that the consensus in the more generally interested WP community was moving against episode articles. At any rate, it behooves us to state our independent views here. I note that this particular articlew is one sentence long. Speedy as empty is my view. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:25, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> A detailed reading of the discussion page at the centralized discussion leads me to the conclusion that there was <i>not</i> consensus for stub articles for epsodes, but rather for only general articles until there was sufficient material to break it out into session articles, and then eventually into ones for each episode. These articles are none of them even approaching the stage of individual episode articles. The discussion frequently referred to school articles as a model, and I think its clear that discussions here are against individual articles until the material is sufficient. The bulk of the discussion was some months ago, and there were notes at the end that the consensus in the more generally interested WP community was moving against episode articles. At any rate, it behooves us to state our independent views here. Speedy as empty is my view. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:26, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> A detailed reading of the discussion page at the centralized discussion leads me to the conclusion that there was <i>not</i> consensus for stub articles for epsodes, but rather for only general articles until there was sufficient material to break it out into session articles, and then eventually into ones for each episode. These articles are none of them even approaching the stage of individual episode articles. The discussion frequently referred to school articles as a model, and I think its clear that discussions here are against individual articles until the material is sufficient. The bulk of the discussion was some months ago, and there were notes at the end that the consensus in the more generally interested WP community was moving against episode articles.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I placed the initial speedy tag as this seemed to be a local band of little note. A google search revealed many hits, but upon closer inspection, these were mostly for <i>another</i> band named Phineas Gage. If this article is kept, it should at least be moved to Phineas Gage (death metal band) and replaced with a dab. Otherwise, the article needs to be <i>fundamentally</i> rewritten, hence deletion is appropriate for now. <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 05:48, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Believe it or not, there are many unsigned bands with the same name, this band name is not owned by any label in existance so that does not disqualify any of the bands who do use the name. This band you roadied for, is probably now defunct like the other one which was brought up. The bottom line is, this tab was not occupied, and now it is listed with the correct and accurate information about a band name Phineas Gage out of Orlando Fl. Thus there is no grounds for deletion.</p>

<li>I have restored your cuts, added sources for the ones without sources and removed the only living person who is unsourced. If you don't like the name List of ex-gay people then move it to List of people who formerly identified as LGBT. I remain at a loss to understand how "For people who were once identified as LGBT but no longer are" is in any way vague. It requires editor to be able to answer and source two questions: Was the person at one time identified as LGBT? If no, then don't add. If yes, then go to question two Does the person now identify as heterosexual? If no, then don't add. If yes, then add and source. Not that complicated really. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:37, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Unless these actors and actresses are notable for once being gay, they violate the "Is it notable, verifiable and important to the article? If not, leave it out." bit of WP:BLP. The standard for information is higher when dealing with Biographical information, and this list violates that due to the fact that the information is rarely, if ever relevant to the person's notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> - If a person makes a <i>public statement</i> that they are gay and then later makes a <i>public statement</i> that they are not, there is no implication of their privacy. And with all due respect, your ignorance about who is or isn't gay or who has or hasn't made an "issue" of their sexuality has no bearing on this discussion. The fact that you characterize the list as containing "actors and actresses" indicates to me that you didn't even bother to fully read the list before commenting. The list as it now stands consists of one actor/singer, two musicians, a professional "reparative therapist," an evangelical minister, a journalist, a writer and a retail heir. If you bother to read some of the linked articles, you would realize that their identification as formerly gay is notable, verifiable and important. Some of the people on the list made their careers denouncing homosexuality. Others make their living performing therapy designed to turn gay men straight and writing books and delivering lectures on the topic. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:24, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

As has been pointed out below, most of the list don't mention it in the article itself, which makes it non-applicable here. Likewise, if they've formerly denounced or otherwise attacked the LBGT community in the past that makes it MORE important that this be examined very, very carefully. My comments about it being non-notable applied specifically to Anne Heche and Tatu, in regards to the fact that Anne Heche's sexuality is not former, and Tatu are on record as never having been Lesbian. If Anne Heche's sexuality can't be sufficiently covered in her own damned article, why does it deserve a full paragraph in a topic which doesn't apply per the established criteria?Cheers, <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> ○ <a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELankybugger_4866.html" title="User talk:Lankybugger">speak</a> ○ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lankybugger_113c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lankybugger">see</a> ○ 19:30, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete As-Is</b> - After reviewing the article in question, as well as the sources, I think the most responsible course of action is to remove the list due to possibly inaccurate material. Here are my concerns regarding the article, which need to be addressed promptly so as not to violate WP policy towards biographies of living persons:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. In most cases, the main pages for the individuals do not mention the past homosexuality. This should be a prerequisite to appearing on the list.</dd>
<dd>2. The title of the article (and proposed titles) imply that the individuals self identified (ie. came out) as an alternative sexuality. As noted below, this is not the case for most people on the list (at least according to the sources provided).
<dl>
<dd>-Robert Graves is only mentioned (and it is not sourced) for having "homosexual experiences in his youth". In my mind, this does not immediately make him gay, especially since no elaboration is given as to these experiences.</dd>
<dd>-Ted Haggard has never to the best of my knowledge identified as anything other than heterosexual. While it might be tempting to infer from his recent claims to be "completely heterosexual" that he once was something else, I don't believe we can make this leap.</dd>
<dd>-Russell Miller's "flirt[ing] with bisexuality" does not make him a bisexual anymore than my flirting with pot makes me a pothead.</dd>
<dd>-Lou Reed's supposed bisexuality is based around claims made by another, and was denied by Reed himself (based on what I can infer from the notes on the article in question and a bit of googling).</dd>
<dd>-t.A.T.u. "were never lesbians in the first place". This comes directly from the source given supporting their transformation.</dd>
<dd>-Worsthorne's article (when read carefully) does not state that the journalist ever identified as homosexual. It instead references how he and many of his peers preferred the simplicity of same sex company during the course of their education. Given the very abstract tone of the article, I don't feel comftorable labeling Worsthorne as <i>any</i> sexuality without corresponding accounts.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>3. None of the sources (aside from the t.A.T.u. article and Cohen's webpage) put me at ease about the claims they support. I mentioned me concerns with the vaugeness of Worsthorne's piece. I don't have information regarding the specifice passages in the Aldrich book or <i>New Idea</i> article which support the claims about Bowie and Miller (respectively). I don't fully understand the reference supporting the claim about Reed. Graves has no citation at all. Finally, news articles about Haggard that I have read do nothing more than print speculation regarding Haggard's previous orientation.</dd>
<dd>4. My final concern regards the "hot" nature of this topic. Without multiple reliable references for each claim, we put ourselves in serious risk of seriously offending and damaging the images of the individuals named. While I don't think we face any libel issues (so long as we are merely repeating what others have said) I certainly do not want to ruin any lives (or, in the case of Graves, memories) by giving rise to false sensationalism.</dd>
<dd>Taking the above into stock, the only individual who I feel comftorable leaving on the list is Cohen. Since his <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Cohen_%28author%29_5640.html" title="Richard Cohen (author)">page</a> already contains the information, I don't see any need to duplicate it here. Given that, I offer my suggestion of delete, as given above. <a href="../../../-/b/o/User_talk%7E-Bobby_2c83.html" title="User talk:-Bobby">→</a><a href="../../../-/b/o/User%7E-Bobby_56ae.html" title="User:-Bobby"><em style="color:green;font-variant:small-caps;cursor:crosshair">Bobby</em></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_-Bobby_0e62.html" title="Special:Contributions/-Bobby">←</a> 16:51, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Too many potential <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> issues here, plus it's very difficult to really verify what is truth and what is rumor, or whether certain individuals were ever actually gay to begin with (as noted above, TATU being a good example). <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:39, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> I know I'm rowing against the tide here, but I feel I have to say something. ALL biographical information is "prone to BLP issues," even the least contentious claims you could think of. That alone is not a reason to delete, being 'prone' to problems violates no wikipedia policy. IF this list satisfies <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> then there is no choice other to keep. I agree it's a mess in current form, so I won't vote keep, but if it is deleted, I would please ask that it be done without prejudice so that a fully-sourced version comporting to BLP and verifiability guidelines would not be simply speedied out of existance. This list is not POV, not OR and not unallowable so long as it relies on published information and reliable sources. The fact that, as 23skidoo noted "[...]difficult to really verify what is truth[...]" is not a real problem, Wikipedia is not concerned with empirical truth, only what can be verified through reliable sources. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 19:47, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In my mind, the article's content cleary constitutes unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material. As a result, it seems to me like the offending material should be deleted (as Samuel Blanning attempted to do earlier). I propose we set a time period by which time sources must be provided for any currently questionable claims. If community consensus is that the article does not meet BLP standards by the end of that time, I further suggest removing any questionable material, and continuing the AfD discussion based on a page history snapshot. If nobody objects, I'd like to set the deadline for 16:00 (UTC) tomorrow (Friday, 3-30). <a href="../../../-/b/o/User_talk%7E-Bobby_2c83.html" title="User talk:-Bobby">→</a><a href="../../../-/b/o/User%7E-Bobby_56ae.html" title="User:-Bobby"><em style="color:green;font-variant:small-caps;cursor:crosshair">Bobby</em></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_-Bobby_0e62.html" title="Special:Contributions/-Bobby">←</a> 20:22, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, it needs sourcing: remove unsourced living people, and after you've done that, go to all the various lists of people belonging to (or formerly belonging to) various religious and political groups and do the same. If you think sexual orientation is "crap", others think that religion and politics are too, and membership in or adherance to certain religious or political groups is illegal in some places, and may not be very nice, so it could be defamatory as well. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 03:34, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> As Bobby pointed out, this list is a mish-mash of people who have publicly <i>denied</i> they were gay, not renounced they were gay. I originally nominated this list because it is a nightmare to source, because it isn't really notable, and because of the BLP concerns brought up above. (btw, thankyou very much for not bothering to tell me it was at DRV) I'd like to comment on the subtitle of the article though - the list of actual LGB people is split by alphabet because of size, and whoever created this article must just have been following precedent. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 06:49, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Notability? He was <i>one</i> of a group of people that started a very small record label. He is <i>one</i> of three owners of a nightclub. He is listed as "road manager and producer" for notable artists... well, which was it? There's a heckuva difference between being a road manager and a producer. Absent <i>any</i> verification, I'd have to assume that he was the road manager, not the producer. Verifiability? All I could find was his MySpace page (which contains no mention of any of these accomplishments) and a brief mention establishing that he is, indeed, a part owner of Heaven. Nothing on his being a producer.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, if anyone has info that he was (1) an actual producer of an established artist and/or (2) the Steve Allen Show is highly notable and he really is a regular part of it, he <i>might</i> make the cut. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 13:22, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is an article about a living person with no notable accomplishments. Lubos Motl set up this article by himself (user Lumidek who created this article is identified as Lubos Motl). Then, the article was created on the Czech wikipedia based on this article. Lubos Motl claims to have published articles in Czech press, however his letters to the editors are of no or minor importance and are mostly published on web servers or by minor media.

The text I added is sourced from the articles linked. There is no original research here. I have also seen the religion mentioned in published books, I just don't happen to have any of them on my desk at the moment. I would go look them up for you, but I have work that needs to be done offline. Did you check to see whether the article was verifiable/notable before you nominated it for deletion?

<li>I understand that. Perhaps you would generate less antagonism if you would provide an explanation of why the sources are inadequate before deleting the information. Also, I believe that it is generally appropriate, when you come across unsourced text on Wikipedia, to make an attempt to source it before deleting it, and to accompany your deletion/deletion nom with an explanation of the avenues you pursued. There is a lot of verifiable information on Wikipedia that is just improperly sourced, so just the fact that the sources an article cites are inadequate isn't enough to justify deleting it. (The fact that the only information I can find on Religio Romana is self-published on the internet <i>is</i> enough, so <b>delete.</b> I can't find enough in books for a stub - it's not even mentioned in <i>Which Witch is Which</i>.) - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMae</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">t</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">c</a> - <a href="../../../w/p/n/WP%7EWPN_02d0.html" title="WP:WPN">wpn</a>)</sup> 18:17, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I am reluctant to delete any page for something which might be a religion, but the sourcing is very weak. if this in in the other WPs, then perhaps there are some sources there. But it did not help for various parties to delete the admittedly pathetic external links during the course of the AfD. I've restored them. If they lead to any real sources, the article should be kept.

<li>How so? The <b>Wiki standard</b> tells us that the notability criterion shared by many is - <i>A topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple non-trivial published works that are reliable and independent of the subject</i> (<a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>). And, that independent sources may not include <i>Self-promotion, autobiography, and product placement are not the routes to having an encyclopaedia article. The published works should be someone else writing about the subject</i> (amazon.com as vendor fairly misses to be an independent source). Besides, the specific notability guideline for biographies tells us that for a general bio the subject should have <i>a credible independent biography</i>, for athletes the subject may be <i>competitors who have played in a fully professional league or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport, or competitors who have played or competed at the highest level in amateur sports</i> (this was claimed of the subject by never verified), and for writers/journalists the subject may be <i>regarded as an important figure or is widely cited by their peers or successors</i> (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>).

<dd>Sorry about hiding unnecessary information (I didn't delete them, though), but how does the information on where he lives and if he is married adds to his notability?

<li>Sorry, since I was the only user debating for a delete, I think it was directed against me and my understanding. I am hurt. For one - I never claimed to know anything about the subject. But, that doesn't mean that I don't understand wikipedia notability standards, and I don't understand promotional sites. Unfortunately, I work in an advertising agency (affiliated with <a href="../../../j/w/t/JWT_1d1f.html" title="JWT">JWT</a>) and there is a possibility that while you may know everything about the subject, I may be more knowledgeable about promotional work (though not necessarily so). As long the wikipedia standards of establishing notability is followed I have no problems with the subject. This is not a personal vendetta against a person unknown to me (apart from the fact that he is well advertised). I haver already quoted all the guidelines that stand against the article, and none of the people who know much better than I do have been able to provide anything that meets those criterion (apart from more promotional stuff, including those of a vendor of the book written by the subject). May be I haven't noticed that wikipedia is a democracy now, and AfDs have turned into voting boxes. Sorry, again for all the trouble.

This cannot be compared to the Roy C. Strickland article. This is a mere stub. The Roy Strickland article is concise, thorough, and wery well-written. There is no comparison. Strickland ran for office in two states. He was a pioneer of the LA GOP. No comparison, as I see it. In addition, Strickland has an impressive business career.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. You've misunderstood me. I'm not saying the articles are directly comparable. <i>One</i> of the arguments posed by two of the editors in favor of keeping Strickland is that all major party candidates for U.S. Congress should be considered automatically notable, regardless of other notability criteria. If Strickland has other item of notability, then that's applicable in his debate, but it's beside the point that I'm addressing here. The point <i>here</i> is that if that <i>specific</i> argument gains traction and indeed seems to be a consensus among editors, then that sentiment does directly affect this one.

<dd>The 100 year test is not a generally accepted criterion--I think if it were formally proposed now it would be soundly rejected, as it makes no sense whatsoever.

<p>I think this is the same article that was previously speedily deleted as spam (G11). As I read it, it still qualifies (maybe even as unasserted significance (A7)). Anyway, I'm not sure what the notability criteria are for articles of this nature, so I wanted to have an AFD for it. --<a href="../../../p/e/k/User%7EPekaje_a76b.html" title="User:Pekaje">Pekaje</a> 19:33, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Under a more NPOV title, like Muhammad in poetry or Muhammad in literature, this could well be a reasonably good, encyclopedically valuable article. However, at the moment, the article is just one unsources paragraph and several quotes from poetry, and it has been in its current state for pretty long. Therefore, <b>delete</b>, but without prejudice to it being recreated if sufficient material from reliable secondary sources is found on this topic. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 19:34, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

How old the victim were, how many fathers, mothers, preteen childred died there, how many family members died there. It's also useful for book writers or journalists who want to write articles about terrorist's attacks to have these exact information.

<li><b>Delete</b> It is not necessary to have a directory of each person who died in a tragedy to appreciate the magnitude of the tragedy. Summary information in the main article is sufficient.

The fact that he has written books and been in some DVDs does not automatically establish notability. Have his books/DVDs been reviewed? Has anyone other than IMDB written a bio for him?

<li>Yes, I see what you are saying and this is actually a pretty tough call. Josh is all over the place, but not in any <i>major source</i>. However, I give him the <i>benefit of the doubt</i> and think that he is notable enough to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> just by the skin of his teeth.

<p>Poorly sourced. One source merely warns of a <i>potential</i> new apartheid. Another looks at the influence Australia may have had on South African apatheid 55 years ago.

<p>I wasn't aware that notable information could be deleted within two days because it isn't well sourced enough. This is clearly notable article, because Australia's policies inspired those of South Africa-- this is in the historical record, too. Even if it was 55 years ago, it's notable for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Encyclopedias are supposed to cover the past in just as much detail as the present, when it comes to politics.</li>
<li>The allegation is still used against Australian society today, even though it's blatantly false in my opinion. (this is comparible to the allegation of economic apartheid in the United States. to me it is blatantly false, but it is a politically notable accusation given the history involved.)</li>
</ol>
<p>It is hypocrisy to delete this article and keep the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> article. So, because this is notable, the answer is to add to it, and source it, just like any other article. We shouldn't delete it because it stifles a potentially notable article from emerging. <b>Keep</b>.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 20:10, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Judging by Urthogie's comments, it seems the name is at least wrong. I'm not sure what the title of the article would be, but "Allegations of Australian apartheid" definitely seems odd, if this is basically a historical issue. I'm not sure what the sources are for any article though; I guess the question is whether a person should be able to make several articles and then say they'll source them later.

<p>As explained at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Physics_a4a8.html#Physical_nullification" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Physics">WikiProject Physics Talk</a>, this page is an exercise in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Original Research</a> on a non-notable topic. Google returns 17 hits on "physical nullification", not including WP and mirrors, most of which don't refer to this topic (<i><a href="http://www.gilasvirsky.com/wib2007.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gilasvirsky.com/wib2007.html" rel="nofollow">e.g.,</a></i> "the physical nullification and conjugal rape experienced by many women in the West").

The same goes for the part about <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wormhole.html" title="Wormhole">wormholes</a> — it's OR because we have no evidence that Forward said any of it, and it probably just stems from the imagination of 66.16.45.2 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.16.45.2_308a.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.16.45.2">contribs</a>), trying to connect an old <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">SF</a> idea with something more modern.</p>
<p>If you cut out the OR, there's not enough left to merit an article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Seriously, these pages have been up for over six months. And if you want to delete them then go ahead. But you will never convince me that when one were to google "Mark Lind" + "punk" and "Ducky Boys" + "punk" and got 11,000 and 71,000 results respectively, there isn't some of notability out there. You also can't tell me that a band that has toured with major bands like Dropkick Murphys and Rancid doesn't have respect in the music community. I am in no way a member of the band, nor personally know any member of the band or Mark himself. I simply am interested in their music and their strong following within the Boston Area. But if it will delight the Wikipedia "Gods" to delete this article, please go right ahead. AxYoung 21:25, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

People who want to create schools articles should first make them sections of school district articles unless they're going to bother to put in more than a few paragraphs of material. If the school district articles get too long, they can calve off "Arlington Public Schools elementary schools" or "---- middle schools". Start a school article when you've got the information. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:40, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Living writer with only one book and no other claim to notability. A <i>prod</i> tag has been removed three times, twice by different anons and once by the original creator of the article User:Giovanni.manganello (in his third edit ever since he created the article 7 months ago). All three gave similar reasons in the edit summary, and may be the same person.

<p>Non-notable theatre group. So they're pretty old, hardly a big deal. Just about every theatre group is going to be the oldest in some geographic location. All this really is is a list of people, 99% of them completely non-notable. A couple semi-famous people may have been associated with them over the years, but no one is famous <i>for</i> their association with the group. The bar where Tom Wopat washed dishes when he was in college is not notable from its association with Tom Wopat, and the same goes for this little group. <a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:47, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Having been president of the major professional association is strong evidence of notability. In most professions, the term is limited to one year, so there's nothing off about that. There are quite enough sources. It should have been obvious from even the first stub that the subject was clearly notable and that sources would be available. Its verifiability, not verified. 22:31, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The entire article is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and completely lacks any <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EAttribute_6b35.html" title="WP:Attribute">citations</a> (it's been tagged as unreferenced since December <b>2005</b>), and <i>full</i> of useless entries like "Wake - Red Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield". <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DICT" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indescriminate collection of information</a> also apply here, I think.

<li>I want to delete it because it's unreferenced and almost entirely original research, both of which are in clear violation of Wikipedia policies. Other people have made good points here about massive cleanup being possibly better than outright deletion (I don't know that I agree, simply because I think this type of thing is likely to always have a lot of original research in it by its nature, and because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DICT" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>).

<li>It would seem this article is more appropriate for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">wiktionary</a> than the current wiki, however I want to know what your source is for its supposed inaccuracy.
