<p>This apprently was previously nominated, but someone removed the tag and deleted the VfD page, which seems quite improper. The original article was speedied as a substub with hardly any info. It was on VfU, not fairing too well, when someone wrote the current article, which is certainly not speedy material. As for this band, they have no recordings, but it's been put forth that they pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criterion #2. This is somewhat suspect, as playing a few gigs outside of the island you live on is hardly a substantial tour. For example, they played a festival in Copenhagen ("festival" meaning they were just one of many bands). Their best claim to notability is winning a Faroe Islands contest, and as of now I can't tell how great of an accomplishment that is (the Faroe Islands having a population less than that of Eau Claire, Wisconsin). But I'd say it's their only real shot at articleworthiness. <i>gestir band faroe</i> got me 29 google hits.-<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:10, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I wrote the article having read on VfU that the subject was clearly notable and that the subject would be kept as long as someone wrote a proper article, which I did. To me this sort of subject has done enough, the model for bands in Scandanvian country isn't the same as that in America, to which WP:MUSIC guidelines are slanted. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 16:23, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Only 1 person in the VfU said they were clearly notable, and didn't exactly give any rationale for that statement. Others (including me) said that creation of an article with significant content wouldn't be speedied, but I didn't see anyone saying such an article would clearly be a keeper either. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:29, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My town is bigger than the Faroe Islands, and simply being "big" here certainly doesn't qualify a band for being in an encyclopedia. Fortunately, we have a nice guidelines to help us decide on bands, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. If they DO meet the criteria there, by all means the article should make this clear, and I'll reconsider my vote. Just to put things in perspective, these guys don't even have a record yet. Article says they're signed to a label which I can't find any information on (other than their website, which makes them sound like a vanity label for music from that particular location). Anyway, I see no assertion of meeting the music criteria in the article, so I vote <b>Delete</b> for now. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:28, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm certainly willing to entertain the idea that the music guideline is slanted. But help us out here, what would make this band notable? There are tons of bands with more than one record already out who aren't "important" enough to be included. Why are these guys special? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:32, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>As I said, it is normal in Scandanvian countries to be around much longer than American bands before having a record.

<li><b>Delete</b> While this band has some claims to notability, they fail to meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a>. However, they will become eligible if their album or a single from it reaches the top 100 of a national chart or they complete a national tour or they release two albums n a major label or significant independent label.
