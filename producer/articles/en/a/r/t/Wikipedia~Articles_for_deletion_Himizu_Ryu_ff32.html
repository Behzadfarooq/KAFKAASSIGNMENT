<p>A martial-art, alleged to be a <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koryu.html" title="Koryu">koryu</a> with history claiming to date back to 1609. Only few Google links (not counting Wikipedia mirrors), all clearly copied from same source than this article. Himizu ryu cannot be found from reference works like <i>Bugei Ryuha Daijiten</i>, <i>Nihon Kobudo Soran</i>, or from any *reliable* English language secondary source (Draeger's trilogy, Friday, Skoss, Amdur, Lowry, www.koryu.com, etc.). <b>Delete</b> for being unverifiable, non-notable and for using Wikipedia as a vehicle of promotion. <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> 12:59, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Martial arts is a tremendous amount of politics. And, like all politics, many people are so opinionated that they use their anger to voice their issues instead of seeking truth directly from the source.</p>
<p>Mr. JNI uses only initials to represent who he is but spends his time seeking to attempt to debunk certain groups but yet has offered NO reason as to why he should be given credit himself.</p>
<p>Who wishes to respect anyone who refuses to show their face by at least placing their real name and contact information with their wikipedia entries? ANYONE claiming knowledge of anything without proving as to why they should be respected as an authority on a given topic should not be allowed to troll through free encyclopedia's seeking to damage the name of others without first contacting them and making a formal request for information.</p>
<p>I, Kevin Rocha, as a member in good standing with the Himizu Ryu, can verify that Mr. "JNI" has NEVER attempted to contact ANY members of the Himizu Ryu and is therefore only seeking attention. Anyone wishing to contact me directly may do so at kevinrocha@hotmail.com to discuss this matter in its entirety.</p>
<p>Remember, never trust those who play hide and seek by asking others to trust them but yet only using their supposed initials to identifiy themselves and then use VERY POOR internetiquette to discuss historical issues without ANY real knowledge of the topic or anything to verify their "claims".</p>
<p>When Mr. "JNI" would like to be professional and: 1) List his <b>real name</b> 2) List his <b>contact information</b> 3) List as to how it is he should be respected ie-his credentials that give him authority to write ANYTHING on wikipedia (meaning his <b>educational background in history and martial art training</b>), then I will stop questioning his motives and actions. Until then, he is NOT to be trusted and any of his information is greatly subject to debate as to whether or not it is honest and real. Mr. "JNI" continues to post faulty information on wikipedia and has YET to provide any kind of information that would ligitimately discredit those whom he attacks. I have provided my name and contact information but "JNI" has NOT contacted myself or anyone else on this matter to formally ask questions but has instead spent his time only attacking others -- without providing answers to our questions: 1. Contact Information &amp; 2. Educational credentials concerning History and the Martial Arts. Therefore, he is only seeking to start a internet flame war with 1. no personal credibility and 2. no qualifications to speak on matters of organizations he doesn't even belong to.</p>
<p>The topic being discussed is to the validity of our ryuha and that information is not able to be found. I have stated that our information IS available to those who contact us and formally request information. Therefore, the disussion as to whether or not the validity of HR exists should cease and not be stated as to whether it is in question any longer.</p>

<li>Comment: I think User:Kevin Rocha already gave a reason for deletion above: <i>...the validity of our ryuha and that information is not able to be found.</i> Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and encyclopedias need to contain information that is verifiable from external sources. Kevin effectually says: "we have a <i>densho</i> (scroll), but it is not available to non-members". He mentioning such a primary source immediately promps some questions, however: 1) name of the document? 2) its author? 3) year written? 4) references to published secondary sources that use <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholarly_method.html" title="Scholarly method">scholarly method</a> to derive conclusions from said <i>densho</i>? 5) references to Japanese sources that verify its author is a historical person? 6) references to internal documents of *other* <i>ryūha</i>, that reference the document in question. Primary sources alone, even when they can be validated, are not very helpful for building an encyclopedia. As eminent historian Karl Friday notes in his <i>Legacies of the Sword</i>, materials produced by <i>bugei ryūha</i> are nearly always not objective; he uses term "parochial history" in reference to his own work in cases where secondary scholarship does not support (or does not exist for) the internal documents of <i>Kashima shinryū</i>. In summary, the question of whether himizu-ryu is real or fake is immaterial to this VfD, if it cannot be verified. Furthermore, pseudonym Kevin Rochas repeated vandalism of this page and statements of anger towards me and the deletion process do not cast any credibility to his cause. <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> 06:59, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
