<dd>I'm uncertain. Possibly a list of just the celebrity centers would be notable, if quite small. Otherwise I'm thinking this could be like, or lead to, a list of every center of every religion. Which is not what most lists are. I don't think we have a List of Unification churches. Or even a List of Kingdom Halls. If we do then I'll change my tone and be for keep. Right now I don't know. Are centers equivalent to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedral.html" title="Cathedral">Cathedrals</a> or <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilica.html" title="Basilica">Basilicas</a> to this faith?--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>Some of those other lists also have problems. The thing is, with this list there is no way in which it can be useful. If an user wants a list of scientology centres, then they would go quickly to the CoS's own website, where they will find a superior one. If an article needs to invoke a list of scientology centres, then it would also give a link to the current CoS directory instead. Even if written optimally, this list can only verbatim repeat the official, centralised listings, presenting no additional data, collating information from no additional source, and offering no summary or introduction or interpretation that will distinguish it and make it a rightful resident of wikipedia. There is no need for this list, and having this list is harmful because there will be a temptation to use it when in any concievably circumstance, the official CoS list will be better.--<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFangz_eec0.html" title="User:Fangz">Fangz</a> 06:07, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I should emphasise that I linked to that list to defeat the misconception that WP should only host lists that are indices to WP articles. There is a case for lists to have encyclopediac value other than linking to articles.

On the other hand that list links to articles at Wikipedia so if this survives it should link to Scientology centers that are already important enough to have articles. Still some arguments on its usefulness, in the comment section below, have some merit. Then again Scientology is certainly not as noteworthy as Islam. Also it could use some annotation and links showing notability. For now the link simply seems to show that they exist and they are centers, which doesn't say much.

<dd>Although I disagree with those lists as well, at least those are lists of <i><b>churches</b></i>, not simply lists of cities which have churches and then links to their external websites. Zoe (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.234.130.130.html" title="User:216.234.130.130">216.234.130.130</a> 16:15, 12 December 2005 (UTC))
<dl>
<dd>This article <i>is</i> a list of churches that just happens to be ordered by city. And I've already stated repeatedly that if the external links are what makes the difference, I don't mind if someone removes them. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:27, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But that's simply not true. Just look at the first one, under Argentina. The link is to <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires%2C_Argentina_c990.html" title="Buenos Aires, Argentina">Buenos Aires, Argentina</a>, not to Scientology Center of Buenos Aires, or however they're named. Zoe (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.234.130.130.html" title="User:216.234.130.130">216.234.130.130</a> 18:34, 12 December 2005 (UTC))
<dl>
<dd>Zoe, the names of the cities are Wikified links because it is Wikipedia formatting style to do so. The links to each individual Scientology center is given as a reference link (y'know, the little number after each city?). <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 22:57, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- There is a big difference between some of the articles mentioned above, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ottawa_churches_755b.html" title="List of Ottawa churches">List of Ottawa churches</a>, which are lists organizing information <i>in Wikipedia</i>, and the subject article, which is just a repository of external links. As such, it's something that one ought to look for on Scientology's website, not here. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 20:33, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One might just as easily posit that one ought to look elsewhere to a more official website for <i>anything</i> rather than on Wikipedia, by the same token. Should we also delete the thousands of TV show/movie articles and say that they're something one ought to look for on <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDB_38d9.html" title="IMDB">IMDB</a>'s website, not here? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 22:53, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You've misunderstood Skeezix's objection. Lists that are indexes to articles here on Wikipedia have a useful organisational role to play in this encyclopedia. Lists of links to content elsewhere on the internet are quite different: if a page consists mostly of these, then it is rather like a section of a directory, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> expressly says that is not what this enterprise is about. We don't have a firm rule saying that such pages can never have a place on WP, but the onus is definitely on the article's defenders to say why such content is necessary. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 23:18, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article is not called "List of Links to Scientology Center Webpages", and it was never intended to be that. It's "List of Scientology Centers". I only threw the links in as a sort of, you know, <i>extra bonus</i>. *smile* Like I keep saying (over and over and over), I'm fine with the external links being removed, because it's not about the links. I <i>do</i> maintain that a list of centers for this highly controversial and high-profile organization is extremely notable and extremely important information for researchers of all viewpoints. And hey, I'll be glad to create a separate article stub for each of the Centers, if that's what it takes. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 23:52, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But this is <i><b>not</b></i> a "List of Scientology Centers". This is a "List of cities which have Scientology Centers". Zoe (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.234.130.130.html" title="User:216.234.130.130">216.234.130.130</a> 00:02, 13 December 2005 (UTC))</li>

<li><b>Other</b> - Right now the article seems like a list of links, but it also seems that it has potential (and it may be needed for the related project). I have also noticed that the article was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Undelete/List_of_Scientology_centers" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Undelete/List_of_Scientology_centers" rel="nofollow">created</a> and (speedy?) deleted in 9 minutes, and then it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Scientology_centers&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Scientology_centers&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">got</a> an AfD (three minutes after re-creation/undelete). I think that time should be given, in order to let the contributing editors show whether this article is indeed needed, or it could be provisionally moved from Main_space to User_space, be expanded and worked, and then listed normally in Main_space. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">+MATIA</a> <small><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatia.gr_4cf3.html" title="User talk:Matia.gr">☎</a></small> 22:05, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
