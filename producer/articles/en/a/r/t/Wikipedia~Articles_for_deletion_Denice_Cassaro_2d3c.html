<li><b>Keep</b> Denice is notable for bombarding the undergraduates with emails about campus events. Every single person who has been an undergrad at cornell for the past 8 years knows Denice very well, that makes her notable to about 100,000 or more people. Much more notable than many minor politicians or schools. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 06:51, 2 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Klonimus is notable for bombarding the VfD page with extreme inclusionist votes with questionable logic. That doesn't mean Klonimus meets standards to have a WP article. <b>Delete</b> this article, notability not established, not even close to having it suggested. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 16:02, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>The same applies to the extreme exclusionist votes by mister Klo. More than I agree with Barno, I see you deserve an entry in WP rather than her. We accept to include an e-mailer and exclude notable articles just because of non reasonable POVs.

<ul>
<li>No, I'd rather go for Klonimus the inconsistant exclusionist. See?! The proof is that you excluded my signature (I know it was unintentionally). I replaced back on its right place.&#160;;-) Cheers and respect <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Svest</a> 01:54, May 3, 2005 (UTC) <sup><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF">Wiki me up</a></sup>.
<ul>
<li>Neither inclusionism nor exclusionism is a crime or sin. Klo is noted for votes that include/exclude all of a category that isn't policy, similar to many of Kappa's votes, rather than explaining what fact about the topic meets what policy. That doesn't make him encyclopedically significant enough for an article. If Ms. Cassaro is a mailbot as suggested below, I doubt that's pioneering enough or widely enough noted for an article. Its contents as it stand show no reason to differentiate Ms. Cassaro from hundreds of other shills doing a job that has an impersonal feather-touch upon the e-mail accounts of a few thousand people in one place. Do the students at Cornell's joint projects in places like Hong Kong have their educational experience revolutionized by the name on their internal announcements? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 15:46, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Is there a university (or even a little community college) that does <b>not</b> have a communications person publicizing current happenings and housing? Would Cornell lose its prestige if this person didn't make the entire community aware of for-sale items? I work in Ithaca and subscribe to the Ithaca Journal; I can tell you that this person isn't locally notable to a non-student, so I can't see how she'd be notable in a broader context.

<li><b>Keep</b>, (author's vote) notability is established by over 18000 undergraduates (and probably another 18000 graduated students) knowing Denice by e-mail address, not her face. Her reputation is very wide reaching, and she performs an important role in community development, much like a town crier of the days of yore.
