<p>Donald Crews was born in Newark, New Jersey in 1938. He had an older brother, and two sisters. His mother worked as a seamstress, and his father worked at the railroad, and several other odd jobs. For the summers he would travel down to rural Florida to stay with his grandmother, who he called "Bigmama". He loved loved the big city, but he also loved being at the farm, and this caused him to create two, massively different types of art later on in his life.</p>
<p>From a young age, his talent for drawing was encouraged by his family and his teachers. When he got into high school, one of his teachers became a mentor to him, and personally made sure that he got into art school.</p>
<p>He graduated from Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York City in 1959, and married another graduate, and graphic artist, Ann Jonas. He was drafted into the army in 1963, and sent to Frankfurt, Germany. Their first daughter, Nina was born in Germany, and their second was born a year lter in New York.</p>
<p>While in Germany, he worked on several pieces for his portfolio, including the extremely odd children's book <a href="../../../a/_/t/We_Read%7E_A_to_Z_58fc.html" title="We Read: A to Z">We Read: A to Z</a>. After several suggestions from friends, he submitted it, and it was published by Harpers. The book relied on abstract ideas, rather than tired cliches that were ussually associated with ABC books. One classic example is the entry for the letter C: "Cc, corner: where the yellow is" is illustrated with a yellow square in the far corner of a red page in the book.</p>
<p>He created several other books over the next few years, but it was 1979's Freight Train that won him a Caldecott Honor, and the respect of other artists in that field. He won another Caldecott Honor the next year for <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truck.html" title="Truck">Truck</a>. Several other transportation themed books followed, such as <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_Bus_853f.html" title="School Bus">School Bus</a> (1984), <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying.html" title="Flying">Flying</a> (1986), and <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sail_Away_a989.html" title="Sail Away">Sail Away</a> (1995). Children loved these books that took everyday objects and followed them on their travels throughout the day. His memories from his summers in florida first appeared in Bigmama's and later in <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shortcut.html" title="Shortcut">Shortcut</a>. These stories are vastly different from his previous works, in that they focus on humans, and tell a more linear story.</p>

<p>Katz v. United States 389 U.S. 347 (1967) Docket Number: 35 Abstract</p>
<p>Argued:</p>
<p><br />
October 17, 1967</p>
<p>Decided:</p>
<p><br />
December 18, 1967</p>
<p>Subjects:</p>
<p><br />
Criminal Procedure: Search and Seizure Facts of the Case</p>
<p>Acting on a suspicion that Katz was transmitting gambling information over the phone to clients in other states, Federal agents attached an eavesdropping device to the outside of a public phone booth used by Katz. Based on recordings of his end of the conversations, Katz was convicted under an eight-count indictment for the illegal transmission of wagering information from Los Angeles to Boston and Miami. On appeal, Katz challanged his conviction arguing that the recordings could not be used as evidence against him. The Court of Appeals rejected this point, noting the absence of a physical intrusion into the phone booth itself. The Court granted certiorari. Question Presented</p>
<p>Does the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures require the police to obtain a search warrant in order to wiretap a public pay phone? Conclusion</p>
<p>Yes. The Court ruled that Katz was entitled to Fourth Amendment protection for his conversations and that a physical intrusion into the area he occupied was unnecessary to bring the Amendment into play. "The Fourth Amendment protects people, not places," wrote Justice Potter Stewart for the Court. A concurring opinion by John Marshall Harlan introduced the idea of a 'reasonable' expectation of Fourth Amendment protection.</p>

<p>[[Kent Randall was born in Peterborough, Ontario Canada in 1984. Kent studied at PCVS during the years of 1998-2003. His major interests in school was geography. On the side of school he found a strong interest in music. After many years of practice, determination and hardwork he completed an album in 2001. This was his first album, it was self titled 'What you been missing'. For a couple of years he performed his talents around the city at parties and establishments. Ivoree was his stage name, which has said to have a much more deeper meaning; one that he has yet to be revealed. Upon recent discussion, it has been rumoured that he will reveal it on his next upcoming 2nd album. This is slated for 2007. Kent now resides in Waterloo, Ontario and is frequently on tour, but many PCVS alumni during the 90's and 2000's will remember him for his initial breakthrough start at the PCVS talent show, where he played his now hit song 'True'. Other notable songs that are popular are 'What you been missing', 'Mad Hype'. In his spare time he enjoys coming back to participate in local golf charity tournaments.</p>

<p>The USS Premonition is a fictional starship from the science fiction franchise Star Trek. It is set in the Next Generation era and is commanded by Captain Thaddeus Deming. According to the classic strategy game by Activision, Star Trek Armada, the Premonition was constructed in the near distant future. Designed as a timeship, the Premonition was outfitted with a Temporal Drive, which produced a swirling blue and white wormhole, or in this case timehole, allowing the ship to travel backwards or forwards through time.</p>
<p>The starship was constructed after a Borg holocaust, when the Borg, according to Captain Deming, have assimilated every major planet in the Alpha Quadrant, from Bajor to Vulcan to Earth itself. Although not directly stated in Star Trek Armada, according to the novel Star Trek Premonition by Samuel Ordonia, which focuses more on what happened in the alternate future of Borgified Earth, the Premonition was humanity's last ditch effort to save itself from extinction. Eventually, the time came when the Premonition was required to travel back in time, only to be trailed by two Borg ships.</p>
<p>The battered starship arrives in a time that coincides not long after the events depicted in Star Trek Insurrection, as in the game Star Trek Armada, there is a reference to recent hostilities between the Federation and the Sona. In addition, in the first mission of the game Armada, Captain Picard states that the Dominion War has recently ended. This first mission is the time period of which the Premonition emerges with its cyborg companions from the future. After a brief firefight, the Premonition is rescued by Picard. Ironically, Picard mutters to himself that the Premonition looks familiar.</p>
<p>Deming warns the captain of the Enterprise E that a Borg attack on Starbase 612 will soon occur. Deming states that this attack was the first of the Borg invasion "that eventually took over the Alpha Quadrant." Although initially reluctant, Picard agrees to travel to Starbase 612, only to find that Deming was right. However, Picard is able to rally the remaining forces that are still battling the Borg to score the victory against the Borg.</p>
<p>However, this attack was only the first. After the Borg continue to struggle to conquer the Alpha Quadrant, they eventually attack Earth, using their latest weapon, the alternate version of Picard, Locutus. Locutus defeats the defense forces of Earth, which included the Enterprise E and the Premonition. The Premonition sends the Enterprise E back in time to change events more, and in the battle of Earth (take two), the Federation forces are assisted by their new Klingon and Romulan allies.</p>
<p>The mission of the Premonition is a success when Picard's double Locutus is supposedly killed and the Omega Particle, a substance of tremendous power, is destroyed. However, all is not as easy as it seems. Locutus, viewing the inevitibility of defeat, travels back in time himself to kill Picard.</p>
<p>As the universe changes and reforms to a universe lacking a Picard, Deming and the Premontion find themselves the only ones capable of changing this tragedy. According to Deming, the Premonition has a different quantum signature than the other figures of that time period. Apparently, this has protected the Premonition from the changes in the altered timeline. The Premonition travels once more back in time to Picard's first mission with the Enterprise D, to Farpoint Station. The Premonition defeats Locutus, finally killing the Borg, and returns straight to its own time without another word with Picard. This Farpoint Incident explains why Picard hazily recognizes the Premonition when he rescues it from the Borg.</p>
<p>The Premonition is presumed to have returned to a time period with a brighter future. Neither the Premonition nor others of its class are ever mentioned in any Star Trek television show or movie, indicating that it is only a figment of fanfiction. Then again, the existence of a future Federation timeship is not unrealistic, as in the Star Trek Enterprise series, there are repeated references to an organization bent on protecting the timeline. Obviously, the protection of time requires a timeship, and there is a first for everything.</p>

<p>The Rabbit Factory is about the NBA, which is the National Basketball Association. It is about the New York Knicks trying to get a rabbit out of a hole in the chairs of the United Center. In the ninth chapter a sailor is trying to sex upa prostitute and he fails miserably. Alright, so I only read nine chapeters. I have to admit, I read the ninth chapter when I was dropping a deuce. If you don't know what that is, then look it up on Wikkipedia. It doesn't lie. The only reason I got this book is because it was next to Dan Brown, who wrote The Da Vinchi Code. I really didn't even plan on checking out this book.</p>

<p>polyphenols are one of the major component of tannins. the polyphenols are having the property of both anti-oxidant and protein binding abilitties. the anti-oxidant property is one of the important biological process. in the synthesis of collagen the (L)ascorbic acid is converting to (L)proline and also ascorbic acid consumed for hydroxylation of proline to form 4-hydroxy proline by proline hydroxylase enzyme. the over consumption of ascorbic acid leads to defeciency in vitamin C leads to hemeorrage. the use of polyphenols in anti-oxidant is it will readly convert to quinone derivative by consumption of free-radical generated during hydroxylations. also the polyphenols are commercially available food preservatives</p>

<p>In Informatics, coalescing is the act of merging two adjacent free blocks of memory. When an application frees memory, gaps can fall in the memory segment that that application uses. Among other techniques, coalescing is used to reduce external fragmentation, but is not totally effective. Coalescing can be done as soon as blocks are freed, or it can be deferred until some time later (known as deferred coalescing), or it might not be done at all.</p>
<p>Coalescence and related techniques like heap compaction, can be used in garbage collection.</p>

<p>the insurgents are the legendary rock and roll band that started off as CodeSwiss. Their diverse style of music. Codeswiss broke up after their publicity was all too much. "we needed to settle down," said lead guitarist, Sam Johnson,"we needed to head into the studio and take a break." he said after their show at the 2005 Superbowl. They then broke off into the small twon band, Genuine Rebel. After the publicity once again got them, they broke off into the now legendary The Insurgents.</p>

<p>Michael Sheridan released his first solo EP and began playing in Portland, Oregon as Michael Meanwhile... The EP did well, but he continued to search for a cast of musicians who could bring to life his growing notebook of songs. He was looking for players with diverse musical backgrounds, but a shared belief that all great music starts with honesty. Scott Pemberton was the first to sign on playing lead guitar, pedal steel, bass and organ. Ji Tanzer came aboard bringing drums and percussion. Finally, Joe Cunningham stepped in, playing everything from Sax to Melodica, Rhodes to Glockenspiel. Boasting a long list of credits, Scott, Joe &amp; Ji are widely considered among the premier players in the Northwest. The evolution of the project, nudged Michael to shed his solo moniker and release a self produced record under a new band name, National Flower. Their single, "Rise &amp; fall", was selected as a finalist in the NewSong Contest (2005), and later declared a winner after a series of live performance rounds in West Virginia. Refusing to be forced into a genre, National Flower has created their own, which they call Northwest Americana.</p>

<p>Woodrow Wilson, the 28th president of the United States , was a man of ideals. It was he who attempted to make âthe world safe for democracy,â and it was he who proposed the 14 points and League of Nations in order to contest war and aggression. Wilson had numerous grand solutions for the worldâs largest problems. But a man, a president, should be judged based on the consequences of his actions, not on the gallantry of his ideas. If evaluated as such, Mr. Wilson does not emerge as one Americaâs most heroic presidents, but rather as one of the most ignoble. Woodrow Wilson had grand ideas before he became US president in 1912. Prior to his political career, which he began in 1910 as the governor of New Jersey, Wilson was the president of Princeton. When he began, Wilson decided that the entire education system at Princeton had to be revamped, and he proposed changes that would cost northwards of $10 million, despite the fact that the schoolâs endowment was only $4 million. He was successful in hiring 50 well-qualified faculty members and implementing the British tutor system, which had young teachers live in the dormitories with students and give them guidance. Wilsonâs career at Princeton was eventually cut short though due to a number of disputes he initiated with important faculty members and patrons of the school. Wilson aspired to raise the intellectual bar of Princeton, which at that time was more of a rich manâs playground. In an attempt to break up the social cliques that had endured from years past, Wilson proposed the âquadrangle system,â which would basically have the school divided into colleges based on intellectual pursuit. This was met with much resistance from alumni, who considered those cliques to have been the epitome of the Princeton experience â an idea that was detested by Wilson. His unwillingness to compromise irritated a number of board members as well, and the fighting halted any forward progress. Wilson also got into a heated debate surrounding the establishment of the graduate school, which resulted in his alienation of important benefactorâs such as William Proctor of Procter &amp; Gamble. Wilsonâs arrogant stubbornness was cause for a nasty split from Princeton in 1909, the sting of which was allayed by his emergence as a political figure soon after. Wilsonâs behavior at Princeton foreshadowed what would be his general attitude and behavior as President of the United States. His arrogance and belief that his actions were taking the moral high ground explain the unsuccessfulness of the programs and ideas that characterize his presidency. Namely, his entrance into World War I and the ensuing Paris Peace Conference in 1919.</p>
<p>The main mistake that Wilson made as President was to enter World War I in the first place. At the end of July 1914, an originally isolated standoff in the Balkans between Austria and Serbia exploded into huge war that involved not only continental Europe, but also European colonies and even Japan. The war has a number of underlying causes, but the immediate reason for conflict had to do with The assassination of Austrian Archduke Francis Ferdinand by Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princep in Sarajevo. The archdukeâs murder prompted Austria-Hungary to deliver an unreasonable ultimatum to Serbia. At that point, Austria-Hungary had received a âblank checkâ from Germany and felt confident enough to invade Serbia and advance its colonial agenda in the Balkans. Russia, in support of Pan-Slavism, mobilized its army to defend Serbia, and subsequently, Germany came to AHâs defense. France, allies with Russia in the Triple Entente, joined the war, and as did Britain when Germany invaded neutral Belgium. Eventually, numerous other countries entered the foray, but the US remained on the sidelines. The US remained âneutralâ until April 1917, when it declared war on Germany. Even thought they claimed they were neutral, they helped the Allies by giving them loans and weapons, but also by putting pressure on countries when needed. One big mistake the Wilson made in his pseudo-neutrality was due to his lack of knowledge about the ongoing Russian revolution. In 1917, while an interim government ruled in place of Czar Nicolas II, Wilson pressured them to remain in the war, despite the fact that Russians were strongly opposed to it. The added complication of staying in the war made it hard for the government to consolidate its power, the public threw their support behind Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and they were able to grab power for themselves in October. From that spawned the USSR, Stalin, and the Cold War - which consumed American foreign policy for some half a century. But back to America's part in the war. A few factors contributed to the USâs declaration. The reasons used by Wilson to justify entrance to the war, however, are misconstrued and blown out of proportion. One of the first âacts of aggressionâ by the Germanâs was the sinking of the British ocean liner the Lusitania on May 7th, 1915, in which 1200 people died, of which about 130 were American citizens. A message sent from the US to the German government on the 13th of may decried the âviolation of many sacred principles of justice and humanityâ and stated, âAmerican citizens act within their indisputable rights in taking their ships and in traveling wherever their legitimate business calls them upon the high seas.â This supposedly unwarranted attack helped build American sentiment against the Germans, and allowed for the escalation of Americaâs efforts against the Central Powers. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan resigned the next month in protest of Wilsonâs handling of the Lusitania situation, as he believed that he was manipulating the occurrence in order to prepare America for war. He may have been right. Fifteen days later, the German government responded:</p>
<p>The Lusitania was one of the largest and fastest English commerce steamers, constructed with Government funds as auxiliary cruisers, and is expressly included in the navy list published by the British Admiralty... the Lusitania when she left New York undoubtedly had guns on board which were mounted under decks and maskedâ¦ there can be no doubt that the rapid sinking of the Lusitania was primarily due to the explosion of the cargo of ammunition caused by the torpedo. Otherwise, in all human probability, the passengers would have been saved.</p>
<p>This being the case, the US governmentâs previous statements are empty ones. First of all, as it carried ammunitions, the Lusitania cannot be considered a neutral ship. Secondly, it was traveling in a war zone. It is never a good idea to travel through a war zone, especially if the ship is one carrying ammunitions. The Germans had taken out ads in American magazines warning civilians not to go into areas of conflict, so, although this loss of life was a tragedy, it certainly was not completely unwarranted on the part of the Germans. Even so, at the requests of the US, Germany desisted from submarine warfare. However, they resumed once again in 1917 â with the hope that they could establish a blockade around Britain â prompting the US into action. This method of attack that was considered so egregious by the Americans was in fact more insidious than the British blockade on Germany, but there were no warnings sent to London. This blockade, which cut off all supplies from Germany, was highly successful, but at the same time, it acutely disrupted the lives of all German civilians. There was no material for clothing and little food; basically, families struggled to find the most elemental provisions necessary for survival. Yet there was no questioning of British practice. Regarding the issue of not forewarning all incoming ships, it made no sense that the rules of sea warfare should apply to submarines, which are ineffective above water, and are subject to ramming from enemy ships (even the commercial ones, many of which were equipped with ramming devices). Besides for the sinking of the Lusitania and the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917, another incident that helped form US policy was the interception of a telegram sent from German foreign secretary Arthur Zimmerman to the German ambassador to Mexico, Heinrich Von Eckardt. The content of the telegram was forwarded to the American public. Germany was prepared to ally with Mexico in order to attack America. That a German attack on American soil was imminent resulted in anger toward Germany; anger that would buoy support for entrance to a foreign war, a war in which America should not have had a part. Zimmerman had written in telegram, âIt is our intention to endeavor to keep neutral the United States of America. If this attempt is not successful, we propose an alliance on the following basis with Mexico: That we shall make war together and together make peace.â The Germans specifically did not purport to bring America into the war. They merely proposed a hypothetical alliance, adding in that Mexico could regain territory lost to the US. If anyone actually considered that idea, they would have realized that it was not tactically plausible, taking into account the stake of the German army and navy in Europe. How (and why) would they suddenly help Mexico recapture Texas? A German attack on America was truly not a threat. This didnât stop Wilson and the US from declaring war on Germany on April 6th, 1915. But maybe it was Wilsonâs prejudicial view of Germany, not one based solely on facts and the interests of the country, which played a role in his declaration of war. At the Paris peace conference following the war, Wilson admitted to Lloyd George, the Prime Minister of Britain: âI have always detested Germanyâ¦ They are so far from our views that they have inspired in me a feeling of aversion (Wilsonâs War, p. 149).â On the same note, Wilson was also racist toward blacks. In his book History of the American Peoples he writes, "The white men were roused by a mere instinct of self-preservationâ¦ until at last there had sprung into existence a great Ku Klux Klan, a veritable empire of the South, to prevent the Southern Country. (Wikipedia â Woodrow Wilson)" His intolerance of non-whites and unwillingness to move forward from the discriminatory practices of old is seen while he was at Princeton, where he refused to admit black students because he deemed their wish to be educated "unwarranted." (Wikipedia â Woodrow Wilson) How can a man be seen as a great progressive when he maintains the same idiotic prejudices espoused by Confederates? Maybe he was truly not as great and kind a person as he is sometimes portrayed to be. Following US entrance to the war came a number of acts passed by Wilson that impeded on Americans' right to assemble and their freedom of speech. In June 1917, two months after the declaration of war on Germany, Wilson passed the Espionage Act, which made action or information transfer against the US armed forces illegal and punished by a large fine and jail time. In 1918, at the behest of Wilson, Congress passed the Sedition Act, which prohibited any defamation of things American, such as the flag, government, and armed forces. That Wilson had the gall to pass such laws shows his close-mindedness and his lack of deference for the Constitution. Entering, and ultimately winning, the war on the side of the Allies was a mistake per the interests of America even at the time, but that decision also had a number of unintended but terrible consequences. By the time 1917 rolled around, Wilson did not have a good track record with regard to intervening in foreign conflicts. He had screwed up badly in Mexico by trying to help solve their leadership woes, and April 2nd, he stood before congress, asking them to allow the US army to help make the world âsafe for democracy.â Never mind the fact that Britain and France had huge colonial empires. Or that their generals were infamous for their squandering of precious human lives; Besides for losing hundreds of thousands of soldiers during a number of pointless offensive pushes (in one example, while following the orders of British general Douglas Haig to walk upright across the battlefield, 20,000 soldiers were killed in one day), they also had a policy of killing any soldier who was unwilling to go and die at the hands of the German enemy. The problem, though, with entering the war, is that the Allied victory and the ensuing penalties imposed on Germany by the treaty of Versailles are inexorably linked to the rise of Hitler and Nazism in Germany. Had the United States never entered the war, it would almost for certain have remained stalemated, at least until one of the sides sued for peace, or they came to a mutual agreement. Despite the Russian pullout and the ability to transfer a number of soldiers from eastern front, Germany was still deeply entrenched in the western front with no end in sight. They were also suffering horribly from the highly effective British blockade. Assuming they miraculously defeated the Allies on the western front it is unlikely that they would have been able to really taste their victory. The British would have remained independent based on the strength of their navy, and the uproar of nationalism in territories taken from Russia (which had originally wanted independence from them) and other countries probably would have overwhelmed the Germans. (Wilsonâs War, pg. 6) America had no real reason to enter the war. The 300,000 casualties it cost the country were certainly not worth the eventual consequences. The issue of how to punish the defeated countries was discussed in Paris in 1919. Wilson, ever the idealist, had proposed to Congress in January 1918 fourteen points that would help determine what should be done after the war. The first two points guaranteed that all âinternational understandingsâ should be made openly, and that there should be âAbsolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside territorial waters, alike in peace and in war.â His last point proposed the creation of âA general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.â His ideas sounded good and gave hope for the future. Unfortunately, they were not successfully put into practice. Wilson was too weak to stand up to the pressure put on him by French leader Georges Clemenceau and British PM Lloyd George. They (especially Clemenceau) wanted revenge from Germany. In the end, in stark contrast to the lenient measures of the 14 points that aimed to create stability in the region, sole guilt and full reparations were placed on Germany, who were astounded by the terms of the âpeaceâ and who felt betrayed by Wilson. They were also forced to cut down nearly all of their military. The severe economic depression that this forced Germany into, as well as the ignominious fall from glory, allowed for a man like Hitler â responsible for the death of millions â to rise to power. Maybe things would not have fallen out as they did if Wilsonâs 14th point â the League of Nations â would have worked out. Unfortunately, that turned out to be a bust as well. Instead of involving everyone, the League only incorporated those countries that were on the winning side of the war. The losers were left out. So in effect, the League of Nations, which promised mutual security and supported a reduction of arms, just turned out to be a one-sided alliance; sort of like the situation before World War One. The League also lacked a military force that would be capable of backing up its decisions. And one of the biggest problems â Congress didnât allow the US to enter. This supreme mess-up of Wilsonâs was, like with Princeton, due to his stubbornness. In the most recent elections, the Republicans had won control of Congress. Wilson, a Democrat, adamantly refused to bring a Republican with him to Paris, which surely would have aided the making of his case to Congress. So when it came time to ask congress to ratify US entry into the League, Wilson was shot down. Wilsonâs great idea failed; there was another war two decades later, and the League of Nations dissipated in 1946.</p>
<p>Woodrow Wilson can by no means by considered a hero. His decisions to pressure Russian into staying in the war and then for the US to enter the war directly led to numerous atrocities and horrors that occurred decades later. His intervention into a foreign war planted the seeds for other, destructive interventions later on. His 14 points were abandoned and his League of Nations bore no fruit. And not only was he an ineffective politician, but a bigoted one with little respect for the basic tenets of American society. Most of Wilsonâs intentions may have been noble, but the terrible consequences of his actions certainly cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>There is outrage in the Netherlands after paedophiles launched a political party to push for a cut in the legal age of consent. The Charity, Freedom and Diversity (NVD) party wants the age dropped from 16 to 12, before having it scrapped completely, and also wants child pornography and sex with animals to be legalised, sparking a massive backlash in the liberal country. The vast majority of the Dutch public now believe the government should step in and outlaw the group. One of the NVD's founders, Ad van den Berg, said: "A ban just makes children curious. We want to make paedophilia the subject of discussion. "We want to get into parliament so we have a voice. Other politicians only talk about us in a negative sense, as if we were criminals." But, right-wing politician Geert Wilders said he had asked the government to investigate whether a party with such "sick ideas" could really be established. And Kees van deer Staaij, a member of the Christian SGP party, also demanded action: "Paedophilia and child pornography should be taboo in every constitutional state. Breaking that will just create more victims and more serious ones." The NVD says toddlers should be given sex education and youths aged 16 and up should be allowed to appear in porn films and prostitute themselves. Sex with animals should be allowed although abuse of animals should remain illegal, it said. The party also said everybody should be allowed to go naked in public and promotes legalising all soft and hard drugs and free train travel for all.</p>

<p>GamingHours is a, currently, non-commercial <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game.html" title="Video game">video game</a> review site that caters for people that prefer to read small reviews. Set up in <a href="../../../m/a/r/March.html" title="March">March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, it has undergone several key design changes, and has changed direction in it's 'soft launch' year, merely using 2005/2006 to gather content and to settle on a design to enable a fully fledged 'hard launch' some time in the <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer.html" title="Summer">Summer</a> of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</p>

<p>In it's early guises the site used bulk-standard <a href="../../../h/t/m/HTML_4c4a.html" title="HTML">HTML</a> for the coding and design work, which didn't really fit the needs of a growing video game site, so it was moved to <a href="../../../p/h/p/Php.html" title="Php">php</a> during <a href="../../../a/u/g/August.html" title="August">August</a> of 2005.</p>
<p>The first design was a dull gray affair, with graphics done in MS Paint. This was soon corrected with a newer, whiter design to coincide with the launch of the php version of the site.</p>
<p>During the latter half of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the site experimented with a more child-friendly design, marking content suitability with the <a href="../../../p/e/g/PEGI_de7d.html" title="PEGI">PEGI</a> logos. However, this wasn't very well received, and the <a href="http://www.gaminghours.com" class="external text" title="http://www.gaminghours.com" rel="nofollow">current</a>design was created in <a href="../../../d/e/c/December.html" title="December">December</a> 2005.</p>
<p><br />
The scoring system on the site is used as guide only, and should not be taken as a final verdict as it is not comprised of breakdown scores, it is merely a 'feel' score.</p>
<p>The average score is between 75 and 85, with a slight weighting towards development time and graphics.</p>

<p>They are one of the few mouthbrooders in the marine world and they have been bred in capivity. The males generally do the incubating with the young being released after about a week. In the aquarium it has been possible to feed the babies on brine shrimp fry within 24 hours of their emergence from the males mouth. They have been known to use long spined sea urchins (Diadema setosum) as protection against predators.</p>

Travel Warning<br />
Hittite Empire<br />
Issued by Egypt Department of State<br />
Condoleezza Ramses, Advisor to the Pharaoh</p>
<p>This information is current as of today, Mon December 12, 1595 BC</p>
<p><br />
This is a travel warning for all Egyptians to avoid traveling to the Hittite Empire and all Hittite occupied areas. This warning is meant to persuade all Egyptians from having any contract with any Hittite people, especially Hittite soldiers. Hittites are extremely dangerous and they are known to attack, rape and kill Egyptian people. The Hittite attack of Babylon in 1595 BC shows that the Hittites are a dangerous people and Egyptian people must avoid them at all costs. Hittite soldiers killed thousands of men, women and children in Babylon. Do not go on vacation to Hittite empire because they will kill you. Do not let this happen to you and your family! Also Hittites raped women and slaughtered over 1000 innocent women and children plus their buffet line is horrible. Run away if you see the Hittites coming! Do not visit Syria because Hittites are planning to attack Syria. Hittite soldiers are extremely dangerous. They are experts in chariot warfare. Their chariots are much larger than Egyptian chariots. The chariots carry three soldiers. They use their chariots as an assault weapon to attack groups of unarmed civilians. They are masters of their large horses. Hittite soldiers are armed with spears, bows and arrows. You can expect to die if you come within 2000 paces of these soldiers. Most Hittite soldiers are not paid, rather they work for the loot; they are allowed to keep any items the can take from local populations. Hide all you valuables items when traveling near any Hittite area. How can you identify a Hittite? Hittite soldiers wear helmets and bronze scale armor. The marching soldiers carry long thrusting spears and short daggers for close killing. Another characteristic of the Hittite soldiers is their long hair. Our leader Ramses has called them the âeffeminate ones.â Do not be fooled by the long hair, they are savage killers. There is some doubt about the seriousness of this warning. Some remember false warnings about the Canaanites. Hittites are different; they are the most violent people in the world. You are smart to be afraid. In the past attacks on countries such as Babylon, 60 percent of the people the Hittites killed were women or children. Over 50 percent of the buildings and livestock were destroyed. The Hittites are very barbaric. If you go and visit the Hittites it is almost guaranteed they will attack or torture you because you are not on of them. According to General Seti, the Chief of the Egyptian Military, the Hittites are truly barbaric people. âMy troops were riding through Hattusia we had to make a stop when I came back the gold wheels on my chariot were gone, they are truly barbaric." Some officials predict that if you go to the Hittite kingdom men will killed and women will be raped. Children will be sold as slaves. If you try to resist or show any restraint your heart will be cut out. Thatâs why itâs best to stay in Egypt. In conclusion, all Egyptian are warned to stay away from the Hittite Empire. Do not travel there. Do not take you wives, families, slaves, goats, camels or cattle to the Hittite empire. They will easily murder you and then happily keep all your property. Consider yourself warned.</p>

<p>TÃTE DE MOINE cheese is a semi-hard cheese from the Swiss Romande region of Switzerland. Monks at the monastery of Bellelay first began to produce the cheese in 1192, but the name TÃTE DE MOINE has only been used since the end of the 18th century.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the cheese is not cut, but pared into rosettes by using a blade held at a right angle to the surface. However, since the 1980s and the invention of the "Girolle", a sort of paring apparatus, this process has become much easier. The reason for the strange cuts of cheese is to allow air to come into contact with the surface of this full-fat cheese, giving it a more flavourful and milky taste.</p>
<p>TÃTE DE MOINE can be found in supermarkets in Switzerland and is known as one of the traditional cheeses of the region.</p>

<p>Frank McHugh was born in Homestead, Pennsylvania on May 23, 1898. He was a popular character actor of the nineteen thirties and forties. He was best known for his entertaining and charming humor and for his unique (as he called it) one-two-three "ha-ha-ha" type of laugh.</p>
<p>Although usually a quiet man, his friends knew him to be a great storyteller. He had a knack for making people laugh.. Frank's parents owned their own stock company, so he spent his childhood traveling and acting with them. His father, "Cutie" McHugh had set the record for acting the longest amount of time in a single play. The McHugh's company toured around the country putting on a wide variety of plays ranging from comedy to drama and everything in between. Frank made his debut on the stage at the tender age of six. His siblings also acted in the troupe. His oldest brother, Jim, usually got the leading roles, while he and his younger siblings, Matt, Kitty and Eddie usually played the supporting parts. In his late teens, Frank joined the Marguerite Bryant Stock Company as the resident juvenile. After this, he continued to do stock theatre and travel the vaudeville circuit.</p>
<p>In 1925, he got his first role on Broadway in âThe Fall Guyâ. Later he traveled to London as the stage manager of James Gleason's hit play âIs Zat So?â. Upon his return from London, when he got back to New York his brother Jim gave him a welcome home party. At that party he met actor Pat O'Brien. At the time O'Brien was in the same stock company as his brother Jim. O'Brien was good friends with Jim, he was to become even closer friends with Frank. Soon after their first meeting Frank and O'Brien both got jobs in the play âTenth Avenueâ, in it was their mutual friend Spencer Tracy.</p>
<p>Frank's first venture into film came in 1928 with a Vitaphone short subject. Two years later, he headed out to Hollywood and was signed as a contract player for Warner Brothers. His first movie in Hollywood was âThe Dawn Patrolâ, starring Richard Barthelmess and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Frank played the small part of Flaherty, a World War I motorcycle messenger. A year and many small parts later he acted in the classic âThe Front Pageâ, the first of fourteen films he was to do with his friend Pat O'Brien. In 1932 he worked with two more of his close friends, Joan Blondell and James Cagney, in âThe Crowd Roarsâ. Frank reprised his role in the 1939 remake of âThe Crowd Roarsâ, âIndianapolis Speedwayâ, starring Pat O'Brien in Cagney's old role. McHugh, Cagney, and O'Brien were all to work together in the 1934 film, âHere Comes the Navyâ. In this film McHugh plays Cagney's friend and sidekick, as he was to do in many more Warner Brothers pictures. This trio worked together several more times. In 1936 McHugh got his first and only leading role in a movie in âThree Men on a Horseâ, playing a common greeting card writer, who gets kidnapped by three horse-racing gamblers. One of the three gamblers in the film was Allen Jenkins, who was to work with McHugh in a grand total of twelve movies over the years. By this time McHugh was a well-established character actor, known most for his touches of comedic relief in otherwise serious films. He continued to work hard at Warners.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, he had gotten married to a girl from Kentucky Dorothy Spencer. He remained married to her for the rest of his life. Together they had two sons and a daughter. Unfortunately one of their sons was later killed. McHugh's friends were there to support him in that time of tragedy.</p>
<p>In 1937, McHugh was in the documentary style Navy film âSubmarine D-1â. The next year he played the husband of one of the daughters in the extremely popular movie âFour Daughtersâ. He reprised this role in later sequels: âFour Wivesâ (1939) and âFour Mothersâ (1941). In 1939 McHugh starred in âThe Roaring Twentiesâ, with Cangey and Humphrey Bogart. Toward the beginning of the film, the story called for a reunion between Cagney and his friend McHugh. This scene was very dull as written in the script, so when McHugh suggested a different scenario for the scene the director quickly jumped at the idea, and it was McHugh's version that was filmed. In âThe Fighting 69thâ Frank once again suggested a scene that was used in the film. This time he devised the ending of the movie.</p>
<p>During World War II, his movie making slowed considerably, but he still kept himself busy. In 1942 he was a member of the Victory Caravan, which consisted of a large band of actors traveling across the country selling war bonds. Also during the war years he occupied a lot of his time making guest appearances on the popular radio shows of the day, including Bing Crosby's Kraft Music Hall radio show on NBC, where he was a frequent guest.</p>
<p>It was during this period that he broke ties with Warner Brothers and started working at various other studios. In 1944 he played one of his most popular roles, Father Timothy O'Dowd, in Paramount's Academy Award winning film, âGoing My Wayâ. In 1949 he was in âMighty Joe Youngâ, playing Robert Armstrong's assistant, Windy. Around this time his parts began to thin out even more. He was in the notable classic âThe Last Hurrahâ, with his old friends Spencer Tracy and Pat O'Brien in 1958. For the 1964-65 season McHugh was a regular on the Bing Crosby television show. He played Willis Walter, a friend of the Crosby family who is constantly imposing on them. Three years after The Bing Crosby Show. McHugh was to appear in his last movie âEasy Come, Easy Goâ as Captain Jack. After this he retired to Cos Cob, Connecticut. He died on September 11, 1981 at the age of eighty-three. Soon after his death, James Cagney said about his old friend, "Frank, dear Frank. Of all our gang, Frank was the funniest one, and the only people who saw him at his funniest were the boys down at The Players and The Lambs. He'd take those skinny little parts they gave him at Warners and make them little bits of comic genius. I saw him just a few days ago on television in the musical version of State Fair, a nothing part, and Frank made it bloom with his charm. An actor."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-01_c419.html" title="Edit section: Kevin Cahoon and the Ghetto Cowboy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kevin Cahoon and the Ghetto Cowboy</span></h2>
<p>Kevin Cahoon And the Ghetto Cowboy deliver explosive rock infused with glitter on their debut record, DOLL. The album features 8 original gritty rock songs written and performed by Cahoon backed by guitar, drums, bass and keys. The band has quickly become one of the most buzzed about new arrivals on New Yorkâs downtown music scene. Through live shows at venues such as Irving Plaza, CBGB's, Don Hill's and Ars Nova, among others, the group has demonstrated its command of all sorts of stages â from downtown rock nâ roll spots to some of the newest theater spaces in town. The pop, power and glam theatricality of their live events are captured for the first time on CD with this new studio recording.</p>
<p>DOLL is being released through Sh-K-Boom Records, a Sony/BMG distributed label, known to âbridge the gap between pop music and theater.â With a sound unique to what one might expect from a Broadway actor, Kevin Cahoon is quickly building a fan base in the indie music world, due to his live shows and abundance of press. Kevin Cahoon and his band Ghetto Cowboy have been heralded by New York Times, Time Out New York, and The Advocate, among others.</p>
<p>Kevin Cahoon &amp; Ghetto Cowboy and their CD have chalked up a number of kudos including four nominations at the 2006 OutMusic Awards including, Outstanding Debut Recording-male; Outstanding Music Video, Outstanding CD Graphic Design; and âDollâ as Out Song of the Year. The Onion (NY) and Pabst Blue Ribbon selected KC&amp;GC as band of the week in their âLive and Localâ Campaign and Mr. Cahoon received an honorable mention in Billboard Magazineâs World Songwriting Contest. Music from the CD has been heard in some interesting outlets. âFashionistaâ was featured on several runways during the last two Fashion Weeks in NYC, it has been played overhead for two months in Urban Outfitter stores nationwide and is currently in the top 50 for Sirius Satellite Radio / OutQâs Mid-Year Music Survey alongside tunes from such artists as Elton John, Rufus Wainwright and Scissor Sisters, among others.</p>
<p>Born and raised just outside of Houston, Kevin Cahoon first performed on the local rodeo circuit, as a rodeo clown. He wasted no time reaching the zenith of pop culture stardom for teenagers in the 80s- an appearance on "Star Search." He took the Junior Grand Championship in 1985 with a show tune (though he wonât tell which song he sang).</p>
<p>Kevinâs pistol power performances and raw theatrics on the rock nâ roll stage stem from his successful career on Broadway. After graduating from New York University, Cahoon was cast as a gang member in The Who's Tommy on Broadway, then originated the role of âEd the Hyenaâ in The Lion King. Other credits include The Rocky Horror Show, The Foreigner with Matthew Broderick, (Lortel Nomination), Chitty Chitty Band Bang as the âChildcatcherâ and the title role in Hedwig and the Angry Inch Off-Broadway and sit-downs in San Francisco, Boston and at the Edinburgh Festival. In fact, it was during Kevin's tour with Hedwig that he was inspired to realize his long-held ambition to front his own band. Cahoon is currently starring in The Wedding Singer, as âGeorge,â the scene-stealing Boy George-obsessed bandmate of Robbie Hart, New Jerseyâs favorite wedding singer and the showâs title character. The musical is based on the hit Adam Sandler movie.</p>

<p>In distribution it is important to manage inventory effectively as it is one of the largest assets. The two classic measurements are <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i><i>u</i><i>r</i><i>n</i><i>s</i></span> and Gross Margin Return on Investment (<span class="texhtml"><i>G</i><i>M</i><i>R</i><i>O</i><i>I</i></span>). The following equations are for a multi-warehouse set up where product transfers take place. Keep in mind that we are only dealing with product sold and transferred from stocking shelves, not sold direct from vendor or cross-docked. In the following, <span class="texhtml"><i>C</i><i>O</i><i>G</i><i>S</i></span> stands for Cost of Goods Sold (from stock), <span class="texhtml"><i>C</i><i>O</i><i>G</i><i>T</i></span> stands for Cost of Goods Transferred (from Stock), <span class="texhtml"><i>G</i><i>M</i></span> stands for Gross Margin Dollars for Stock Sales, and <span class="texhtml"><i>A</i><i>v</i><i>g</i><i>I</i><i>n</i><i>v</i></span> stands for Average Inventory Value (take starting inventory value for the period and average it with the ending, or take multiple snapshots and average them). Typically these values are based on a rolling 12 months.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="texhtml"><i>T</i><i>u</i><i>r</i><i>n</i><i>s</i> = (<i>C</i><i>O</i><i>G</i><i>S</i> + <i>C</i><i>O</i><i>G</i><i>T</i>) / <i>A</i><i>v</i><i>g</i><i>I</i><i>n</i><i>v</i></span></dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="texhtml"><i>G</i><i>M</i><i>R</i><i>O</i><i>I</i> = <i>G</i><i>M</i> / (<i>A</i><i>v</i><i>g</i><i>I</i><i>n</i><i>v</i> * <i>R</i>)</span> where <span class="texhtml"><i>R</i></span> is <span class="texhtml"><i>C</i><i>O</i><i>G</i><i>S</i> / (<i>C</i><i>O</i><i>G</i><i>S</i> + <i>C</i><i>O</i><i>G</i><i>T</i>)</span></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Note that if you only have one warehouse these equations reduce to the ones typically found on the World Wide Web since COGT will be zero.</p>
<p>The sweet spot for Turns depends on your Gross Margin Percent. Generally, the lower the GMP the higher the turns needed to be profitable. For a profitable general line industrial distributor a turn value of 5 is typical.</p>
<p>The sweet spot for GMROI is generally 1.25 to 1.75.</p>
<p>Note that if you have large differences in carrying cost across the product groups you distribute, then you will want to add a Carrying Cost Factor to AvgInv to properly compare product groups.</p>

<p>SOC is a specialised <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microbiological_medium.html" title="Microbiological medium">microbiological medium</a>, primarily used for culture of <i><a href="../../../e/s/c/Escherichia_coli.html" title="Escherichia coli">E. coli</a></i> after <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformation_%28genetics%29.html" title="Transformation (genetics)">transformation</a>, before <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agar_plate.html" title="Agar plate">plating</a>.</p>

<p>Born in 1979 in Flint Michigan, Joshua Nathaniel Strickland began singing in church at a young age, and in 1994 co-founded the contemporary Christian pop/rock duo LASTDAZ, who recorded and performed for the next five years, including notable performances at the Icthus (Wilmore KY), Crossroads (Shelby OH) and True Love Waits (Durand MI) music festivals.</p>
<p>In 1998 Strickland began a successful radio career at Michigan radio station "Z 92.5 The Castle," (WJSZ-FM) whose unique 'no-format' format would eventually be that of the 2005 nationwide buzz format commonly referred to as "JACK." "Jukebox Josh" was heard in markets throughout Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky until 2004 when he made the decision to incorporate his family name into his broadcasts.</p>
<p>In 2004, to coincide with the release of his first solo music project, entitled "July," "The Strickland Show" was launched on "Hot 96" (WSTO-FM) and at his official website, www.stricklandonline.com.</p>
<p>Strickland's "July," which is centralized around a divorce; he from his wife, that was finalized only 3 months prior to the release in July 2004, was succeeded in January 2006 by "On With The Story," the contents of which reference a variety of situations and scenereos, all unrelated to the subject matter of "July."</p>
<p>"41 Miles," the lead single from Strickland's "On With The Story," became a healing anthem for several Indiana and Kentucky towns following a sweep of devastating and deadly tornados in November of 2005. The song was written for one of the casualties, an 18 year old cheerleader in Boonville Indiana named Melinda Hadley.</p>
<p>"The Strickland Show" currently airs 2-6pm CST, weekdays on WSTO-FM. Strickland also hosts a special Sunday night program on "93.5 The Wolf" (WLFW-FM) from 6-12a CST under the alias "Joshua Nathaniel." Strickland has also used "JJ," "Josh Blank," and "Buckshot" as aliases in the past.</p>
<p>Strickland has won awards from the Associated Press and the Michigan Association of Broadcasters, including "Best Personality" in 2002. In 2005 Strickland was nominated for a Radio Music Award/Radio Megablast Award and WSTO-FM was nominated for Radio and Records CHR/Pop Station of the Year.</p>

<p>The episode starts out with Rock Lee and Maito Gai, who are about to start off a mission, supposedly one that is very hard. As the two of them go out, two other ninjas are shown, hiding in a tree. One is very fat and rather short; another is very skinny and lanky. The fat one says that now is the time to take down Lee and Gai, but the tall one says that a change in plan has been made. The tall one seems to be the leader, as the fatter one seems to call him "Big Bro".</p>
<p>When the sun rises, the two of them are shown again, but dressed exactly like Lee and Gai. (From here, the two of them are referred to as Fake Lee and Fake Gai, since their names are never given).</p>
<p>The two of them go into Konoha, and attract quite a lot of attention, since they do not look remotely like Gai and Lee, especially Fake Lee. However, the two of them seem unable to notice, and soon, the villagers return to their business. Fake Gai tells Fake Lee that since they are finally in Konoha, it is time to steal the secret information. Fake Lee states that now, their village (unknown) will finally be able to prosper, and the Fake Lee and Fake Gai both daydream of being welcomed as heroes back at their village. They quickly return to reality, and Fake Gai tells Fake Lee that Konoha has a Hokage as the leader, and they should find where he lives at a very noticeable building with the 'Fire' kanji on it. They find it, but Kakashi suddenly appears behind them, asking them what they are doing.</p>
<p>Kakashi pretends to be fooled by a distraction Fake Lee and Fake Gai do, but he actually follows them and finds out about their plans. Kakashi reports the incident to Tsunade, who seriously doubts if they are indeed ninja, as they used costumes rather than Henge no Jutsu (Transformation Technique). Shizune asks if they should expel the two, but Tsunade puts on an evil grin, saying that they should see what Fake Lee and Fake Gai do now that the two of them are in Konoha. Kakashi then leaves, saying that he merely thought he should report the incident, but also stating that nobody could possibly be fooled by the disguise.</p>
<p>Shift to Naruto, who has been fooled by the disguise, and asks Fake Lee and Fake Gai to train him in Taijutsu. Though the two fakes refuse at first, Naruto uses Harem no Jutsu, and puts Fake Gai so off balance that Fake Gai immediately agreed. The three of them are about to head off, when Tenten shouts to Fake Gai and Fake Lee out of her window. She tells them that they are supposed to be at a farm, and quickly drags them there, followed closely by Naruto.</p>
<p>At the farmhouse, the three of them are to help out the farmer. First, they must plant rice in a rice paddy. Not only is there lots of mud, since the land has been submerged in water, but there are also flying leeches in the water. Fake Lee gets attacked by one, and suffers from severe blood loss. Fake Lee and Fake Gai do barely anything, while Naruto, thinking that planting rice will give a good workout, does everything.</p>
<p>Next, the three of them are to fertilize the entire farm with manure that has been out for a long time. They are to carry them in buckets and then take them to the land. Fake Lee and Fake Gai could barely carry two large buckets on a pole, while Naruto has no trouble doing it alone. Fake Lee and Fake Gai could barely maintain their balance, but they tell Naruto that it is harder to move off-balance, which gets Naruto to do the same thing. However, Naruto keeps having one bucket right under Fake Gai's nose, and Fake Gai wants Naruto to stop. Naruto did not catch the entire sentence, and swings around to hear it all. However, the other bucket Naruto was carrying gets splashed all over Fake Lee and Fake Gai.</p>
<p>Fake Lee and Fake Gai wash themselves clean, while Naruto finished the rest of the work. At this time, Sakura comes, and wants Fake Gai and Fake Lee to get a piece of laundry that got blown to the top of a cliff. Though she was only asking, her tone and visage make it more of a threat. Fake Lee and Fake Gai thus had to climb all the way up. Naruto asks them why they don't use any chakra, but Fake Lee and Fake Gai tell Naruto that they are training their bodies, so Naruto copies them. Finally, Fake Lee and Fake Gai get to the laundry, and they grab hold of it. However, they used it like a parachute to get down, only they let go midway and fell on a tree.</p>
<p>Now, Tsunade comes, telling Fake Lee and Fake Gai that her companion is sick, and want Fake Lee and Fake Gai to help treat her companion. All four of them get to a clearing, where they see Katsuyu. Tsunade tells Fake Gai and Fake Lee to treat Katsuyu, and when they seem to chicken out, Tsunade reveals that she is the Hokage, and demands that Fake Lee and Fake Gai help. Seeing her scary personality, Fake Lee and Fake Gai help out, but Katsuyu keeps saying that she is quite sick, and spits out acid, barely avoiding Fake Lee and Fake Gai. Finally, Katsuyu separates into little slugs, all of which fall on Fake Lee and Fake Gai.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Fake Lee and Fake Gai crawl out of Konoha in crutches and bandages, only to see the real Gai and Lee. Fake Lee and Fake Gai had enough, and decide to fight Gai and Lee, but Gai and Lee easily won, kicking Fake Lee and Fake Gai out of Konoha. Seeing Fake Lee and Fake Gai fly out to the sky, Tsunade says that the little fun is over, and its back to work. She thanks Tenten and Sakura for their help, and Shizune remarks that Tsunade even summoned Katsuyu to help. Sakura and Tenten, however, are ashamed that Naruto actually fell for the two fakes' disguises.</p>
<p>Naruto catches up to the real Gai and Lee, and tells them that later, he will continue their Taijutsu training.</p>

<p>The McDonalds Steelers Trivia Challenge was taped on July 9th and 10th 2006. The show was hosted KDKA sports anchor Bob Pompeani. The show was very similiar to kdka's other show the KDKA Hometown High-Q. The show first aired on Saturday July 16th at 11:35 pm. The first season continued from the premiere until the championship game which aired before the first game of the Steelers 2006 Superbowl season against the Tennessee Titans.</p>
<p>18 teams were in the challenge. The games consisted of 3 teams per game. The winners of the first round advanced to the playoffs. In the playoffs the two winners plus the team with the next highest score all advanced to the final round.</p>
<p>The championship game consisted of Team Pittsburgh, One for the Dumb, and Cope A Nuts. The game ended with some controversy and during the quick snaps session of the game Team Pittsburgh answered a question correctly however it was ruled in correct. That 20 point difference is what gave One for the Dumb the small lead that allowed them to win the game despite a 100 point comeback in the final round by Team Pittsburgh. The question that caused the controvery was when Bob Pompeani read "What do the colors in the Steelers logo mean". However the written question was "What does EACH color in the Steelers logo mean?". Team Pittsburgh answered Ore, Coal, and Steel Scrap which was the correct answer, however the producers asked for a more specific answer to which they deemed incorrect. During the taping the questions were not presented upon the monitors at each teams podium. There were several questions throughout the series that were read differently than they were written which caused some confusion in the show. Another example of a misread question was during playoff game 1 during the Opening Drive segment where Bob Pompeani read "Who did the Steelers trade to move up in the draft to get Troy Polamalu?" However the Steelers did not actually trade any players at all, they simply traded draft picks. The question that appeared on the screen actually read "Who did the Steelers trade up with in the draft to select Troy Polamalu?" That question is more correct since it asks what team, not which player. The last major mistake during the game was during the No Huddle Offense which is the final segment of the show. In episode 3 of round 1 Bob Pompeani asked "During Superbowl XXX who was the intended target on Neil O'Donnell's second interception? The Meatballs buzzed in with 15 seconds left and only 25 points behind, however Bob Pompeani never stated which team buzzed in until approximately 5 seconds left in the game. Despite missing the question, it did not allow time for the Meatballs to have an opportunity to answer more questions as the timer ran out.</p>
<p>Season Two of the McDonald's Steelers Trivia show is set to debut its second season sometime in July 2006 and run until the first week of the Pittsburgh Steelers Season.</p>

<p>How oft, O how oft?</p>
<p>For here we are once again at Great Charles, seat of the Dukes of Charleyville, twelve centuries incumbent, Royal Knights of the Pricklyhose.</p>
<p>How oft at dusk have we heard the cooing of doves in the belfry, the shriek of amorous peacocks in the maze, the clamour of copper pots in the scullery, the contented snuffle of steeds in the stable? The lowing of kine in the meadow, the keening of hounds in the kennel? The breeze in the topiary, the wheeze of a weathervane, the cluck of a lost pheasant? The clack of a croquet mallet, the creek and fizz of two ice cubes, the plosh of a tennis ball in the swimming pool? The svelte growl of a Ducati, the demur hum of a Bentley, the crunch of a coach and four in the driveway? The laboured breathing of a grandfather clock, the thud of a dud piano, the gamelan of ancient plumbing? The swish of fur on parquet, the rap of stiletto on marble, the rustle of hips in taffeta? Or the tiny ballet of dust motes caught very quietly circling by the westering sun in the drawing room?</p>
<p>How oft, O how oft?</p>

<p>There has been minor speculation about what exactly the song means. Some think of it as a <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> club anthem, while a few know its actual lyrical significance. Contrary to popular belief, it is poking fun at how people go to clubs wearing fake "designer" outfits ("Bucci" bag), thinking they are "hot stuff", but they really don't look as good as they think.</p>

<p>The Voice for Europe campaign is a civil initiative running in several European countries. It is organised by associations and movements which share a common interest in preserving and deepening the values of the free and democratic Europe. As stated in key European documents and charters, these values are, among others: respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, rule of law, human rights, pluralism, tolerance, solidarity and equality between women and men. We believe that any further enlargement of the European Union should be based on these commonly shared values.</p>
<p>Todayâs Europe has its roots in the rationalism of ancient Greece, in the notion of law of ancient Rome and in the tradition of Judaistic and Christian culture. Humanism, Reformation and Enlightenment have contributed to accomplishing the freedoms we enjoy today.</p>
<p>The European civilization and its values have developed through thousands of years therefore it is worth protecting and cultivating this heritage. Countries not supporting European values should not be invited to join the EU.</p>
<p>Our objectives We raise public interest in short-term as well as long-term European issues. We work towards solutions and strategies concerning these issues.</p>
<p>Our activities</p>
<ul>
<li>We organise public discussions and conferences about European issues</li>
<li>We inform citizens about important topics that need to be addressed</li>
<li>We encourage politicians to support the protection and cultivation of European values in our countries</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Campaign Turkeyâs membership in the European Union would significantly complicate and most probably prevent finding a consensus on the further shape of the EU. We decisively disapprove not only the accession of Turkey to the European Union, but also the very commencement of the accession talks. On 17th December 2004 our governmentsâ representatives have decided to open these talks on October 3rd, 2005. We are convinced that the citizens of Europe would face severe social and economic problems if Turkeyâs accession is completed. The aim of our Voice for Europe campaign is to block the start of the accession talks in October.</p>
<p>During the campaign, signatures for a petition against Turkeyâs accession are collected throughout the countries of the EU. We are creating a broad pan-European alliance of associations, movements, civil initiatives and individuals, politicians, notable personalities and different political parties, who unanimously oppose the accession of Turkey to the EU.</p>
<p>We want to invite our European fellow citizens, providing them with an opportunity to join our common Voice for Europe.</p>
