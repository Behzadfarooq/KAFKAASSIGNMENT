<ul>
<li>Eddie, if you have some kind of reference, just post it already. Stop yacking about it and do it. Most of us would change our votes if you would verify and source it. As it is, you're running out of time. Either put up some sources, or let it go. Bringing all these puppets in to back you up is only hurting your cause. Also, pronouns like "you" and "me" are not capitalised unless they start a sentence. Stop editing other people's writing to make them capped when they shouldn't be.

<li>No Eddie, you don't need to scan the page. You need to give us a standard bibliographical reference, preferably with page numbers. No scanning required, and you can't host such a scan on Wikipedia anyway.

<li>No, I have not heard of the word "exicornt" before because it is obviously very localised and perhaps only spoken by you and your closest compatriots given that other people here, including (verifiably) other Wikipedians, especially transport-interested ones, are siding with the delete camp. We would be willing to include the page if you could verify it, which is why we need the bibliographical references for this book you claim it's in. If you can provide these references and these references can be verified, I would be more than happy to change my vote to "Keep". However, I'm sure I can speak for many fellow people on this thread that I find it suspicious you are not giving an explicit bibliographical reference, which is far easier than a scan (which turns out to be against the rules anyway). As it turns out, the term doesn't appear in the cited website. I suspect you might be clutching at straws to keep this article here. Those straws are breaking fast. -<a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELichYoshi_2634.html" title="User:LichYoshi">LichYoshi</a> 10:13, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You misunderstand Me. I've used that term long before I created the page to describe such switches when talking about subway lines. Since only a few people (and <i>not</i> My friends or My family but people that know subway terminology. I felt it was necessary to create this page so the reader knows exactly what I am talking about when I use the word. I didn't create this page in bad faith, or to drive people crazy and have people talk about whether or not we should keep the page or delete it. Consider this, a few years ago, hardly anyone knew what a "blog" was. Today people say "blog" instead of "journal" because someone came along and defined the word. It's the same with this word.—<a href="../../../e/d/d/User%7EEddieSegoura_9794.html" title="User:EddieSegoura">EddieSegoura</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/d/User_talk%7EEddieSegoura_2ef5.html" title="User talk:EddieSegoura">talk</a>) 4:26 AM, November 23, 2005 (EST)

<dd>If you have the book <a href="http://nyctrackbook.com" class="external text" title="http://nyctrackbook.com" rel="nofollow">Tracks of the NYC Subway</a> you can check for a reference. The correct spelling word "Exicornt" might be different. BestBuy25 01:39, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I looked through quite a few pages of the book available online at <a href="http://nyctrackbook.com/updates.html" class="external free" title="http://nyctrackbook.com/updates.html" rel="nofollow">http://nyctrackbook.com/updates.html</a> and it seems to stick to terms like "crossover" and "double crosover".

<dd>I couldn't find it in the online version either, so I emailed Pete Dougherty, the author of the book, and asked him if he knows it to be a legitimate rail switch term. Sarah Ewart 02:43, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> It would be interesting to find out if the two previous edits originated from the Brooklyn NY store. They were open at 5am EST today (early for holiday shopping) and according to the timestamps, those two edits would have been made at 5:45 and 6:13 AM EST, respectively (Hi Eddie!). Unfortunately, the IP block appears to resolve to HQ, so there's no way to tell right away. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> 12:41, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> According to Eddie's user page, he works ~1 mile away from the <a href="../../../b/e/s/Best_Buy_c40e.html" title="Best Buy">Best Buy</a> store, and this can be shown on mapquest. However, for Eddie's own personal security, I would like it if someone could discourage him from posting the name of his workplace on his user page. I'm worried that someone might take advantage of this information and cause trouble for him. I've already told him not to post personal information, but he won't listen to me. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> 10:53, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>. Just to put an end to Eddie's "Exicornt" quest and his claim that the cited book on New York subways refers to exicornts, I have received an email from Pete Dougherty, the author of the book, which states in part: " I can tell you without hesitation that until your e-mail, I'd never heard "exicornt" ever used in any context and I doubt that it is even a word." He then goes on to say that the only possible use he can think of for the word would be as a location indicator, where exicornt is the name of a road, or other location. He then emphasises again that he had never even heard of the word until he received my email. Sarah Ewart 23:05, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
