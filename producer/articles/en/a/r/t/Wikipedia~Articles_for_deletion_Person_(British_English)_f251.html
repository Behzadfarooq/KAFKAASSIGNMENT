<p>I am also nominating for deletion: Person (American English)</p>
<p>In the original article <a href="../../../p/e/r/Person.html" title="Person">Person</a>, now redirected to Person (American English),<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">User:Lucy-marie</a> globally altered every occurence of the word 'persons' to 'people' and every occurence of 'personhood' to 'being a people', making nonsense of a sensible article. Her grounds for doing this were: "(persosns is an icorrect grammar pluralisation it is people or a person or a person's rights and carried out a clean up)". I pointed out the error, and reverted. Lucy-marie refused to accept she was wrong and reverted. On the discussion page (now at Talk:Person (American English)) I started a Request for Comment. <s>The only supporter of Lucy-marie has been a friend of hers.</s> One contributor suggested, jokingly, that two separate pages be made, one for American English and one for British English. Lucy-marie has now unilaterally declared the Request for Comment process closed and has totally unnecessarily created these two pages, blanked the original <a href="../../../p/e/r/Person.html" title="Person">Person</a> page and turned it into a Redirect. At the top of the Discussion page for each article, she has written "This page was created entirley to resolve a dispute over persons or poeple". The dispute has not been resolved. I am proposing the deletion of these two pages and the restoration of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Person.html" title="Person">Person</a> until the Request for Comment discusssion is properly concluded. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 10:34, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Just a reminder to readers that this is not, strictly speaking, a fork over grammar but more basically whether there is or is not such a word as <b>persons</b> in British or any other form of English. I have provided dictionary quotes before on the relevant Discussion page, but here is a direct quote from Chambers Online Dictionary, about as British as it gets. I think this clinches it:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>"<b>person</b> <i>noun</i> (<i><b>persons</b></i> or in sense 1 also <i><b>people</b></i>) <b>1</b> an individual human being. <b>2</b> the body, often including clothes • <i>A knife was found hidden on his person</i>. <b>3</b> <i>grammar</i> each of the three classes into which pronouns and verb forms fall, <b>first person</b> denoting the speaker (or the speaker and others, eg <i>I</i> and <i>we</i>), <b>second person</b> the person addressed (with or without others, eg <i>you</i>) and <b>third person</b> the person(s) or thing(s) spoken of (eg <i>she, he, it</i> or <i>they</i>). <b>4 (Person)</b> <i>Christianity</i> any of the three forms or manifestations of God (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) that together form the <b>Trinity</b> (sense 2). <b>5</b> <i>in compounds</i> used instead of <i>-man, -woman</i>, etc, to denote a specified activity or office, avoiding illegal or unnecessary discrimination on grounds of sex, eg in job advertisements • <i>chairperson</i> • <i>spokesperson</i>. Compare <b>chairman, chairwoman</b>, <i>etc</i>. <b>be no respecter of persons</b> to make no allowances for rank or status. <b>in person 1</b> actually present oneself • <i>was there in person</i>. <b>2</b> doing something oneself, not asking or allowing others to do it for one."</p>

<p>This is a definition from the online dictionary of the word people.<br />
1.persons indefinitely or collectively; persons in general: to find it easy to talk to people; What will people think?<br />
2. persons, whether men, women, or children, considered as numerable individuals forming a group: Twenty people volunteered to help.<br />
3. human beings, as distinguished from animals or other beings.<br />
4. the entire body of persons who constitute a community, tribe, nation, or other group by virtue of a common culture, history, religion, or the like: the people of Australia; the Jewish people.<br />
5. the persons of any particular group, company, or number (sometimes used in combination): the people of a parish; educated people; salespeople.<br />
6. the ordinary persons, as distinguished from those who have wealth, rank, influence, etc.: a man of the people.<br />
7. the subjects, followers, or subordinates of a ruler, leader, employer, etc.: the king and his people.<br />
8. the body of enfranchised citizens of a state: representatives chosen by the people.<br />
9. a person's family or relatives: My grandmother's people came from Iowa.<br />
10. (used in the possessive in Communist or left-wing countries to indicate that an institution operates under the control of or for the benefit of the people, esp. under Communist leadership): people's republic; people's army.<br />
11. animals of a specified kind: the monkey people of the forest. –verb (used with object)<br />
12. to furnish with people; populate<br />
13. to supply or stock as if with people: a meadow peopled with flowers.<br />
So according to the above definition it can be used to represent a collective and according to the first defintion it can be used to represnt individuals so therefore it can be used to reprersnt both.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 19:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
