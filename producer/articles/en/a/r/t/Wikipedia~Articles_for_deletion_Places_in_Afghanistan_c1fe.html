It's long, obviously, but that's no reson to get rid of it. It just needs sorting into sublists. (And I say <i>just</i> in its loosest sense.) The need for this list would ideally be obviated by categories, but since there are few articles on Afghan places that's not going to happen right now. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowerparty_4b7e.html" title="User:Flowerparty"><font color="#CCDDDD">Flowerparty</font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFlowerparty_6764.html" title="User talk:Flowerparty"><sup>talk</sup></a> 01:42, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, atlases and almanacs are the place for lists of places, not encyclopedias. And this list doesn't even separate them into types of places or give populations; it's just a list, that doesn't even link to anything. Category:Places in Afghanistan, sure. This page, no.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 07:42, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>It is an index. Thus it helps people find things. An encyclopedia without an index isn't overly useful. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 07:44, 21 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not an index, because an index links to things that are in the book. It's not an index, because the function of an index is to help you find things where you don't expect them, and if these articles did exist, they would exist right where you expect them. Not only that, the search box elimenates most of the need for an index, and what's left is mostly handled by Category pages...and as I said, a category page would work just fine.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 08:04, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Incorporating elements of" is different from being an almanac.

<li>Right now, we have a list with a crap load of places in Afganistan. But how many people would be able to list so many places in Afganistan, if we delete this, we may never have a list as comprehensive again.

But, the secondary list is *easily* justified compared to the endless mass of lists for North American communities.

<li><b>Comment</b> I just went through the A's and checked the links. Most were blue only because the incorrectly pointed to non-related extant articles (as mentioned by 80.255). Most of the rest are only one-liners in disambiguation pages that I added.

<li><b>Delete</b> Unless some of the "cities" have pages created for them that are actually relevent.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wonderful article. I regard the English Wikipedia as the <i>World Wikipedia</i>, and our goal must be to cover every place in Afghanistan.

<li>They may not remain red links for long. If they are expanded. I do not recollect a rule in wikipedia where a page is deleted if it has too many reds. Because it's a transitory phenomenon.

<li><b>Comment</b>&#160;: I had a thought regarding the use of categories. We could use categories and do something very similar to what this page is doing. What are your thoughts&#160;? For example, create stubs for each of the cities mentioned in the page and categorize them as "Cities in Afghanistan". Would that not be more intuitive&#160;?
