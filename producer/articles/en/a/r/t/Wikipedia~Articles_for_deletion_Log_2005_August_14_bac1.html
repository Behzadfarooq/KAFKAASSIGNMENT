The example of <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Burr_puzzle_4f55.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Burr puzzle">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Burr puzzle</a> should have served as a caution that you overreached your mandate.<br />
<br />
To recap what I wrote on your talk page, suppose there are three types of articles:
<ol>
<li>My Stupid Book (mystery novel), a spam page</li>
<li>unsolved mystery novel</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_novel.html" title="Mystery novel">mystery novel</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>then pages of type 1 above are obvious VfDs, pages of type 3 are not (generic term), while pages of type 2 are debatable: is "unsolved mystery novel" a generic term and subcategory of "mystery novel", or is it a neologism coined by the user? The point is, that's precisely the sort of thing a VfD is supposed to sort out: people research it and Google it and present their conclusions in a VfD vote. The current article in question <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neat_tiling.html" title="Neat tiling">Neat tiling</a> seems to be of type 2 above: is it a neologism invented by Karl Scherer, or is it a generic term in general use among the puzzle-solving community? Such a VfD debate can now take place at last, on this page.<br />
<br />
However, you presented your original Vfd in a careless way, or perhaps even a deceptive way if you had done it deliberately: you listed only pages of type 1 above in the VfD itself and buried the pages of type 2 and type 3 within a very long listing (200 articles!) on a completely separate page (never mentioning them on the VfD page itself) that most voters probably never looked at. It was just flat out wrong to lump pages of entirely different categories into one humungous VfD whose presentation incorrectly implied that all the pages to be deleted were of type 1 above (obvious deletion candidates).<br />
<br />
This was a procedural error in the original VfD —it is questionable whether a page was duly deleted if it was never even mentioned on any VfD page. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 02:20, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Google Is Not Science (tm), nor should it be the centre of VfD. 35/61 - either way, less than 100 is 'not much internet presence'/'usually has different name'.

<li>Curps, I read the VfD, and I think you're mistaken -- Neat tiling clearly appears on the list attached to the VfD, which was discussed at the time. Even if you are correct, though, the right thing to do would have been to list Neat Tiling on VfU and discuss the procedural flaws there. Instead, now we're caught in a twisty little maze of procedural violations, all different. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 15:59, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes it was, everyone was pointed to the category in the 3rd of the 3 opening paragraphs, the issue of whether all the items in the category counted as well as those in listed in the list that was "includes <b>but isnt limited to</b>" was discussed <i>at length</i> in the VFD itself, and the result was delete ALL. And it didn't go through WP:VFU so re-creating it is an abuse of process, and it should be speedy re-deleted. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> ( ! | ? | * ) 15:48, 14 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nandesuka, appearing "on the list attached to the VfD" (actually, an entirely separate page) is not the same as actually appearing at the top of the VfD page itself. Many voters undoubtedly never even looked at that page, and took their cue from the writeup at the top of the VfD page itself, which, intentionally or not, only listed egregious spam pages and failed to explicitly mention pages like <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neat_tiling.html" title="Neat tiling">neat tiling</a> or <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lock_puzzle.html" title="Lock puzzle">lock puzzle</a>, etc. This was procedurally flawed: the process was biased in a way to delete pages that in many cases would have survived their own individual VfD (as <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Burr_puzzle_4f55.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Burr puzzle">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Burr puzzle</a> and the ongoing <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Interlocking_puzzle_c468.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Interlocking puzzle">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Interlocking puzzle</a> show). So as I've said I don't believe the original VfD validly applied to this page. But fair enough, to avoid procedural snafus I'll use VfU for such cases in the future. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 16:49, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because the article contains totally original research - it is called "continuous tesselation" because it is "continuous" and a "tesselation", in the same way that a "red cow" is called that because it is "red" and a "cow", but that doesn't warrent the article [[red cow]] existing. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> ( ! | ? | * ) 23:16, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You can't assert something has been made up on the spot, and has a 'correct mathematical term', that's patent nonsense.

There might be correct names for things that <a href="../../../u/n/u/Ununhexium.html" title="Ununhexium">don't exist</a>, but there certainly aren't correct names for things that haven't been thought of. But seeing as people have been tessellating for thousands of years, I doubt very much whether this definition was first used by a C20 puzzler.

Grünbaum and Shephard, <i>Tilings and Patterns,</i> W.H. Freeman and Company, 1987, which I consider the most authorative references on the mathematical theory of tilings, defines <i>edge-to-edge tilings</i> on page 18. This addresses Ril's concern that <i>neat tiling</i> is a neologism. I don't care that much about the other concern, that it was undeleted improperly: our goal is to write an encyclopeadia. I could not find <i>neat tiling</i> nor <i>continuous tessellation</i> in either MathSciNet or the book, so I'm curious where Ril got this term from. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 13:35, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

It's possible that puzzle hobbyists use a different term than mathematicians, which could be solved by using redirects.

<li><b>Delete</b> for two reasons. Firstly, it was deleted in accordance with a vote on VfD. I'm as unhappy about the mass listing on VfD as other people are, but since it's clear that there's no clear consensus, we should follow policy and take it to VfU first. (In fact, it would be nice if some admin (<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a>?) could go through <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Zillions_games_list_f54f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Zillions games/list">Ril's list from the mass deletion</a>—I'd like to acknowledge -Ril- for making the list available, since it's been helpful in the ensuing discussion—and look for other articles which aren't the Zillions spam they were accused of being, to list on VfU.)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, the article is no more than a definition and consensus seems to be that the most standard terminology is not <i>neat tilings</i> but <i>edge-to-edge tilings</i> for which we have a standard reference (Grünbaum and Shephard). (By consensus I mean both <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a>, above, and <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_Myers_adb9.html" title="User:Joseph Myers">Joseph Myers</a> in <a href="../../../t/i/l/Talk%7ETiling_17f7.html#Terminology" title="Talk:Tiling">Talk:Tiling#Terminology</a>.) It doesn't seem that we'd lose a great deal by deleting the article. When we have an article on <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edge-to-edge_tiling.html" title="Edge-to-edge tiling">edge-to-edge tilings</a>, then we can put in a redirect—because I'm sure I <i>have</i> seen the term <i>neat tilings</i> in a recreational mathematics book, and besides, redirects are cheap. —<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 11:25, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would be important to identify just how Kutenai construct sexuality and what westerners would call transsexuality/transgenderism. Every Native group does so differently. "Berdache" (being a western term, anyway) and "two-spirit" (a term used by one particular group whose name escapes me and since generalized) probably don't cut it particularly well and the tribe's own designation would be preferable. - <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontrealais_bf21.html" title="User:Montrealais">Montréalais</a> 15:33, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

"Would I be wrong to assume that a verifiable transexual prophetess influential in the white population in Massachusetts at the same time would have been kept without discussion?"

<li>A high Amazon sales rank is important for the notability of a work aimed at popularity, but a low sales rank is completely irrelevant for the significance of academic publications. And as I pointed out in <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_A._F._Gotch_43bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/A. F. Gotch">the other discussion</a>, Gotch was clearly not an academic in the sense Edsforth is, and his books appear to have no scientific value; three of them, with almost identical titles, were popular books on the Latin names of animals, and one of these was deemed "virtually useless" by a reviewer in an academic journal. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 15:14, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is currently no assertion of critical importance of Edsforth's work in his article, if there were I agree that sales would be far less relevant. I suggest that without some assesment of an academic's work, there's no reason they should be given an easier ride on the sales front than a writer of popular fiction - university press is only one step from vanity press. You did a good job on digging up a review of Gotch's book, presumably some journal somewhere that will say <i>Class Conflict and Cultural Consensus: The Making of a Mass Consumer Society in Flint, Michigan</i> is notable despite miserable sales compared to <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_%26_Me_fedd.html" title="Roger &amp; Me">Roger &amp; Me</a> or other popularist work. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 18:25, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it is fair to say that there are two (or more) sides to this and every story, and this article only addresses one of them. Yes, I will agree that there is evidence of abuse by the HK police, but I am sure that it is contested. I dont think you will disagree that it is a blatantly one sided article which is clearly opposed to the HK police. If you have evidence concerning this topic, try and present it in a neutral fashion. I suggest that you create a section on the Hong Kong police article entitled "Alleged human rights abuses by the Hong Kong police" and quote Amnesty International and the other organizations that criticize the HK police there. Please see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> for more information on writing in the neutral point of view.

<dd>I actually agree. I have tried to talk to this user about merging the article, but they do not seem to see how a POV artcle is unacceptable, I do think they even see this as POV (keeps saying sbuse is "well documented"). I think since the user put in so much work, we should try to add a section to Hong Kong Police entitled "Alleged Human Rights Abuses" with the content (re-written of course) from this article.

The author is undeniably notable, but I don't think the book is.

<p>I am a devoted fan of punk, ska, and rockabilly, and there are indeed many bands that mix these styles, but I have never heard any of them refer to themselves as "skunkabilly." The original page was clearly a joke, containing bizarre rules for how you can be included in this genre ("following Hammurabi's Code," for example), and I nominated it for speedy deletion. However, this suggestion was shot down based on the fact that the term has many Google hits. But googling for this shows no results for an actual genre of music - all the hits seem to be usernames on message boards. The closest I can find is a non-notable indie record label called "Skunkabilly Records," which signs ska, punk, and rockabilly bands, but never refers to the music as "skunkabilly." I removed the joke bits from the article, but that still doesn't make it an actual punk subgenre.</p>

<dd>Granted, it can be difficult to "prove" notability in a borderline case, but most people would be willing to agree that someone is notable if an article can cite references from trustworthy sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well-written article. The lawsuit raises important contemporary issues. I am inclined to vote keep, but will first try my informal test: I'm going to look her up in an online database, to which I have access courtesy of my local public library, that contains the full content of The New York Times. If she is mentioned, I will vote keep. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:27, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> New York Times, July 28, 2005, p. 3, "An Online Artist Challenges Obscenity Law." She has had pictures <i>in</i> shows that have gotten brief news-item notices in The New York Times: September 5, 2003 p. 30, ""BOYS OF SUMMER," ClampArt... Standing out among the crowd of pictures by more than two dozen photographers ... men in leather, by Barbara Nitke...".I don't know whether it's the same person or not, but there have also been pictures published <i>in</i> The New York Times that have been <i>credited</i> to someone named Barbara Nitke, e.g. "Photo: Moira, left, with her dogs, Roxy and Tooter, on the documentary series 'Showdog Moms &amp; Dads.' (Photo by Barbara Nitke/Bravo)", March 30, 2005, p. 3. Finally, I don't accept the "professor test," but she <i>is</i> a professor, and being president of the Camera Club of New York together with the other things would seem to make her clearly more notable than the average professor. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:27, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you don't want to keep this, why are you voting for a keep? It's hardly logical to make the cruftiness of others persuade you to vote differently.

<li>So as long as someone makes really big articles, it should be kept, no matter how useless or relativly obscure it can be? The Simpsons are very notable, but Simpsons TV ads are not. And I'm saying this as a quite devoted (though early season-orthodox) Simpson fan myself. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 15:16, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't think anyone is saying that "as long as someone makes really big articles, it should be kept, no matter how useless or relativly obscure..." I could write quite a lengthy missive on the lint that collects between my toes when I wear argyle socks, and even put in tables and pictures and so forth - but my toe lint is not regularly broadcast on TV, nor is it familiar to millions of people. Some TV commercial campaigns are notable, and those featuring the cast of The Simpsons tend to fall into that category. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 15:53, August 16, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'll concede that they might be individually <i>notable</i> (a lot of things are notable), but they are not encyclopedic by any reasonable or useful definition of the term. It's still fancruft and the only ones that will come looking for it here are Simpsons-nuts; a very good reason to transwiki to a dedicated Simpsons-wiki. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 16:14, 16 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I'm not a Simpsons nut, and I find it useful to have here. In any event, it is surely better to have this list than to have individual articles on each ad (which another editor had begun to do), and it takes no more of Wikipedia's space to have this article than to have the same information included in the already overly large list of episodes (where it was previously). As my father would say, it can't hurt and it might help. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 18:29, August 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The purpose is to "<i>discuss administrators</i>"?! This may have something to do with Ril's recent RFC against Uninvited Company and his ongoing arbitration case involving me and some other admins. This sounds like Witkacy's Black Book to me, and I don't like it one bit. The funny thing is that non-admins, indeed Ril himself, frequently comment on the Administrators' noticeboard. I'm not sure it would be appropriate for me to vote here because of the arbcom case, but it is obvious to me that Ril's disruption is getting worse, not better. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 08:30, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

The follow up posting was made by a fan of the game who happens to work in the BBC (where we've been beta-testing for the last month). This was unauthorized and made without the knowledge of anyone in the Jamie Kane Team or BBC Marketing. To confirm: the BBC would never use Wikipedia as a marketing tool. We hope you enjoy the game:-) Team Jamie</i></p>
<p>As a side issue: how on earth would "the BBC" (more exactly, "Team Jamie") know who made the initial entry? Have they provided a source for their reassurance upon this point? Most reputable news organizations are expected to verify facts with two independent sources. Are we expected to take them at their word simply because they are the BBC? Unless we've divulged our IP logs to them - which we certainly should not have done - they are in no position to state anything whatsoever about the identity of the person who created the first article - except perhaps that no one on "Team Jamie" admits to it. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:10, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please note that the first revision of the article (supposedly created by Jon_Hawk) did contain a weak note (bottom of the page) about this being a fictional page. While the original article was bad in most (or all) aspects, I do not believe it was done as part of an advertising campaign - more likely a person who is familiar with the game and conceived the fictional character as notable created the article in much the same spirit as most "StarTrek", "Doom" or "Halo" articles which treat the material as a matter of fact and only weakly note their fictional nature. 62.90.49.87 10:53, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What note are you talking about? As far as I can tell, Jon_Hawk's material was all fake presented as real.

<li><b>keep</b>. When suitably marked as "fictional&#160;: accuracy disputed", and re-written to explain the fictional use, this (a) shows how fast, intelligently and effectively Wikipedia can respond to such silly marketing tricks and remain on higher ground, by simply exposing the truth rather than getting caught up in silly games. Also, (b) it largely destroys (or at least, can be written to counter) the viral marketing goals, if that is indeed why it was created. In this sense, it can be used to explain to the exact demographic who are being taken in by the fictional game, why this conflicts with the goals of Wikipedia. Lastly (c), if other marketers see the above process, and realise playing tricks with wikipedia will run a high risk of damaging their brand, rather than creating a "cool, viral" edge, then they will be less likely to abuse it in the future. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintywalker_29f8.html" title="User:Mintywalker">mintywalker</a> 10:54, 14 August 2005 (BST)

<li>I disagree. Keeping the article purely to point out that its fictional viral marketing and how evil it is would be a POV, and go against the principles of Wikipedia as a source of knowledge, not a source of comentary. The best thing is to simply remove viral marketing as it appears. It should be noted that keeping the marketing, but noting it as marketing, does not reduce the marketing impact. Infact, this whole debate simply gains more 'eyes' on the BBC which was the intent. So I feel it should be quickly directed to a deletion. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarberio_8f89.html" title="User:Barberio">Barberio</a> 10:15, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've edited without mercy and done a <b>complete rewrite from sources</b> about the actual game, rather than about the eponymous character within the game, providing the "article on the BBC's game that this character is from" that <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDayv_afc0.html" title="User:Dayv">Dayv</a> (and <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a>, and <a href="../../../m/h/o/User%7EMholland_48ad.html" title="User:Mholland">Mholland</a>) mentions above. The list of sources given in the references section indicates that this game has received some news media and other coverage over the past year. Whilst the original fake biography of a fictional character may qualify as viral marketing, the current straight summary of primary and secondary sources (some of them critical) dealing with a venture by the BBC into the world of interactive fiction does not. Furthermore, better this than a repeated succession of silly stubs about the fictional character written by players of the game over the next few months repeatedly being deleted (which, based upon past experience, is what would likely happen if the article were deleted). <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:15:10, 2005-08-15 (UTC)

<li>It is true that any company can create a game web site.

Assuming you have read the discussion, it is clear this is a complete re-write and I can't see how this article originated from the Boy*d Upp article. Generally, the BBC has a massive amount of resources to wield at its disposal and would neither need to nor resort to relying on an open-content encyclopedia to funnel traffic to their website! In any case, Wikipedia is not a website frequented primarily by 14-18 year old girls and thus any advertising effects is minimal. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintchocicecream_dfbe.html" title="User:Mintchocicecream">Mintchocicecream</a> 09:04, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're missing the fact that it wasn't rewritten solely in order to render the neutral point of view and to correct spelling. It was rewritten <i>using information from cited sources</i>.

<li>From what I can tell, the References section is a collection of links to blogs and a couple of PR stories in the Guardian. Hardly notability... if the game takes off the article can be recreated.

<ul>
<li>If your argument is that the fact that newspapers cover something, and that people discuss it, does not indicate notability at all, then I disagree. If your argument is simply about <i>what level</i> of discussion is necessary, then I agree that this subject is at the low end of the spectrum. However, as I stated above, an additional factor to take into account is that were this article to be deleted, we'd quite probably (as has happened in other cases in the past) have a succession of silly "Jamie Kane is a pop star" articles continually re-created in its place by players of the game over the coming months. Better an encyclopaedia with a proper article about a subject at the low end of the notability spectrum than an encyclopaedia with a succession of silly articles. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:23:57, 2005-08-15 (UTC)

<li>I got a mention in two of my local newspapers last week. Wikipedia article here I come! If I trawl google I can find people have been discussing any old cruft and rubbish. The Guardian entries are PR stories... ten-a-penny. I simply don't understand your point about how there will be lots of "Jamie Kane" new pages -- you don't and can't know that. If that starts to happen then people are playing it and it's becoming more notable, in which case my position might change. Your speculation is hardly a good reason for keeping it... isn't Wikipedia supposed to catalogue notable things rather than predict them? - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 18:47:38, 2005-08-15 (UTC)</li>

As an aside, if I had been a Wikipedian in the age of ilovebees and ourcolony, I would have voted for deletion of them as well, for the same reasons. <a href="../../../o/b/o/User%7EOboreruhito_b66d.html" title="User:Oboreruhito">obo</a> 21:22, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'd say this is a notable ARG - it is the first aimed at a 'normal' user (14-18yr old girls are outside of the typical market for such games), it is the first ARG done by an institution as well respected as the BBC and it is complete in that many people have played the game to completion. 84.9.20.203 22:27, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Since sanity is evidently scarce here, I ought to point out that the BoingBoing article makes no accusations, and cites no concrete evidence that this is actually an "advertising campaign" at all. It is merely a suspicion, which is why the headline ends with a question mark. Did you not get taught at school the difference between a question and a statement? Consequently I don't understand how you've rationalized this sudden jump from BoingBoing's premise...
<dl>
<dd>"This page <b>might be</b> an abuse of Wikipedia to promote an advertising campaign"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>...to the logically distinct premise...
<dl>
<dd>"This page <b>is</b> an abuse of Wikipedia to promote an advertising campaign".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I also suggest that any other sheepy votes based solely on <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarberio_8f89.html" title="User:Barberio">Barberio</a>'s bogus reasoning, and shameless scaremongering, should be discounted.</dd>
<dd>You should also be aware that you are, in effect, creating a viral advertising campaign for the BoingBoing site amongst readers of this page.

<li>Well, sort of anyway. Do networks ever operate in a strict round-robin sense? They all use one of the IEEE 802 standards and none of those is specifically a round-robin proposal, since you might have nothing to transmit and would just pass the opportunity onto the next station in the ring, so a token ring is closest by description. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 16:30, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>A lot more could be written about this expression, which is famous here. Since <a href="../../../e/h/_/Eh.html" title="Eh">Eh</a> has an article, Opa! should, too. The title must change, however, because we have two ways to use/pronounce it. "Opa" can also mean "hey you made a mistake" or "I am happy" depending on how you pronounce it and how long you pronounce the O sound. "opa-opa" is also related, and I think it's used in songs.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm trying to expand it, I believe it should be marked as a stub and then marked for cleanup. There is also Opa. Certainly wikipedia is not a dictionary but wikipedians shouldn't go around deleting stuff when they could expand them (or as official policy says <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">If you come across an article that is nothing more than a definition, see if there is information you can add that would be appropriate for an encyclopedia.</a>)</li>

<p>Title 28 is the portion of the United States Code (federal statutory law) that governs the federal judicial system. It includes provisions about quite a few judiciary-related topics, and relevant sections are cited in the appropriate articles, such as in <a href="../../../d/i/v/Diversity_jurisdiction.html" title="Diversity jurisdiction">Diversity jurisdiction</a>. Title 28 doesn't need a separate article. If it did, the article wouldn't be a POV diatribe against one extremely minor portion relating to bankruptcy law. (Title 28 isn't even the key title on bankruptcy, the substance of which is covered in Title 11.) <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 10:42, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This version is much less objectionable, but, despite my appreciation for <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a>'s work, my "Delete" vote stands. Trying to organize our coverage of the U.S. Code according to its 50 or so Titles would be a waste of effort. Readers search for specific legal topics. Not many people would care about which specific subject areas happened to be covered in Title 28. Nothing links to the article except one offhand comment on <a href="../../../b/a/n/Talk%7EBankruptcy_5d9c.html" title="Talk:Bankruptcy">Talk:Bankruptcy</a>, which now turns out to be a typographical error.

<li>First, saying in VfD that "we should keep X because you didn't nominate Y" is rarely a meaningful argument. Second, I'm not going to deal with the last two examples you cite, for reasons which I imagine are obvious. As to the first three, the Brazil article says, amongst other things, <i>"...a covert nuclear weapons program was pursued by Brazil under a military government in the 1980s."</i>, the Canada article says plenty about why the issue is important there: it evidently decided an election and they were partners in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan_Project_aaa1.html" title="Manhattan Project">Manhattan Project</a>, the Poland article says <i>"...during communist times had active programs in the development of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons"</i>. The Taiwan article is more difficult, and could perhaps be discussed, <i>but</i>, the statement from Beijing that the obtainment of nuclear capability would lead to "immediate attack" with all the geopolitical implications of that is fairly important. The Germany article, on the other hand, offers no significance to the issue of WMD in Germany at present or in the past (apart from component manufacture which most industrialized nations do too).-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 17:15, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>KEEP</b>. The votes are actually numerically almost equal, which would be a no-consensus keep. But most of the deletes were cast before the initial stub which is now in place was written and are clearly rejecting the adevertising content that was present at the time. All but one vote after the stub would keep — and one of the deleters allows for a "major rewrite" too. Further, the article has been further expanded since even most of the keep votes. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 07:18, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comment: I agree with you (including the rename), *if* <a href="../../../g/%C3%AE/t/G%C3%AEte.html" title="Gîte">gîte</a> is not a brand, but a common/generic word used in France. I'm a little confused, though, since the web site suggests of starting in 1951 with something "new" and non-traditional. But, surely there were summer homes before than; what were they called? Are all rented summer homes in France "Gites" (as answer.com implies), or is this just a brand? Is this the same as a <a href="../../../d/a/c/Dacha.html" title="Dacha">Dacha</a>? If it's a uniquely French version of <a href="../../../d/a/c/Dacha.html" title="Dacha">Dacha</a> than an article is easily (or as easily) justified. I just want to be sure we're not promoting somebody's brand, I admit ignorance about France on this. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 21:36, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Cottage can be tranlated in French by "villa" or in some case by "résidence secondaire". In both case they are not vacation accomodation.

<li><b>Keep</b> From time to time, over the years, I have actually wondered just what a gîte is. I know it's some sort of holiday let thing, but how does it work? Are they owned by companies, or by individuals who stay there themselves? I have this notion that they are rural things, usually converted farmhouses - but is that true? Can there be gîtes in towns? And why are they called "gîtes" - a marketing thing? Is there a distinction between gîtes and other holiday homes? When did this gîte thing come about? I hope the article can be expanded so that I can get some answers.--<a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinbarr_Saunders_b918.html" title="User:Finbarr Saunders">Finbarr Saunders</a> 22:25, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This looks like a joke or hoax to me.

<p>It is a religion that a bunch of college students have created and use as a story that they continually expand upon. They are even writing a book about it. The text referenced - laws inherent to eternal substance (L.I.E.S.) is a few pages scribbled on lined paper. This article should not be deleted, it should be updated to accurately represent what Raymonites are. But - it is true that while the religion is not real, a Raymonite (someone who believes the religion) would be exactly what the post says. It's just that there are no real Raymonites yet.</p>
<p>As for the fortunecity homepage, I have never heard of it even though I am one of the creators. I know all 30-ish people involved, and I don't think the page is one of their's either.</p>

<p>The person and his band do appear to exist, but - judging from Google results - no notability is established.

<p>He is the live keyboard player for the Manic Street Preachers, and has additionally been on television with them, in documentaries. He is also listed in the credits of three of their albums.</p>
<p>He has a cult status with fans of the band.</p>
<p>His name is sometimes spelt Nick Naysmith, but it is believed that it is Naysmyth.</p>
<p>Hence, my vote is to keep the page - Michael Anazapela</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael, if this is so and Naysmyth has little notability on his own, consider merging the info into the main <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manic_Street_Preachers_e8ef.html" title="Manic Street Preachers">Manic Street Preachers</a> article or enhancing the Naysmyth article (cf. the tag I've added).

<p>While I agree that it is likely that this game will come out <i>someday</i>, absolutely nothing is actually known about it. Every single item in the article is utter speculation. Details about the game are expected to be announced next month at a trade show, so I'd say delete this and recreate it after it's actually announced. (Am I being too type-A here? I'm seriously interested in knowing the consensus). <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 13:59, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure what to make of this... this page links to several dozen subpages, e.g. <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiology_basic_topics_455a.html" title="Wikipedia:Biology basic topics">Wikipedia:Biology basic topics</a> and <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics_basic_topics.html" title="Economics basic topics">Economics basic topics</a> (which isn't even in Wikispace, and is already converted to a redir). Those subpages list basic terms in that particular field. The whole idea is that this allows us to list basic terms that require articles. The point is, however, that those terms (being basic) <i>already have</i> articles. So the entire system is bascially a list of articles that we want and we already have. The result, among others, is to make <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_missing_topics_055d.html" title="Category:Wikipedia missing topics">Category:Wikipedia missing topics</a> filled with things that aren't missing.

<dd><b>Comment</b> you may be missing the point of the phrase 'non-notable' here, Ellectrika. In the context of this discussion it is <b>not</b> intended as a slur, either personal or professional. It is merely an attempt to keep some measure of control over what articles do and do not persist on Wikipedia. For example Martg mentions <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> above. Visit <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">the link</a> and you'll see that this is a set of guidelines (admittedly <i>rough</i> guidelines) as to what counts as "notable" in that context. Please note these are <i>not</i> subjective guidelines, they are merely criteria of how "big" – or "notable – a band or artiste is. No-one in this discussion is "pulling you down" (though there's a good measure of perplexity at what seems to be over-reaction; we don't know, and I at least don't particularly want to know, the background).</dd>
<dd>The people voting in this are in fact the last people you should be telling to 'go do something constructive with their time'. The "something constructive" that's being done is trying to get your problem solved – simply screaming 'remove, delete' won't do that as there's not a lot to stop it being reinstated, perhaps in another form. You might also take the time to read <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_legal_threats_370c.html" title="Wikipedia:No legal threats">Wikipedia:No legal threats</a> to see why legal threats are probably not the best way to start to argue your case. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> 22:35, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hi there User:Ellectrika. You may be wondering why the page Ellectrika hasn't yet been deleted. When a page in the encyclopedia is listed for deletion, a <i>vote page</i> is listed (for Ellectrika, it's the page you are looking at now), and comments are gathered for a period before voting is closed. That period for general articles in the encyclopedia is 5 days. At the end of 5 days, a sysop closes the vote page, considers the comments, and arrives at a decision as to whether to <i>keep</i> or <i>delete</i>. Since all comments here have been to delete, that will likely be the outcome (unless other editors object, for some reason, in the remaining time — this is unlikely). A small number of articles go through a much faster process of deletion, called <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion</a>. This is reserved for "articles" that are clearly inappropriate, for example, gibberish ("dsbkjdbgkjdngjkdngkdhmnkuijh" and such). Where regular pages are concerned, the 5 day period is intended to provide time for editors to consider the merits of the subject, how well (if at all) the article is written, and whether the article is somehow in contravention of Wikipedia policies. That's what's been happening here. If it will do anything to assuage your anxiety about the page, may I point out that it is, as you know, currently virtually blanked out, and in any case these new, unremarkable pages get an exceptionally low amount of traffic — it is likely that few people have seen it other than the creator, yourself, and the editors on this page. Kind regards—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><sup><font color="#000">ζ</font></sup></a>&#160; 15:23:20, 2005-08-16 (UTC)</li>

<p>If this belonged anywhere, it should go into the <a href="../../../d/a/y/Day_After_Tomorrow_c345.html" title="Day After Tomorrow">Day After Tomorrow</a> page, as a section. However, it is likely that if it was added to that page it would be edited out: this is simply not a level of trivial detail that most of our movie pages go into, or any other pages for that matter. The transliterated actors' names are not interesting: English Wikipedia routinely provides the native name (in a non-Latin-alphabet writing system) for foreign personal and place names; however, we don't provide transliterations <i>into</i> every conceivable non-Latin-alphabet writing system of English personal and place names. The movie title in foreign languages may be somewhat more interesting, since this is usually not a transliteration and often not even a translation, but often a newly chosen title. However, we would usually not routinely provide these unless they were of particular interest.

<li>(<b>Comment</b>) The <i>subject</i> is notable enough. Instead of relying on XM's list, I think it is not a bad idea to have an independent list that, as time goes by, will reflect changes, provide space for comments, and will never require some strange browser plug-ins. The <a href="../../../x/m/_/XM_Satellite_Radio_9ff5.html" title="XM Satellite Radio">XM Satellite Radio</a> article is already quite long, so separating the list seems the right thing to do. --<a href="../../../d/r/t/User%7EDrTorstenHenning_2c0a.html" title="User:DrTorstenHenning">DrTorstenHenning</a> 06:41, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>The various generic genre channels of either this or its competetor <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirius_Satellite_Radio_4c94.html" title="Sirius Satellite Radio">Sirius Satellite Radio</a> will never be notable enough to warrant forming an article around them. A common list of the syndicated radio channels available might be worth including as a separate article, with it indicating which sat radio providers carry them while the few unique and exclusive signature channels with original content created by XM or Sirius should simply be linked to from within each article with no need for a list. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 15:01, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>(<b>Comment</b>). Radio channels that thousands of people listen to while driving millions of miles should be no more non-notable than Harry Potter paraphernalia or Pokemon characters that have watered down the standard of notability in Wikipedia. Once they are gone (which sadly will not happen), I would be the first to agree that a list of radio channels might disappear as well. And I think that the articles on the operators themselves are already long enough to warrant the separation of their signature channels into a separate list, which then is the natural place for the list of the syndicated channels as well. --<a href="../../../d/r/t/User%7EDrTorstenHenning_2c0a.html" title="User:DrTorstenHenning">DrTorstenHenning</a> 06:46, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Highly notable. Planet Ant is a valuable example of an artist incubator where young actors, directors, sound designers, stage managers practice their craft as they prepare more prestigious jobs. In the area of Detroit culture, at least five to ten actors in major roles can trace their beginning to Planet Ant. Planet Ant also hosts one of two vital film festivals in the Michigan.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I see a lot of weblinks to this. Still, the article itself is very weak, in his defence above Wmjuntunen's written a better entry then the article itself. If it really plays this big a role in Detroit culture I guess it should stay.</li>

<li>Thank you. I usually begin an article with a stub that gives basics: location, place in time, and a general overview. I employ Wikipedia to do at least ten to fifteen drafts before leaving it alone, and then I communicate with subject-matter experts for a verification read. I understand this part of the Wikipedia process better now, and I am now collaborating with Michigan cultural writers to make certain content about our cultural life passes the ratification process. <a href="../../../w/m/j/User%7EWmjuntunen_a4ce.html" title="User:Wmjuntunen">Wmjuntunen</a> 20:11, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I think Wmjuntunen's personal process of first adding basic information, then refining it over several days while collaborating with others is a perfectly reasonable approach given that we are all volunteers here who contribute when we can find the time. With that said, this article has good encyclopedic potential and I'd like for the author to have time to flesh it out (as it was nominated for VfD on its creation date.) --<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPresnell_cc17.html" title="User:Presnell">Presnell</a> 20:46, August 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Walsh, do not make silly accusations. You were probably not around when Usenet was the online community. It has not had that position since Canter and Segal destroyed it. Elf is a very significant online pioneer. He was one of the first people to post a regular FAQ to any of the usenet groups. His was certainly the most significant, it transformed the newsgroup. Your criteria for notability are somewhat strange, Paris Hilton is better known than Tim Berners-Lee, which one of the two do you think would be considered more notable by the editors of Britannica? I doubt you have heard of Butler Lampson or Tony Hoare but they are both very significant Turing Award winners. Perhaps if you bothered to explain your VfD nominations on talk pages, took a few seconds to Google the item and stopped deleting criticism of your sloppy actions from your user page you might be more credible.--<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 23:48, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Hmm. We already have a reasonable precedent for notability of articles on Usenet folks, some of whom are notable otherwise (Gene Spafford, Henry Spencer, Brad Templeton) and some of whom are only notable in the context of Usenet (Robert McElwaine, Kibo, even B1FF). I'd guess worth keeping even in the absence of notability for the writing.

<p>Sadly to say that Kempler video is the seven and a half video minute of the Rabin murder and my explanation of the historical importance of the video is accurate. Once you see the video and read the explanation you will see that we are talking about something very important historically. Leave the thing up because it is historically very important. For the Rabin murder it is more important to figure out what really happened than the JFK murder film was what happened to JFK. Imagine taking down the JFK murder film with similar arguments. The difference is that most Israelis only remember the film from 9 years ago and the video has not been seen since. Really wierd. Results 1 - 10 of about 7,960 for kempler video is the google hits, which is alot for a video that has not bad been seen in over nine years. But of course, we are cutting to the chase of the Rabin murder and there are people who cannot let this happen.

<p>Unencyclopedic, Buffy-cruft. It's dedicating a whole article on the "villain" aspect of a TV show. It's redundant because it just reiterates information found in a table in the main BtVS slayer and information from the individual villain articles.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I worked on this article recently, but I realize that the encyclopedic potential for this to equal a featured article is very little. Also, I couldn't find any authoritative sources for some of the article's claims, therefore the "original research" argument is valid. For example, no authoritative source states The First's morphing in "Lessons" were suppose to be big bads or just villains from past seasons. In addition, it looks like this focus on the Buffy villain is spawning more duplicates such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_bad&amp;oldid=19974201" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_bad&amp;oldid=19974201" rel="nofollow">big bad.</a> At best a merge into the main Buffy article, but it's already there under the "Characters" section so I vote delete. ! ! ! 01:42, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or Combine and Redirect. The "original research" notion seems pretty weak. Anybody who has watched this show and thought about it should see that it acurately tells what happens with villains on buffy the vampire slayer. Here's the primary source for the claims made in the article: Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Seasons One through Seven. If that's not source enough, I cite TV guide. If that's not enough, I'll go find one of the dozen books on on Buffy and cite that. They all agree that what this article says is acurate. Anyone who has thought about the show can verify that most of the claims in this article are acurate, and can correct them where they are astray. No wild or controversial interpretations are offered in this article. And note this from the OR page: "[R]esearch that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is strongly encouraged. In fact, all articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research," it is "source-based research," and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia." This article is not creating a primary source, it is reporting the content of a primary source. A friend of mine has a slogan: "If you want to know about an obscure Roman emperor, go to encyclopedia britanica for all I care. If you want to know about a Sith Lord, go to Wikipedia." Wikipedia is reliably a very good source of information about our evolving popular culture, probably the best on the net, probably the best in there is. Wikipedia should be proud of this rather than trying to evolve into a stuffy attempt to be Encyclopedia Britanica. Course, I'm the one who wrote most of this article... <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosofool_446b.html" title="User:Philosofool">User:Philosofool</a> 13:55 PDT 21 August 2005</li>

<dd>No, because the article is written in English, it clearly the one that belongs on the English Wikipedia.

<dd>The <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> was obviously that the addition of the single word "notable" was an assertion of notability, when the VfU discussion was clearly in opposition to the undeletion of the article on A7 grounds. The recreation at an alternative capitalization with practically the same content is gaming the system, and falls under the same ambit.

<dd>Thank you. You see, <a href="../../../n/a/u/Nautica_Thorn_cb68.html" title="Nautica Thorn">Nautica Thorn</a> would definitely qualify as notable in my book. To me this indicates the guidelines are lacking when it comes to determining what porn actors and actresses are notable. The present one seems to imply they're <i>all</i> notable. But while that's fine if you are of the viewpoint nearly every person on Earth is notable anyway (or "worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia", if you will) it seems quite uneven to use the guideline in singling out porn actors this way. I doubt anyone would argue there's not a difference between porn actors and actors in just about any other genre in this regard, but if I'm wrong, I'd like to have that spelled out at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 01:32, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nonsense. A student is not notable as a student except for very few rare cases, which would have to be explained. But is it very common for an actor to be notable for simply being an actor and having a minimum name recognition, but there may be no practical way to demonstrate that in an article.

<dd>I don't think it works that way for any speedy. <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> explicitly talks only about the <i>content of articles</i>, not about their topics. The criterion under which this article was deleted reads "an article about a real person that does not assert that person's importance or significance" (and follows this up with the reason why we're here: "if the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to VFD instead"). It seems hard to argue that the article "asserted that person's importance or significance", unless you want to agree with NoPuzzleStranger that adding "notable" is such an assertion. (Grammatically speaking he's completely right, of course.) If you want to argue administrators <i>additionally</i> have the requirement of checking whether the article doesn't happen to ineffectively talk about a notable person who's significance is not established before speedying: I can't see anything in any policy anywhere where that is even implied. If you want to hold administrators responsible this way, I suggest amending policy to make this more explicit. I will agree with you that continuing to speedy an article despite objections is a bad idea, but I cannot agree with you that the original speedies where as baseless as you seem to suggest they were. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 01:50, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>No matter what the CSD's say, we don't expect our administrators to act blindly and delete perfectly good articles on the basis of content--at least I don't. Obviously this was a VfD candidate from the first, asserting as it did that the person named was an American porn star. The way to remove doubt would have been to type her name into google and see if anything comes out--if it doesn't, then it's a clearly spurious claim and can be speedied; otherwise some discussion may be required.</li>
<li>I'm sorry that you don't seem to see anywhere in policy that says administrators are expected to be persons of generally good judgement. Maybe we should add something to that effect to our policy, though of course it would be superfluous because obviously we all are, so we don't usually go around blindly deleting articles on the basis that if we squint a bit we can pretend that the subjects aren't pretty famous people. But we all make mistakes. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:08, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Rational continuation of this argument seems pointless. You clearly believe administrators cannot delete articles (or ought not, at least) unless they first make a good attempt at establishing the notability of their subjects, and failing. I do not. The remainder of the straw man arguments and hyperbole are not worth addressing. I understand your point perfectly well, Tony. No need to give it an ironic, or even sarcastic edge. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 02:18, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm sorry that you thought I was being sarcastic. I do sincerely believe that we're all capable of being good administrators. I don't think that ever involves deleting articles that say stuff like "X is a porn star" without even checking on google. The claim that a person is a porn star is a claim of notability (porn is mass distributed and so thousands, possibly even hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to the attributed work of a person who works in that industry). Now if I wrote an article "Meritanio Gonzalez is a porn star" you would obviously want to know if this were a likely claim. But it's easy enough to check it. I have done RC patrol myself, it just doesn't make sense to blindly delete stuff because a lot of it turns out to be easily verifiable and if you delete it you've just deleted something that can be made into a good stub in a few seconds. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:53, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, now I see where the argument lies. You consider porn stars (existing ones, obviously) to be notable <i>because</i> porn is mass distributed. I find myself holding the exact <i>opposite</i> opinion: I'd expect that so many porn movies are made and so many porn actors hired that individual ones need to have good claims to fame. Now I also see why you must have thought me a bit of an idiot to belabor the point: you would consider the assertion "X is a porn star" to be a <i>good claim</i> of notability and thus not something you could apply the speedy criterion to; I'd consider it <i>insufficient</i>. This seems like a pretty serious discrepancy, though. We should definitely try to get some consensus on the issue outside this individual case. I'd imagine we're not the only two people representing either side. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 03:02, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This isn't a CSD IMHO. It doesn't qualify under A7 because it does assert the notability of the subject (the word "noted" is actually in the lead sentence). As for being reposted content, the previous deletion was a speedy, and the guidelines suggest that if content is speedied and re-created, then it might conceivably be deserving of an article, so VfD might be a better place to resolve the issue (as Lacrimosus did).

<ul>
<li>Very little or no information is availble about the game other than what Kojima has stated in various interviews.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The game is unreleased and will probably stay that way for quite awhile.</li>

WP is not a hagiographic work (in contrast to the site from which these bios were "migrated"), so it is neither necessary nor remotely acceptable here to retell a heroic deed jointly performed by the two or fifty who were equally decorated for it, two or fifty times in their respective WP bios. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Defense_of_Rorke%27s_Drift_hospital&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=20953432" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Defense_of_Rorke%27s_Drift_hospital&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=20953432" rel="nofollow">"<i>Contents moved</i></a> [sic] <i>to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Jones_%28VC%29_5886.html" title="Robert Jones (VC)">Robert Jones (VC)</a></i>" (presumably meaning either "<i>copied</i> to" or "... <i>to be</i> moved, immediately prior to deletion, ...") would in any case be a mistake, for they would also be needed in <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Jones_%28VC%29_8913.html" title="William Jones (VC)">William Jones (VC)</a> (unless i failed to insert the lk in place of them, as i intended and described above).<br />

<li>Truly unnecessarily convoluted explanation. All I can make out is criticism to migrated Victoria Cross articles. As for me, I would vote to <b>merge</b> to <a href="../../../r/o/r/Rorke%27s_Drift_9934.html" title="Rorke's Drift">Rorke's Drift</a> - that article would also do with lots of expansion - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 11:55, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>The only response called for is this <b>off-topic</b> one for the record; it is necessary only bcz "criticism" (such a loaded word) has been attributed to me. My only "criticism" of the valuable VC articles is that they are well suited to their source but not yet to WP; they have suffered neglect. That is not a complaint about their authors: WP may need to consciously seek balance by compensating for ignorance of military affairs, as it has been argued WP should compensate for ignorance of 6 of the 7 continents.<br />
