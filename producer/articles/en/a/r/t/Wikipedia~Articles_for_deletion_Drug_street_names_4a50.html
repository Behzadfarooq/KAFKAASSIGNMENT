<p>The result was} <b>speedy delete</b> as yet another re-creation of a deleted dictionary of slang. This is simply List of street names of drugs re-created, under a different title 3 days after its last deletion. The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy applies. This article is nothing but a set of (stub) dictionary entries for slang words — not even good stubs in many cases, at that. There is no actual encyclopaedia article content, on the subject of drug street names, here at all. We had a consensus to get rid of this dictionary of slang words at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_street_names_of_drugs_%282nd_nomination%29_6c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of street names of drugs (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of street names of drugs (2nd nomination)</a>, and in different forms this dictionary has already been discussed several times before, including at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Street_name_6760.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Street name">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Street name</a> and at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_marijuana_slang_terms_2_30b7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of marijuana slang terms 2">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of marijuana slang terms 2</a>. For a dictionary of such slang words, see Wiktionary, which is a dictionary. Wiktionary has had WikiSaurus entries and appendices dealing with these words for several years, now. It has <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wikisaurus:marijuana" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wikisaurus:marijuana">wikt:Wikisaurus:marijuana</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Cannabis_slang" class="extiw" title="wikt:Appendix:Cannabis_slang">wikt:Appendix:Cannabis slang</a>, for examples.

<p>This list has not a single reference. I would love to go through and clean it up using Wikipedia standards for sourcing (and also notability)... but it would be empty. This is simply a harbor for neologisms. Notable slang terms, if there are any, should be (and are) included in the articles for the particular drugs they're referring to — "marijuana" at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis.html" title="Cannabis">cannabis</a>, "coke" at <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>, etc. 98% of this is simply intoxicant-listcruft. Let me reiterate: there are no sources for <i>anything on this page,</i> either for notability or even simple common, widespread use. <b>Delete.</b> <b><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a></b> <small><a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">JDiscourse</a></small> 04:42, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Ok, so maybe this list isn't sourced right now. Here's three <a href="http://www.nida.nih.gov/DrugPages/DrugsofAbuse.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nida.nih.gov/DrugPages/DrugsofAbuse.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.drugs.indiana.edu/slang/home.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.drugs.indiana.edu/slang/home.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>,<a href="http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/streetterms/default.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/streetterms/default.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. If anybody wants to rewrite this article using these sources, or others, they certainly can, and probably should. So the only question is whether or not this kind of information should be collated on Wikipedia. (The nomination certainly supports including the information in articles on the drugs themselves, so the inclusion of the information is not immediately at issue). So far as I can see, I don't see why not, none of the opinions here have expressed any kind of argument addressing that issue. The names themselves are important enough for law enforcement to care about, and while articles shouldn't use slang, that's not the same as saying we shouldn't have articles on slang. Somebody get back to me if you can address that issue, and not the unimportant one about sources. That, as the links I provided show, is easily addressed. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:33, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information, which this list certainly seems to qualify as. Your sources actually strengthen this point: the second source, for instance, lists 536 different slang terms for marijuana alone. Your third source is equally long-winded; your first mercifully only lists a few examples for each. But this demonstrates that even "official" lists such as these are not at all definitive, unless you're suggesting we include everything on their list simply because it's there? Those other sites allow themselves the latitude to randomly compile information; we do not. If individuals are interested in the slang names for particular drugs, they're able to look those up and find them in their respective articles. Better yet, they can go peruse urbandictionary.com, a project dedicated to documenting exactly this sort of information. If there were a source stating the importance to police of being up on drug slang, that information would be relevant at <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a>. But neologisms huddling together for warmth as they do here, or being put on a context-less list by drug agencies, do not make them Wikipedia material. <b><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a></b> <small><a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">JDiscourse</a></small> 23:20, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, your nomination(and several of the further opinions expressed) complained about sources, I demonstrated that it's not a real issue, as there are numerous sources available. It took me literally seconds to find these. Thus it would be better to not even try to argue that, as it's rather easy to show why it's meaningless claim. If you want sources, they exist. Perhaps you could strike that reason from your nomination? That might concentrate matters on more relevant reasons to delete. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DICT" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DICT</a> is probably a better argument in this case, and I suggest seeing if Wikitionary has it already. You aren't objecting to the information itself after all, as you have supported putting these slang terms on the individual drug articles. I think a collation is helpful myself, but I don't care if it's here or there. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:11, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> While I would agree that the article does not necessarily meet Wikipedia standards per se, I do think that it compiles an interesting amount of information, not necessarily inaccurate. Is that not what Wikipedia was meant to be? And yes, they're neologisms but I think they're very important socially. If it's not here, it won't be anywhere. Just my two cents. --<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockstar915_f516.html" title="User:Rockstar915">Rockstar915</a> 00:07, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
