<li><b>A Must Keep</b> - The Kamehameha wave has become a universal icon and inspiration to the world of modern art and animation. As Western culture and practices become ever more influenced by methods and aesthetics of the East, the significance of the Kamehamehe wave is increasingly noticeable. I find that most arguments made against the inclusion of this definition stem from a disdain for "fans" or people who possess a zealous interest in the particulars of artistic expression (particularly television programs). Ultimately, this article is completely valid and factual in that it accurately represents a term employed in the program referenced, therefore such definitions are factually based, and factually based information, however trivial some may feel it to be, is indeed knowledge. Those who seek its removal seek, simultaneously, to limit the scope of Wikipedia's ability to inform. They seek to cut short knowledge. It is not for us to deem what is or is not "good" or "relevant" or "trivial" information. All information is of worth. And those who seek to remove any information, are guilty of crimes against knowledge.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Using <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_One_Piece_attacks_fe02.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/One Piece attacks">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/One Piece attacks</a> as a precidence, I declare that this attack list is fancruft and should be deleted. To quote one of the users in that discussion: "Let me see if I can, I was reading this and then had a look at the page. What does the one page attacks page consist of? Well when you break it down, it's a list of the different ways one character can punch another in the face [note: in this case, it would be "blast someone in the face"]. Using this logic, we should create a page for DC universe offensive use of superpowers - Superman has quite a few and using them in combination he can work up more than 5 "attacks". Once we have done this, we can move onto the same for the Marvel Universe etc. When you consider that minor characters should not have their own articles unless there is good reason.... attacks?" This is even worse than the linked page, since several attacks in this show are very similar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, having a page for <i>one attack</i> is just plain silly. Thus, the following will be deleted too.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>- The Kamehameha is a very important element in Dragon Ball and has enough information to keep it's own article. The attack list doesn't do any harm, and it helps readers understand more about what they're reading by giving a picture and description of each attack. I'd say these articles are pretty important, and this request is pretty rash. I also think it's interesting how your account is only 2 says old, and you have 7 edits (6 of which are creating this page and nominating said pages for deletion).--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude"><sup><font color="lightblue">(Contributions)</font></sup></a> 19:09, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- It's possible that they are fancruft, but that alone doesn't warrant deletion (please read <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a>). These articles are well written and cited. They should stay. I find Koji's point regarding your account interesting as well. CPitt76 23:08, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- Attack lists are perfectly valid to make articles about, and this is a well made one. For the record, I don't agree with the deletion you linked to either. <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigmasonic_X_df4d.html" title="User:Sigmasonic X">Sigmasonic X</a> 04:42, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li>Well, you see, it seems Hydromasta doesn't like attack lists and thinks they don't belong on Wikipedia (apparently, so do many other people, as seen in the articles for deletion linked), and is using the deletion of the One Piece attack list to delete the others. <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigmasonic_X_df4d.html" title="User:Sigmasonic X">Sigmasonic X</a> 23:24, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's supossed to be all of them. But, as you can see, it's unfinished.

<li>To any mods (I believe that's who decides if the topics remain open or not), look at the link supplied in the first post for good arguements against attack lists. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydromasta231_6acc.html" title="User:Hydromasta231">Hydromasta231</a> 02:26, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Specifically, the arguement between Justyn and A Man in Black brings up several good points. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydromasta231_6acc.html" title="User:Hydromasta231">Hydromasta231</a> 04:33, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I read it. It's the same boring set of arguments that were posed in the articles for deletion review of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_injuries%2C_accidents%2C_and_mishaps_on_MythBusters_c575.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of injuries, accidents, and mishaps on MythBusters">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of injuries, accidents, and mishaps on MythBusters</a>. The designation of "cruft" hinges on it being UNIMPORTANT to the topic in general. This one doesn't fit that because of the nature of the show. The anime has the various special attacks and such things as the way of determining combat. Thus having a list of them is almost as important as having a list of races or characters.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 03:02, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Clearly fancruft. Make a Dragon Ball Wiki (if there isn't one already) and post it there.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article doesn't give an greater understanding of the series to laypeople. "It's useful" is not a argument; game guides, weather reports, and bios for unknown people are useful but not befitting of Wikipedia. It "doesn't do any harm" is an even stupider argument; it's the Internet. Of course it doesnt hurt anybody. No deleted article hurt anybody. Please provide some actual arguments, people. 04:40, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - In general, it seems that most of the ability stuff is better confined to the characters who use it. Centralized information in the character articles is far more useful. Also, over 40 "fair use" images in an article is most certainly pushing it... <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 05:06, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Why is a user coming onto Wikipedia to nominate articles for deletion and spam talk pages with advertisements about this discussion? An experienced user would have been told previously that spamming of talk pages in the manner that the nominator did, is looked down upon by the community in general. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 05:23, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b>.

<li><b>comment</b> It exists because this sort of thing was an important aspect of the anime. The One Peice anime doesn't have the same emphasis on what attacks you use, thus it should not be considered a valid precedent.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 05:57, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Welllllll...I'm almost tempted to say keep the <i>Kamehameha</i> article, but no. <b>Merge and redirect</b> <i>Kamehameha</i> to <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragonball_Z_726c.html" title="Dragonball Z">Dragonball Z</a>. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dragon_Ball_special_abilities_c3fe.html" title="List of Dragon Ball special abilities">List of Dragon Ball special abilities</a> with extreme prejudice, because it's listcruft.

<li>How is this page related to your quoted criteria, considering the criteria is a very limited set, and only refers to its status by saying that "current consensus is that Wikipedia articles are not <i>simply</i>" (emphasis added).

<li>All right. Let me rephrase that. My vote is <b>delete</b>, because there is NO REASON whatsoever that this article needs to exist on its own. The information (such as it is) in this article could easily be trimmed and merged right back into the individual character articles. (How hard is it to mention something like "Vegeta's 'Big Bang attack' creates a large sphere of ki which is then launched at the opponent, leaving a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mushroom_cloud.html" title="Mushroom cloud">mushroom cloud</a> in its wake" in the main <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegeta.html" title="Vegeta">Vegeta</a> article?) So. This article serves no purpose that could not be served elsewhere, thus delete. <font color="#000000">♠<a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPMC_03a4.html" title="User:PMC">P</a></font><a href="../../../p/m/c/User_talk%7EPMC_cf58.html" title="User talk:PMC"><font color="#FF00FF">M</font></a><font color="#000000"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Premeditated_Chaos_3dcc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Premeditated Chaos">C</a>♠</font> 22:41, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I've seen pages like this before, I don't think this is fancruff at all. I think this is a good attempt at handling attacks that most other major manga and anime attack pages fail to do and it DOES contain useful infomation. Now I'm not a fan of the show (in fact I can't stand it!), normally I would oppose everything to do with DB because I'm somewhat baised, however this page is okay in my books. It may not get read very often (but there are other wikipedia pages that don't get very often too that are far less informatitive) because of what its about... But it is useful. I don't see a problem with this article.
<p>Plus a lot of this page is just common knowledge amongst the DB, DBZ and DBGT media. If you delete this, this might make the DBA wikipedia pages incomplete somewhat. I agree there is still room for improvments, for instance there are far too many pictures for moves as some of them cannot be summed up in one picture. As someone pointed , many of these moves are simulair.</p>
<p>And... Even Superman has his own attacks page so to speak.<a href="../../../p/o/w/Powers_and_abilities_of_Superman_724f.html" title="Powers and abilities of Superman">Powers and abilities of Superman</a>, although its more abilities then attack (just listing what he is capable of doing). Perhaps if this was more written towards like how this article is, would you allow it? I say, if this page is delete worthy at least let everyone working on it at least give everyone a chance to rethink it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 07:49, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Ah, the flawed and ill-founded "It's just like <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powers_and_abilities_of_Superman_724f.html" title="Powers and abilities of Superman">Powers and abilities of Superman</a>." argument again! <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powers_and_abilities_of_Superman_724f.html" title="Powers and abilities of Superman">Powers and abilities of Superman</a> is a <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> breakout sub-article of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html#Powers_and_abilities" title="Superman">Superman#Powers_and_abilities</a>. To justify similar breakout articles for one particular facet of Dragon Ball characters on the same grounds, you would have to show that they, like <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> had individual articles on the individual characters that were so crowded that one had to break out the special abilities section, summary style, from the main article on the character. Looking at <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegeta.html#Techniques_and_special_abilities" title="Vegeta">Vegeta#Techniques_and_special_abilities</a>, that's clearly not the case. Indeed, the information on the attacks in the character article is <i>longer</i> than the information on the attacks in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dragon_Ball_special_abilities_c3fe.html" title="List of Dragon Ball special abilities">List of Dragon Ball special abilities</a>. This is clearly nowhere near being summary style. You're going to have to find another argument. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:14, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>And for the love of God, <i><b>STOP USING THE "IT'S USEFUL" ARGUMENT</b></i>. Game guides are useful. Weather reports are useful. How-to guides are useful. Phone directories are useful. They still do not belong in Wikipedia. <i><b>BEING USEFUL IS NOT ENOUGH TO WARRANT AN ARTICLE.</b></i> <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 09:16, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> per nom. Even the Kamehameha, while perhaps an important concept in the series, does not need this much detail - the entire article could be boiled down into a single paragraph. Quite simply, this is an encyclopedia not a fan-wiki, and as such it is quite adequate to describe a character's <i>most important</i> abilities <i>in that character's article</i>, and only break them out if (like Superman) those characters and abilities are so culturally relevant that it is important to discuss them in more detail than there's room for in a single article.<br />
Note that this clearly doesn't apply to these abilities, because even references to Dragonball in other series tend to refer only to very general concepts like "powering up", not to specific attacks.<br />

<li>comment To delete or not seems to hinge on one thing: Is it encyclopedic? If you're going to do an encyclopedia article about DragonBall Z, then you're going to need to explain the various techniques and skills performed during the course of the show. Whether or not this takes the form of an itemized list is determined entirely by how detailed you make the article. IMO this article IS detailed enough to warrant a seperate list. As for "justification" I'd like to point out that there's only ONE article for all of the Dragonball characters.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 09:56, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>No. You don't have to explain the mass amount of "attacks" "He blasts him away with ki energy." "He blinds him with a ki skill." It's rather easy to explain without resorting to pointless names that only confuse the lay reader. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 10:01, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually I find it to be the opposite. That sort of explanation is suited to a plot summary. However it's not well suited to an encyclopedic article. Besides, the names aren't pointless. Most of them are mentioned in the anime/manga as the name of the technique when it is shown being used.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 10:09, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hilarious how you refer to an "encyclopedic article", as a list of fictional attacks in a cartoon that's treated as if they were real isn't anywhere close to encyclopedic. I still fail to see how "Goku uses an Kalakamakma on Biggu Heado" is more encyclopedic than "Goku fires a blast of ki energy at Biggu Heado". <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 10:19, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep it as well as the rest</b>: Why the heck is this page being nominated for deletion and on the basis that the One Piece Attacks got deleted? The Dragonball pages are more professional looking than what was deleted plus these moves are more notable than the One Piece ones. Do not delete them because they are integral. They exist because they are part of this types of character. The way a fictional anime and manga character hits someone with a named attack can explain alot of the character. They explain what a character can do and can't do. They explains how far they are willing to go. They explain the character's creativity based on how they deliver the attack. They explain alot of the characters that words alone cannot summarized. You can't explain that in a summary like what the Superman page. The only way to convey that message is to list the attacks in some sort of manner. This is not cruft. In fact as quoted by the admin who deleted the One Piece article "One man's "cruft" is another man's priceless tidbit on information, and regardless of anything else it's incredibly rude to the individuals who have volounteered their time creating the article to use a belitteling and pejorative term." In other words what is useless to one person is useful for another person. This page is worthless to somebody who doesn't like or even knows the show but it is useful to those who do. The One Piece Attacks deletion was a great lost to alot to the people who edited it. It made alot of people sad and angry. Did anyone think about those people who gave alot of sweat and blood for that page. Did anyone think of the long hours and research they tireless did. If you delete this page and others like them based on what really should be in a proper looking and real encyclopedia rather than a free source of information then you are alienating an entire community from wikipedia. You are alienating them all. You are alienting both editors and clients. I am saying all these because I was spammed by one for my opinion who's first post in Wikipedia was in the One Piece attack AFD discussion namely the guy who brought up these entire discussion. I am going a bit uncivil here and risking being blocked if not banned from Wikipedia but it is well worth it.

<li><b>Comment</b> The Dragon Ball Character articles are already massive as it is; now you want us to copy all these attacks and ect. into them? The list is a conveinient and informative article. It isn't "fancruft" at all. It's just ifnormation about attacks used in the show. How are we supossed to write the Dragon Ball articles and expect somone who's never seen the show to understand it? I've seen that in every peer review, Rey Brujo mentions that the article needs to be understandable to somone who hasn't seen the show. That's what this article is. I really don't see what part of this article warrants deletion, and every DB article links to it.--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude"><sup><font color="lightblue">(Contributions)</font></sup></a> 12:51, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I really don't see how these are all that different from the One Piece Attacks page, they have all the same positive and negative aspects. Reading the closing admin's reasoning on that deletion debate, it seems the main reason the One Piece Attacks were deleted was a complete and total lack of cited <i>sources</i> external to the thing itself. This is a valid concern, and one I brought up in my keep "vote" there. This AFD bundles the attack list with 3 pages on individual attacks. The main attack list is a <i>little</i> better sourced than the One Piece one (but not much), but the other 3 have no sources cited at all. Any keep argument I can come up with would be essentially the same as the ones I made there; however I definately do see the vital importance of sources to Wikipedia's credibility. A lot of people would make an exception for fiction, but I'm not convinced that fiction should be an exception to the reliable sources rule. I do believe, however, that a lack of cited sources is a clean-up concern and <i>not a reason for deletion</i>. However, in instances where sources can never reasonably be expected to be found deletion may be an option. The difference between the main list here and the One Piece attacks list is that this one <i>does</i> cite 2 sources, whatever you may think of the quality of those sources. Therefore, by that reasoning it should be kept. The other three articles however, do not cite any sources (though I imagine they would be the same as the main article), and therefore should be <b>merged</b> into the main list and deleted (or sourced appropriately, including a source for the contention that they are more important then the other special abilities and deserve their own article). Hence, the weak keep. ~ <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</small> 14:37, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So, if I watch a movie or a television show, and I note that a given star was in it, playing a given character, that is original research? Sorry, but no, that is not OR. Now concluding that a given star is making a comeback, or has hit rock-bottom, that would be. However, you don't seem to realize that I am talking about books and other media that are the ones who have done the observation of the Dragonball series, and as such, this content is clealry derived from that, so your first objection does not apply. To your second, well, I don't think it is a prime example of that, as this is all relevant information to the Dragonball series, which is itself a notable anime.

<dd>Well, there are clearly verifiable facts in these articles. However, without a single source in any of the articles and just 2 external links to sites which may not be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>, nothing is actually <i>verified</i>. I'd strongly suspect that a fair chunk of this is indeed OR and so unverifiable, if there are verifiable facts here - give a source so they can be verified. I feel it is indiscriminate in that it lists every attack, no matter how minor, the Kamehameha is important to Dragonball but can you really say that of the Gekiretsu Kōdan? My view is the stuff which should be said on these attacks would be best served in the other DB articles.--<a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENilfanion_64a5.html" title="User:Nilfanion">Nilfanion</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/l/User_talk%7ENilfanion_2aa8.html" title="User talk:Nilfanion">talk</a>) 22:17, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Gekiretsu Kodan doesn't have its own article. If you want to remove it from the collated one, I suggest you take it to that article's talk page. But since it is apparently used in some video games, presumably by name, perhaps someone with access to them, and their manuals can provide useful sources. I can't do it, as I'm not knowledgeable enough of Dragonball or Japanese to do it, I don't own any of the games, even the card game. Can others? Maybe. But an AfD like this one is unlikely to make it happen. Especially not when you mindlessly focus on one minor entry. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:51, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete all.</b> First and foremost, very little of this is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified or verifiable</a>, particularly the list. All of it is sourced to direct observation of the show itself, and Wikipedia isn't here to provide watchers' guides for longrunning anime series.<br />
<br />
Additionally, it's indiscriminate. The word "indiscriminate" gets thrown around a lot, but what it means is that Wikipedia summarizes subjects, instead of listing every single exhaustive detail. It would be perfectly reasonable to mention that attacks are frequently named in the articles on the various DB anime and manga, and it would be perfectly reasonable to name some of the most prominent attacks, even describing them as the signature attacks of certain characters. This is discriminate. Indiscriminate is a list so exhaustive that it lists <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dragon_Ball_special_abilities_c3fe.html#Gekiretsu_K.C5.8Ddan" title="List of Dragon Ball special abilities">Gekiretsu Kōdan</a>, an attack that is never once used in either manga or anime.<br />
<br />
There are additional, aggravating factors. These articles are laden with fair-use images, illustrating every single attack however minor, even if that attack can amply be described with prose. These articles are often highly speculative, due to the lack of reliable sources. Romanizations are unattributed; I'm fairly sure that a number of these Romanizations are controversial among fans. The lot of these articles are written from an in-universe style, which is <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">inappropriate</a>. Even if these lesser issues were resolved, however, the fact remains that there's no verification and no discrimination, and that's just not the sort of thing that can be included in or allowed in this project.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b> The verifiability of the article is problematic because of the nature of the subject. Independant agencies aren't gonna write about this.

The Anime and the Manga.(the primary sources for ALL of the Dragonball Z pages) But while this, arguably, may not fullfill the letter of the verifiability policy, it IS verifiable by anyone who watches the source material. We do have the various videogames made from the series though.

<li>If we can't verify it, we shouldn't be covering it. There's no need to cover every single story ever told in any anime, manga, or other fictional work; if someone wants to know what happens, whoever-has-licensed-DB-this-week is more than willing to sell them tapes, DVDs, manga volumes, books, or other works.

<li>But there isn't an article on Gekiretsu Kōdan, it is merely a component of a larger article.

<li>Oh, I understand how they're important to the show.

<li>Depends on the context. For DB as a whole, we could easily say, "Attacks in Dragon Ball are flashy, fantastic, and often pyrotechnic. Characters throw punches in flurries too fast for the eye to see, hurl massive balls of shining ki energy, and often shake the landscape or even split planets in the course of a battle." If we wanted to describe one character's style, we'd do that. They're not all alike, but they're all examples of a single, largely unified art style, and the vast, vast majority are different forms of ki or energy blasts, and the ones that aren't aren't attacks at all and would probably be described individually (flight, fusion, transformation) or are different ways of hitting people (which can easily be summarized). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:11, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's a difference between a common-knowledge claim, trivially simple to source but unsourced as it isn't in dispute and excessive citation would clutter the article, and a claim made only on Wikipedia, attested to nobody. "Grass is green" is so widely verified that it isn't necessary to specifically attest it but attesting it would be trivially easy; these lists are of such narrow appeal that attesting their claims is nearly impossible.

<li>As you say, it is going overboard to insist on "independent" sources, whatever the real definition of that is. Reliable sources in the context of this article are going to be on the fan sites, where if something is said that is wrong, someone will pick up on it in a Peer Review fashion, which gives legitimacy to the site overall. Kind of like the peer review system here, except they are much more devoted to single topics on those sites (hence improving in accuracy value). <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 00:10, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dude, will you stop saying they don't have sources? They <i><b>DO</b></i>. They have about 3 million. What the fuck is your problem man? Sources which aren't the subject themselves aren't needed. How is an Anime not notable? Are you fukcing high or something? Saying there aren't sources is just plain biased. You want an independent source, fine, look at the millions of fan sites and merchandise. There's no way in hell for you to back up your argument of it being un-sourced, unless, of course, you expect everyone to just assume you're right scicne your an administrator. Two things I've noticed about this AfD is that it was made in Bad Faith by a possible sock puppet, and nobody really has any solid arguments against the articles. I'm pretty sure that warrants closing, unless you wanna use your godly administrator powers to change the policy on closing an AfD so you won't lose the argument.--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude"><sup><font color="lightblue">(Contributions)</font></sup></a> 01:33, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, okay, I get it, the 279 episode Anime is just my personal opinion. These articles should <i>definitly</i> be deleted, seeing as how having about 3 million sources isn't enough for any article. Let's see, how many artciles on Wikipedia have less than that? You better get started. Oh, by the way, this is directly from the admin guide for deletion: "<i>Administrators necessarily must use their best judgment, attempting to be as impartial as is possible for a fallible human, to determine when rough consensus has been reached. For example, administrators can disregard opinions and comments if they feel that there is strong evidence that they were not made in good faith. Such "bad faith" opinions include those being made by sock puppets, being made anonymously, or being made using a new userid whose only edits are to the article in question and the voting on that article.</i>" Seing as how this whole thing was started in bad faith, your job as an administrator would be to close it, not to repeatedly say that it isn't notable, when it obviousley is. Also: <b>pay attention to what I write</b>. Just because I'm used to using vulgar languege doesn't mean my opinion doesn't matter.--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude"><sup><font color="lightblue">(Contributions)</font></sup></a> 01:45, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You've mistaken "people interested in the subject" and "structural divisions of the subject" for "reliable sources independent of the subject". You've argued that there are a lot of DB fans and that there are a lot of DB episodes. That's nice, but <i>the fact that DB is important does not necessarily mean that every single detail of DB is sufficient material for its own Wikipedia article</i>. Given the lack of sources other than direct observation, the indiscriminate nature of these articles, the fact that these attacks can reasonablybe summarized in broader articles, and the legion of style problems with these articles, I think there's ample evidence that we don't need such overspecific articles.</dd>
<dd>Now, as for being an admin, I'm here expressing my opinion as an editor, rather than closing the AFD debate (which I wouldn't do, as I've participated in the debate and additionally have a strong personal opinion). The fact that I am an administrator is only relevant insofar as it's good evidence that I'm a user in good standing, as opposed to the nominator, who is apparently a brand-new user. I never meant to imply that my arguments carried any extra weight because I'm an administrator, merely that even if this was a bad faith nom made by a new user with a grudge (the worst possible situation) that the nom had a point and such-and-such reasons were why. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 01:56, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The attacks are probobly the second most important part of the show. The entire series focuses around them, so having articles describing them in detail and they're origin/history is notable, encyclopedic, helpful to the readers, and interesting.</dd>

Latly I've somehow developed a sort of prejuduce against administrators, and when I see one making the same point that has already been proven wrong millions of times over and over, or seems to be violating admin guidlines/WP:AGF, or just acting in a questionable matter, I get a little snippy (see, I have self control.

<dd>I could assert that the color orange is the most important part of the show, and then write Orange (Dragon Ball) about every appearance of the color orange. No interpretation, of course, just a list of every single orange thing in Dragon Ball. (It'd be a lot; orange is one of Toriyama's favored contrast colors.) The hedge against me doing so is the fact that we rely on (sounding like a broken record here) <i>coverage in reliable sources independent of the subject</i>. These lists have the same problem that Orange (Dragon Ball) would, and the argument that the attacks are important would apply, just as reasonably, to the color orange, because it's a claim made by a Wikipedia user with nothing whatsoever other than that Wikipedia user's say-so to support it. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 02:13, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> The preceding comment by Hoary is oh so important. Why oh why would the article have less value to fans if it were on a Dragon Ball wiki? Probably because it's not as well-known as Wikipedia and there's an extra sense of importance that comes with your favorite topic having an article in here. But there's no denying that this article is entirely unreferenced original research and none of the articles' supporters have seriously adressed that concern. Man in Black put it pretty well: it does not make sense to cover this in an encyclopedia when no other third-party source has ever bothered to. It's useful to the show's fans? Sure, so move it all to the useful dragonball wiki and let's get on with writing an encyclopedia here. I urge the closing admin to go beyond counting the votes here. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 14:00, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep and Merge</b> (if I can, following rules, otherwise <b>Comment</b>) I'd like to make you note that an encyclopedia should retain, at least, 'common' knowledge (or things commonly assumed to be known). A lot of "Dragon Ball"-related (as well as "&lt;other anime/manga/TV series&gt;"-related) topics <i>are</i> common knowledge for the young and not-so-young generations of <i>many</i> so-colled rich/industrialized/post-industrialization countries, nevertheless are <i>important</i> parts of their folklore-mythology, much much more than, e.g., ancient greek mythology (which is however naturally retained for historical reasons). Because of it, it's expected <i>at least</i> the presence of articles (or pieces of articles) regarding those most famous topics necessary to understand common cultural references (like Son Goku, other main characters, kamehameha and so on), but, as <i>every</i> good encyclopedia is expected to do, it <i>should</i> (and IMHO <i>must</i>) go into them a little more, exactly to tell the reader more about the things that gave birth to this widespread culture-folklore-mythology (simply what an encyclopedia is supposed to do). That said, I don't propose to retain a single article for every DB ability or such, but to list them correctly (e.g. per character) in the right place (like "List of Dragon Ball special abilities" was supposed to be) and use this page as the link for the other DB-related article citing that ability. I'm not writing that that article is perfect and sould retained as is or that all the 'abilities' should be written in it (IMHO only the most notable ones, but this is another discussion), I'm only writing it shouldn't be deleted. In my opinion, the deletion of similar articles is a sort of censorship of the 'olds' (OK, the world population is becoming older and older but there are younger people too) or cultural racism (something like "every single detail of the ancient greek mythology is acceptable for an encyclopedia because it's 'highly' cultural or 'ancient', but everything relating contemporary mythology is to discard as it isn't culture at all"). To sum it up: there are too specific articles to be merged into bigger ones (like ability-specific articles not culturally widespread, but a kamehameha article to me is perfectly just), there are things to change in these big articles and probably there are things to be deleted, but these, fewer, articles should exist [we are not talking about an unknown manga/anime which sold only two copies]. --87.7.62.159 16:52, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Hydromasta's reason's for deleting this article are horrendous. Unlike other genres of animated series, Dragonball is more or less a parody and a homage to martial arts. Techniques and how they are used are very important througout most of the saga although by late stage Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT the importance of individual techniques where minimized. Still comparing Dragonball to comics like Batman, Superman, Spiderman, etc is not appropriate. This article list is very informative especially to those new to the series and even those who are experienced fans. Individual articles on certain techniques however should be deleted. Articles such as the Kamehameha and Kaioken should be either deleted or merged into this one. Certain transformations however like Oozaru deserve their own article. --Maphisto86 17:39, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>In case any editors haven't seen this suggestion, I will post it again here: Hmm, it seems that the One Piece attack list has been moved to a <a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Attacks" class="external text" title="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Attacks" rel="nofollow">wikia</a>, and after it is cleaned up enough a link to it will be provided on the wikipedia One Piece page. Would it please both parties if the DBZ attacks were moved to a similar place, with links to that page replacing the ones currently linking to the pages up for deletion? For example, if Goku's article said "His main attack is the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamehameha_%28Dragon_Ball%29_f257.html" title="Kamehameha (Dragon Ball)">Kamehameha</a>", it would instead say "His main attack is the [(insert link) Kamehameha]." Pretty much the only real changes would be that the attacks can't be found using the Wikipedia search engine, that the links would have those squares next to them, and it technically wouldn't be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigmasonic_X_df4d.html" title="User:Sigmasonic X">Sigmasonic X</a> 17:51, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>A Must Keep</b> - The Kamehameha wave has become a universal icon and inspiration to the world of modern art and animation. As Eastern culture and practices become ever more influenced by methods and aesthetics of the West, the significance of the Kamehamehe wave is increasingly noticeable. I find that most arguments made against the inclusion of this definition stem from a disdain for "fans" or people who possess a zealous interest in the particulars of artistic expression (particularly television programs). Ultimately, this article is completely valid and factual in that it accurately represents a term employed in the program referenced, therefore such definitions are factually based, and factually based information, however trivial some may feel it to be, is indeed knowledge. Those who seek its removal seek, simultaneously, to limit the scope of Wikipedia's ability to inform. They seek to cut short knowledge. It is not for us to deem what is or is not "good" or "relevant" or "trivial" information. All information is of worth. And those who seek to remove any information, are guilty of crimes against knowledge... Hmmmm, I may have erred in my posting practices earlier. I am new to this, apparently one is to place comments in chronological order downward? Also, it seems that a username is to be listed. I am currently uncertain how to accomplish this but will attempt my best. Patiencee please. GCZ 01:24, 16 October, 2006 (UTC) <i>... in fact added by User:12.218.119.147</i>

<li><b>Rejoinder</b>: I don't even know what's meant by "universal icon" but doubt that this is one.
