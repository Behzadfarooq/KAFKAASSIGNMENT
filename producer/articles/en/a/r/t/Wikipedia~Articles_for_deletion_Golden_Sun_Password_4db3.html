<li><b>HOLD your fire</b>, This article has not been up for a day. Do you know that someone tried to make it dissapear before I even created it? It is a link from the article on Golden Sun and should be separate because someone only wants to know about passwords in depth when he needs to use one. As for the article's usefulness, GOLLY&#160;!!! I know that there is no other place with the information. I know that the knowledge of what a password does is pieced out among - isolated - gamers. Wiki's structure is designed with the intention of gathering and distilling knowledge that is scattered among isolated persons. As for the possibility that the knowledge is solely useful to gamers, is this a criterion for deleting it? Why not pick another group and delete the the entries that are uniquely helpful to that group?</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I suggest the editor of this article to create a wiki in <a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiCities_b967.html" title="WikiCities">WikiCities</a> or other similar resource to start a wiki about the game. I'm sorry, but we are not a GameFAQ repository. -- <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune.welsh_2e22.html" title="User:Rune.welsh">Rune Welsh</a> | <a href="../../../r/u/n/User_talk%7ERune.welsh_7599.html" title="User talk:Rune.welsh">ταλκ</a> | <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#339900">Esperanza</font></a> 21:32, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's an attempt to mis-use Wikipedia as a bulletin board for exchanging passwords between players of a computer game. As per <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a free wiki host or a resource for conducting business</a>.

<li><b>Speedy</b> as having little or no context, at least for an encyclopedia, and a completely inappropriate use of Wikipedia space. Block from recreation. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 00:59, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>If You Read Only One Thing, Make This It</b> GameFAQs says its not the place for this, and frankly the purpose of Wikipedia may not be to store every little thing for every little game, it is meant to compile the knowledge of it's user in a way that makes it conveniant. I see no problem in allowing this page to continue, and people that have a bone to pick with GameFAQs shouldn't take it out on this rather nice idea.
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not a messageboard. It is an encyclopædia. Use <a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiCities_b967.html" title="WikiCities">WikiCities</a> or a free messageboard service. -<a href="../../../l/i/c/User%7ELichYoshi_2634.html" title="User:LichYoshi">LichYoshi</a> 13:52, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The Golden Sun Password article is collecting facts and knowledge. This article is being accused of having no context of misusing Wikipedia as a message board and as an "every little thing of a little game." For the sake of argument, let us say that these accusations are true: What we are still left with is a <b>demand</b> that the article be deleted yesterday. What we are left with is that Wikipedia is not for the likes of you. This article is not a fungus or a virus that will contaminate Wikipedia. This article is not a cancer that is taking over Wikipedia. I believe that the demands that the article be deleted are consuming more Wikipedia resources than the article.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by CobraGT (<a href="../../../c/o/b/User_talk%7ECobraGT_a291.html" title="User talk:CobraGT">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CobraGT_90e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/CobraGT">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>One good thing about a slow process like this is that we can try to explain why it doesn't belong. In the end passwords are part of the game, but listing them don't help readers to <i>understand</i> the game better, so they don't belong in an encyclopedia article. You say it's taking a lot of resources to get it deleted, that's true, but if it says wikipedia will be taken over by similar pages of game passwords/tips/challenges/whatever which will end up consuming a lot more resources than this discussion. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:56, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> but good luck with your wikicities endeavors, if you listen to Rune Welsh's good advice. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_92a1.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M Schedler">★</a> 00:47, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</sup></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> The statement that passwords do not help readers to <i>understand</i> of the game sounds as though you know what you are talking about but the statement is not true. This is like saying that a picture of a particular species of plant does not contribute to an understanding of plants. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by CobraGT (<a href="../../../c/o/b/User_talk%7ECobraGT_a291.html" title="User talk:CobraGT">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CobraGT_90e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/CobraGT">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: You aren't allowed to vote twice. Also, please sign your comments with three or four tildes (~~~~). Also, a picture is nothing like a password. I have played the game and the password does not contribute to understanding of it. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESome_guy_60f7.html" title="User:Some guy">Some guy</a> 04:14, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Oops, I did not mean to look like a clown, obviously. I thought that signing in appended a signature. I did not realized that every person who wants this gets to visit this discussion and count as a zomg! vote. I thought that the "keeps" and "deletes" were captions to cue you in on the comment's intent. I do appreciate your explaining that without rubbing it in.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I'm not the sock puppet of anyone. I just go to a board on GameFAQs and I've known CobraGT for more than a year (I met him on a Golden Sun board.. casually). I know how much people need a PASSWORD guide for Golden Sun.</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia's purpose is to give information right? Well, this article gives information for the Gameboy Advance game, Golden Sun. It will help new players and/or other people who play this game understand Golden Sun's password system. It also helps the player as if you don't have the original Golden Sun, you don't have a password to use. People who just bought this game (part 2) can simply choose a password from the list to use.
