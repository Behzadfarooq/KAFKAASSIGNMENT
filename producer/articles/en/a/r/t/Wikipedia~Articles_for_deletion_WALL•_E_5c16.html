<li><b>Keep</b> Walt Disney have officially announced it as noted on the articles page. And so what if IMDB hasn't even got an article on it. IMDB doesn't know everything. I'm sure they will now, that it has been announced officially.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The only information that exists (officially) is the one sentence blurb in the annual report. That certainly can't be enough to warrant adding it to WP at this time, as it wasn't enough to warrant keeping the article a few weeks ago when the only info was a random floating Disney press release. (key word in previous sentence was "at this time", not "never". <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpikeJones_20f7.html" title="User:SpikeJones">SpikeJones</a> 05:39, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

I don't know if you can describe that as "additional information", as the logo merely depicts the title of the movie; however, I think the existence of an official confirmation by Disney, a preview picture of the main character, and a movie logo already give WALL-E its notability.<a href="../../../s/40/l/User%7ES%40lo_8072.html" title="User:S@lo">S@lo</a> 06:05, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Since it is now official, it is most likrly no more than 6 and a half months from a teaser trailer. I think, given this is the next film from a studio that has made all movies that have grossed 150 million +, lately 200 million +,It is only a matter of time before this bacomes very essential.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Bob Iger has released the first picture and logo from the film, and it has been confirmed that Andrew Stanton is directing. The release date has also been announced by Disney some time ago. Back when we deleted this the first two times, there wasn't that much information supporting a keep. We finally have that info right here.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> it does not exist yet. All we have is speculation and an announcement that something will/may happen. Wikipedia is an <i>encyclopaedia</i> not a film rumours website. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 12:56, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: there is precedence of Disney announcing items in their annual reports (or elsewhere) that later do not ever come to fruition (the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tron_2.0.html" title="Tron 2.0">Tron 2.0</a> movie, not just the game, is just one example of announced projects that never materialized). Not saying that's the case here, just saying that waiting for more info before creating the article is prudent. As for JimHillMedia, while we all probably read JHM, WP has been rather strict on not using blogs as sources for material.<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpikeJones_20f7.html" title="User:SpikeJones">SpikeJones</a> 13:15, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If Bob Iger feels fit to announce it, then that's official enough for me. There really is no point in deleting it again. If the project is eventually cancelled, feel free to delete it, but this page should stay for now. <a href="../../../r/m/s/User%7ERMS_Oceanic_e623.html" title="User:RMS Oceanic">RMS Oceanic</a> 15:26, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - as far as I'm concerned, a letter from the Disney CEO posted on the Disney website with an approved image is confirmation enough. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRealFennShysa_6315.html" title="User:TheRealFennShysa">TheRealFennShysa</a> 15:51, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Statements made by corporate executives are inherently "speculative and forward-looking". If actual work begins on the film, there will be press-releases issued and information will be made available to entertainment industry press. A comment by an executive who has no actual role in the production of the film cannot be taken as confirmation of anything. --Lee Vonce 17:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - This is Pixar animation Studios. If there are pictures of it about and the CEO of its head company announces it, it is real. Pixar's animated films take 4+ years to make. I highly doubt they will get over 2 years into production on a film and then dump it. I have even heard word about 2 years ago that they were already making models of the characters. If they are that far, it costs a lot of money ot make those models. They are not going to waste money on a movie they are possibly not going to release. Even one of the animators at Pixar said on his blog that he is working on the film after Ratatouille, being Wall-E. This film WILL be released in 2008, no matter what you say and you are going to be proved wrong. And before any film goes ahead a film studio, the chief creative officer runs it by the CEO of the company. In which case John Lasseter from Pixar who is Chief Creative Officer at both studios would have reported it to the CEO of Disney, and he has had the greenlight to announce it.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article may discuss a future project, but along with the announcement was released a still from the film featuring the main character, and the official logo has appeared at other sources. This should be evidence enough to the production of this film. --<a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidesim_be77.html" title="User:Ridesim">Ridesim</a> 18:08, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Is there a list of proposed Disney films to which we might re-direct this article?

<li><b>Comment</b> - Variety has also posted an article regarding WALL• E <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957684.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957684.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this was the first time that Jim Morris' role as producer in this film was mentioned, and that it was <b>not</b> announced in Bob Iger's letter to shareholders (which would mean that we have some additional information regarding the project). <a href="../../../s/40/l/User%7ES%40lo_8072.html" title="User:S@lo">S@lo</a> 03:39, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - official announcement, image, media attention, and now an exact release date (June 27, 2008 - from the Variety article). This seems pretty solid. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 10:22, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just an afterthought (<b>comment</b>): High-cost animated films like this one take many years to make (around 4-5), so a release date within a year and a half means that the film is already well into production. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 02:55, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
