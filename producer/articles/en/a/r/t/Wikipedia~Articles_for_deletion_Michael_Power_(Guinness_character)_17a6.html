<li><b>Keep</b>. I was going to initially suggest merging conservatively to the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guiness.html" title="Guiness">Guiness</a> article, but they made a bloody movie featuring him, for Christ's sake.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Can anyone tell me why this should not be merged into <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol_advertising.html" title="Alcohol advertising">alcohol advertising</a> or maybe merged with some of that and split into a wider article on Guinness campaigns (several of which have been considered influential by the admittedly self-obsessed advertising industry)? A whole article of this size (about the same size as the <i>real</i> <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Cheshire_7c65.html" title="Leonard Cheshire">Leonard Cheshire</a>) on a <i>fictional</i> character from an <i>advert</i> rather than a work of actual literature seems grossly disproportionate. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 18:31, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The place to merge would be <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness.html" title="Guinness">Guinness</a>, but I don't think that's the appropriate thing to do. Similar articles could be written on other advertising campaigns, surely. I'd think this falls under <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a>. In other words, merging this into <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness.html" title="Guinness">Guinness</a> (or <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol_advertising.html" title="Alcohol advertising">alcohol advertising</a>) would disproportionately discuss one single ad campaign at the expense of others. Instead, I think Guinness should have a summary of the Michael Power campaign but not in the same level of detail (this would also address <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">systemic bias</a>). Incidentally, when I started the article, I thought "Michael Power" was a real person. That's the general attitude in Cameroon, and that's how Guinness is treating this character. People even debate what village he's from. Perhaps this should be made clearer in the article. —<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 18:41, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I still think that an article of this length on a fictional character from an advert is grossly disproportionate. But I'd be happy to support an article on Guinness campaigns generally (as I said). I just don't think that articles of this length on ephemeral characters are desirable. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 19:58, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ephemeral? His face is known across an entire continent and he's starred in a feature film. He's been constantly in the public eye for eight years right now.

<li>Yes, ephemeral. In that the campaign will end, and once it has ended people will forget about him.

<dd>Besides, you could just as easily make the "ephemeral" argument for almost any book, movie, CD, TV show, athlete, politician, or event of this year, no?

<li><b>Strong keep</b> The article is historical. With it I can learn about something that happened elsewhere in the world. From it I wonder if Western "image marketing" is new to Africa. I heard of someone easily quitting smoking once they notice how the marketing affects them. So the article is significant.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Naturally most of the info cited is from Guiness, I don't imagine there are a lot of other organizations out there producing literature about their campaign. This article is very informative and obviously culturally relavent to large parts of Africa. <a href="../../../w/h/e/Where%27s_the_beef__e887.html" title="Where's the beef?">Where's the beef?</a> is another example of advertising campaigns gaining cultural relevance.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Not only is it a well-written article, the Michael Power phenomenon is an important African cultural development - a media-created character that has popularity and resonance across the continent.
