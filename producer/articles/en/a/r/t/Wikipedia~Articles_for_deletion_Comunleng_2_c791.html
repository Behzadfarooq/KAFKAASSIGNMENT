<p>This article was proposed for deletion in May, but after <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Comunleng_f212.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Comunleng">a VfD that made me shake my head in despair</a> there was no consensus. This is a non-notable conlang ("known by an only guy" according to <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoLagrange_38c1.html" title="User:ArnoLagrange">ArnoLagrange</a>) that has managed to sit on Wikipedia and become spread around the internet in mirrors and apparently by other self-promotion. Part of the reason people objected to the suggestion that it was original research last time around was that there are three interwiki links, though people didn't seem to appreciate that it's possible to create articles worthy of deletion in multiple languages. The French and Spanish versions of the article are extensive but have unanswered questions about such things as just how significant this language is on their talk pages. After the last VfD <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">func</a> put various questions on the talk page relating to verifiability and notability. These have not been answered.

<li>Your complaint comes down to wanting it deleted, being disappointed in those who didn't delete it in the <i>previous</i> VfD, and relisting it after some time has passed. Unless you have evidence of fraud in the previous VfD, or a <i>significant</i> amount of time has passed (3 months minimum) without update or expansion, pages shouldn't be relisted on VfD. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_9414.html" title="User:Almafeta">Almafeta</a> 07:00, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Could you point me to the three month rule please? I see you also invoked this mysterious policy on the talk page.

<li>There is no "three month rule". I once nominated an article for deletion twelve hours after the previous VfD had closed, with no changes having been made to the article page, on the grounds that the circumstances that had lead to the article being kept had changed.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with Trilobite that the last VfD was a disgrace. I agree that this article should be removed. I could not <i>in good faith</i> vote to delete this article at this time. We should not be dipping into the well again because we don't like the first taste. This should apply to any consensus decision, by the way: changes to CSD, RFA, anything. It's bad form, and weakens respect for "process". A <i>four</i> month moratorium sounds reasonable to me. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 07:19, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The nature of a Wiki is that anyone can modify anything at any time in any way. There is no logic to a 4 month lock after modification: it runs counter to how this 'place' works. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 14:29, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Whoa! I've been misunderstood before, but never so egregiously! (I blame all my problems on poor communication. Just never on <i>my</i> poor communication.) I was suggesting that when consensus in a <b>vote</b> has been reached, that that <b>vote</b> not be re-introduced again for four months. And before anyone whips out "show me the policy" of course it's not policy. If you don't feel bound by a vote you didn't participate in, Splash, does that mean you don't recognize as <i>policy</i> anything you didn't vote on? (That's a rhetorical question.) <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Sunwear_1720.html" title="Pacific Sunwear">Pacific Sunwear</a> was kept by a 7 to 1 vote and you voted keep. So imagine <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENova_Cygni_58ed.html" title="User:Nova Cygni">Nova Cygni</a> thinks this was a "spectacular example of faulty logic" and nominates it again in four weeks. And imagine that by some crazy coincidence everyone was on wikibreak but for a bunch of rabid surf-short haters. When you'rE back from the beach and find PS gone, you'd feel cheated by the system.

<li>There's a problem with this "4 month rule", and that is it's open to abuse by people who want to keep an article. Let's say I write an article on Origami chocolate and manage to convince just enough people its a real thing so that it just barely misses consensus to delete. It looks like that vote was a fluke and it will be deleted when it comes up for a vote again. So I nominate it in 3 months, and it again evades deletion because "it's last vote was not 4 months ago". Now it has another 4 month reprieve. Again in 3 months I nominate it, etc. This process goes on forever, and my travesty of an article on chocolate origami stays in Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:17, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think it's very wiki to maintain that once a vote has been conducted and it ends in no consensus (there was certainly not a <i>consensus to keep</i> last time, it just defaulted to keep), that an article must be kept for all time and the matter must be considered settled once and for all. Common sense surely dictates that where there are sensible reasons, and you don't do it constantly, it's okay to reopen the debate about an article's inclusion, particularly when simple requests like providing one source other than stuff that has itself been pulled from Wikipedia go unfulfilled. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 16:22, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't give a hit about the last VfD. A bad result last time does not justify a bad result this time. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:12, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, as per my commentary during the first <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Comunleng_f212.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Comunleng">vfd</a> and my comments on the talk page. I understand and appreciate the above comments concerning consensus, ie: it is possible to abuse our system by repeatedly placing an article on VFD. However, this isn't about the VFD process, it is about what Wikipedia is all about. The issues regarding <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> are at the core of our ability to maintain a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, ie: to give <b>undue coverage</b> to a language virtually no one has heard of is to allow Wikipedia to be used as an <b>advertising platform</b>. I think the Wikipedian who wrote the original article was perfectly aware that by placing <b>his creation</b> on Wikipedia, it would be copied to dozens of mirrors, floating lists of conlangs, etc. We are not here to <b>establish</b> the notability of the things we write articles on: they have to <b>already be established</b>. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 16:15, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Just because the article previously survived a VfD vote doesn't mean that that error shouldn't be corrected as soon as possible. Non-notable, original research. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 17:05, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It defaulted to keep last time after no consensus based largely on some flimsy claims. Several people voted to keep because it has interwiki links... well, the Spanish version (the only other one I can read) is longer, but it too fails to address any claims this language has to relevance outside the personal dabblings of its creator. It's not surprising that a conlang has interwiki links; conlangers are likely to be also speakers of several natural languages. This is not like the repeated GNAA VfD, which received a good deal of attention and roughly 100 votes and still arrived at no consensus; this got comparatively little attention, and many outstanding concerns from last time were not addressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the 6 Keep votes last time, three were based on its having interwiki links. One makes the claim that "conlangs are a special case", not backing it up with any reasoning. One is from an anonymous user claiming that it is a "well-recognized auxlang name"; when challenged, produced a Wikipedia mirror as more evidence of its existence. The last claimed it was a userful article even if the subject was not widely known -- taking the position that all original research should stay if the articles are good?</p>
<p>I don't care about Comunleng; I just want to make the case that the renomination is not out of process (and yes, I will kick the <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EASS_3337.html" title="WP:ASS">WP:ASS</a> of anyone who renominates GNAA anytime soon), and that the previous default keep should not be a reason to dismiss this nomination entirely. This is the sort of article <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> was meant to provide justification for deleting; there's a conlang Wikicity <a href="http://conlang.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://conlang.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">here</a> for just such things. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 17:48, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think anyone is making the case that <i>in general</i>, "no consensus" results are errors to be corrected, and I agree with the default to keep where the community is genuinely split. But sometimes we come to no consensus based on faulty or incomplete information—why shouldn't we be able to correct that within a reasonable timeframe? I believe sufficient time has passed since the last VfD for any evidence regarding its verifiability to be presented, and it has not been. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 21:25, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

No citations here or in the interwiki items. Google results are squat. No indication of any legitimate quantity of speakers, nor of a historic body of speakers whose use of the language was repressed and caused the language's extinction (as with natural languages of aborginal peoples).

<li>I agree in part and should have been clearer - the POV alone is not a reason for deletion, it was a criticism of the article as it stood. However it's an interesting question how to replace the POV with verifiable neutral information when the subject is inherently unverifiable, being apparently someone's unpublicized and undiscussed (let alone analyzed) invention. My personal view (irrelevant to this discussion) is that a conlang is inherently more interesting than lots of other kinds of thought experiments, but until the language achieves notability by being known to somebody besides its creator, this isn't the right place to publicize it. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 02:49, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Calton and others may not care, but I do. The <b>three-month rule</b> may be informal, but is a mechanism that helps keep VfD from becoming <i>even more</i> overloaded with gripes about prior decisions. We need consistent due process.

<li>Would you really want an article reading "poop" to stay in wikipedia for 4 months based on a stupid principle? You must not care much for the contents of wikipedia then. I'm sorry but sometimes votes are skewed by incomplete information, and when new information is brought to light it makes sense to readdress the issue. Three months is a very long time. Now, assuming this is kept because people are voting purely on the previous vote not on <i>the actual article</i>, would we have to wait 3 months from its original nomination or three months from this one?

A couple partisan trolls voting keep can skew the process, and it <i>is</i> possible (albeit highly unlikely) that their actions could result in a default keep for even the shittiest of articles, including "poop". <i>If</i> that unlikely event did happen, would you really defend the article on a technicality?

<li>My common sense tells me that it is <i>so much better</i> to let one stupid article (that no one but the author will ever look up) live here with a "totally disputed" tag for a month and half, than to establish a precedent that articles can be reopened on Vfd sooner. This precedent is the surest way to have VfD hit 200 articles/per day before 2006. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 22:40, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why is it an inherently bad thing for VFD to hit 200 articles a day? Doesn't it just reflect that people are determining 200 articles a day to be deletion-worthy?

<li>Assuming the number of complaints now about the process at 100/day (and the CSD debate) I imagine that double that volume would cause <b>enormous</b> complaint. Since the Wikipedia solution seems to be to add to CSDs to reduce volume, I could also imagine such an upsurge contributing ultimately to more bureaucracy. Normally, VfD's are very accurate at screening out crap, but when they fail, better to abide with them, then to propose other solutions which either increase the risk of VfD expansion, or cause the proliferation of regulation, or both. An extra 90 days for a stupid article is simply not damaging enough to merit unbalancing the VfD process. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 03:16, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

The article is totally unverifiable and non-notable, but you'd rather go exactly by the book (the book in your head, since the three month rule isn't policy at all) and spend your time rules-lawyering and arguing about procedure so you can preserve it. If you're so keen on keeping it, how about providing a reference for the information in it that doesn't originate with Wikipedia, and finding something that indicates it's a notable topic?

<li>Referencing the English wikiarticle for the Spanish one was as much an inappropriate citation as referencing the Spanish article here is. The difference between self-referencing in an article and referencing another wikiarticle is nil: both are unverified recursion, and may as well be original research. It's no different than citing a mirror of this article. Only sources that are completely independent from any form of wikipedia whatsoever should be regarded as eligible for being considered valid; I would think that would be obvious enough that it shouldn't need a policy dictating it, though I would be glad to propose such a policy if there isn't one. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 15:32, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In light of point one, though, I wonder why the process matters. I.E., in the absence of affirmative arguments, does that not obligate us to repeat the deletion process until such time as an affirmative argument about merit is produced or the article is successfully deleted? Whether we wait 4 weeks between nominations, 4 months, or 4 years, all of the first bullet will remain true in the absence of affirmative arguments or changes to the article's content that meet, for instance, the requirements set forth by <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">func</a> - which would constitute an affirmative argument for keeping it. What makes a 4 week interval disrespectful or abusive of the VFD process, but not a lengthier one? An article that is infused with "obvious craptitude" has obvious craptitude, regardless of the time at which it is discussed, the number of edits between nominations, or any other consideration not related to the content of the article and the standards for an acceptable article. I believe voting to keep or delete an article based on the results and date of a previous VFD is what constitutes abuse of the VFD process. The process exists to judge the article's content in its present form and, if the present form is unacceptable for Wikipedia, to determine the proper remedy: merge, redirect, delete, move. Either this article is or is not acceptable; if a user judges it unacceptable but votes keep, that is abuse. If a user judges it acceptable but votes delete, that is abuse. If a user judges it unacceptable and in light of that nominates it for deletion, as <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> has, that's proper use of the process.</li>

<li>I must object most strenuously to one user thinking he can hold the VfD to ransom. If you want something done around here on the Wiki, do it yourself. Don't go demanding that other users do it for you. Your vote is no more (and no less) important to the process than anyone else's. If you want to vote keep because of the reasons you give above, that's fine, but don't go <i>demanding</i> that the rest of us do things to placate you. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 02:50, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>And, you seem to think there is some lack of clarity over inconclusive VfDs. There's not: they are kept unless there is a "rough consensus" to delete. Then, they can be renominated anytime someone feels like it. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 02:52, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Held to ransom? Did my vote somehow become <i><b>really important</b></i> and I wasn't notified? Stating conditions upon which you'll change your vote is almost standard practice: I'll vote "keep" if (this article is expanded <i>or</i> the other one is deleted <i>or</i> its notability is proven to me). Look closely that last one. Isn't that, to use your word, "demanding", that others commit some action to "placate"? I'm also puzzled by your repeated misinterpretations. I state I think "we should wait four mounths between VfD nominations", your response is about "locks on editing articles". I raise "how long is appropiate between nominations", your response adresses " no consensus means keep". I'm left with several possibilities: Either you aren't reading my comments before you respond, you are failing to understand my intent (which could be my fault), or you are being deliberate. This questions was raised when <s>Trilobite</s> func first stated he was going to re-nominate (see Eventually Back to VfD) so it should some as no suprise now. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 04:32, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Voting delete-unless-made-better is quite different. It (in my case, anyway) usually means that I don't think the article <i>can</i> be made into a keepable one, but I am not sufficiently knowledgeable of the area to verify this fact to my own satisfaction. I mean to encourage others to help out who know where to look for information. Your condition here, however, has nothing at all to do with content and is something you <i>could</i> just go and do and yourself rather than expecting that others will do it for you just because you say so. As for my <i>"no consensus means keep"</i> response, this was because you said <i>"The only open point is what the appropiate process for</i> inconclusive <i>VfDs is"</i>, and the appropriate process is keep. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 16:09, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm starting to doubt my ability to form english-like sentences.

From the context of this discussion, a reasonable person would read that sentence as <i>"The only open point is what the appropiate [time until renomination] process for</i> inconclusive <i>VfDs is"</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems that to me that Wikipedia's rules state that if there is no consensus, the default is to keep the article. If there are people who are unhappy with this, and keep proposing deletion whenever they have failed to get something deleted, this is an <b>abuse of the VfD process,</b> as it simply is an attempt to try to wear out the patience of those who have voted to keep in a previous VfD. -- <a href="../../../b/r/g/User%7EBRG_b05e.html" title="User:BRG">BRG</a> 18:53, July 16, 2005 (UTC)

<li>"Keep proposing deletion" is an odd way to describe it. It was proposed once before and several weeks later has been put up again. Have you actually read the article? Have you read the comments on its talk page? Have you read the previous VfD? Have you read the arguments set out on this page? <i>Can you provide a single source external to Wikipedia that verifies the content of the article or establishes its notability?</i> Would you rather Wikipedia was full of nonsense than permit a second VfD after a decent interval for an article that no one has shown to be encyclopedic?

<li><b>Delete</b> - unverified, and certaintly unnotable.

<li><b>Delete</b> (I voted Delete the last time this came up, just got a notification of this current vote.) I agree with func above. Wikipedia reports on things already notable in the outside world. It's not an advertising portal for non-notable things. (Non-notable does not mean "bad", it just means not notable.) Note that I would not vote to delete articles on conlangs like <a href="../../../c/e/q/Ceqli.html" title="Ceqli">Ceqli</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovio.html" title="Slovio">Slovio</a> for which one can show the existence of some kind of community of people, going back a number of years, who have an interest in the language.

This article is a fly-speck, and if it had been simply trimmed back to a verfiable stub and left for six months, there would have been no real harm done. But when we start jacking with the system because we get our knickers in a twist, <i>then</i> there is harm done.The last VfD was conducted properly and closed properly, and even though I think they were idiots, it's insufferable to simply say, "Well, we think that was dumb, so it doesn't count." <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 23:48, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The fact of the matter is, it's back on VfD, whether you like this or not is besides the point. This is an opportunity for the articles supporters to argue why we should keep. So far, not one of them has said why this article is worthy of staying on wikipedia. Every keep vote has complained about the proccess. Renominating this article is not against the rules. I do not see that there was any other option but to renominate, because every article on wikipedia must be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a>, a fair chance was given on the article's talk page for evidence that the subject can be varied to be submitted into the article. No such evidence was submitted. It is fair and correct therefore, that, considering that there's no evidence of verifiability, that the article be subject to another VfD.

<ul>
<li>Brenneman, I answer your four questions in this way:</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>1. Closely re-nominating inconclusive votes for consensus (which does not apply in this case, as the month's time passed does not constitute "closely following") improves perception of the process by allowing the process to do what it exists to do: efficiently dispose of articles that do not belong on wikipedia through an appropriate method, of which deletion, merging, renaming, and redirecting without merger are common choices. It ensures that the appropriate keeping of inconclusive articles is kept as a temporary measure, and forces debate to continue until it is resolved in consensus - either clear consensus to keep or to delete. Indeed, I believe that policy should <i>require</i> renomination of any inconclusive VFD after no later than two to three weeks.</dd>
<dd>2. The possible follow-on effects are desirable, as more inconclusive VFDs may be revisted. Furthermore, we are setting valuable precedent that inconclusive VFDs, rendered inconclusive due to keep arguments that are quickly shown to be factually false or otherwise faulty (accurate descriptors, I believe, for all the "keep" votes in the original Comunleng VFD) are no different from consensus-to-keep VFDs that are subsequently shown to have been kept on false premises. Finally, we are establishing that articles are to be voted on due to judgement of their content alone, and not due to procedural matters that have no place, I believe, in VFD discussion. I repeat and clarify what I said earlier: to vote keep for this or any other article, for any reason at all, if you believe it does not meet such criteria as verifiability required, no original research allowed, no advertising allowed, or encyclopedic nature required, is a worse abuse of VFD than any renomination could ever be.</dd>
<dd>3. What other options are there? This is an unsalvagable article. It is vanity about a conlang so unnotable that it is unverifiable to the point of being indistinguishable, in my mind, from a hoax. Three or four reasons all of which the deletion policy defines as grounds for deletion. I can't find anything in this article that belongs on wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>4. As I see it, as a VFD can be closed after 5 days, then by the same reasoning that 5 days is sufficient time for consensus to be reached and edits that would change an article's status from Deletion Required to Keepworthy to be made, 5 days is sufficient time for new edits to be made prior to a revisiting. I believe inconclusive VFDs are more often inconclusive because of faulty reasoning one way or the other than because the article's contents do not lend themselves to consensus; 5 days allows enough time for those articles whose contents do require some clarification to be edited enough to tip the discussion in the appropriate direction.</dd>
<dd>Every article and every topic has a fundamental essence. That essence is either Deletion Required or Keepworthy. It is the purpose of VFD to discover that essence with maximum efficiency. If its essence is Deletion Required, our duty as editors is to eradicate the offending article. If its essence is Keepworthy, our duty as editors is to edit and reshape the article until it is someday transmuted to Ideal. Yes, I'm being foolishly metaphysical, but I believe it is wholly inappropriate to allow inconclusive VFDs to stand. They <i>need</i> to be renominated. And in this case, it <i>needs</i> to be deleted, and it did not "pass" anything. Discussion was closed too soon, and the original "keep" votes were never legitimate to begin with. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 03:43, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
