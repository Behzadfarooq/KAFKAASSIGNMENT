<p>An astonishing example of...erm...buscruft. I've no objection to this being merged into the main article on the bus company if people feel it's worth saving, but - to be honest - I don't really think it is.

<li><b>Delete</b> and don't merge. Whilst I agree with what Uncle G says about the verifiability and neutrality of the article, it remains non-notable as a subject for an article. The fact that the practice happens is quite enough information and so should go in the main article, especially since the bus company has a fairly extensive <a href="http://www.buses.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.buses.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">website</a> of its own which <b>already includes this list</b> (and is likely to be more up to date than us) and even lists the manufacturers of each bus in the fleet! – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 16:04, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, there's more information from secondary sources to be had than just the 1 sentence. From the cited articles we can source the fact that a competition was run to pick names for the buses, the fact that originally at least two alternatives were considered to using names of famous people, the 18 specific names that were added in April 2004, and the 19 specific names that were added in September 2005. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:03, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> – I make no dispute with your facts, but what's the value of that information? Just because there's information out there doesn't mean it's remotely appropriate for an encyclopædia. Those sources could be given as further reading from the main article, and besides, there's no reason why the mention which goes in the main article should only be one sentence as you seem to be concerned about. It could be several, but it should not, in my opinion, be a reproduction of the list which I stress is available on the bus company website. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 18:25, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You came close to answering your own question. The value of that particular information that I mentioned is context and detail, of course. It's more informative for the reader to know the history than just (to quote the article) "Since 1999 many of the buses have had the name of a famous person commemorated on the front.". Otherwise we might as well have articles like "Bill Clinton was President of the United States. There was a scandal.". Note that we are not discussing the article at hand (and I didn't say above that we were), but your assertion above that "the fact that the practice happens is quite enough information". It isn't enough information. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:52, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> – There is indeed a wider point at issue here. But to compare the <i>importance</i> or <i>usefulness</i> of the bus-naming policy of the Brighton and Hove Bus Company with the Presidency of Bill Clinton is not a realistic comparison. And (to discuss the article at hand) it is enough information for us here when the other (detail) information is available in the sources for people who want to dig. On the whole, Wikipedia doesn't feature sources copied out verbatim, but rather précis of those sources for the benefit of readers who want to retrieve the information efficiently. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 19:02, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a very realistic and pointed comparison. What you are missing is that your evaluation of the "importance or usefulness" of the information being discussed here is entirely subjective. I can imagine that there are people in Brighton and Hove for whom the scandal related to Bill Clinton is wholly unimportant and useless information that has no impact upon their lives, but to whom knowledge about the way that the local bus company names its buses is important and useful. (Read the very first sentence of the very first article that I cited, for example.) And the issue that we are discussing is not the copying out of primary sources (which I've not actually disagreed with you about and which is a perfectly good point). I explicitly wrote "secondary sources" above, and pointed out that there is material to be had from those secondary sources beyond "the fact that the practice happens", just as there is information to be had from secondary sources beyond the fact that "there was scandal". It turns out that it is about 3 paragraphs' worth. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:45, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>We'll have to agree to differ (although I think we're somewhat talking about different things.) I defend my subjectivity though. The content of Wikipedia should be objective. Anybody's decision of what to contribute (and/or leave alone) is <i>always</i> subjective. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 19:55, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
