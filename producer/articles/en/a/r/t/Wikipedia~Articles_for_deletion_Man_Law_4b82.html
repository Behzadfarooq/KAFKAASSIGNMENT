<li><b>Keep</b>,There is no official policy on notability. Given that this advertising campaign has seen presence beyond the ads themselves, including but not limited to appearances on popular talk shows (like <i>The Tonight Show With Jay Leno</i>), news articles (NYT <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/01/business/media/01adco.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/01/business/media/01adco.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, Detroit Free Press <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060516/BUSINESS07/605160353/-1/BUSINESS07" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060516/BUSINESS07/605160353/-1/BUSINESS07" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and Business Week <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_21/b3985001.htm?chan=innovation_branding_top+stories" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_21/b3985001.htm?chan=innovation_branding_top+stories" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>) blog presence, etc; this topic is rapidly becoming a component of popular culture distinct from the product with which it is associated. This topic does not satisfy any of the what wikipedia is not; Crystal ball is reserved for the removal of articles which speak exclusively of future events, this is an event in progress. A Google search for "man law" gives 3 of the top 10 on this subject (none wikipedia). <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 15:42, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think I disagree that it has achieved that sort of notability, and I doubt that it will. It's not even a "Make 7up Yours" at this point (which doesn't have an article). I'm not sure where the criteria for a notable advertising campaign worthy of an encyclopedia article is, but I don't believe this comes close. A google search on a not-notable topic will necessarily return results that refer to it, so I'm not sure what that proves. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 18:16, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Current ad campaign, may be remembered, may not. We remember Supds and Joe and the beef lady long after the fact. Without a crystal ball, no way to tell if this will stand the test of time. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 21:48, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, There doesn't seem to be a need to delete it. The information is accurate (within the realm of the commercial), and verifiable. While the long-term relevance of the campaign may be in question, its existence is not. As long as the article is factual who's to say what others should or should not be able to look up on an encyclopedia where the content is entirely user supplied? Jedi697b 04:39, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - There should probably be a waiting period for articles about commercials, as its hard to tell which advertising campaigns are "important" until after the fact. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 04:45, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Wikipedia is and should be a place where people can go to find answers to their questions. After seeing the commercials on TV, I went to the man laws website to find out who these people were. The site provided some information, but not enough for me to identify those people outside of my experience. The Wikipedia entry provides further information on these people's identities that is not readily available and collected anywhere else. Thus deletion of this article effectively deprives would-be seekers of information of an easy avenue to the answers they seek. This is the purpose of Wikipedia. With no compelling argument in favor of deletion, any deletion discussion should wait until this topic has *left* popular culture (should it do so), not while it is of legitimate interest. This commercial series is unique in that it begs investigation and participation, a characteristic uncommon in advertising. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 12:53, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The laws are quite funny.

<li><b>Keep</b>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>. I echo the comments of Kershner and Jedi697b. Comparing entries in Wikipedia to those that would be seen in normal encyclopedias should not serve as the sole barometer for what should be allowable in this encyclopedia. Wikipedia has many strengths (and uses) above and beyond standard encyclopedias, and the ability to keep pace with current events is one of them. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomwithanh_e1db.html" title="User:Tomwithanh">Tomwithanh</a> 04:05, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Vegaswikian, could you elaborate on what you are referring to? The ads are a collection of very similar television advertisements entitled 'Man Laws'. This article is the article for the ads themselves.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I thought this was the worst idea for an article that I could think of at the time, and I wanted to see if it would take off.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Notable campaign. This wiki entry was the only way I could actually find the official website, google searches came up empty. It also details every member of the square table, information you can't find anywhere else. Wikipedia is a source of information, and it gave me what I wanted. People tend to come here for... anything. There is plenty of useless facts filling the wikipedia, but they are only useless until you actually want to know it.

<li><b>Keep.</b> After watching the commercial I felt the need to find more information, and wikipedia had not only the website linking to the main site but also notable information.

<li><b>Keep.</b> It is a campaign that can and does require more information with very notable people within the entire campaign.

<li><b>Comment</b> I see lots of claims of notability, without anything to substantiate it, except perhaps Kershner's notation of news articles.

The Man Laws website has received thousands of submitted man laws and has approved just over a hundred of them <a href="http://www.manlaws.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.manlaws.com" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. This interaction with the fans of the commercials is demonstrative of yet another reason why this article has continued merit. What separates this commercial series from the rest of the pack, granting notability and merit includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>An ensemble cast of celebrities appealing to a wide demographic.</li>
<li>Interactivity with the audience through the '<a href="../../../w/a/t/Watercooler_show.html" title="Watercooler show">watercooler</a>' concept as well as the official website.</li>
<li>A dissociation from the product akin to the <a href="../../../t/a/c/Taco_Bell_chihuahua_7a06.html" title="Taco Bell chihuahua">Taco Bell chihuahua</a>, the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budweiser_Frogs_d296.html" title="Budweiser Frogs">Budweiser Frogs</a>, the <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energizer_Bunny_00c5.html" title="Energizer Bunny">Energizer Bunny</a> and the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburglar.html" title="Hamburglar">Hamburglar</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that it would probably be more appropriate for this article to be entitled 'Man Laws' instead of 'Man Law'. That error is my own. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 00:51, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Query</b> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a>, in what way does this article not satisfy the definition of notable?: "A topic has notability if it is known outside a narrow interest group or constituency". Quite clearly, the commercial series prevalance on TV with a substantive 'cast', coupled with cast members on late night talk shows, news articles, blog activity and watercooler behavior establishes a wide interest group. As this is my first AfD, I am not sufficiently familiar with the Wikipedia usage of notability as a criteria to be certain that my interpretation equates that of the community as a whole. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 19:29, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> i know several offenders of manlaws, and to me it is a very emotional subject.--Mattfoley 01:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> AFAIK blog activity counts for little or nothing and I'm not sure what watercooler activity you're referring to. Users posting in the AfD that they discuss this commercial at the watercooler definitely doesn't count for anything. A newspaper article in which it is reported that there is a lot of watercooler talk about this campaign might count for something (though I would suspect a slow news day and a lazy reporter working from a Miller Lite press release). Celebrities in a commercial is not unusual. The late night talk show appearances and news articles might be getting somewhere, as I wrote above, but again I'm not so sure that's unusual for a commercial either. There are any number of longer-running commercial campaigns that I can think of that don't have articles: Make 7 Up Yours, 1-800-CALL-ATT, the Old Navy Commercials, etc. (and which I'm not sure should have articles either) which to some degree makes me think this one shouldn't either. Can it be proven to be exceptionally popular (or unpopular), can it be proven to have been exceptionally successful (or unsuccessful), has it won any awards, has it been spoofed, etc.? An article for Tastes Great, Less Filling would make sense, since that campaign's notability can be easily established. Man Law, however: not now and not anytime soon, I suspect. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 22:35, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you for the explanation. Obviously we have material disagreements on the notability of this topic, but your comments lead me to a better understanding of your perspective on the matter and the usage of the term notable within the Wikipedia community. My primary contention on the difference between the ad campaigns you cite and this one is that this satisfies both a dissociation of product (similar to the other Wikipedia articles cited previously) and interactivity (create / talk about man laws). These two characteristics cause the audience to have questions and comments about the commercial series and not the product. The result of this is that Wikipedia can represent a place where information on the commercial can be collected and presented concisely and for which that information has a substantive audience, as demonstrated by the many 'keeps' noted above. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 01:47, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
