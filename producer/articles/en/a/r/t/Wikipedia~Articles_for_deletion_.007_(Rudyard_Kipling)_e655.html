<li><b>Weak keep</b> - a little research reveals it is about a locomotive not a bullet calibre, so its one fact is incorrect!

<dd>No, having articles whose only content is "A short story by Rudyard Kipling. The .007 is probably meaning caliber-number. This story has no relation to secret agent James Bond (codenamed 007)" makes WP a laughingstock. If it still looks like that after it's been on AfD for a week, there is clearly not enough interest among editors—and thus, presumably, WP readers in general—to make it worthwhile, at least at this time.</dd>
<dd>Besides, which do you think is more likely to make WP a laughingstock: Good articles on bad (read, "uncultured") topics, or barely readable articles on good topics? --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZenohockey_178b.html" title="User:Zenohockey">zenohockey</a> 02:24, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The article has been expanded since it was nominated, and is now a much less obvious deletion candidate.

<dd>If you're talking about me... well... I can't speak for others but I like to spend a little bit more time when I'm adding material to an article than when I'm commenting on it in an AfD. I shoot from the hip sometimes in an AfD comment, but I try not to when I'm editing an article. I wanted to get my "keep" in early, and I wasn't sure when I'd have time to work on the article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:25, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And if you're talking about me, who took the time to nominate it...well, that's what I felt like doing. And lo, it led to a vast improvement in the article, didn't it?

<li><b>Keep</b> (or if that fails, <b>merge and redirect</b> it to the author article). Story by famous author should be covered especially when it's about antropomorphic locomotives, which don't seem to be his standard fare. I don't see any good reason to delete content about stories by Kipling in particular one that has been cleaned up. BTW, shouldn't this be at <a href="../../../2E/0/0/.007.html" title=".007">.007</a> without the modifier with a redirect at 007 (Rudyard Kipling) for those who forget the dot? - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:03, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
