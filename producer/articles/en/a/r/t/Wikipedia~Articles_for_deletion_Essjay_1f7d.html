<li>Yeah, thanks for clearing up what I meant Dhartung. Moe the reliability of wikipedia is the subject of open debate. Recent studies have shown that it is more or less as accurate and comprehensive as a paper encyclopedia.

<dd>Okay, here is my assessment of what is going on here; a person, whom we will call "Ryan Jordan" acted as a source in an article for the New Yorker. In it, he discussed his works as an admin on Wikipedia. However, he did so under what is now believed to be a pseudonym, and a false identity. This was then discovered, and revealed - much to the chagrin of the New Yorker, and to some extent, Wikipedia. As I see it, the question breaks down as follows:
<ul>
<li>Were Robert Jordan's comments in the New Yorker article sufficient to consider him a notable figure?</li>
<li>Was the subsequent coverage of <s>Robert</s> Ryan Jordan's "true" identity sufficient to consider him a notable, or encyclopedic figure?</li>
<li>Were the above, combined, sufficient to make <s>Robert</s> Ryan Jordan a notable figure.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Bear in mind that the guidelines under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> are <i>guidelines</i>; they are as rules of thumb as notability; not hard and fast rules.</dd>
<dd>With that said, I will have to say that he is not notable. His initial actions, as a source to the New Yorker, were not notable. The attention he later received was not, in fact, directed at him - rather at the <i>situation</i> itself. Ryan Jordan was entirely tangential to the real issue that was being discussed here. Furthermore, I think the charge of <i>recentism</i> applies here, as there is no concievable way Jordan will be remembered - the controversy, and related issue of which he became an example of, <b>will be</b>. However, he - himself - as a person is not notable. Thus, I will have to say <b>weak delete</b>.</dd>
<dd>This is by no means a clear-cut case, but I have to argue that it is incorrect to blindly apply notability guidelines here; we need to consider this case in context, and I believe doing so supports deletion. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 05:12, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<blockquote>
<p>EDITORS’ NOTE:</p>
<p>The July 31, 2006, piece on Wikipedia, “Know It All,” by Stacy Schiff, contained an interview with a Wikipedia site administrator and contributor called Essjay, whose responsibilities included handling disagreements about the accuracy of the site’s articles and taking action against users who violate site policy. He was described in the piece as “a tenured professor of religion at a private university” with “a Ph.D. in theology and a degree in canon law.”</p>
<p>Essjay was recommended to Ms. Schiff as a source by a member of Wikipedia’s management team because of his respected position within the Wikipedia community. He was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page. At the time of publication, neither we nor Wikipedia knew Essjay’s real name. Essjay’s entire Wikipedia life was conducted with only a user name; anonymity is common for Wikipedia administrators and contributors, and he says that he feared personal retribution from those he had ruled against online. Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan, that he is twenty-four and holds no advanced degrees, and that he has never taught. He was recently hired by Wikia — a for-profit company affiliated with Wikipedia — as a “community manager”; he continues to hold his Wikipedia positions. He did not answer a message we sent to him; Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikia and of Wikipedia, said of Essjay’s invented persona, “I regard it as a pseudonym and I don’t really have a problem with it.”</p>
</blockquote>
Essjay and his trustworthiness (or lack thereof) are clearly the central issue of this note and several later articles. -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedict_the_Moor_1d60.html" title="User:Benedict the Moor">Ben</a> 09:14, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>As of 06:42, 3 March 2007 (UTC), Jimbo Wales <u>does</u> really have a problem with it; in fact has now found the situation grave enough to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimbo_Wales_9687.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimbo_Wales_9687.html" rel="nofollow">blank out the rest of his talk page and devote it to this issue,</a> having asked Essjay <i>"to resign his positions of trust within the community"</i>... <i>"because forgiveness or not, these positions are not appropriate for him now."</i> (Those positions include <i>"<span class="plainlinks" style="color:#002bb8"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/i/s/Special%7EListusers_21e7.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/i/s/Special%7EListusers_21e7.html" rel="nofollow"><span title="Listuser: Essjay, limit=1"><font color="#002BB8">boardvote, Bureaucrat, checkuser, oversight, Administrator</font></span></a></span>",</i> and ArbCom.) Jimbo also says, <i>"From the moment this whole thing became known, EssJay has been contrite and apologetic."</i> That leading clause is significant: the contrition and apology followed not the commission of the sin but its revelation by others. Any "Catholic scholar", indeed most ordinary people whether Christian or not, would understand the difference between <i>being sorry for having done something wrong</i> and <i>being sorry for having been caught at it</i>. -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedict_the_Moor_1d60.html" title="User:Benedict the Moor">Ben</a> 19:04, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

There's also the issue of self-referencing: Wikipedia should never threat her own topic differently than others, hence this article is as incoherent as any article on an admin of a different notable site would be. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 09:00, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep or Merge</b>. I don't have a clear opinion about how this should be handled, but the whole Ryan/Schiff/New Yorker incident is going to be, whether you like it or not, very notable. I entered into the discussions on this very early on when there was only a single comment on Essjay's talk page and maybe a dozen on Jim Wale's and the posts now are in the hundreds across multiple pages. Wiki activity hardly makes this notable, but you're beginning to see the same trend with outside media. The incident has already been slash dotted and commented on in a number of blogs. This is going to continue. Main stream media will pick up on this. There is going to be a bit of a feeding frenzy because the incident just fits so nicely into the stereotypes much of the main stream media has for something like Wikipedia. It's all a bit sad really. <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EAbcarter_3034.html" title="User:Abcarter">A B Carter</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/b/c/User_talk%7EAbcarter_86c3.html" title="User talk:Abcarter">talk</a>)</small> 13:16, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

Why should Essjay come here and furthur jeaporadize his reputation by commenting on it on a very large-scale AFD? Personally I don't think Essjay is even reading this right now. What I said was moot was the fact that he pushed Essjay's opinion higher because he was an admin, which is moot since neither being an admin is "more important", nor have a more valid opinion, because everyone's is equal and it's moot because he may lose his adminship because of this. And my whole purpose for replying was for what you just said: "[Essjay] continues to be a Wikipedia member with a valid opinion", some people really don't think that, I do and I wish everyone else did, but it's not the case anymore.

<dd>I've bolded the part that is applicable to your comment. "Simple fact: Deletion concerning him/<b>this event</b> will look like wikipedia censors its own mistakes." To bury this event in the middle of another section is not beneficial. Hence, as long as the material is easily and fully accessible it is fine. The nomination says nothing about redirect to anything else. It requests delete, in part, based on "Not a notable person (to anybody outside Wikipedia, that is), and doesn't have <b>many</b>, if any, <b>reliable sources</b>." I explained he notable, espcially concerning public image of wikipedia for various reasons including but not limited to censorship arguments. Also an article about this event cannot be fully explored in two paragraphs in an article titled "criticism." It seems as if it is being downplayed in that instance. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 03:18, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>That's ridiculous. First, one-quarter of 2007 is not even over and there may yet be other fraud incidents within the year. Secondly, who will look for an article title by that name? "Essjay" is clearly the title people will use to search for the article. Thirdly, the scandal is about more than just fraud. Fourthly, your point about an article entitled "Essjay" not being able to encompass context is simply groundless. Any required context may be placed in the article as titled "Essjay". <a href="../../../c/2E/m/User%7EC.m.jones_b614.html" title="User:C.m.jones">C.m.jones</a> 05:36, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

If there are other bridges to be crossed this year, so be it, the article can be renamed then. To be correctly framed, the article needs to be about Wikipedia. The subject is otherwise not notable. We need an article that encompass the acts of Jimmy Wales, other people that were aware of the case, and those that put effort into bringing the matter to light. btw, a rename will leave an article titled "Essjay" that would redirect to the more complete article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 06:28, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

It is not currently known whether the controversy associated with this subject is going to balloon into greater notability and visibility or whether it is going to become a flash-in-the-pan.

However, if the mainstream news media pick-up this story and run with it as they did with the Seigenthaler case, an article may be justified.

I am tantalised by Random832's suggestion that the <i>New Yorker</i> is not a reliable source (because they don't check their interviewees' CV's) but that way lies madness - I'm more seriously of the opinion that the editorial note, and all sources following it, are about Wikipedia and not about Essjay. The 'bite' of the press coverage is that "<i>Wikipedia is unreliable, see what they let their trusted leaders do</i>", not "<i>This man lied to a journalist and to his friends to get an upper hand in content disputes on an online encyclopaedia</i>". The only person who was genuinely interested in who Essjay really is and what he did before the scandal blew up is Daniel Brandt.

<li><b>Comment</b> I still think that we need to wait until the dust has settled before making a <s>final</s>long- or medium-term decision. The <i>New York Times</i> article not only shows notability, it shows that the information we need to <i>judge</i> notability is not yet complete, and won't be for a little time yet. Incidentally, it also seems to show an argument for moving this page to <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essjay_incident.html" title="Essjay incident">Essjay incident</a>, since it is clearly about the event and not the individual whose actions provoked it. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 07:23, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move to Wikipedia namespace</b> - Whatever we do, whatever the article contains, however many sources we get, this is an article about Wikipedia in Wikipedia, and people will see it as what Wikipedia says about Essjay, without making the distinction between Wikipedia the encyclopedia and Wikipedia the project. And why would they? The encyclopedia is written by the project, and the article will always be the project's side of the story, driven by the same forces as the current kerfuffle about the deletion of Essjay's RFC. It would be better if we aknowledged that and kept this meta-information in meta-space. When <s>a newspaper or a magazine has something to report about itself, it doesn't do it in the regular news section either.</s> the publisher of a book wants the book to contain text about the book or about the publisher, they put it in an appendix.

<dd>Yes, as I&#160;!voted above&#160;:) There are good reasons that we initially decided to avoid self-references, and I think that in this case they outweigh notability by far. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, avoiding self-reference made more sense initially when we wanted to prevent navel gazing and make sure the project talked about important stuff. The bottom line is that Wikipedia is now notable enough that we have not one, but multiple articles about it (such as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_Wikipedia_565c.html" title="Criticisms of Wikipedia">Criticisms of Wikipedia</a>). The real problem with self-reference is when it uses Wikipedia as a primary source or engages in original research. Neither of these are issues here. and we should thus treat this as we would any other Wikipedia related article. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:49, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

As I always anticipated, there are sources, because this scandal has always been notable. Given a little more time, it is now also noted in the sources we are comfortable using. However, we as a community are still highly divided by this, as is quite natural after one we thought of as one of our own has done this much damage. So as a community, we are better off keeping the material in a larger article where it will have more context and be easier to manage undue weight. Yes, our normal guidelines would say that we should have an independent article now. But I think we need to give it time, and let both the sources and ourselves get beyond recentism, before we have a standalone article. The best way to do this is to merge. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:40, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I stay with my previous opinion, i.e. to delete - makes sense to cover this incident in a more general article on Wikipedia or criticisms of it, or wherever, but the individual is not notable enough to have an article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia gets a bad rap for being unreliable because anyone can edit it. I think that's BS, the vast majority of editors are honest, hardworking and knowledgeable. However, the only way we can combat this false impression of unreliability is to be absolutely forthright about it when we screw up. Give the magnitude of this controversy, and its roots in the dishonesty of a Wikipedian, we need to have an article that directly addresses the issue. Blackeagle 06:05, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. I strongly believe that this incident is not deserving of its own article in the encyclopedia. It's been covered by reputable news sources, but I think that Wikipedians are overestimating its independent importance. I am more than satisfied that <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> already covers the issue in sufficient depth. I suggest that if more needs to be said about it, <b>this article could be moved to the Wikipedia namespace</b> because it relates to some fundamental problems within the Wikipedia community. The story could function as a starting point for a centralized discussion about what lessons to learn, without placing our internal idiosyncracies in the article namespace of the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 06:10, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Yet here we have people wishing to merge <i>still more</i> material into an already overlong article. Odd. Secondly, <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essjay_scandal.html" title="Essjay scandal">Essjay scandal</a> <i>is not even on the subject of "Criticisms of Wikipedia"</i>. It is about a <i>scandal</i> of Wikipedia. Also, "I just don't see the long-term notability of this incident" is crystal-ball gazing.

Why can't the <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essjay.html" title="Essjay">Essjay</a> article simply be expanded to include biographical information, with sufficient focus on this scandal? I admit that the existing sources may be suspect (I'm thinking Essjay's Wikia user page, not the tenured professor of religion data from the WP user page which is obviously not reliable), but isn't there some amount of data that can be confirmed that would contribute to a sufficiently biographical article (ie he lives in Kentucky, studied religion as an undergraduate, contributed heavily to wikipedia, held various administrative positions, was hired by Wikia and was involved in this controversy) to keep the page at <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essjay.html" title="Essjay">Essjay</a>? <a href="../../../c/u/f/User%7ECuffeparade_1248.html" title="User:Cuffeparade">Cuffeparade</a> 10:47, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Please forgive my ignorance of the renaming. You'll also have to forgive my ignorance of some of these procedural matters, as this is the first time I've weighed in on an AfD debate. As I understand it, however, the matter is not finally closed, correct? It seems quite probable to me that in the future considerably more verifiable biographical information of Essjay/Ryan Jordan will become available, at which time I imagine a biographical article would be opened. As I see it, despite a number of editors comments to the contrary, <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essjay_Scandal_3aa2.html" title="Essjay Scandal">Essjay Scandal</a> is already essentially about Essjay as well as the reactions to what he has done. In the event that more verifiable information on his identity emerges, are we likely to rename the article once again? I don't see how such an infamously notable figure to WP can be denied a bio, given that verifiable sources come to light. At any rate, this appears to be a wait-and-see situation. <a href="../../../c/u/f/User%7ECuffeparade_1248.html" title="User:Cuffeparade">Cuffeparade</a> 11:53, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (changing from an earlier opinion of "Wait.") It's a major international story. <i>New Yorker</i>, <i>New York Times,</i> <i>BBC</i>. Definitely notable. I also agree with the name change to "Essjay scandal." Keep the article, let the story develop. After things have died down, perhaps in a month's time, we can take another look to determine if the information should be merged, but for now, it's definitely worth its own article. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">El</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html" title="User talk:Elonka">on</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elonka_1320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elonka">ka</a> 16:50, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> this has been covered extensively by some of the world's largest media organisations. If the New York Times and BBC aren't important enough coverage, then wtf is? This is not suitable for a merge with 'Criticism of Wikipedia' because it is not a <i>criticism</i> of <i>Wikipedia</i>. Sorry to be facetious, but this article is about a very specific incident where the issue was not criticism of the concept or reliability of Wikipedia itself, but the conduct of a prominent Wikipedia community member and Wikia employee.

<li><b>Keep</b> - (ec) I've held off a long time in&#160;!voting on this one, but when this story was brought up at our lunchtime conversation by a large group of civilians who had (mostly) never even been to the Wikipedia site, any concern I had about notability was vanquished. With the rename, it is clear the article is about the situation and not as much about the person. I'd like to see the photo gone, though - right now, I think Essjay would have a legitimate claim to concern about harassment. <b>Comment:</b> It's clear that many of our talented and more senior editors and admins have been taken aback by the community's response to this situation. I'd like to encourage editors to reach out to them and support them wherever possible. Many of them are true friends of Essjay and must feel a personal loss here.

<p><b>Question for those saying not-notable/no seperate article</b> He's now at 30-40+ sources, including international broadcast television coverage... how can anyone argue vs. a seperate article now, based on policy, for any reason beyond protecting Essjay as ex-member of the site? I am just curious as to why you think he is not notable enough now, for an article, based on all this. thanks. I do sympathize, but I want to understand what you are basing this on, if you can explain it to us. The comments like "Seperate article, no"; "Human dignitiy", etc., don't make sense. We don't spare other notable people articles on their misdeeds... why Essjay? Please let us know... if this is based on protecting him for who he is, please say so--if policy needs to be changed to that, then this is a good time to set that precendent, no?
