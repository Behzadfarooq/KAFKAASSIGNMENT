<p>Prod contested. This article meets criteria for what <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>. Wikipedia is not a directory and should not serve as an index of roads in Hong Kong. Not all roads and streets in Hong Kong are notable. While some roads are notable, the listing of all roads and streets in Hong Kong will spur the eventual growth of non-notable roads. This existence of such a list is hard to maintain. This article can better fulfill its intended goal through the use of a category and merging the remaining useful content into <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_Hong_Kong_51ee.html" title="Transport in Hong Kong">Transport in Hong Kong</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyluke_155b.html" title="User:Luckyluke">Luke!</a> 00:39, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

I really don't think this article can be considered in <i>isolation</i> from the others that apparently fall within that project, and may have been <i>fostered by the project</i> with goals such as splitting information into multiple pages to unclutter and provide navigation resources. Without referencing the aims and methods of the project, we shouldn't judge an isolated piece of it. There are several other articles which could also be judged harshly, in isolation from one another. Here are a couple:

<dd>It may be that together these effectively enhance the ability of reader <i>to find the information they seek</i>. And that <i>is</i> a valid use of lists in Wikipedia.

<li>So 1. Are there more than 140 roads on the list? If yes, just delete some items, but not the whole list, and rename the list into "List of notable streets and roads in Hong Kong". 2.

<li>The <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> article says the 2006 population was 6,864,000. With reference to the <a href="../../../5/0/k/WP%7E50k_a237.html" title="WP:50k">WP:50k</a> rule, that'd be a maximum of 137. Counting just the roads I come up with 242 entries minus 90 redlinks, 152.

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRECTORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRECTORY</a>. I can't imagine any vote to keep here. This isn't a list of significant or notable roads in HK, it's a list of ALL of them. That's the dictionary definition of a street directory. I'm also unimpressed at the assertions that this article "could" become useful or that it is a temporary holding page for the HK Wikiproject. This article was created <i>fifteen months</i> ago, and before a flurry in March there'd been few substantive edits for half a year. Plainly the HK Wikiproject isn't as invested in it as all of that. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor"><b><span style="background:Blue;color:Cyan">&#160;RGTraynor&#160;</span></b></a> 14:18, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and RGTraynor. Like RGTraynor, I am confused to see any votes for keep here at all.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, I know this more of what <a href="../../../a/t/a/WP%7EATA_2c1b.html" title="WP:ATA">WP:ATA</a> mentions as 'bad' to say in arguments, but to avoid some parochialism simply because it is Hong Kong, please compare to New York City.

<dd>What is the difference in the implementation of the Hong Kong-related set, apparently patterned much like previous projects, that upsets people? I suppose some didn't realize that at 6.8M people the Hong Kong population is certainly of the same magnitude as New York City at 8.1M people. And I haven't looked at places like <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. (hmm, peeking I see <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunnels_underneath_the_River_Thames_14a5.html" title="Tunnels underneath the River Thames">Tunnels underneath the River Thames</a>)</dd>
<dd>&#160; &#160; I believe several people simply don't like 'lists', and so want to vote delete here. As I've said above, I think that properly used lists and categories can serve as navigation aids and therefore are useful. (And usefulness is a valid consideration, otherwise you would want to swear off things like <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> and other shortcuts). Please do not single out one article because you dislike the idea of lists. Would converting to a more category heavy mix be better?</dd>
<dd>&#160; &#160; So what I'd like to hear is, what is a useful <i>direction</i> to suggest for this information? Remembering of course that that same suggestion could (should?) be applied to New York City and every other project like this. &#160; <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 03:45, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> on the analogy of the above articles,and the general way decisions are going, the solution is a <b>category</b>, which will include all the streets and roads notable enough to warrant separate articles. There are a small number of tunnels under the Thames, or bridges in NYC, and the history of them as a general topic is therefore notable--and books have been written bout just such topics. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 07:25, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I agree that a category would be a better solution. Then all lists that are noteable enough to have their own article would be included, and debates on inclusion and deletion could more easily be handled separately. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_bab_aed9.html" title="User:Dr bab">Dr bab</a> 11:37, 7 April 2007 (UTC).</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- It could be argued that most lists on Wikipedia amount to directory entries; if it were only notable streets, it could be from a directory of notable streets in Hong Kong. There are loads of such lists, a lot of big cities have them for streets, subway stations, skyscrapers, etc, and valid arguments have been made for their usefulness. Until there's a more general discussion on whether all of these do or don't belong on Wikipedia, I don't think targeting one city is appropriate. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">bobanny</a> 16:12, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
