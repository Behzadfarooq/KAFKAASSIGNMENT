<li><b>Comment</b>. Deleted at <i>2005-06-19 12:55:44 Petaholmes deleted "Parrot harness" (7 june copyvio)</i>. This is a completely different version. (I nominated the other for copyvio <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Copyright_problems&amp;diff=14843906&amp;oldid=14842713" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Copyright_problems&amp;diff=14843906&amp;oldid=14842713" rel="nofollow">diff from WP:CP</a>)--<a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabla_d282.html" title="User:Nabla">Nabla</a> 2005-06-29 16:12:16 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parrot.html" title="Parrot">Parrot</a>? Or delete would be cool too. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdc_936f.html" title="User:Cdc"><small>CDC</small></a> <a href="../../../c/d/c/User_talk%7ECdc_878d.html" title="User talk:Cdc"><small>(talk)</small></a> 29 June 2005 21:21 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think this would be out of place in the main <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parrot.html" title="Parrot">parrot</a> article, but for some reason we have an article called how to care for a pet cockatoo. Perhaps this could be merged there. --<a href="../../../k/f/p/User%7EKFP_849a.html" title="User:KFP">KFP</a> 30 June 2005 15:07 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Might be worth a mention in a pet care article (which we don't seem to have). .:.<a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJareth_d262.html" title="User:Jareth">Jareth</a>.:. <sup><a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJareth_7e10.html" title="User talk:Jareth">babelfish</a></sup> June 30, 2005 16:31 (UTC)

<li>As the creator of that article on Parrot Harness, I rather not vote.</li>
<li>That article was first slated for deletion because of copyviolation. Since I was the author of that article that it was supposed to violate, I find it very strange that I was accused of plagiarising myself.</li>
<li>Harness for parrots is a very serious subject in the parrot world. Are the voters, one way or other, conversant with either parrots or harness? if not, are they qualified to decide it that should be merged or deleted? On what basis have people decided that "it is not notable either way'?</li>
<li>We even have an entry for Worshipful Company of Coachmakers and Coach Harness Makers and another entry for dildo harness which surely cannot be that relevant to the world. Those did not seem to be bad jokes (which I thought they were). Yet something which are of very serious concerns to parrot lovers are now being debated to be thrown out? --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanlung_4498.html" title="User:Shanlung">shanlung</a>
<ul>
<li>As to the copyvio notice and deletion: all you had to do was to explicitly release it under GFDL on its talk page (something like this: <a href="../../../t/o/m/Talk%7ETom_Campbell_Black_9761.html" title="Talk:Tom Campbell Black">Talk:Tom Campbell Black</a>).</li>
<li>Yes, WP is a mess regarding "(something) harness" articles. I found "parrot harness" while trying to figure a way to organise it a little. Mostly because there is no <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harness.html" title="Harness">harness</a> article <i>per se</i> (it a disambig pointing to «Horse tack»).</li>
<li>Just because there is something worse it is no immediate reason to keep an article (although it is an hint to) some strange keep/delete decisions happen in grey areas...</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Parrot+harness%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Parrot+harness%22" rel="nofollow">1 460 Google hits</a> from several different sources make me vote as <b>weak keep</b>. - <a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabla_d282.html" title="User:Nabla">Nabla</a> 20:14:30, 2005-07-09 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am so new to WP that I even have problem in adding to this discussion officially with date and time stamp to authenticate myself. I tried at the beginning to releae it under GFDL. But it is only now with the example of Tom Cambell Black that I think I know how that is done. In a way, I am glad that was not allowed as that meant editing would also be allowed. I would not wish for any editing from people who never have that kind of practical experience on what I have written as I stand by what I said having walked that walk. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanlung_4498.html" title="User:Shanlung">shanlung</a></li>
<li>WoW! I did a search for "dildo harness" on Google and found 69,100 hits. So is the number of hits meant Encyclopedia is only a repository of stuff that is desired by many people so that is politically correct? Techniques and information so new that few people heard of it meant those new stuff should be merged, canned and deleted? Perhaps a new defination of encyclopedia should also be made in this encycolopedia so that uninformed people like me be better educated --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanlung_4498.html" title="User:Shanlung">shanlung</a></li>
