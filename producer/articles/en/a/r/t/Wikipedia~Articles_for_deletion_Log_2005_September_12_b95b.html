<li>If you're referring to me, I said that it was "Not a speedy as re-creation of previously deleted material..." perhaps I should have put "not" in bold. I said it was, however, essentially similar to many others, all voted for deletion. Perhaps I should have put "similar" in bold. a) A number of articles that were similar to each other were all voted for deletion; b) therefore, a consensus exists that such articles should be deleted; c) this article is similar to those articles; d) therefore, this article should be deleted. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:09, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that you can go as far as you do in "b". In my opinion the most that one can say is "it seems that a consensus exists that such articles should be deleted", but the way that Articles for deletion is currently done (and I would argue for keeping it this way) the consensuses are reached or not reached on individual articles, not vaguely-defined types of articles. In any case, there are some articles on surrealist groups which have been kept, which suggests in any case that you haven't adequately defined what you mean by "such articles". --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<li><b>Delete</b>, per Boyer's arguments. Reading this article, I was struck by the lack of any explanation of notability: in blunt English, this article fails to answer the question, "What have they done?" Have they held any exhibits, performances, published any works? Instead of citing examples of these (which would help convince me -- &amp; hopefully others -- to vote to keep), Boyer responds with explaining his own interpretation of the rules, apparently arguing that if the rules do not forbid it then this article should be kept. Sorry, Boyer: that argument does not persuade me. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:30, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have argued no such thing. I have not said or argued the article should be kept, I have just argued that it should be judged on its own merits, not lumped together with others, and some other points about what people said. There is nothing to be sorry about as I never said that if "the rules do not forbid it then this article should be kept". --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<p>Daniel, please understand what is being asked of you here. It is very simple: Where we can find information on this group, in regards to publications, gallery exhibits, books, films, anything??? All you gave us was a blog. This really is a clubhouse that you are promoting here and it just gets weaker and weaker every time you challenge a delete vote. I would have supported this article if there was suitable material to go on, but as usual, this is all just promotion. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a place to promote your friends and their websites and blogs. Daniel, please let me give you some good advice: When you create an article on contemporary surrealism, give us something solid to go on. For example: Nobody that is friends with you and an entity that is notable for their creative ouput. Really Daniel, when it comes to Surrealism as an organized movement, everything kind of goes downhill after 1969. Any university professor will tell you that. These friends of your in Seattle, Portland, Houston, Minnesota, Chicago, London, Leeds, etc. need to accomplish something more solid than cheap attempts at notability by getting their friend Daniel C. Boyer to promote them on Wikipedia. Daniel, with all due respect, you really are a great surrealist artist, yet, where do you find the time to create, lately?<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 01:07, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobody in the Seattle Surrealist Group is "friends" with me; I've never met them and have had no contact with any of them whatsoever. I am aware that you have repeatedly defined "friends" to mean those who are my friends, some of my casual correspondents, and some of those who have no connexion to me whatsoever, but have not seen fit to justify this definition in any way whatsoever. Your implication that university professors know more about surrealism than surrealists is in my opinion a questionable position, but it's really a POV and nothing more. This POV could certainly be alluded to in any relevant article(s). The same goes for your opinion that "everything kind of goes downhill after 1969". There are many publications (you're certainly aware of some of these, such as <i>Arsenal</i>, <i>Blue Feathers</i>, &amp;c. -- you may be critical of them, and my bet is, correct me if I'm wrong, you'll express such criticism in your response, but this is once again a POV), exhibitions (you are aware, aren't you, of the 1976 World Surrealist Exhibition?) and other manifestations of surrealism in this period, indeed numerically more than in the pre-1969 period, but any discussion of the quality of those manifestations is, again, POV. An expression of any of these POVs is, again, appropriate in any relevant article(s) so long as (at least in general) the holder(s) are identified. Gratified as I am by your concern about me and whether I am able to create, I am puzzled by its relevance to the article. My bet is that you will not answer any of my concerns here. I challenge you to do so. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C. Boyer</a> 14:43, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Really Daniel, I will answer your, "challenge". First, in regards to Arsenal, that is just another publication that your friend Mr.Rosemont SELLS to us all. Remember, Arsenal comes with a pricetag and REVOLUTION has no price! As for that rag being a legit surrealist publication, that is open for debate. Granted, many of Rosemonts friends (like you) will defend it at all costs, because you all share in this scam on the marvelous. If you were so insistent on Arsenal being a real surrealist publication, then why not provide scans of all the issues and put it on the net. Oh, I forgot, according to, "The Surrealist Movement in the United States" website, it comes with a price. As for, "Blue Feathers", that is a total waste of anyone's time. IF I were to go into any musuem with that rag of Dale's and Barrett's, the security guards would throw me out. That is a clubhouse rag. You are promoting a clubhouse here on Wikipedia, Daniel. Lets really be surrealistically real in the surrealist sense. Daniel, you have not once spoken out about Pierre's lame essay. Comrade Richardson did, why not you???<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 03:02, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You haven't even come close to addressing my point. You haven't addressed your bizarre and idiosyncratic (to say the least) definition of "friends" and after that it's just one (weak, in my opinion) POV after another. As I anticipated, you do exactly what I predicted, crticising the quality or aspects of the journals and publications rather than addressing my concerns. By your criteria no surrealist journal (<i>La Revolution Surrealiste</i>, <i>La Surrealisme ASDLR</i> &amp;c.) has ever been authentically surrealist; they were all sold. But it is up to Wikipedians how much attention they will pay to what is in my opinion a thoroughly ridiculous charge. As for your theory that everything is either computerised or should be, and that "real publications" are not such unless they are digitized, it is hardly worth the rebuttal. There are things called libraries, they have things called books and journals, and if you don't feel like paying for a journal go to the library and read it or check it out. Another digital-centric (beyond bizarre, in my opinion) POV. And as for your making museum guards the arbiters of surrealism, if you were "surrealistically real" in any sense you would know better than that. It is exceedingly difficult to come to any other conclusion than that you are an anti-surrealist. Finally, the "lameness" of "Pierre's essay" is a POV, and one that has no discernible connexion whatsoever to this deletion discussion. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

Multiple Roller-related articles are a "work-in-progress" right now, which is in the process of being cleaned up.

And I'm glad this's no Eva Braun, Mr. Hillman, I wouldn't have wasted my time on someone like her. Perhaps Christopher Reeve's wife, Dana. I thank Rob for his help and will do better in the future, I'll choose to delete my research, though I thank those who wanted to give me a chance.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: This article is useful since it's a part of New Hampshire's State Highway system.

<li><b>Keep</b> simply because it is a numbered US state highway; from what I have read above it appears that there are some states that number more roads than the norm, but I don't think I've heard that about New Hampshire anyway. This road is also not short (approx 43.3 miles).
<ul>
<li>For a road in the United States, 43.3 miles is short. From where I sit right now, 43.3 miles will just barely get me to another city. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 03:25, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I disagree. While relative to many areas it may be short (I'm guessing in central US this could be the case), it certianly isn't so everywhere. There are many major roads in my area that are significantly shorter than this one.

<li>I certainly would have voted Delete pre-rewrite, but now I'm surprising myself by voting to <b>keep</b>. Although a rename to "Non-canonical Archie Storylines" or something similar might be good; that way there's no appearance of an "alternate universe" theory being proposed. To point to the Archie comics as a source and make the obvious observation that some storylines fall outside the main continuity does not strike me as Original Research, as long as you don't theorize on the hows and whys of that being the case. Which only leaves me wondering if the topic is notable or encyclopedic. But with hundreds of Star Wars pages out there, I think there's plenty of room for some well-organized Archie information like this. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> 03:56, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I fail to see how plot summaries fall short of factual. it is easily verifiable to anyone with familiarity of these comics. I say "keep"! <i>(Unsigned comment by 216.80.110.89 at 20:15, 14 September 2005. IP's first Wikipedia edit.)</i></li>

<li>The problem is that they make wild claims about hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity that they cannot backup with evidences.

<p>Anti-Pokemon is an orphan article written about a non existing word/name (Gibberish phrase) which is also misspelled. The content of the article does not explain the term "Anti-Pokemon" and has been made by just guessing wiki markup, for example creating headlines by writing bold text followed by a horizontal line (which users are told to use sparingly) without previewing causing gibberish like "<i>Italic text</i>Anti<i>Italic text</i>". See <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_theme_music.html" title="Pokémon theme music">Pokémon theme music</a> also. --<a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShreddy_5b09.html" title="User:Shreddy">Shreddy</a> 20:34, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I would counter your reasons, Shreddy. When someone goes to Wikipedia, they want to be able to see info on all types of sources. Also, there is an extensive issue on "Pokemon", so everyone would know what that meant. Plus, horizontal lines are used sparingly (just twice). "Use Sparingly" doesn't mean "never use". Finally, Anti-Pokemon is not spelled wrong, and it is not gibberish, either. Sure hope no one makes the grave mistake of deleting this page. --Scyther-Mantis 12:34, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's a misconception that there's a martial art called Magatama in the --King of Fighters-- series - the actual names of the arts used by characters of the Kusanagi family, as well as Iori and Shingo (mostly "Kusanagi style of ancient martial arts") are listed in an official source, the www.kof10th.com website, in the individual character profile pages. The misconception derives from part of the legend that inspired the Orochi plot in the KoF games up to 1997, as there are 3 sacred objects associated with the legend: a sword, a mirror, and a magatama (an object which has its own Wikipedia article, and which shouldn't need to go through a disambiguation page to be reached), which correspond to 3 important characters in that series, respectively Kyo, Chizuru and Iori <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoona_9ca2.html" title="User:Loona">Loona</a> 11:58, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> How common is the misconception? Would an explanation of the misconception be appropriate in, say, the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Fighters_3173.html" title="King of Fighters">King of Fighters</a> article or another appropriate article? If so, my feeling is that it should be <b>merged</b> not deleted. <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithD_2f0d.html" title="User:KeithD">KeithD</a> <a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeithD_fbd8.html" title="User talk:KeithD">(talk)</a> 13:19, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's not that frequent to be worth mentioning in the main KoF article - at most, mentioning the common points (these tend to stick to the some of the special moves they use, and the odd normal attack or two) between the styles used by the characters <a href="../../../k/y/o/Kyo_Kusanagi_0f2b.html" title="Kyo Kusanagi">Kyo Kusanagi</a>, <a href="../../../i/o/r/Iori_Yagami_c844.html" title="Iori Yagami">Iori Yagami</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shingo_Yabuki_5bb8.html" title="Shingo Yabuki">Shingo Yabuki</a> and Saishu/Saisyu Kusanagi (Kyo's dad - the spelling of the name tends to change slightly according to the source) in their respective profiles - Kyo's, at least, is in need of some tweaking. In short, the fighting style that does exist (and evolves) in KoF is that of the Kusanagi clan, which the official bios pretty much refer to as "Kusanagi style" - Saishyu passed that on to Kyo (who changed some aspects of it after being beat by Goenitz prior to the KoF96 tournament), while the Yagami had something quite different in many aspects, with only a few similarities that border parody by opposition (this is most noticeable in KoF 95, where both Kyo and Iori - who debuted in that game - have projectiles, but throw them with practically opposite hand movements - Kyo's is up-to-forward, and Iori's is back-to-down; another special has both of them dashing at an opponent, and while Kyo lifts his victim upon hitting him, Iori slams him into the ground - both follow up with an explosion); Shingo is basically a Kyo fanboy who tries to do the same things, but with no formal training (other than bugging Kyo to show him a move, and then proceeding to practice that countless times, so it's said), although Saishyu offers to train him in a KoF2003 ending. In no game or official source is a "Magatama style" mentioned, so it's something not worth focusing on outside the character profiles IMO, especially with a wrong name, and certainly not with a page of its own. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoona_9ca2.html" title="User:Loona">Loona</a> 15:22, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a collective AfD for about two dozen <i>Lists of primary route destinations</i> in English counties. The List of Primary Route Destinations in Wiltshire came up for deletion a few days ago.</p>
<p>Each of these lists a couple of towns in the particular county without comment or context. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a repository for original data or contextless links. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 13:44, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. No context. Each entry seems to be little more than a list of major towns, which should be covered by the specific counties' articles. <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithD_2f0d.html" title="User:KeithD">KeithD</a> <a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeithD_fbd8.html" title="User talk:KeithD">(talk)</a> 14:49, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Far from contextless lists, these are lists of primary destinations, the places you'll see on signposts on major roads, and they're grouped by county. They're not all towns, because not all destinations are towns (see List of Primary Route Destinations in Tyne and Wear which includes <a href="../../../t/y/n/Tyne_Tunnel_21cc.html" title="Tyne Tunnel">Tyne Tunnel</a>). I honestly cannot understand what would cause anyone to wish to delete these excellent, useful list articles. As a simple "for instance" example of how they could be extended and improve the organization of information on Wikipedia, the destinations in each list could be annotated with the major roads leading to them, and the articles on these roads in turn could link to the appropriate lists of primary destinations. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:57, 12 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In the present state, these lists are absolutely contextless. On their own they are also original data, which does not belong here. One possible outlet for them would be to move the data into the county that they live in. Another would be to put them into a <b>Wikiatlas</b> with the roads that they are linked by. The format of an itinerary (i.e. a road or atlas in words) that you suggest is too clunky to be useful. Even if they were put in the form of an itinerary one would list the cities not by counties but by the road that passes through them. 129.215.195.81 15:41, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure where you get the idea that this is original research.

<li>Primary route destinations are well defined in the UK and are commonly included in atlases, maps and gazetteers (and, you may not be aware, encyclopedias competing with Wikipedia do normally incorporate at the very least an excellent atlas). The designation is useful for, for instance, gauging distances on the English and Scottish mainland. One would expect to find in a good encyclopedia tables of primary route destinations and their distances from one other.</li>
<li>I don't buy the proposition that "No one searching for encyclopedic information would look for or in these articles." In fact I find the suggestion simply incredible. Were I looking for information about the political geography and transportation in a county, I'd expect to find a list of the primary destinations of the major roads, and this is precisely function that these really excellent articles provide. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:33, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<s>Not promotion of a religious movement, rather a description of a religious movement and more. A valid and noteworthy aspect of contemporary American youth culture. Not simply a unique online community, but also an affiliation of musicians and artists. Excluding phatmass from wikipedia strikes me as a mistake consider the fact that there are articles on some of the must banal and absurd topics.</s></p>
<p>And I fail to understand the accusation of an organized program to prosteletyze using Wikipedia. The link provided points to a page belonging to some unaffiliated organization who happens to have phatmass.com on their list of websites to prosteletyze. Ha!</p>
<p>Phatmass.com is entirely public and is archived by google.com and archive.org. You will find not evidence of an organized program to prosteletyze using Wikipedia, the accusation is utterly absurd. Good day!</p>

<p>Note: Phatmass.com has several members who attend a legitamite mass of 1962, myself included ie: the_rev. Others would include at phatmass, McJust, Totus Tuus, and many more. The reaosn why Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus is marked as "phishy" is because he holds beliefs contrary to what the Catholic Church teaches. Promotion of the SSPX, or affiliation is wrong since they are in schism.</p>
<p>Please do not delete this page, because it may be helpful to others.</p>
<p>The About thing is mainly talking about the site which is forums, but any casual perusal of the site will reveal the music side of things (click the music section, or any of the message boards for a particular band in the forums section). And as I said, you will find nothing about an organized prosteletyzing on Wikipedia or whatever else you were accusing phatmass of. The only thing that is related in the phatmass mission statement is: "Our mission is to live and defend the faith given to us by Jesus Christ by remaining totally and completely obedient to the teaching authority of His Church. We encourage dialogue between people of all faiths and recognize that we are all children of God striving for holiness." This is hardly prostelytism, it is defending the faith when anti-Catholics visit the forums and what not. I do not understand your bias in this case. What is the issue?</p>
<p>And futhermore, did you read on that page the section regarding what phatmass does? Example: "Produces Catholic hip-hop music as a creative method of communication to the youth and urban culture" "Performs at live shows and events across the country with the cooperation of a network of different artists"</p>

<p>This is a community it was in the Toronto Star for being one of the last of its kind. There are few subdivisions with large houses being built anymore and it was designated as an Exective step up community by the city of Brampton.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Perhaps the word 'community' is being thrown around a little too loosely. I know little of Brampton but I know a lot about residential subdivision and development. I don't think they should be included in Wikipedia for several reasons, among them: they're just trying to sell a product, they're all hype, and they're not significant in themselves. Few grow to be real communities, most simply just get integrated into the town and lose the 'place', unless there is a gate around it - then it becomes something else. The name is meaningless - just a selling feature, like my couch the 'Palm d'Or' (it has palm trees on it!). It will be gone as fast as the developers once the last house is sold. rant rant rant... --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 02:18, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article misleadingly conflates a number of unrelated actions under the rubric "bandwidth theft". It gives the impression that this term has some legal or technical meaning, which it does not. Some of the actions described are not crimes at all. Others are crimes under unrelated laws which do not treat with "theft".</p>
<p>Many pieces of the article appear to me to be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, or simply opinion presented as fact. Others are simply erroneous or misleading. The title, and the presentation of this morass as a single legal or technical category called "bandwidth theft", rather caps it off.</p>
<p>I don't see any way that this can be improved in place: the title needs to go; most of the content is misleading; and what isn't misleading is redundant with other articles that deal better with the specific subjects. That's why I'm recommending it for deletion. For more discussion of the problems, please see <a href="../../../b/a/n/Talk%7EBandwidth_theft_0bab.html" title="Talk:Bandwidth theft">the talk page</a>. <a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 17:59, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The title needs to go because it's a made-up category. There isn't really a connection between the things being described as "bandwidth theft" -- it's just several unrelated things that someone doesn't like, thrown together and given a title. There's no reason to expect that there <i>is</i> a right title for this grouping of things.</dd>

<dd>It's as if someone created an article entitled <i>"Sex theft"</i> and put into it discussions of rape, adultery, copyright violation of pornography, and faking orgasm. Some of those are crimes; all of them have something to do with sex; but they don't belong to a category called "sex theft". It's just made up. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 18:53, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Slapping the mistaken term "theft" on top is just a bog-standard NPOV violation, since it assumes the point of view of people who think this action <i>should</i> be illegal.

<dd>For one thing, I don't think the title is nearly as bad as you say...although I do see a problem, the term is <i>the</i> term in common usage. You want to move it, fine, but that's obviously not an AfD matter. And if non-bandwidth-theft related content is in there, then my suggestion would be to take it out (or, if it's content that's only bandwidth-theft-related to a small group, mention it in a little section). Be bold and so forth! That said...and here's the part you're going to like because I admit my ignorance...I wasn't aware of <a href="../../../i/n/l/Inline_linking.html" title="Inline linking">inline linking</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_linking.html" title="Deep linking">deep linking</a>.

<li><b>keep</b> The project is very much real, and it have been under development for a couple of years. There're some pretty interesting changes in the field of computer networking compared to conventional protocols, and those who're familiar in the field will recognize those are very much real. The article now contains a good deal more information than the brief overview also. I must comment on that it would be hard to find it on google because the project have been publicly closed until recently, but with the bsd implementation of the stack that is on the way, I believe that's going to change.

<li>Reply: The "not a crystal ball" section you're refering to have nothing to do with this article, however I understand that it may fall under the "no original research". Depends on how you look at it, because it can also be considered a practial application scheme. But research should have referances to reputable publications, which this one lack. The project leader was publishing some papers on this, so I'll find out which magazines that was and add it. Tempus0 01:17, 13 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b>: I place this in the Crytal Ball category because you seem to be asserting that this topic is going to become notable (shortly?) <i>in the future</i>. It is not notable now, except perhaps as notable original research. It is also a little hard for me to believe that a proposal for a Networking Address Scheme would not have a large number of google hits before it came into wide or even limited real-world use. My opinion (which I could be argued out of, perhaps) is that a network scheme described in research magazines but not even moderately deployed in actuality would not be notable. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> 03:40, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b>: I agree that this article may be a bit "early". When some articles have been published, the implementation is available for public development and testing, and I hear there's also a Internet-draft on its way, then someone else might take the time to write an article again here.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. This is either a hoax, a joke, or someone's OR. There is absolutely no way that a serious or legitimate proposal to redo a Layer 3 addressing scheme can exist in a total vacuum. Where's the RFC? Where's the IETF Working Group? Where is any evidence whatsoever of any publication of this in a journal? Proceedings of a conference? Even a BOF session at a user group? <i>Not even a single Usenet posting???</i> I am familiar with how network standards and protocols are developed, promulgated, and adopted, and it is inconceivable that something could be described at this stage and there be absolutely no record of it in the entire Internet standards &amp; protocols community. Plus, there are fewer than 10 unique Google hits on the protocol's alleged designer (or a person or persons with the same name), none of which refer to any networking or protocol design activties. [User:MCB|MCB]] 06:11, 14 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: It have already been pointed out that the protocol is under development, which do explain the lack of documentation. So, yes, it's original research so it doesn't belong here. That matter has been resolved. But since you claim to be familiar with protocol development, you probably know that layer 3 protocols like IPv4, IPX and XNS had years in closed research / developement before they became widely used / standarized. What you seem to have described in your post is the process to adapted a widely used protocol to a network standard, which is something years ahead of a protocol still in development. Tempus0 18:09, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, no. IPX and XNS are not good examples, because they were originally designed as proprietary protocols designed to provide commercial advantage, and were kept secret (in fact, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_secret.html" title="Trade secret">trade secret</a>) during development. IPv4, on the other hand, was not "closed R&amp;D" by any means, and was widely discussed in the network community before its deployment on ARPANET. The Lillehovde protocol, on the other hand, while it may not be entirely imaginary, does not by any means appear to have any independent or verifiable existence. I mean, many of us have sketched out protocols or meta-protocols on whiteboards to solve particular problems; perhaps even written code stubs to handle them on top of a lower layer. That does not really signify anything. One of the very odd and suspicious things about the article is that neither Lars Lillehovde nor his institution (company? university? laboratory?) is identified. Unless a project is proprietary or a trade secret, it strains my credulity that there is no mention of it in any form whatsoever other than the article itself, even though we have access to essentially every web page, Usenet group, conference proceeedings, or mailing list in existence. In 2005, the world just does not work that way. Perhaps you could give some details about Mr. Lillehovde, his institution, and about yourself and your affiliation as well? -- <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 23:03, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes, it's original research. However the rest of your post only show how immature you are, and that you're not to be taken seriously.

<dd><b>Keep</b>. I was very glad to find this article on the Wikipedia the other day, since I had been looking for a free GIS program. Trying to find something like that using Google had proved to be nearly impossible. I agree that the article needs work. I've now downloaded the program but not installed it. After I've installed it, I should be able to improve the article. Note: The article has been wikified by me, and there have been two other editors besides the original anon, so David Wahler is incorrect when he states that there are no outside links and no contributors. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">∅</font></a> 21:04, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I should have been more clear; I meant that there were no links <i>from</i> other articles, and that there were no contributions of new content.

<p>Agreed. However Mr Merkey is a controversial figure in the Linux and OSS community by way of his own actions and perhaps a page is justifiable. Mr Merkey does not handle criticism well and keeps changing the page to reflect his own narrow viewpoint. Unfortunately there are many within the community that Mr Merkey has angered that enjoy poking him to get a reaction, consequently we are getting a wildly erratic entry based on who had the last edit. <i>Written by <a href="../../../f/a/v/User_talk%7EFava_09e6.html" title="User talk:Fava">Fava</a></i></p>

<p>As Fava notes, Merkey is a well-known public figure - I think that alone warrants keeping the page. Poking him with a stick doesn't belong here but a record of his public acts and comments DOES belong in an encylopaedia. (TWP)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - To me, the entire history just looks like one vandalisation versus another one. Because of this, I have no idea what is actually true and what is false, this makes it a useless wiki article. And what sort of notability is there? I've gone for delete, because he doesn't seem that notable, but if someone could do a complete rewrite and establish what is true in the article, then I'd go keep. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 23:33, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I started the Jeff_Merkey wiki and I've tried to keep what I wrote factual. Merkey is a minor player in the whole SCOX vs World+dog lawsuit circus but he has done and said some very interesting things. I envision the wiki as just a container pointing to the various things he has said online. FYI I didn't have my jeff_v_wookie ID when I started, but I did this so my edits would be tagged as mine.</p>

Go ahead and let the Jeff_Merkey wiki die, but Jeffrey_Vernon_Merkey should continue ...

<p>This article is simply an attempt to harrass and google spam me with wikipedia. The links posted in previous versions contain libel, statements and emails I did not author which are attributed to me, and copyrighted materials and materials which are currently sealed under a Federal Court Order. The version of this story which is present under Jeff_Merkey is accurate and I approve of this content should wikipedia choose to keep it. Please do not allow others to post links to external content or copyrighted materials. End of JMERKEY:</p>
<p><br />
The Merkey "approved" pages are compleatly meaningless because it doesnt address the issues that would make the entry significant. That is his attempts to buy the linux kernel and his threats of lawsuits against those in the community who disagreeing with him. His (removed) legal threat against this forum is just another example of why this is important. I think that the community <b>CAN</b> create a NPOV entry that sticks to the known facts, however as long as Merky keeps reverting the page to his prefered version the community will continue to react in kind.

<p>Jeff seems intent on abusing wikipedia for his own ends, and he's bringing his obnoxious lawsuit threats (which are part of why he's notable) to wikipedia.

<p>Unfortunately the wikipedia has become embroiled in the tail end of a long running dispute between Jeff Merkey and everyone.</p>
<p>The controversy began with a <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=g:thl3463994640d&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;selm=2MMU9-71k-11%40gated-at.bofh.it" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=g:thl3463994640d&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;selm=2MMU9-71k-11%40gated-at.bofh.it" rel="nofollow">post</a> by Merkey to the Linux Kernel mailing list in which he offered $50,000 for a snapshot of the kernel to be re-licensed under the <a href="../../../b/s/d/BSD_c539.html" title="BSD">BSD</a> license. Currently the Kernel is licensed under the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_General_Public_License_c529.html" title="GNU General Public License">GPL</a>, this allows people to use and change the software but the changes must be public and also licensed under the GPL. The BSD license does not require that the software remains open and public and kernel snapshot could be exploited for commercial purposed without changes being given back to the community that created it. So say that this proposal caused discussion and controversy would be an understatement. Much abuse was directed at Jeff as a result of this proposal and it was almost universally rejected by the community.</p>
<p>As a result of this proposal some people began digging. One thing that was found was legal documents between Timpanogos Research Group (Merkeys company) and Novell (Merkeys former employer). Novell alleged misappropriation of trade secrets and Merkey alleged sexual harassment. Novell requested a temporary injunction against Merkey that was granted. The text of the <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20041021131512626" class="external text" title="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20041021131512626" rel="nofollow">injunction</a> is extremely critical of Merkey, paragraphs 112-125 are particularly damming. Merkey then began to threaten anyone who hosted or discussed the ruling. He <a href="http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:zBuiVagOp08J:lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/22/262+merkey+judge+stooge&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:zBuiVagOp08J:lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/22/262+merkey+judge+stooge&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">argued</a> that the Judge was a Novell stooge and that the ruling was a preliminary one and that he was completely vindicated in the final sealed settlement agreement.</p>
<p>On Jun 21 Merkey filed suit against a few named individuals and 200 ”John Does”. As part of the filing he included the sealed final ruling between himself and Novell. Due to a filing error the sealed document was publicly available for a short period. The settlement agreement did not vindicate Merkey as previously claimed. Within a few hours of the inadvertent release of the document it was being mirrored all over the internet and was being widely discusses.</p>
<p>Merkey began to threaten those who hosted and discussed the settlement agreement and he soon filed an amended complaint that named those individuals and websites.</p>
<p>Some highlights of the <a href="http://scofacts.org/Merkey-Perens-7.pdf" class="external text" title="http://scofacts.org/Merkey-Perens-7.pdf" rel="nofollow">Amended complaint.</a></p>
<ul>
<li>He has alleged a broad range of first amendment, torturous interference, identity theft, and hate crimes.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Perens_e2e2.html" title="Bruce Perens">Bruce Perens</a> suggested in a public posting that Merkey be added to each users <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killfile.html" title="Killfile">killfile</a>. Merkey accused him of making death threats.</li>
<li>He has accused the linux community of aiding and sponsoring terrorism.</li>
<li>And much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Merky has continued his complaint of abuse and threats against anyone who is critical of him. The 2 deleted entries on this page are good examples of this. This is the most basic of background information, a proper summary would be many pages. Fava 18:52, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have not seen the article yet, so I can't comment on the specific article's merit but I believe it is highly likely that an article on Jeff Merkey would meet our notability criteria from many angles. He has been discussed in the national media, and has caused at least a much noise as any infamous internet personality though at least some portion of it is limited to the Linux related community. On the flip side, I think we will have a very difficult time producing a good article about him that merkey will agree with, because there are some very solid references which say some very negative things about him. I strongly disagree with the above delete view that the article couldn't be objective... Unlike sollog Merkey doesn't really have followers, and he is also not completely unreasonable. If we can write an acceptable article on any internet personality we can write one on Merkey. My position should be cosidered a <b>keep</b> because deleting the specific text will not help the stability problems we've had with this notable subject. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 22:33, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep - highly notable in the SCO Vs Linux litigation. He's somewhere between a nutter and a troll (including legal trolling), but that doesn't affect whether he warrants an article. Read older articles on Groklaw (he's not mentioned in current ones precisely because he's suing them now) and you'll see why. I urge all delete <s>voters</s> whateverit'scallednows to read, learn and reconsider.

I'm going to do this by adding the single-sentence synopses to the target article under a new section heading, removing the then-redundant wikilinks and adding links to the Wikiquotes entries in the same new section.
