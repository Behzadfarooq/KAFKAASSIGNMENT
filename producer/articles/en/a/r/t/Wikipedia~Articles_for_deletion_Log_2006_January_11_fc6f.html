<li><b>Comment</b> You have to weigh the value of what was in the article when it was nominated for AfD, and one name a list does not make. So the Nomination for deletion was ultimately correct see <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">CSD-A1</a>. The issue is he used Article for Deletion instead of speedying it. The people with the sudden interest in the fate of this article have no history of editing oriental art articles, or for the most part art at all. I checked their contributions. They are all however regular contributers to other list articles. I sincerely believe that they are letting their personal opinion of the value of these types of articles, to come between the removal of an article which has limited value, and in this case can be best served with an existing category. The use of Categories is the proper way to go for things of this nature, especially where there is little interest in developing, maintaining, and promoting the list. Several people have mentioned that the lists best indicate articles which need creation. This is true however the process is better served by the request for article process. Non-existent articles links in article content are of a limited benefit to the Wikipedia and indeed can run off newbie visitors. -- <a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanLarson_f734.html" title="User:SusanLarson">SusanLarson</a> <span><sup>(<a href="../../../s/u/s/User_talk%7ESusanLarson_fb19.html" title="User talk:SusanLarson">User Talk</a>, <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SusanLarson&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SusanLarson&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">New talk</a></span>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SusanLarson_f10c.html" title="Special:Contributions/SusanLarson">Contribs</a>)</sup></span> 22:36, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>comment</b> CSD-A1 is short articles: Articles #1 "Very short articles providing little or no context (e.g., "He is a funny man that has created Factory and the Hacienda. And, by the way, his wife is great."). Limited content is not in itself a reason to delete if there is enough context to allow expansion. A search engine may help in determining context and allow for the article's expansion." One name lists would qualify under that section. As for no history I was primarily speaking of T. Anthony who initially stepped up proclaiming an active interest handling this article. At the time I posted that I did not know others had shown an interest in or stepped up to edit on that article. At this point I am flexible on keeping the article or not. I would suggest that a list should be more than a list and include actual text on the arts in Japan.

<li><b>Another Comment</b> - Well, energy in this case he is considering potential energy, can be related to a force causing it, (this is valid and meaningful only when the force is conservative so that the integral of F in the coordinate space is path-independent) so that F_x = - dU/dx, x being the coordinate and U the potential energy, to give the force in that direction. This means that when dU/dx = 0, there is no force, which occurs when U is at a max/min or a saddle point, which means it can be in unstable, stable, or stable and unstable in various directions respectively. Find any 1st yr universtiy physics book, or a 2ndyr+ classical mechanics book, and this will be verified to be well-founded knowledge, which the author is trying to convey in an informal way for non-physicists. I have no previous experience with the policy of wikipedia towards the suitability of informal pedagogical presentations. <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> 05:23, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm torn. On the one hand, this doesn't cite references and isn't very well formatted. On the other hand, it's entirely true, and a VERY useful technique I was taught in Physics. He's absolutely right; if energy is conserved you can simply calculate everything based on energy equations and the solution is a lot easier to get. <b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 04:56, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Authors Comment</b>. Thanks for the discussion. I am fully in agreement that this page should be deleted and the contents moved to a new section in Energy. I started it as a seperate page to provoke the discussion, without messing with the main energy page too much, it seems that strategy worked (forgive a noob his sins). This section was not intended to talk about potential energy, nor finding the force on a capacitor. I felt having read the Energy section that were I an intelligent non-physicist, say a government legislator or a bright 14 year-old, I would still not understand why the concept of Energy was so very useful, rather like a treatise on complex numbers that does not mention that they unify solutions of polynomial equations and simplify electrical calculations. This section is intended ultimately to convey WHY people should take the time to bother to use the concept, rather than HOW to use the concept. Does it belong in wikipedia? I've read "what wikipedia is not", and it's not clear about what I'm trying to do. In part, that's why the article is so short and ill-drafted. The intention is ultimately to have one well-chosen succintly described example from each main useful branch of energy calculations (bounds on conversion, force finding, equilibrium finding etc). Where to put the section is a problem. If it grows to lots of examples, it should go at the end for risk of hijacking the main article. However, if it is to fulfil its purpose, that of getting people to spend the time reading the rest of the article, then it should really go up front. I could have spent a lot of time putting together a well-polished section only to be told that it was not wiki policy anyway. So in the spirit of "you can't break wiki, give it a try", I offer the aim of this section up for consideration. If thought appropriate, then I can work on better examples without touching the how part of the article, and referencing them out to the other articles that cover them in more depth. I guess I am really wanting the wiki to be more accessible in this article. We are all familiar with the so-called help screen, which only makes sense if we have enough background to understand its terminology. I feel that the assumed level of knowledge to be able to appreciate the information on the energy section is too high for many of the visitors that may be turning to that page for information. Expanding the breadth of the target audience is not easy. I do not advocate "dumbing-down" of the existing information, but do suggest an additional section which "reaches down" to hook people in, starting with why we should bother with the concept at all. The comment about edutainment is quite near to what was intended. It is possible that in attempting to present or sell physics, it is possible to stray away from strict NPOV, but are there really any other majority concensus ways of viewing the world? Could I go further? In teaching my children about energy, I have used the currency analogy, Joules is capital, energy is rate of spend, friction and other losses is taxes and exchange rate levys, levers and transformers get you between a few high value bills and many low value coins, it's an analogy that can pushed a surprisingly long way before it fails to inform. That's what I want to do, inform on the "would understand physics with just a little more help" level.

I don't see why policy should be different for demoscene productions -- unless you want to argue that the demoscene is less worthy of historic documentation than the music industry, and that is shaky ground. <a href="../../../d/i/l/User%7EDilvie_59bd.html" title="User:Dilvie">Dilvie</a> 01:48, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>My apologies, all along I have had a different view of what the Wikipedia was about. In setting up my movie on the Wikipedia, my original intent was to create a small article explaining a little about the movies for those who ask me what "Superlander" is when it comes up in conversation. I now realize the wiki is not for non-notable items such as this. Please accept my apologies. - Tiltonic</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> It is defently not known as a whupee jump, but a search on google for burpee yeilds the correct name for the excercise.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable. Not every porn star should have an entry on wikipedia. There is no information here about her anyway; this is basically just an ad for her website. Her name apparently is inaccurate too so it should be renamed if it is kept but it should not be kept at all. If she is not known to the general public, or even most of the porn-watching public, she doesn't belong in wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 02:50, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The IMDB isn't based on legions of fans creating articles; most pages are created and maintained by agents to help promote their clients. As a longtime member of the "porn-watching public", I will avow that I have not only never heard of her, but have never even <i>seen</i> her.

<li>My opinion has not changed since the last AFD discussion. No biographical sources are cited by the article, or were produced as a result of the prior AFD discussion. (The IMDB listing gives her date of birth and height in its biographical section. If that were all of the biographical source information required for a biography in an encyclopaedia, everyone with a passport or a driving licence would qualify.) Note that the place of birth given in this article <i>has no source apart from the almost certainly entirely fictitious biography on the web site</i>. People in the pornography industry are usually deliberately unverifiable by their own choice, for obvious reasons, and this person appears to be no exception. The purported biographies that accompany pornographic pictures are usually fiction, moreover. As before, <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:42, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Obviously this is a broader subject than just this AfD, but fictional characters are verifiable in that we know what books/movies/etc. they're in, there's often published criticism concerning them, essays about them, etc. What's kind problematic here is that there's really nothing verifiably known about this person other than that she's been filmed having sex 35 times. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:58, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> an indescriminate collection of information though, obviously. Biographies are written on verifiable information... it's just hard to see what's going to be verifiable here other than the contents of her IMDB page, that's what I meant.

<li>As <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> points out, the fictional characters for which we have biographies <i>have independent secondary source material available</i>, such as third-party annotations of or commentaries on the works of fiction concerned.

<li>I actually wrote "independent secondary source material". Ironically, the "proof" that you've offered is proof of my point. You've hyperlinked to a list of products for sale in a catalogue that contains no biographical information whatsoever and an on-line biography every field of which apart from the birthdate, ethnicity, and hair colour is "No data" — giving as much information about this person as a driving licence or a passport, as I said.

<li><b>Comment</b>: why you won't find it in encyclopedias is explained below. Zamanfou is an attitude and lifestyle, not an organised movement.

</li>
<li><b>DELETE</b>. Could be acceptable as a lexicographical entry (an entry in a Greek slang dictionary), but not as an encyclopedia lemma. The social phenomenon it describes is neither unique to Greece, nor unanimously bound with the title word. Unless somebody provides links or references to some widely respected resources treating the alleged social phenomenon as a unique case for which a special term is required (and thus establishing a strong bind with the title-word), unless this happens, the entry should be deleted. As said, it would be perfectly OK to have a related lemma treating Greek slang expressions, <i>marked and labeled as such</i>. Modern Greek has an intricate system of profane verbal expressions and signs, and it would be great if someone were to document it and, if possible, link it to the formative social phenomena. But the "Zamanfou" article should be deleted. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 62.1.62.220 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.1.62.220_1aeb.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.1.62.220">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is definately not a Hoax, ask any Greek and you will find out that it is totally correct</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Uses foul Greek language. There is no phenomenon of the kind but terminology and the gestures mentioned can be found in the streets. It is like elaborating in detail on gestures and idiotic neologisms. Entry regarding the army is completely irrelevant with the subject, term "loufa" as well. The lazy idiots described in the article are always unable to respond correctly to disciplined situations in life, like in the army, in a decent job, etc. It is a silly article, unworthy of Wikipedia. It cannot be rewritten.

<li><b>Comment</b> I do not have a position an opinion on whether it should be deleted or not. However, being greek, a couple of points. It is vulgar. A lot more than anyone might consider even remotely necessary. It is badly written. It generalizes a lot, being at points inconsistent. However, there is indeed such a culture in Greece, although informal. Even formally, many have referred to relevant aspects as characteristic of the Greek people. Perhaps it would be best to scrap and rewrite under "Ωχαδερφισμός" or something. I wonder, though, how one would write that using proper naming conventions. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECangelis_91e1.html" title="User:Cangelis">Cangelis</a> 11:01, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> it's the quintessence of modern Greek society and psyche, although the article should reduce it's 'manual of behaviour for Zemamfoutists' look and it needs to make clear that Zamanfou is an abstract phenomenon; not an official or organised movement with dedicated followers, as sometimes non-Greeks would wrongly understand. That's why you cant' find it on Google and find bibliogaphy and references.

<li>NO, this is NOT a hoax. The phenomenon exists. All the article describes, including the hand gestures and foul language do happen. The terms are broadly used in everyday life. Even, I use them. As a Greek male who lived in Greece through the 80s as well as presently and served in the army, I cannot describe how close this struck to my experience and how relevant it is to my life.</li>

<dd>Loufa could be seen as an extension of Zamanfou, even though it is an related army term. There are even Greek movies about loufa. The movies are called no surprizing called "Λούφα και Παραλαγή" and "Λούφα και Παραλαγή 2" (the latter one is by Nikos Perakis).</dd>

And since there are no official Greek government statistics on the demographic distribution of <i>zamanfou</i> attitudes, we need to cite more of whatever evidence we do have for its prevalence among different age groups.

So, look for alterial motives when a Greek national asks you to "delete an article that's utter nonsence". Ask them "why is nonsense?", first. About the references: They are out there, definately.

<li>I really fail to see how all this can be verified bibliographically, although I can agree with every single word of the article. Come to Greece and ask anyone you want about what Zamanfou is and not only everyone will tell you about it, but you will clearly see it on yourself; ask for books and articles about it and you will find none. I don't know if it's a weakness of Wikipedia: to erase a general truth simply for being unverifiable <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPictureuploader_dff5.html" title="User:Pictureuploader">Pictureuploader</a> 17:47, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>A <b>comment</b> on google hits: It is quite natural that searching for "Zamanfu" only yields 333 hits in Google. The term as used in the article name is a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeklish.html" title="Greeklish">greeklish</a> transliteration of the french language slang expression <i>je m'en fou</i> (420.000 google hits) or <i>je m'en fous</i> (217.000 hits). I think one could consider <i>zamanfou</i> a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>, as there exists an otherwise slang ("argot") term to describe the state of being "en fous", <i>je m'en foutisme</i> (only 634 hits but with an entry in the <a href="http://www.languefrancaise.net/glossaire/detail.php?id=13866" class="external text" title="http://www.languefrancaise.net/glossaire/detail.php?id=13866" rel="nofollow">"Dictionnaire d'argot"</a>). From the above I would note that apart from cleanup and verification, there should also be a renaming as I see it to one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Je m'en foutisme</i> (which would mean that the article would have to incorporate information on the french version of the mentality)</li>
<li><i>Ohaderfismos</i> (which gets <i>no</i> google hits in english and merely 266 hits in greek (ωχαδερφισμός) but could(?) be accepted as a transliteration)</li>
<li><i>Oh Aderfe</i> (Ωχ αδερφε) which gets merely 764 hits in english but a relative impressive number of hits, 14.900, in greek as "ωχ αδερφέ".</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> I’m sure that you find apathetic and socially irresponsible people in every country of the world. This article can only have meaning as satire or a joke. Taken literally as an attempt at sociological analysis it is plain stupid. The author takes a gesture, a few words, and a quite common human characteristic, found I’m sure in people of all races and colors and creates a “social phenomenon”. He gives it a start point in time (that has developed since the late 1980s), a place of origin (It first began in Athens), and a background that even involves the Greek civil war.</p>
<p>The paragraph in which he offers an extremely detailed description of the movement of the hands towards the genitals organised in 5 different categories is proof enough as far as I’m concerned that the author just wanted to spend a fun evening in front of his keyboard.</p>
<p>This pseudo-sociological text could be amusing in a blog but it can be extremely misleading as an article in an encyclopedia. Of course the word exists. Of course the gestures exist , but you can not make a social phenomenon out of them. It is nothing more than the author’s personal, completely unscientific opinion probably inspired by certain satirical pieces (I see links to Nikos Dimou)</p>

<b>DELETE</b> As far as I am concerned, it could be accepted as a lexical entry in a glossary but definitely not as an attempt to analyse a - so called - sociological phenomenon, especially in an encyclopedia. Absolutely misleading. It just doesn't have any scientific grounds whatsoever. Furthermore, the links to Nikos Dimou articles are just a collection of the author's opinions, definitely not a scientific approach. I don't even think that Nikos Dimou intended them to be considered scientific.</p>
<p>This is definitely not a culture-specific phenomenon. It's not bound to the Greek society. Maybe the gestures are. As an extralinguistic phenomenon, gestures are linked to language itself, and these gestures are definitely linked to the Greek language. But that's about it. It should not be associated with a sociological stance, well, at least not one attributed to a specific nation, anyway.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> Unrestrained generalization could be borderline racism. Note the following comments:</p>
<pre>
‘look for alterial motives when a Greek national asks you to delete an article’
‘your average modern Greek assumes bad faith’
‘Greek society, currently, really hates the idea of their dirty laundry getting public’
‘not even part of a sub-culture but rather a vital part of the modern Greek mentality’
‘it’s the quintessence of modern Greek society and psyche’
‘Anyone who has been in Athens for 5 minutes can attest as to the existence or not of Zamanfu’
</pre>
<p>Such sort of aphorisms, (most of them written by the same person who wrote the article), are simply biased in their ‘steamroller logic’. I was born in Athens and I’ve lived my entire life in Greece. I’m 28 years old now and I have never met a single human being that I would categorize as part of this ‘social phenomenon’. Have I lived in a bubble then? You know, as far as I’m concerned what really makes this article fall apart is the systematization that it leads to. Taking this word and that gesture and some example of mentality of indifference and combining them all to create an actual ‘sociological phenomenon’ a system of values, a pattern of behaviour, conscious and so specific. Well such a theory or movement or system simply does not exist</p>
<p>The author also gives specific information that even more enhances the view of this as an actual sociological phenomenon, official and probably studied by scientists. Note the following:</p>
<pre>
‘that has developed since the late 1980s’
‘main supporters of this phenomenon were generally between the ages of 16-25’
‘citizens that chose to prioritize their individual well being’
‘It is thought of as a form of insubordination against the state and the Greek status quo’
‘Due to Zamanfou, as of 2006 the cohesiveness of the Greek society has deteriorated to some extend’
‘this was also one cause of the less than optimal recovery of the Greek economy,
as a member of the European Union, during the eighties and the nineties’
‘Subscribers to this ideology use a characteristic phrase’
‘The Hellenic Armed Forces have developed a military version of Zamanfou, called Loufa’
</pre>
<p>I doubt the credibility of all of the above quotes. I suppose that in this context the hand gesture so eloquently described by the author is a definite way for the scientist to recognize the ‘Zanmafoutian’. It could be a sure way for members of the ‘movement’ to recognize each other as well. You know sort of like a secret handshake :)</p>
<p>The part about the military variation of the ‘phenomenon’ called ‘loufa’ is also nonsense. Loufa or the verb loufaro is slang and describes the international in my opinion tendency to slack off. It is not a word or a tendency that is specific to the Greek military forces.</p>
<p>It’s like me saying that there are people in America for example, who sometimes instead of working spend their time in the office surfing the internet or checking their personal email. Actually there are expressions in the English language such as ‘I don’t give a damn’, ‘I don’t give a shit’, “I don’t give a flying fuck” etc, all used to express indifference. The people who use such expressions and slack off at work are part of a specific sociological phenomenon. Add a few dates, a fancy name and a link to a ‘how to slack off at work and get away with it’ guide and I have my sociological Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>There is not such a thing as a sociological phenomenon called Zamanfou, developed in the late 1980’s, originally in Athens, from 16-25 year olds…. etc, etc. Just the personal, totally unscientific systematization of a number of words, phrases and international mentalities, all woven together by the author in a pseudo-scientific mess.</p>
<p>It might be funny, certainly puts a smile on your face, but it is just not true. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. People come here for information. It should not include articles appearing to be scientific while providing completely personal views and ideas.

<p><b>KEEP</b> but refine. As a non-Greek who has lived and worked with Greeks for two decades, I can say that it is 100% true. The elaboration on hand gestures is ridiculous and should be deleted. Although I have never heard this social condition referred to as zamanfou, I have seen numerous comentaries on the phenomenon of Ωχαδερφισμός in the Greek press. If someone has the time, they could translate a few articles or post references to them. This is by no means a uniquely Greek phenomenon, but in Greece it does indeed have a unique expression bordering on a counterculture. As far as loufa goes, it does not really apply to the Greek military as a whole but only to the conscripts who serve a 12-month tour which is viewed as an unwanted interruption from their life. The truth of the matter is that the Greek military is largely a professional force with conscripts relegated to menial labor duties and other busy work that would drive most Americans mad.

<p><b>KEEP!!!</b> Having read the article on Zamanfou I must stress with a <b>thick underline</b> that the article must be kept. The term is no longer being used except by those of a certain age but the phenomenon is certainly here to stay with Greek everyday life unfortunate as it may be.

<li><b>Save</b> I feel that the Steve Bello Band should not be deleted because they have this acclaim that not a lot of other bands have. They have been doing extremely well with their crowd pull, they have numerous endorsements that are not easy to get, they have been featured in several "Zines" in the NY/NJ area and their bassist Courtenay Penick had a feature in the December Issue of "Bass Player" Magazine. They are on a fast track to the top and are pulling people from all over, Yngwie Malmsteen couldn't even sell out a 1500 seat venue in Philly, yet this 3 person band is pulling people from all over the NY/NJ area and has a deep following and is yet to plan a new tour supporting the new album. If the Steve Bello Band gets deleted for their "non existance in the music industry, then other bands that are in the same boat need to be, The Muckrakers (louisville) are in this fourm and they have 3 releases on an Indy label and why are they not getting threatend with deletion.

<dd>Katherine, how are we supposed to write a useful encyclopedia if we don't have a set of standards that govern what we will allow ourselves to publish? How are we supposed to verify that your submissions are accurate, for example, if this movie has never been covered in the press? I hope you'll read <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and understand why we have these debates. I assure you that nobody here has anything against you personally - it's just that many, many people try to use Wikipedia to publish announcements, opinionated statements, or unverifiable information. It's nothing personal - these articles just do not meet Wikipedia's standards. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 06:44, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: AFAICT this user is not involved in the making of this film. She seems to be just a very devoted fan. Hell hath no fury like a groupie scorned, I guess. I wonder if (based on her comments here) she has some issues with the people who did the other fan sites and this is her way of trying to get back.</dd>
<dd>Also note the recently created <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricnorcross_ec25.html" title="User:Ericnorcross">User:Ericnorcross</a> page, with this bit of personal philosophy: <i>I find Wikipedia to be nothing more than an internet web-board, designed to let those around you decide what's true or not. If they don't believe you or cannot provide proof, it must be false. Bullies.</i> It was used for some of the attempts to remove the AfD notice.

<dd>Neither of us know this person. Good faith assumes she either worked on the project or is good friends with people who did. I really find your comment "Hell hath no fury like a groupie scorned" and speculation about sock puppets to be inappropriate. This article fails to meet Wikipedia standards. I hope it does become encyclopedic after a few months on the festival circuit.

<dd>I checked the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ericnorcross/" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/ericnorcross/" rel="nofollow">one site</a> which <i>is</i> devoted to the film and promoting it. Given the relatively minuscule budgets of most independent films, if she were involved in any way she'd be credited there. Googling on her name plus his <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=qka&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Eric+Norcross%22%2BKatherine%2BJohnson&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=qka&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Eric+Norcross%22%2BKatherine%2BJohnson&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">produces nothing</a> that would suggest her involvement with him in any professional way.</dd>
<dd>Yes, it would be nice for him (at least) if this did one day rate an article.

<dd>Okay, I phrased that badly. I should have said that <i>the article</i> provides no evidence that this term is in common, widespread use. Encyclopedia articles need to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and their subject has to be, in my opinion, important enough to merit an encyclopedia article. If you want to rewrite the thing, I will reconsider my position but a handful of hits to websites doesn't equal notability AFAIC. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyk_0a6a.html" title="User:Reyk">Reyk</a> 06:26, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have to agree with Fuma. Google shows over 11,000 separate uses of the term online in various contexts. It has been used for quite a long time here (in Manchester, NH.) The owner of the Website manchvegas.net (which was registered by that person in 2000, according to whois) says he's not OLD enough to know the origin of that term. I don't know him, but even if he's just 20, that's establishing long-term use.</p>
<p>An article in the Hippo Press newspaper (a local alternative weekly) back in the <a href="http://www.hippopress.com/pubnote/pubnote05818.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hippopress.com/pubnote/pubnote05818.html" rel="nofollow">summer</a> noted that, "the mayor is pushing to replace the nickname ManchVegas with Manchhatten" (meaning Manchester+Manhattan.) He's now the former mayor. Maybe there was a backlash. Still, the mayor (who's about 60) knew the term and knows it is well-used.</p>
<p>The paper also noted in an article that someone was selling "ManchVegas" t-shirts. His Website noted that they sold extremely well after the article came out. Not solid evidence, but at least hearsay evidence.</p>
<p>A 2003 <a href="http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/North_America/United_States_of_America/New_Hampshire/Manchester-831355/Local_Customs-Manchester-R-1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/North_America/United_States_of_America/New_Hampshire/Manchester-831355/Local_Customs-Manchester-R-1.html" rel="nofollow">note</a> on Virtualtourist.com sums things up well: "Residents reflect the regional dry humor by referring to sedate Manchester as 'ManchVegas'."</p>
<p>Anyway, it's recognized, and yes, it's a colloquialism. I do, however, think this article needs expansion, if it's going to stay. Maybe Fuma should contact me and we'll do some more digging for sources. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 07:01, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do have to add that "No evidence that anyone ever actually uses it" can't possibly be the case, given even the barest of citations I have submitted. Was any research done to back that up, or was it assumed someone just made the phrase up recently? <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 07:42, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><s><b>Redirect</b> Now, i'll be perfectly honest here, I thought a buddy of mine made this term up, and when I saw this AfD I was convinced he was the person who wrote it. I was wrong. In either case, this should be redirected to Manchester, NH because there's nothing here. I'm not sure this will be much more than a stub, and it doesnt deserve a stub status - make a subsection in the Manchester page. If it does turn out I'm wrong, and there is a not of stuff on the term, it can always be re-split later.</s><b>Keep</b> Article's been fleshed out more than I thought it could be. --<a href="../../../j/f/g/User%7EJfg284_447f.html" title="User:Jfg284">jfg284</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/f/g/User_talk%7EJfg284_403e.html" title="User talk:Jfg284">you were saying?</a></sup> 12:32, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You may very well be right. However, consider that this is a cultural distinctive like any other. If the Kurdish <a href="../../../w/o/r/Work_song.html" title="Work song">Work song</a> deserves a page (and a very short one at that) and the cultural peculiarity of the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_cringe.html" title="Scottish cringe">Scottish cringe</a> does, and - perhaps the most analogous - the oft-used term "<a href="../../../m/a/s/Massholes.html" title="Massholes">Massholes</a>" has it's own page, then a nickname that is well known and, frankly, is well used deserves one, too. Frankly, this almost qualifies as a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">Portmanteau</a> word - which combines two words into one. Though it may be dubiously one, since I'm not sure place names fit in that definition. If so, however, the word rises to a new level of legitimacy. This evening, I hope to start expanding the article with sources I've found, and perhaps it will win converts. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 20:37, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Okay, you're right that checkin activity is irrelevant. In support of notability, here are some arguments. 1) I personally researched templating engines once when I was deciding which one to use, and Cheetah was one of the top candidates. 2) Cheetah Template is 4th hit on google for "Cheetah", a very generic word. 3) Linux distro packages exist (python-cheetah in Debian) <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_14.html" title="January 14">01-14</a> 11:14<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span></li>

<dd>I can prove anything I've written but am open to what ever wikipedia decides.There is a coffee house in Minneapolis where I played at called Muddy Waters.I also have played at several bars in Milwaukee often at venue called The Trash Festival,and an open mic in Seatle,Washington so if these count as touring the country then I have.As far as charting on mp3tunes.com it may still be up there and Pink Pants was number 15 during the month of December 2005 in folk pop section there and it may still be there.My page here was up for over a year at wikipedia and no one said anything until I connected to Madison so I wonder if it's just jeolousy but rather than acuse people falsely I would rather this group make it own choice not base on my music style which is not the same as Ben Sidren but decide based on whether I really was on Dr Demento which if you go to <a href="http://mypage.iu.edu/~jbmorris/FAQ/drd01.0708.html" class="external free" title="http://mypage.iu.edu/~jbmorris/FAQ/drd01.0708.html" rel="nofollow">http://mypage.iu.edu/~jbmorris/FAQ/drd01.0708.html</a> you'll see I was not only on Dr Demento but my song Have A Peanut Butter Sandwich charted at number 1 in the Funny 5 that week--<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtpaul_7dcc.html" title="User:Artpaul">Artpaul</a> 23:31, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I agree with nominator that this is too narrow a topic. I agree with <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> that a smerge to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle.net.html" title="Battle.net">battle.net</a> seems appropriate. Let the folks who care about that article decide what content here is useful to that article. The best way to accomplish this is to turn the article into a redirect, thus preserving history for those who may want it. But I suppose I'm somewhat outside the realm of Afd with that suggestion. This is a good example of why Afd is bad and talk pages should be used for this type of discussion. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:52, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

Nixer has some kind of agenda to present Stalin as some kind of semi-god while ignoring the basic military and diplomatic principles that the most senior military officer of one country is equal to the senior military officer of another. The same goes for Heads of State. The President of Mali is assumed equal to the President of the USA in diplomatic circles. Nixer disagrees with that and has been edit warring on the article to push his POV <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comparative_military_ranks_of_World_War_II&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comparative_military_ranks_of_World_War_II&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>.

All other editors disagree with his views. He has cited no acceptable sources and now that it has become clear that there is no way he will get his POV though, when at least three other editors will be rolling him back until he cites a source, there is no other outcome.

<dd>This is not a content dispute. The point is there is no sources to build the article on.

<p>nnbio; his claim to fame is that he is an online columnist and reviewer of <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bollywood.html" title="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> films. A google search gives 30,100 hits as his reviews are on popular websites that get picked up by the blogger communities. However, note that not a single hit on Google (atleast not in the first 20) has any information on him. Looks like he is also either liked passionately or disliked intensely by a lot by people influenced by his reviews - article has become a vandalism magent of late <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 12:56, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I feel he is notable. I did a quick google. I found lot of blogs link to his reviews and relate to what he said on Indiafm. Like you said, I did see a lot of dislike towards him.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The point is, we don't have even a single bit of information about him apart from the fact that he writes for indiafm.com. Is it notable by itself?? Just as we shouldn't vote delete due to a low google count, similarly we shouldn't vote keep due to a high google count.

<li><b>Comment</b> the article is about the Bih-sut, "a small tribe of Pakhto-speaking Afghans".

<li>That's absolutely correct - I was hoping someone could source it but they haven't. I'm changing my vote to <b>Delete unless sourced</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> I had a go at finding proof, but all I could find were maps that don't show the tribe, and so can't be used to prove or disprove the tribe's existence (since it can be argued that they are not detailed enough to show a small tribe), e.g. <a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/salrc/afghanistan/materials/maps.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/salrc/afghanistan/materials/maps.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_ethnoling_97.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_ethnoling_97.jpg" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 01:10, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

It is relevant - we are arguing degree of notability. As noted elsewhere in this page, Eduard Einstein is notable enough to merit coverage on several web pages, and to be the subject of a book. I submit that if this makes him more notable than a subject that is currently accepted on Wikipedia, the article should stand. Since his life, medical condition and actions no doubt had a significant impact on one of the greatest scientists of all time, I think he is notable, certainly more so than some socialite's dog. <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryguy_28f0.html" title="User:Dryguy">dryguy</a> 17:44, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's too late to try to keep this brief but Anon, you're making my case for me. The schizophrenia.com website says "Albert Einstein's son - Eduard Einstein" and the other one is a site devoted to Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein is famous, his son isn't. Other examples in the former web site are Dr. James Watson's son - who apparently didn't even have a name and has <i>no</i> mention on Wikipedia, let alone his own article - and Alan Alda's Mother who has a one-line article that I'll be Afd'ing next. Mrs. Alda was at least a beauty pageant winner and a model. You're saying that the Einstein article can be fleshed out - but it can't. There's nothing left to say. Because he wasn't noteworthy. He has a few lines in articles for Albert Einstein and Eduard's mother and that's all that's necessary. Oh, and Paris Hilton is a kazillionaire and an actress. That's noteworthiness. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 19:14, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I haven't heard one example of his name being notable outside of being the son of Albert Einstein. Has anyone read this book? I don't see what else you would write about him. He started showing signs of schizophrenia in 1930 - the year he turned 20. I can't imagine he accomplished much before age 20 and, from the little I know about schizophrenia, people rarely do much after the onset of schizophrenia either. I know - John Nash from the movie A Beautiful Mind - but his most noteworthy accomplishments were still before the onset of the illness, weren't they? Regardless, show me one example of John Nash-type notoriety in Eduard Einstein - besides his being Albert's son - and I'd agree with you. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 03:04, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I created this page from a request from <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">User:Striver</a> in relation to the conspiracy theory in relation to 9/11. However, some segments of the Wikipedia community have gone to lengths to try to remove that aspect from the page. The protests themselves were seriously non-notable, and without the link they don't warrant their own entry. The amount of abusive behaviour from editors surrounding this is just ridiculous and I am sick of it, so this article needs to go. I never wanted to make the article in the first place, so can we just say goodbye to it, and perhaps just put in a redirect to <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> like it was before? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 08:08, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Rhetoric aside, the protests themselves were <i>massively</i> notable. They dominated the news for weeks, caused legal action that was ongoing for years, and are still fairly widely remembered today as the peak of the Australian anti-globalisation movement. The conspiracy theory (that peaceful Australian anti-globalisation protesters mysteriously had something to do with Middle Eastern religious terrorists because incidents happened on the same day a year later) is complete crankery which I very much doubt a reputable source could be found for (the original source was an anonymous <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a> post, of all things), and well deserves to be removed from the article. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 11:06, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As mentioned by Ambi, this protest was notable for many things. For starters, it was the biggest anti-globalisation rally in Australia, and the "S11" protests are well known here. It is unfortunate that the article has been hijacked by the 2000-9-11&lt;-&gt;2001-9-11 conspiracy theories, but this is a candidate for cleaning up, not deletion. - <a href="../../../d/l/e/User%7EDleigh_8a27.html" title="User:Dleigh">Synapse</a> 11:31, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can I post a still of myself being interviewed from the <i>Melbourne Rising</i> film? That's probably the only way I'll ever make it into Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 07:00, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I'll just say that I regret making this article. I told Shriver I didn't want to do it, but he insisted, and started a stub, so I did it. As I told him, there's no way that they could be responsible for 9/11. But they were suspects. The point I was trying to make with him was that Al Qaeda weren't responsible, not that s11 was. But the issue is that its important to include all suspects, however silly they may be. I for one think that Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9/11, and I think its pretty bleeding obvious that he was. But that's my opinion. I have never thought that s11 were responsible. Several thousand other people did though. And that is probably the most notable aspect of them. NOT including that element when discussing them is NEGLIGENT and IRRESPONSIBLE. That is the issue. But whether they deserve their own post for the protests is highly debatable. Protests + Conspiracy theory = yes. Protests alone = probably not. You have to consider this. If you are going to disregard a conspiracy theory which at minimum is far more likely than the ludicruous Jewish theory then you have to note that this is very much non-notable. How many other Anti-Globalisation protests have their own articles? Only 1 other. This one wasn't particularly notable. Only notable for the date that it was performed in, 1 year to the day before the 9/11 attacks. And besides which, I would like to ask for the people who engaged in personal attacks, either in edit summaries, or abusive messages to my talk page, to apologise. I never once claimed ownership of the article, it was not my idea to make it, and I do not deserve such abuse. I for one never thought it was significantly notable for its own article. A small section in 9/11 conspiracy theories is enough. And maybe another small section in the anti-globalisation movement. That's been done. No more is needed. I am very much reluctant in this, especially as it is a somewhat farcical conspiracy theory. Yes, there was cover up, but that doesn't make it a conspiracy theory. And the CIA very much did cover up 9/11 issues, including this, of which there is evidence. But that doesn't mean that these guys are responsible. Whilst they had motive to attack the World Trade Centre, they didn't have motive to attack the Pentagon. Case closed right there. And hence, article deleted right there. To have this used as a rationale for labelling me as a "conspiracy theorist" when I have not contributed to any other conspiracy theory article is worse than ludicruous. It is downright irresponsible. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 10:31, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>No one's calling you a conspiracy theorist for creating this article, Zordrac. It's just that the conspiracy theory doesn't really come into things - it's such a minority view that there doesn't appear to be any reputable sources for it (and thus can't go in the article), and you're obviously in the minority about the significance of the demonstrations. No one knows about the conspiracy theory, but ask most Australians if they remember the S11 demonstrations, and you'll very probably get a positive answer. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 12:06, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>—"SNK Boss Syndrome" is just a colloquial term, shouldn't be here in an Encyclopedia, there are better terms to describe overly powerful bosses rather than saying the words "SNK Boss Syndrome", now that there are Namco and Tecmo bosses that are overly too cheap (i.e. Jinpachi Mishima). — <a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVesther_244c.html" title="User:Vesther">Dark Insanity</a> 04:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Namco and Tecmo, however, have not been known to have insanely hard/cheap bosses for more than ten years. That's been the staple of SNK's fighting games since <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfgang_Krauser_c7a4.html" title="Wolfgang Krauser">Wolfgang Krauser</a> at least. Much like how a great many non-Konami games use the cheat code Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, it's still called the <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konami_Code_6533.html" title="Konami Code">Konami Code</a> because Konami started it, they did it more than anyone else combined, and they became (in)famous because of it. This is why, when somone in just about any given forum with members over the age of 18 posts a thread about tough, cheap bosses, it usually doesn't get past two pages before someone mentions SNK Bosses in general. This is why, when a reviewer mentions the difficulty of a boss in a fighting game, he compares it to the bosses of SNK's games(see links above).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While the use of the word "Syndrome" may sound a little too colliqual to some to describe it, I can't say it's inaccurate. Wikipedia's entry on <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndrome.html" title="Syndrome">Syndrome</a> says this: <i>In medicine, the term syndrome is the association of several clinically recognizable features, signs, symptoms, phenomena or characteristics which often occur together, so that the presence of one feature alerts the physician to the presence of the others.</i></p>
<p>The contributors to this thread have done a very good job in pointing out the recognizable features, signs, symptoms, phenomena and characteristics that have made the Bosses in SNK's fighting games so damn tough. While not a medical syndrome, it's certainly one gameplay-wise.</p>
<p>Not that there's not any precedent. See the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormtrooper_effect.html" title="Stormtrooper effect">Stormtrooper effect</a>. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESAMAS_7b35.html" title="User:SAMAS">SAMAS</a></p>

<li>That's like saying a Tiger has black stripes is POV. None of the "Symptoms" in the article(dude, did you even <i>read</i> it?) are done by any opinion.

Admittedly, I suppose there could be some debate as to how many factors you need for it to qualify for an "SNK boss", and yes it <i>does</i> need work to keep it from becoming POV, but for that and the reasons stated above (by people who have demonstrably <i>read</i> the article), I say we keep it. --<a href="../../../y/a/r/User%7EYar_Kramer_d20f.html" title="User:Yar Kramer">Yar Kramer</a> 05:09, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Being Einstein's son is enough notability here, as Einstein was a major figure, and people could easily be plausibly curious about his children. There is clear precedent with this in the articles on Darwin's children. He was also a scientist with a tenured position at a major university which puts him in the same category with a ton of our academic articles. There was at least one biography of him written (by his first wife, in 1991, published by the University of Iowa). In short, no real reason to delete, is certainly more notable just from his affiliation with Einstein (had strained relations with him, was with him at his death, was involved in the dispute over what to do with <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein%27s_brain.html" title="Einstein's brain">Einstein's brain</a>) to warrant a small article, even if it is not the most thrilling one we have. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 20:05, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>An anonymous user, User:81.197.39.124, decided to change the entire content of this article into a redirect to an unrelated article, on the theory that the topic discussed here is non-notable and the name is better known as a synonym for the other article (see Talk:Stupid sort).

<p>This is not meant to be an ad...I have had a good experience using their product, and given the lack of information on mobile data security in the Wiki, I thought it would be a good idea to add some. I have taken down the external link to their site and only included relevant links to government sites concerning legislation.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Keep the link to their web site. (I just had to find it). The key to making this page better is to have a neutral point of view, and to have external evidance of notability per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)</a>. I think it might be OK for notability, but we need the sources beyond the company's own web site. I think the ownership and board of governance structure is interesting - I have to believe that somebody is writing about these guys. Find sources. Any of us can help make it more neutral.<a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 21:48, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Atrian: No offense, but you're a database administrator. There's many things you haven't heard of, even related to databases. For example, can you explain to me the inner workings of an R-Tree, and of a Quad-Tree, and what the differences are, in which situation one would use either one of those. Oh, and once you're done that, explain to me how you would go about implementing those two structures if you were writing your own RDBMS?

being heavily promoted and used by Ontario 
municipalities.   It is set to become the standard 
for Canadian GIS engines.

Traditionally, Canadian companies have had a much

<p>Look, I'll try to make this simple. It has nothing at all to do with Canada. If OpenGCL is not vaporware, it's a vertical market product with extremely narrow penetration. Such a thing is not something anyone's likely to look up on Wikipedia, or indeed anywhere except the manufacturer's website. Arguing that it's potentially worth billions of dollars -- well, I could say the same thing about Linux I guess. Wouldn't make it a terribly useful thing to say. Honestly, Mr. Mystery IP, if you hang around Articles for Deletion for any great length of time you're sure to find a couple of people who are trying to make exactly the same sort of case you're trying to make to keep an article, with almost exactly the same methods and arguments. People doing that seem to labor under the assumption that somehow they'll find the magic combination of arguments that will get them accepted into Wikipedia (as if Wikipedia recognition is some kind of elite fraternity), and keep going at it, and going at it, and going at it without realizing that they aren't in the best position to make the case in the first place. Fact is, it's easy to make such assertions about the value and use of a product, but when there's no independently verifiable facts about a product, and only the slimmest of verifiable information about the company that makes it, such an assertion is worth approximately nothing in an encyclopedic context. IMHO it's not only a battle you have no hope of winning, it's a battle you had no business fighting in the first place. (I mean, I don't get any mention at all of your product even on Usenet, which means one of two things: either you don't have a very large community of customers, or you have them all NDAed to death, a rather strange thing for a product which claims to be "open". Either way, not enough people know what it is that it belongs on Wikipedia.) <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 06:53, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this page is trying to add a company's history/information that has worked heavily in the Northeast region, why would anyone think it's a vanity page? There's other pages that are far more self absorbed (like musician pages?) What is the AFD notice?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The page reads like a vanity bio of Joseph Dombroski. It includes information irrelevant to the company, like Dombroski's paper routes and college major. Furthermore, the second-to-last line is a publicity slogan for the company. None of this belongs in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 20:04, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is the same company description that is published in literature about the company worldwide. The point that is being missed is the information at the beginning is to describe how this company was started 30 years ago by a thirteen year old boy. Also, I don't even think Joseph Dombroski knows about this particular posting. Also, there is no sign of the company's slogan (which there is none in existance anyway) in the writing. So is every other company and artist on this website supposed to delete their trademarks and factual information? I thought that was Wikipedia was about. Educate yourself and read some other articles of other companies and musicians.</p>
<dl>
<dd>One of these people that want to delete should update it to fill the requirements, this company is very well known out in Delaware.</dd>

<dd>Fine, let me spell it out for you. The fact some 13 year old kid had a paper route is not encyclopaedia material. Neither is the reputation he built up in his neighbourhood repairing TVs. Nor the fact he had an "interest in sound", or that he later went to college... in fact, there is no encyclopaedia-worthy material in the first three paragraphs of the article. The next two paragraphs are an advertisement. They too will have to go, as Wikipedia is not an advertisement website. The last line "For more info..." should be in an "External links" section, but aside from this I have no problem with it in and of itself. However, given that we just deleted everything else on the page, that line is now the only thing on the page. Wikipedia is not a link repository. Thus, it'll have to go. Now, if you want to know how to write a <i>real</i> company page on Wikipedia, I suggest you drop the company publicity listing you're reading and check company pages on Wikipedia. Take whichever company you'd like to learn more about - the bigger the company, the better, as it means more people will have gone over the page and fixed it. Once you've read, say, a dozen or so pages, and you know complete, factual, NPOV corporate pages are written in Wikipedia, feel free to rewrite this thing. <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 20:49, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The phrase "interracial fetish" is new to me in terms of the an explanation. "Prefers dating members of X race" or "Likes to watch pornography where a member of X race has sex with a member of Y race" are common expressions. Fetish implies a peculiar motif that isn't present here such a with latex or bondage practices. Nonetheless, there exists the above-mentioned proclivity and the reason it's hard to find any mentions "in general use" is because few wish to talk about it such as(<a href="http://www.vdare.com/sailer/interracial_marriage.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.vdare.com/sailer/interracial_marriage.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 20:37, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Plea</b> if you read this article I think you will be hard pressed to find a single worthy thing in it. Once again, it is not about interracial anything, it is about ethnic prefferences in pornography, not about pornography with different races participating in it. The title suggests some worthy topic, but the content is a list of ethnicities with unverified statements as to who likes them best. I tend to be a little demanding of inclusioners, so I apologize- I just want to know, what info in the text of this article is verifiable and important? <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 20:44, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is a list of ethnicities with an unverifiable popularity rating next to each. From the article: <i>* Native American Girls (Younger Native American Females) - very popular amongst caucasian American men</i> <i>African Americans are the most popular interracial fetish, apparently, and while these topics could be expanded into something completely different and verifiable, it's important to recognize that they already have been, in interracial pornography and ethnic stereotypes in pornography.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. There were a number of votes from new users, but they had some valid points which I have decided to consider. The argument for keeping is that the game is pretty old, yet the argument for deletion is that the game has never received a great deal of popularity and therefore fails the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidelines. On vote count from established users there is an overwhelming majority for deletion.

<p><b>Keep</b> This is an article about a game that was played on AOL since 1996, hosted by a company that went out of business and was turned over to those that wrote the game and continue to work on it and put long hours and hard work into. There are hundreds of people who have played this game and have put thousands of hours into it and deserve to have their accomplishments recorded. Does the pages about movies only remain because they had millions of dollars budget behind them or because people enjoyed them enough to want to immortalize the information online for those that are fans of it to read about? This topic has valuable information, some of which I didn't even know about until one of the original creators of the game came here and edited my partially incorrect information. I learned something from this topic and others will to unless you get it deleted.</p>
<p>As for it being a non-notable RPG. What is your classifcation of non-notable? Does it have to be a published RPG that makes money to qualify? Something free can't? Does it have to have hundreds of thousands of people playing it? There are message boards still hosted by AOL that have thousands of posts from this game when it was hosted on AOL. The problem was we wanted to expand the game and allow those who didn't have AOL any longer to continue to play. So we took it off of AOL and moved it to AIM rooms.</p>
<p>For proof here is the message boards where thousands of posts still remain from when it was on AOL. And before you say there's only a few...make sure you change your settings to the past 999 days, and even then you can't get all the way back to the 1998 posts. You can only get as far back as 2003 because of the way AOL changed their message boards. <a href="http://messageboards.aol.com/aol/en_us/boards.php?boardId=122669&amp;func=2&amp;channel=Games&amp;refresh=true" class="external text" title="http://messageboards.aol.com/aol/en_us/boards.php?boardId=122669&amp;func=2&amp;channel=Games&amp;refresh=true" rel="nofollow">Black Bayou AOL Message Boards.</a> HoldynWolf 22:26, 12 January 2006 (EST)</p>

And with this AfD I haven't had time to go and look for other topics that I might know something about that's not beed added.

<p><b>Keep</b> This article is a valuable article to the hundreds of people who have played this game over the years. It is a fact that this game existed and there are many people who might benefit or enjoy knowing that the game still exists. Who has the right to go around and delete a post because they were never personally involved with the game? This game is FAR from non-notable.

<li><b>Maybe Obscure to you</b> I cannot give you an exact number of people who played this game. But I just checked the old AOL Message boards, which have been there since 1996 but with AOL's changes can only go back 999 days in the archive. One folder had over 5000 In-Character Posts. Stories written by people. Hundreds maybe thousands. At any given time there would be several hundred active CS's. Which means that they had updated in the last 60 days of their last approved CS. And hundreds more that were not active from time to time. Have you witnessed the game to decide if it's obscure? I know quite a few posts on the internet regarding Black Bayou. There's several reviews of it on Gaming Sites. This page may not be of interest to you or the others asking for it to be deleted, but to all those that games here, and there was many that have. I say hundreds, but I played the game starting in 1997 - 1998 and have taken breaks from time. What is to obscure? I saw a post about some dead guy on Wikipedia who I never knew existed, it had about two paragraphs. I would think that's obscure. Look at the edits on this page already and all the factual information put up about a game that was a very important piece of AOL in it's early years.HoldynWolf 12:45, 13 January 2006 (EST)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> This experience has been a part of AOL and the internet for as long as I can remember. It has outlasted the tabletop Vampire: The Masquerade. Yet another version of Dungeons and Dragons has come and gone during its time. It has spawned countless "mini" spin offs along the way, including one that matured, found a home on AOL and is still there. The futuristic breeds that didnt fit Bayou became a game all on its own called Crossroads. If nothing else, Bayou is notable for the length of it's survival in a world of games that thrive on the newest graphics engines. An all text game running for 10 years... and nobody making a profit off of it as motivation to keep it going. Find another game that can claim that. ~Dark Requiem~</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- 10 years of history consistently rated as the No. 1 game on AOL should NOT be deleted. If ever there was an open-source Role Playing Game, this is it. No one profits. No one makes money off of it. There's not even advertising revenue coming in off of its Web site. Just because people are out to delete all mentions of role playing games on Wikipedia is NOT an excuse to delete this entry. ~ReporterSteven~

AIM is offered now for a wider variety of gamers and writers, some who chose not to pay the price for AOL just to enjoy a nightly game. True there are still AOL based boards and the posts go back to as early as 1997 on those boards. Black Bayou is not a fly by night game, it is not a MMORPH, it is a gaming community even if it is small. The game is over ten years old, it started in 1996 as a premium game before AOL changed from an hourly rate. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Samantha Wolfe (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samantha_Wolfe_0cc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samantha Wolfe">contribs</a>) 02:24, 13 January 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>This is not just about the current community but also about the past community since 1996 that has been involved with Black Bayou and Antagonist Games. BlackBayou.net is a split of of blackbayou.com(different versions of the game are being played at both, and I don't believe there is anyone playing both versions at the current time so those numbers don't overlap the two games). Both those games use the Black Bayou Rules. BlackBayou.net split off in August of 2005. They have around that number since just August. BlackBayou.com has been around just a bit longer (They were originally those AOL Boards I mentioned that have 5000 posts since just 2003) but I know for a fact purged some names on blackbayou.com that were inactive or no longer had valid emails. As for the current totals being played by just these two games should not be the basis for deletion. There have been hundreds more that have played. This is about the history of Black Bayou, about what Black Bayou started as, became and now is. I had hoped to add more to this wikipedia but now I have had to spend much of my time in this discussion. Oh and Explorecrossroads.com (Crossroads RPG) is based off of the Black Bayou Rules. That's three forums that I know off the top of my head that uses these rules and there has been others in the past.HoldynWolf</dd>

<p>Apparently new comers are not appreciated here, nor is new information. The page was not even given enough time to turn into anything. I have not had time this week to devote to trying to work on Black Bayou wikipedia entry as I have had to use what little time this week to defend this. I had heard nothing but good about wikipedia and that's why I came here to post about Black Bayou. A game that was part of Antagonist Games and their parent company Hecklers. Both Hecklers and Antagonist went out of business when AOL changed the way they would do their keywords and channels. Black Bayou continued on. This game was played by so many, long before the 'internet' was as popular as it is now. Back before .asp and java and all the other amazing mark up languages that rule the internet now. Back when you could create a simple page using just html tags. There is so little from back in 1996 about Black Bayou because it was all on AOL, in their keywords using their special coding. It was not internet based then, so there are no internet pages from then. Everything is from NOW since we just moved off of AOL. Hecklers and Antagonist only had their website for months before they went out of bussiness. They could not survive outside of AOL. I can't give you the proof you want because this was all on an old America Online that has changed. You are all trying to take away the chance for it to finally be brought off of AOL and documented on the internet. I am disgusted with wikipedia and their 'community' of members that for the most part I have seen through their 'users contributions' links only go in and say 'delete not notable enough' ... 'delete not important enough' ... 'delete we can't get enough google hits' ... 'delete RPG's aren't important.' Well you know what, fine. delete this and everything else. You can then have your wikipedia of pages about how you got everything deleted. I will make sure to document something some place else in the future.</p>
<p>It's a shame that something as old as this is not considered notable or important enough. It's a shame that American Online which along with several other large online services at the time it being forgotten. Black Bayou was a part of AOL through Antagonist Games and Hecklers Online. They helped fuel American Online, giving content people wanted to pay for. American Online didn't use webpages then, they used their own system. And now because of that, this page is at risk for deletion because I have no internet prrof.HoldynWolf</p>

<li>Hecklers went bust with the dot-com fallout and, thus, so went Black Bayou to the wayside. Thanks to the Library of Congress and the Way Back Machine, some of the Web content as far back as 1997 was saved here for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://Hecklers.com" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://Hecklers.com" rel="nofollow">Hecklers</a> and as far back as 1998 here for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://antagonist.com" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://antagonist.com" rel="nofollow">Antagonist</a>. Per the Web content information, this page needs only meet one of the criteria not to be deleted. "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." This game was created by an outfit so well-known that Playboy teamed up with them. Sure, the outfit may be bankrupt now, but does Wikipedia not talk about online outfits that went bankrupt? Wikipedia further states in <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Importance</a> that "An article is "important" enough to be included in Wikipedia if any one of the following is true: There is evidence that a reasonable number of people are, <b>were or might be concurrently</b> interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known <b>in a community</b> ((that means everyone everywhere doesn't need to know what it is and we established that it has a history amid a corporation that has been written about in business journals ). Further, If an article is "important" according to the above then there's no reason to delete it on the basis of it being:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
  1. of insufficient importance, fame or relevance, or
  2. currently small or a stub, or
  3. obscure. 
</pre>
<p>(Detailed obscure topics hurt no-one because it's hard to find them by accident, and Wikipedia isn't paper.)" So you may find it doesn't have the relative fame of current "millions" and that it's "obscure" but that doesn't matter to importance.

Much later if you mean tabletop gaming. I started playing in the chats of AOL. First in free-form gaming rooms, then in Moderated chats with pages and pages of rules. (It was great!) One was a futuristic game called Crossroads and the other was a WoD themed game called Black Bayou. If I had AOL still I would still be playing BB. After graduation, I went to Community College and finally found some like-minded gamers.... Now its 2005, and still haven't played a game of Vampire ...."

This is a copy of the text from the screen from some guy who hates AOL, from an established Web site, yet it states "Today's selection of actual messages from AOL's Exit and Welcome screens....</p>
<p>Not just another pretty screen name--Meet your neighbors@AOL ON The Move!</p>
<p>Meet your AstroMate...</p>
<p>Edgy roleplay. Mouth to Mouth. Vampires of the Black Bayou..." Right up there with a basic astrology in terms of importance. That's dang good exposure. I saw one of those links way back in the day. I clicked on it. So did many, many others. ~~ReporterSteven~~</p>
<p>Here are more from ant.com.

<p><b>KEEP if</b> the scope is expanded to RPG games of AOL where the myriad other games can be talked about as well. I think this has a place on wikipedia, just not as it's own artical.

<li>I think that's a fair statement. Thank you for offering a POSITIVE statement offering a SOLUTION that helps us rather than dismissing this like some others who insist on arguing. I think this entry could easily be a called RPG Games on AOL or something akin to that with words such as Black Bayou redirected to this site. ~~ReporterSteven~~</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> This article is nonencyclopedic in its content and its title. It discusses the French as some kind of ethnic group, applying modern borders and criteria to eras where the boundaries of what was "French" and wasn't were totally different (for instance, in the Middle Ages).</p>
<p>In addition, the article confuses the idea of ethnicity with the idea of spoken language. Quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In Europe, there are several sizeable permanent French populations outside of France. The largest is in Belgium, in the region of Wallonia and the city of Brussels. In Switzerland, the main concentration of the ethnic French population is in the Western region known as Romandy. Smaller French communities can be found in Luxembourg and the Channel Islands, although most Channel Islanders speak English as their first language today.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I suspect that if we tell the French-speaking Swiss, Canadians and Belgians that they are "French", they will be as thrilled as US citizens told that they are English.</p>
<p>The whole essay looks like some kind of big case of <b>original research</b> used to make a bizarre point, with little regard for usual scientific standards. The factual information that it recounts is found elsewhere on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 21:50, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Keep</b>. I disagree with this page being up for deletion because then you would have to get rid of every page on every ethnic group in Wikipedia. The article discusses the indigenous French ethnic group who have origins to France since the time of the Gauls and even before that. It also discusses the diaspora of ethnic French around the world.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most French-Canadians are actually quite proud of their French origins and culture, to the point that many want the province of Quebec to separate from the rest of the country. Swiss people are rarely defined as a distinct ethnic group since they are a cross roads of the French, German and Italian cultures and many of the French speakers there are indeed ethnic French. As for Belgium, there are also numbers of ethnic French there as well but they are sometimes confused with ethnic Walloons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, you should know that in the 2000 US Census, some 25 million Americans cited English ancestry so clearly people there don't deny their origins, no matter which ethnicity they are, while also being proud of their own independent nation. <a href="../../../e/p/f/User%7EEpf_e280.html" title="User:Epf">Epf</a> 22:13, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>French people in North America is a self-described designation.

Academic usage of French people is quite common, especially from a historical perspective and can be found in many journal articles <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/expand?pub=infobike://rodopi/fls/2002/00000029/00000001/art00003&amp;unc=" class="external text" title="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/expand?pub=infobike://rodopi/fls/2002/00000029/00000001/art00003&amp;unc=" rel="nofollow">Language and Nation in 16th-Century France: The Arts poétiques</a> I think we need to relate this article of a French people to all the other articles describing various peoples.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I disagree with deleting this page. Considering the arguments given, one would find political reasons to delete every people in Europe from Wikipedia. For example, do the 18 million spanish in Argentina consider themselves Spanish? Would they feel offended by the Spanish people page? And the millions of Mexicans of Spanish origin? I suspect this page being put up for deletion is, as I have stated on the discussion page, the result of a taboo existing in France on the issue of ethnicity and on the French model of integration (their wholesale rejection of communitarism). I understand and partially agree with this stance, but this must not deny the inclusion of the French people in the "ethnic groups" section.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 23:11, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Do you really think Catalans consider themselves "ethnic Spanish"? Or maybe you are going to tell us that Catalan are distinct, so the article is in fact about "Castillian people"? But then what about the people in <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murcia_%28autonomous_community%29.html" title="Murcia (autonomous community)">Murcia</a>? Are they ethnic Castilians? And in Andalucia?

<dd>We have a policy of <b>no original research</b> which prohibits using Wikipedia for introducing nonstandard terminology. So far, nobody has been able to produce any kind of quotation of any reasonable publication showing the usage of "French people" to designate the French-speaking Swiss or Canadians. I thus conclude it's some kind of original terminology from whoeever wrote this article.</dd>
<dd>Given that the Belgians and the Swiss generally hate being lumped together with the French, and that the people in Quebec talk of the French as <i>les maudits français</i>, one can see how ridiculous this grouping is.</dd>
<dd>If what was meant was "people of French origin" or even "people of French language", things would possibly be better. Alas, the medieval part is also wrong in that respect! In the Middle Ages, the modern idea of a French nation did not exist. A third or so of current France was held... by the King of England (but it wasn't too bad because the ruling class in England were Norman nobles, which spoke Norman French). The "français" were those from the feudal domain of the King, around Paris. Most people elsewhere did not speak the same language or recognize themselves as from the same "country".</dd>
<dd>This article simply does not make sense from a historical or sociological point of view. If you want to make an article about Francophone countries, do so (but we already have <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francophonie.html" title="Francophonie">Francophonie</a>). If you want to make an article about the current sociological situation in France, do so.

<li>I strongy doubt that all Belgian and Swiss French deny their roots and to say otherwise is obviously typical of pro multi-racial poltical ideology. I'm from Canada and have lived in Quebec and I can tell you first hand that although some may call them "the cursed French", they still don't deny their ethnic roots and if they did, the strong separatist movement would have been extinct by now. Also, how can we forget one of the speeches of former French president Charles de Gaulle when he visited Quebec at Expo 67' and considerably aided in the FLQ and overall separatists movement by declaring "Vive le Quebec libre" !</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also, and more importantly, any reader of this discussion should ignore the ethnic and cultural nihilist-like views by <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">User:Hardouin</a> who clearly has a pro-multi-racial poltical agenda and completely disregards the existence of ethnic French despite their obvious roots there since Gallic times. Also, David, you say there was no medieval French nation ? I don't think Jeanne d'Arc would have succeeded in defeating the English and unifying France if that was the case ! The regions controlled by the Angevin kings of England consistently changed over the 300-400 years they had claims in French lands. The countless numbers of wars fought in the period with England clearly gives reason enough for an ethnic French nation which wished to ne ruled by outsiders. In terms of language, many regions did speak a very similar dialect to the Parisian French langauge or at least a "langue d'oil" or related "langue d'oc" (Aquitaine, Toulouse and Provence). <b>I strongly advise the Wikipedia admin to NOT delete this article</b> as you would be just giving into the point of view and political aims of various users. Articles on the ethnic French are present in many respected encyclopedias (see below) and so are articles on all other ethnic groups. <a href="../../../e/p/f/User%7EEpf_e280.html" title="User:Epf">Epf</a> 11:17, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ah ah ah! Good example! The <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Years_War_ada8.html" title="Hundred Years War">Hundred Years War</a> was the beginning of some feelings of nationalism in both France and England. Because of this war, as I understand, the English (Norman) nobility stopped talking French, and some of the people in France felt a urge to throw out the English.</dd>
<dd>But, see, the Hundred Years War was at the end of the Middle Ages (the war stopped in 1453, and the end of the Middle Ages is generally set by convention to 1492 or a bit earlier). This means that for most of the Middle Ages, the notion of different nations separating France and England was not current. Different feudal domains, sure.. But nations?</dd>
<dd>As for ethnicity, France until the 19th century was a patchwork of provinces with different customs, languages, etc. It's very dubious to apply 19th- and 20th-century criteria of nation-state to these era (there has been significant homogeneization of the country in the 19th and 20th century due to government efforts and increased travel and communications). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 14:05, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Norman English kings and French fought various conflicts over land even before the long period of the hundreds years war. Although the English controlled certain parts of France, that does not mean the people there weren't ethnic or indigenous French peoples. When most of Russia was under the control of Mongols, were the indigenous slavic peoples no longer Russian ? I mean is it to say ethnic Italians have only existed since the unification of Italy in 1861 ? Italians are in a fact a great comparison considering although they have several local dialects and differences they have always been for along time seen as ethnic Italians since the different peoples of the peninsula were also closely related. The same can be said about the ethnic French peoples who although may have local differences in language/dialects and culture, they are still much more closely related to each other in terms of history, origins, culture, and language than peoples in other nearby nations.

<dd><i>I strongy doubt that all Belgian and Swiss French deny their roots</i>. I don't know for Belgian, but roots of Swiss are in Switzerland. France is just an influencial (through the common language) foreign country. If a Swiss says that he is French, it means that he has a French nationality. For instance, I know quite a lot o French that live in Switzerland. I don't understand what you mean by <i>roots</i>. It can make sense for Québec, where people went.

<dd>The history of Switzerland shows the historic divide between ethnic French and ethnic Swiss Germans. When the Burgundians invaded and settled in the west of Switzerland and in France(Burgundy), as with the Franks, they assimilated into the population and adopted Gallo-Roman culture. This is contrary to the majority Allemanni who remained distinctly Germanic. This part of Swiss history is documented here: <a href="http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/switzerlands-population-languages.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/switzerlands-population-languages.html" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> <a href="../../../e/p/f/User%7EEpf_e280.html" title="User:Epf">Epf</a> 09:26, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wrong, the historic divide is between two disapeared tribes: Burgundians and Alamannen. Now, there is a <i><b>language</b> border between French and German</i>. The article says nothing about ethnic French because this concept does not exist. Better, the article says, <i>When the French kings persecuted the French protestants ... a great number of them fled to French-speaking Switzerland.</i> As you can read, the people living in the French-speaking part of Swizterland welcomed persecuted French protestants (ie foreigners = French). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_Mongenet_1ce6.html" title="User:Marc Mongenet">Marc Mongenet</a> 20:36, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep the article</b>. It's ridiculous to delete this article. This same information is found in Encyclopedia Britannica, Americana etc. Why is wikipedia suddenly no longer going to identify indigenous peoples of various regions? This article is about the French of France so the spillover issue is another matter that can be addressed by articles on the Walloons and so on. These articles aren't meant to please people, but to inform. I frankly don't see anything wrong with the article. It just plainly states who the French are. Comparisons with the US and Australia don't wash as these regions also have indigenous people, the Native Americans and Aborigines. We aren't going to have articles about them either then? Just because some people don't like the idea of there being an identification of a French people who pre-date the current multicultural changes taking place doesn't mean we ignore that there are French people. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 06:08, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Britannica is explaining regional diversity which exists even with the English, Germans etc. Encyclopedia Americana, has a people section and relates the origins of the French people as well.

<li><b>Keep the article</b>. The above item from encyclopedia Britannica about the French is still under the group of "ethnic groups". The statement itself is speaking of the indigenous people of France and if they are "strongly conscious of a single nation", it is fair to say there are a people or group of related peoples who are responsible for creating French culture, language and identity and which form the original inhabitants of the nation we call France. <a href="../../../e/p/f/User%7EEpf_e280.html" title="User:Epf">Epf</a> 12:32, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> I agree to a degree with this approach however the segment from encyclopedia Britannica is only one example from one encyclopedia. We need more information and more valid sources when discussing ethnic French. The sentence "they hardly constitute a unified ethnic group by any scientific gauge" doesn not however claim there aren't indigenous ethnic French peoples of France which are responsible for the language, culture and identity. The reason why this debate has been so difficult with ethnic French is mainly because the government of France has a ban on collecting data on ethnic groups and religion and has sought an assimilation policy which clearly has failed (hence the recent riots). This article must be kept to decipher between those French citizens which are immigrants or descended from immigrants and the indigenous peoples which have inhabited the area since the time of the creation of the French nation by Charlegmagne (and even before). 69.157.109.6 13:09, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jimbo Wales' quote, put here by user Epf, actually leads to delete the article, because if we are to follow what most people believe, then most French people do not believe in a "French ethnicity". In all my life, I have met thousands of French people, and I can't think of anyone who would describe themselves as ethnic French (compare this with the Kurds or the Koreans who certainly describe themselves in ethnic terms). French people certainly feel a strong sense of belonging to the French nation, but this nation is not based on ethnic criteria.

<dd>Well that is your opinion from your own personal experiences and I have to say the French people I have talked to have always spoken about belonging to a larger French nation that has origins in France dating back many centuries. Whether they say "ethnic French" (<i>Francais de souche</i>) or not, they're clearly speaking of a people with ancestors in France going back to the very beginnings of the nation around the time of the death of Charlemagne (814 ad.), widely considered the father of the French nation. <a href="../../../e/p/f/User%7EEpf_e280.html" title="User:Epf">Epf</a> 14:33, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If we delete the French, then are the Native Americans, Berbers, and Japanese people next? The article is merely pointing out the traits of a French people who are diverse yes. I think a more fair compromise would be to re-write the article so as to point out differing views on the French rather than deleting the article altogether. There is no actual original research here as much of the information is simply being reiterated almost verbatim from other sources, including encyclopedias. The majority of references define the French from their Celtic, Roman, and Germanic backgrounds. Why is this wrong to state or even inaccurate or <i>original research</i> if other articles, books about France (Insight Guides: France defines French people this way), already explain what French people means and entails within the context of an indigenous population. Surely there is room for compromise rather than wholesale deletion. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 17:38, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the basic problem is in the whole "ethnic group" series in the english wikipedia, a series which does not exist in other languages such as the french. The problem is that no clear definition of "people" has been given from which to work on. The French argue that they cannot be defined by racial origin because this goes against the ideology of the French state. At the same time, the French do exist on many levels: they exist on a "de souche" level, on a cultural level and on a citizenship level. It would be difficult to ignore any of the 3 in classifying the French people. But we shouldnt jumble up the definitions in writing this page. I propose to divide the French people page in sections. Starting from the most restrictive definition of what it is to be French going to the the largest.</p>
<p>One starts with the French as an ethnic group...talk about their origins etc... (Franks,celts, Romans whatever...)</p>
<p>Then the French as a cultural and linguistic community which would include Belgians, Swiss, Quebecois etc...</p>
<p>The another section should give the "republican" definition of what it means to be French. (here we include Zidane and Sarkozy)</p>
<p>The issue of the Spanish people is more complicated, as there are racial, linguistic, cultural and political divides within the state aswell as the problem of the Spanish in Latin America and the deep connection with this region. The defintion of what it means to be Spanish must also be multiple: Spanish as members of the state; as members of the dominant castillian culture, or simply as Spanish citizens in an increasingly multiethnic spanish society; ,as part of the cultural, ethnical or linguistic community shared by Spain and Latin America...</p>

<dd>My personal point for putting this page for deletion has nothing to do with the ideology of the French state, but with the anachronisms that litter this article. Actually, the ideology of the French state in the 19th century was that the ancestors of the French were the Gauls and the French are directly descended from them, and this article somehow seems to be written solely from this point of view, which is now generally considered ridiculous. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 07:07, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did you read the messages above? As I have already explained, there are peoples who define themselves in ethnic terms, such as Germans, Kurds, Koreans, Japanese, etc., and it makes sense to have ethnic articles about these peoples, but there are other peoples, such as French, Spaniards, Swiss, etc., who do not define themselves in ethnic terms, but whose nations were formed around statehood, and so for these peoples it makes no sense to have ethnic articles. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 22:51, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a>, have YOU read any of the messages in this discussion other than your own ? Who are you to decide who is defined in ethnic terms or not ? OBVIOUSLY the Swiss aren't defined in ethnic terms because their country is at a crossroads of three different cultures and ethnic groups (German, French and Italian). It does make very good sense to have an article on ethnic French because as I've stated before, who do you think formed to create the indigenous people of France and created the culture, language and French identity ? The indigenous ethnic French people , even though the designation of these people hasn't been as readily discussed as other groups to which you have pointd out, doesn't mean that their ethnicity/nation doesn't exist. The fact you compare this with Spaniards is ridiculous. Ethnic Spanish obviously comprise of the closely-related indigenous ethnic groups of Spain although it does need to be divided into the major peoples which came from there in the Galicians, Catalans and Castilians. The fact still remains, they are the indigenous ethnic people of Spain who have diaspora around the globe and, just as with the ethnic French (the indigenous peoples who created the langues d'oil and langues d'oc), need to be differentiated from those who are immigrants and of immigrant descent. One of the main reasons why this has been so difficult is the ban by the French government on collecting data of ethnic and religous groups. <a href="../../../e/p/f/User%7EEpf_e280.html" title="User:Epf">Epf</a> 15:57, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Change the definition</b> One of the problems with this article is its title: "French people" or "Frenchmen" typically refers to "French citizens", whatever their ethnic background may be. The article attempts to redefine what "French people" means by defining them as an "ethnic group", which is debatable. The CIA World factbook <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/fr.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/fr.html" rel="nofollow">[64]</a> defines "Frenchmen" as "French citizens" and does not mention a "French" ethnic group. It gives the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nationality: noun: Frenchman(men), Frenchwoman(women); adjective: French</li>
<li>Ethnic groups: Celtic and Latin with Teutonic, Slavic, North African, Indochinese, Basque minorities</li>

From this we can deduce that the French ethnic group has been traditionally of this origin, even though the notion of "French people" has evolved into that of citizenship.... as it has in the rest of western Europe.

It is true the langue d'oc speakers of southern France differ culturally but are they not more related to you than peoples in other countries who are not ethnic French ?. The cultural differences between the langue d'oil ("northern France") and langue d'oc peoples ("southern France") is comparable to that between a German from Saxony and a German from Bavaria, but do they not still constitute to be ethnic Germans ? 69.157.109.6 07:00, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have one very simple question for people who would like to keep the article:if the "French ethnicity" exists, can you offer a definition of that ethnicity? In particular, could you tell us if you consider a Mr. Neumann from Strasbourg (whose grandparents spoke Alsatian) to be part of that French ethnicity? What about a Ms. Vandervelt from Dunkirk (whose grandparents spoke Western Flemish)? Is she "ethnic French"? What about Mr. Kernoroc'h from Brest (whose grandparents spoke Breton)? And Ms. Etxeberry from Biarritz (whose grandparents spoke Basque)? Mr. Delpech from Toulouse (whose grandparents spoke Occitan)? For the records, Delpech is an Occitan family name whose French equivalent is "Dumont". What about Ms. Spuig from Perpignan (whose grandparents spoke Catalan)? Last but least, what about Mr. Jacob from Lyon, whose French Jewish grandparents converted to Catholicism in 1900? Are these people "ethnic French"? or does your "French ethnicity" only applies to people like Ms. Lambry from Tours, Mr. Villeneuve from Beauvais, and the likes? <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 12:17, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hardouin: Firstly, we must agree that all nations and nationalities are, to a degree, imagined and the product of a state legitimizing it's power. States always rewrite history in order to offer a continuity between the present day nation state and the past. You will find this problem in every nation state not just France. In Turkey, many people who consider themselves Turks are actually of Greek, Kurdish or Armenian extraction... but, so what? Should we erase the Turkish people page? The definition of the French people has been as broad as possible: "A PREDOMINANTLY GERMANIC, LATIN AND CELTIC PEOPLE WHO TODAY SHARE THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AND CULTURE." This definition applies to the Bretons, Occitans, Catalans and Alsatians. +Many of these regions are only different because of their proximity to Germany (Alsatians) and Spain (Perpignan and Biarritz). Nationalism and local cultures (except perhaps in Corsica) has also been wiped out by the French Republic to a point that you can hardly speak of an Occitan people or Alsatian people. The word "predominantly" is used so that exceptions like Mr Jacob (Globalization is not particular to France nor to the 21st century) can be allowed. Recent immigration is not included yet, because these groups retain their foreign ethnicity and culture and have not yet been fully assimilated into French culture and society. But I agree that these definitions are temporary and that in 100 years ethnicity will perhaps be meaningless in all western countries, unless mass immigration is countered by an ability of immigrant groups to retain their culture and to create transnational communities with the aid of new technologies. Perhaps, at this point it will be the nation state that will disapear.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 14:08, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh yeah? Then what about the millions of French people of Italian descent, Spanish descent, Polish descent, Armenian descent, Portuguese descent? Do your ethnicist theories treat them as "ethnically French"? Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, Minister of Interior, of Hungarian descent, is he "ethnically French"? What about Mr. Michel Poniatowski, former minister, of Polish descent, is he "ethnically French"? What about French singer Yves Montand, of Italian descent? What about Charles Aznavour, of Armenian descent? Not to mention Mr. Jean-Claude Martinez, one of the leaders of the Front National, who is of Spanish descent. Is Mr. Martinez ethnically French? Jean-Marie Le Pen (of Breton ancestry, by the way) is anxiously waiting for your answer. 81.64.86.210 14:23, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But <i>where</i> does this definition come from ? <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchutz_72ef.html" title="User:Schutz">Schutz</a> 16:00, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, I think you all need to understand that the Bretons, Occitans (langue d'oc peoples), the original ethnic French (langue d'oil peoples), the Basques and the Catalans of France are all indigenous peoples of France. The Catalans consider themselves as a separate nation, as do the Basques and Bretons, so they are irrelevant to this debate on ethnic French. The langue d'oil peoples are indeed the original ethnic French in a sense since it is their culture and language which dominated and formed the basis for the French nation. The langue d'oc peoples have a distinct language and culture in the south of France but the similarities with the langue d'oil peoples are obvious and the two are more closely related to each other than with any other ethnic groups. The person Hardouin mentions from France with a German last name very well could be of full or partial German descent, being so close to the German border. The same goes for the person with a Flemish last name living near the Belgian border. Hardouin and 81.64.86.210 are putting up a futile case with regards to the list of famous French people of foreign descent (some in the list who also have partial ethnic French descent). They seem to forget the numerous famous French people of ethnic French descent. Of course several countries in Europe have famous people from their nations who are immigrants or of immigrant descent, but that does not mean the whole country is comprised in such a multi-ethnic manner or that an indigenous population doesn't exist (whether or not if it forms the majority). It also appears that you ignore the fact that many of those famous people listed in the discussions above acknowledge their non-ethnic French origins and I know for a fact they realize there are obviously ethnic French peoples in France. The reason why this has been so difficult for people in this discussion (and in general) to realize is because the Government of France itself discourages ethnic identification even if the majority of people still maintain it to at least some degree (hence the survival of languages like Breton and Occitan). This assimilationist model by the government is practically unique within Europe and only after several recent problems and violence have officials started to listen to critics of the policy. Clearly new measures need to be taken, such as for one, the government collecting data on ethnicity and religion which is done by again practically every other European country (and most world nations for that matter).</li>

<dd>I see there is absolutely no consensus between you guys. Burgas00 says Bretons and Basques are part of the French ethnicity, IP 69.157.109.6 says only langue d'Oil peoples are the real ethnic French. This should be enough to prove to everybody that there is no such thing as a French ethnicity. What there is is a French nation, but it is based on a shared history built around statehood, it is not based on ethnicity, which nobody seems to be able to agree on. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 16:58, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's no need for a concensus on definition. We can explain all the varying perspectives and still retain the page. Obviously, the Basques were a distinct group that has largely been assimilated. This can be mentioned surely. This isn't a question of a French nation, but a discussion about the French people. These two aspects don't have to be identical. There's no point in trying to prove one thing or another as ethnicity is a tricky thing to define. A compromise here would be to explain all the viewpoints and add as much information as possible. One could even mention that for many French the idea of a 'pure' French people is offensive and relates to <i>Le Pen</i>, while also adding that from the perception of people outside of France there is a view of French people that is perhaps not entirely accurate. If we work by combining some of the ideas mentioned on this page, the French people page could be greatly enhanced and be more representative of the differing viewpoints of what constitutes a group. The alternative is to abandon the idea of there being any groups, cultural or otherwise and strictly go by language or personal orientation. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 18:53, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps a re-write as <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> suggested could be a solution. We could denote that the French are a diverse group and are changing as we speak etc. The description could retain the origins of the majority of the French people and explain that during the course of its existence, peoples from Germany, Spain, Eastern Europe, etc. have moved to France and assimilated into the culture and are essentially French today. Next, we could add the situation with Maghribi immigrants some of whose descendents have assimilated quite easily (Zidane, Adjani etc.), while there are also tensions etc. Surely this could be considered a fair compromise, while acknowledging that France has been a conduit and a willing recipient and place of refuge for immigrants for centuries and explain that a majority population more indigenous to France also exists and has absorbed these waves of immigrants. Is this a better compromise? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 18:46, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>How do you claim that their is no ethnic French when I just told you the original ethnic French were the langue d'oil peoples. As their nation and culture became the predominant one in France, it absorbed the very similar culture of the langue d'oc peoples. With the creation of the nation of France, other indigenous peoples such as the Basques, Bretons and Catalans came to be included in the territorial boundaries of the nation. Though the French policy was assimilation, these peoples have clearly retained to some degree their language and culture. This however doesn't come to say that the ethnic langue d'oil and langue d'oc peoples don't exist. Yes, France encompasses other ethnic groups (both indigenous and foreign), just as does Spain, England, Germany and many other European states. Again, this does not mean that the indigenous ethnic group which created the foundations of the nation (culturally and linguistically) does not exist. I also don't think Burgas meant to say Bretons and Baques are part of the ethnic French, but are part of the nation of France. 69.157.109.6 17:18, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok. This debate seems to be divided into: 1) the pro and anti camps who honestly want to find a solution to the problem through compromise and debate. 2) the intransigent antis who either i) have just joined the debate and are repeating past arguments or ii) find the idea of "french people" so offensive that no debate is possible.</p>
<p>In any case I think we should focus on what we agree on rather than on what we don't and Tombseye's solution is, in my opinion, on the right track. Another thing, I think that we should distinguish clearly between the French ethnic group and the French citizen. I can be a French citizen, without being an ethnic French, and I will not feel offended. So ethnic French people should not feel offended for me!!:-)--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 20:22, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

However, those Wikipedians must take into account that under French law, it is forbidden to make any <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistics.html" title="Statistics">statistics</a> according to so-called "<a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic.html" title="Ethnic">ethnic</a>" appartenances, for the simple reason that French law does not recognize this concept, which most French people consider a simple <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">racist</a> concept, with no scientific groundworks at all (official institutes such as <a href="../../../i/n/e/INED_a1f6.html" title="INED">INED</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/s/INSEE_08fd.html" title="INSEE">INSEE</a> never use such a category). <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapaz_13cf.html" title="User:Lapaz">Lapaz</a> 18:26, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Totally agree with you. The French nation is based on Renan's idea of nation, i.e. a people bound by a shared history and the will to live together, whereas the German nation is based on Fichte's idea of nation, i.e. a people defined by language and genetic characterisitcs, whether or not they actually live in the same state. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 19:15, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>French law forbids categorization of French <i>citizens</i> by so-called "ethnic" ascendency, and this at least since <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vichy_France_a8eb.html" title="Vichy France">Vichy France</a>. The expression - often used in this entry - of <i>Français de souche</i> ("ethnic French") is forbidden from use in official statistics and is never used in census. In fact, it is almost only used by members of the far-right <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_National_3f7b.html" title="Front National">Front National</a>.

<li>I think that most of you are just kidding yourselves. All of your arguments seem to be based on the fact that French means a citizen of the nation of France. I don't doubt that, just as English, German, Italian, American and any other nationality means simply a citizen of the country, regardelss of ethnic origin. To say that the idea of gathering statistics for ethnic origins and race is a "US official POV" is ridiculous since America at first did not adopt the principle of ethnic statistics and mult-culturalism, just as France didn't and still doesn't. Also, France is currently one of the only European countries who does not collect such statistics and its assimilationist views can now be considered unique (and obsolete for that matter if you look at recent events). I don't know how reliable the sources used by Lapaz are in describing the percentage of French speakers in 18th century, but even if the majority didn't speak French, they spoke a very similar language/dialect of the langue d'oil family or the less related langue d'oc family. I also doubt most French people consider the gahtering of ethnic statistics as a "racist" concept without any "scientific groundworks" at all considering again, <b>France is unique in being one of the very few countries that does not gather such statistics</b>. The lack of such statistics from the government would make it difficult to gather the numbers of ethnic French in France, yes, but NGO's have gathered similar data and for most of the countries ethnic French have migrated to outside of France (Canada, US, Argentina,etc.) ethnic data on these populations is readily available.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It must be said that just because the French government policy does not wish to speak of ethnic French, it again does not mean they are not there and I guarantee most ethnic French in France do use the distinction of "français de souche" even if "forbidden" by government law. How do I know this ? Well other than speaking with various French people from France over my time, the ethnic French who live here in the Americas (including Quebecois and Cajuns) don't simply regard themselves as "American/Canadian" and also distinguish themselves from French speaking peoples who are not ethnic French (such as French speaking peoples of African ancestry from Haiti, Martinique, France, etc.). You also make it sound like the French government never has used ethnic statistics to describe people. Obviously you have not read much into French colonial history, especially in the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, where the French had countless numbers of names and statistics for people of varying degrees of mixed white, black and Amerindian ancestry (eg. Métis), just as the Spanish did.</dd>
<dd>I have explained already what the distinction of ethnic French (langue d'oil, langue d'oc peoples) entails in my entries above and I know from reading anthropolgical studies, French history and of course experiences with French people this is what the ethnic French are. The nation of France came to include other peoples who were not ethnic French and the government refused to recognize the existence of diverse ethnic groups within the nation. You even said yourself that all the various immigrants and their descendants as well as the Basques, Catalans and Bretons are all considered "French" (i.e. citizens of France) by the government, but does that mean their indivdiual ethnicity doesn't exist ? I don't think so and most people outwith the government of France don't think so either. If this is not the case, then why is it that so many North Africans in France are always referred to as "French, but of Arabic descent" ??? Obviously there is an unacceptable prejudice against people of North African descent in France, but it just goes to show you that the ethnic identities in France are only "non-existing" in the out of date policies of the French government (and in the minds of those French officials who still support it). I guarantee the Bretons, Basques and Catlans and also the non-native ethnic groups in France would hardly consider themselves ethnic French or even "French" for that matter. With this pointed out, obviously there are the peoples who do consider themselves ethnic French (langue d'oil peoples and langue d'oc peoples) since they are the ones who won't deny being called "French" when it calls into question ethnic identity/origin since they are the ones who are respnsible for the creation of the French language, culture and nation. To say otherwise is just ridiculous and most academics in the world and many within France would never deny this fact. Remember, the French language, culture and identity originated from somewhere, and this somewhere is clearly the indigenous peoples of France. If you still disagree and are from France, look at your background and see where your family/ancestors originated from and if the peoples of that country have the same language/culture as which is found in France. What more can be said ?</dd>

<dd>Much less could actually be said. Whichever decisions the French government has made to minimize - or some might say "deny" - racial discrimination has basically nothing to do in this debate. These are, after all, "only" political decisions. Everybody here would most probably agree that people with very diverse ethnic backgrounds are French citizens, and all of them are as such called "French people". And yes, there are ethnic tensions in France, and yes <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affirmative_action.html" title="Affirmative action">affirmative action</a> is currently being debated in France. Now, whether or not there actually is a group of French citizens (or descendants of French citizens) which could be called "ethnic French" seems to be where the actual debate is focusing. So far, we had many OPINIONS supporting the existence of a <b>French ethnic group</b> and we have been given several times the same personal definition of "francais de souche", but in no case did we have any SOLID REFERENCE (the best we had was a link to a Google search of "ethnic French" returning a meager 587 hits). On the other hand, we have at least 2 sources which are advocating against the mere existence of such an ethnic group (Britannica: "they hardly constitute a unified ethnic group by any scientific gauge" and CIA World factbook not even mentioning "French" in the list of ethnic groups in France, but rather "Ethnic groups: Celtic and Latin with Teutonic, Slavic, North African, Indochinese, Basque minorities".). The best conclusion that I can objectively draw at this point is: French people = mostly French speaking people of Celtic and Latin ethnicity. Would you call them an "ethnic group"? Not so sure. At this point, I believe that the article should be rewritten and mention these various POINTS OF VIEW with supporting sources. <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlivier_5e7f.html" title="User:Olivier">olivier</a> 14:05, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some of you guys are asking for sources to proove that the French are an ethnic group. This is just an idea but, dosent the existence of French people, people with a French heritage and origin, outside the borders of France (Quebec, Chile, North Africa, Switzerland) prove that one can be part of the French ethnicity without being a French citizen? These guys dont have French nationality so all the arguments about ius soli are not applicable! So one must only reverse the argument to argue that there are people in France, who have French nationality, are full citizens but are not ethnic French. Its as easy as that! Like Zidane who is a French citizen and is an ethnic Kabyle.</p>
<p>Anyways, the existence of ethnic French outside of France (you can find sources for this...) is enough to prove that there is such thing as a French ethnicity which is unrelated to French citizenship.

<li>Although the CIA world Fact Book only says "Celtic, Latin and Teutonic", if you look at the page for Ireland it also says "Celtic and English". Obviously it is clarifying that the "Celtic/Latin/Teutonic" resembles the indigenous ethnic French just as the Celtic and English (from Anglo-Normans settling in the "Pale" during the middle ages) resemble the ethnic Irish under the ethnic groups heading. Another way to show my point, is how under ethnic groups for France "Celtic, Latin and Teutonic" is separate from "North African, Slavic, Indochinese, Basque minorities". 69.157.109.6 18:07, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Olivier's post above is correct. The focus of the debate is of course on the expression "Français de souche", (badly) translated as "ethnic French" ("souche" refers to "roots"). And the reason of our argument may be (surely) a big difference of conception on what does "ethnics" means, especially refering to something called the "Republic", which doesn't categorize people according to their group or collectivity, but as individual. It may be a good or bad idea, and I would be the last one to deny that discrimination is very real in France, as in Anglophone countries, and that affirmative action is well worthy of thinking about (for the least). However, if a link to <a href="../../../../fr/n/a/t/Nationalit%C3%A9_fran%C3%A7aise.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Nationalité_française">fr:Nationalité française</a> here was made, it was so that those of you who speak French but aren't can read what French Wiki writes on French nationality.

<p>I guess Lapaz wants to be politically correct and that he feels uncomfortable with the term "ethnic French" because some French extremist parties believe that French citizenship should only be granted to ethnic French. I understand and share his concern. But one cannot over react in such a hysterical way to these racists by denying that the French people ever existed. After all, whether they did or they didnt is inconsequential in modern day France. In my opinion you are just playing into the hands of the FN with this intransigence: Their discourse won't be based on sources proving the existence of the French people, but on the menace of those who are attempting to deny its existence and thus "destroying the nation".--81.37.18.88 12:39, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First sentence of the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnicity.html" title="Ethnicity">Ethnicity</a> entry: "An ethnic group is a culture or subculture whose members are readily distinguishable by outsiders based on traits originating from a common racial, national, linguistic, or religious source." There is no way of "readily distinguishing" an "ethnic French" from a "non-ethnic French with French nationality" (sic). "Traits originationg from a common racial": "races" do not exist. "National": France is less than two centuries old, known as it is now. Same goes for nationalism. "Linguistic": you will say "langue d'oïl" &amp; "langue d'oc": those languages are several centuries old. Today, everybody speaks French. On the contrary of (Spanish) Catalunya, in France, "occitan" more or less completely disappeared with the 20th century (a revival movement was created in the 1960-70s, with low impact compared to Spain). And finally, "religious", well, I'm sure you'll understand this one without me...

<li>Your recent entries make one want to laugh Lapaz. Ethnicities can also a share similar origin as is described in the [Ethnic groups] article as well as cultural traits and traditions passed down through the generations. Even without these, your claims of ethnic traits that the indigenous French do not possess have no factual basis with the possible exception of religion. - Race: The idea of races is currently very much in debate even though the majority of the world's people acknowledge the existence of such a thing. Whether or not a "race" exists, biolgical differences (as proven by modern genetics and physical anthropology )between different populations and ethnic groups do, even if the traits are not unique to that population/ethnic group alone. - National: Obviously there was a consensus of an ethnic French nation at one point otherwise the country would have a different name than "France" and the language and culture would not be French. As I have said on the discussion page, the French nation is not 200 years old and most academics would laugh at any such claim. The French <b>republic</b> is over 200 years old now but the majority of historians trace the beginnings of the French <b>nation</b> to the death of Charlemagne in 814 AD. The idea of the nation being a "modern invention" is refuted by the majority of academics and by people as a whole for that matter.- Language: Although practically all citizens of France can speak French, various other French dialects and langues d'oil exist which are rarely spoken by non-indigenous French peoples. As for the langues d'oc, it is currently estimated by the Ethnologue that there are 2 million speakers (600,000 native) and therfore hardly disappeared at any point in this century (although under pressure from the langues d'oil and English). Finally, - Religion: indeed under government policy there is no state religion for the nation of France ever since the dissolution of the monarchy. However, the predominant religion of ethnic French outside of France, for example in Quebec, remains to this day Roman Catholicism (<a href="http://www.statcan.ca" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.statcan.ca" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>) and according to statistics (eg. CIA World Fact Book) this is also the case with the ethnic French (langue d'oil, langue d'oc peoples) in France with a minority of Protestants and Islamic, Buddhist, etc. converts. (There are also large numbers of French Huguenot descendants outside of France which are largely Protestant)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article shows what happens when people tries to write articles about topics they don't know much about.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I see the following weaknesses in this one :
<ul>
<li>Defining <i>French people</i> as an ehtnic group is a mistake. This article could be about people living in France but at this point, it's not. It's written about some imaginary ethnic group of people living in France. But, French people have really different origins : France, but also Italy, Poland, Spain, North Africa, Cameroon, ... . So, there is no unicity of religion, culture, etc.</li>
<li>Then comes the next problem. Let's assume that French people are the people who are supposed to be the original French (before immigration). The big problem with this approach is that you have to come back to the beginning of the XXst century while French weren't a single ethnic group but severals (Brittany, ....). So, even the people originally from France aren't a single ethnic group.</li>
<li>There is no (real) French diaspora as Italian, Polish, Jewish diasporas, simply because France hasn't really been a land of emigration (but immigration) in the XXth century. So, when this article quotes 16,000,000 French people in USA, 4 000 000 in South America, it's kind of stupid because those guys don't have links with France anymore (the major part have been emigrated between the 17th and 19th century).</li>

Also, I fail to see how this ebaum/YTMND war is at all notable. Since it started I've seen a lot of trolls creating attack pages when doing RC patrol, and frankly this is just another one of them. Wikipedia is not a message board, and this "war" should be faught elsewhere. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 01:15, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think it would be useful to have an entry on the expression "yiddishe kop" explaining what it means, and maybe having "Yiddish Cup" redirect to it, so the YTMND crowd that looks it up will learn the expression. Its popularization from the YTMND-ebaums war is trivial, and should not be included (except maybe on the YTMND fads page). But if the purpose of an encyclopedia is to educate, this is an opportunity. 128.12.32.214 01:16, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> - This article was my first shot at creating a Wiki entry. I have added a number of links to articles about NGDI or on topics which refer to the company directly. As I have stated, this is a company which gained its reputation without the use of the internet. Although, they have been in business for 25 years, there was not a website devoted to the organization until 2005. Consequently NGDI has not left a very substantial footprint on the web and searching only returns minor entries several pages into the results. Because of numerous stories devoted to the organization in local and regional newspapers and magazines, I believe Nick Garrett Development, Inc., and the subsequent bio of its CEO Charles Nick Garrett, Jr. meet the criteria of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)</a>.

(It's a Guideline not a Policy) To answer the question, I am not related to the subject, though I do know him. Should that even matter? If I wanted to put up an article on my grandfather's story of being 18 yrs old in Europe at the end of WWII, who most wikipedians would aggree does not meet the Notability requirement, who is to say that it is not a worthwhile entry? After reading Jimmy Wale's personal appeal for donations to Wikipedia, where he suggests the purpose of Wiki is "to freely share clear, factual, unbiased information...", I think we can all make the world a better place if we just step back and please don't bite the newcomers.

<li>Although <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline, not a policy, it has pretty wide acceptance and is regularly used as a criteria on AfD. It is my primary criteria when participating in AfD discussions. One problem with inlcuding non-notable people is that the information is hard to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a>. Also, it can be difficult to write about someone you are related to from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> (hence the <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a> guildeline).

<dd>You don't need to vote in order to redirect something, and in fact deleting and then redirecting makes no sense, because after it's deleted there's nothing to redirect. Just redirect it to begin with and avoid this whole mess. Deleting also erases all talkpage comments = not good, as the fraudulent claims and edits should be saved and accessible for future reference. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 00:48, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This arose out of an interesting situation. There was a disputed redirect on this article (see <a href="../../../a/l/a/Talk%7EAladin_63d3.html#Improper_redirection" title="Talk:Aladin">Talk:Aladin#Improper redirection</a>). I contend that since a redirect is a "normal edit", not a deletion, there's no reason in the world to use Afd if the desired result is a redirect. My "vote" is <b>speedy keep</b> and edit the article normally. If there's talk page consensus for a redirect, that can be achieved without use of Afd. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 22:29, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Aladin was a cabinet adviser: <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=604" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=604" rel="nofollow">[72]</a>, that’s been verified. He is a magician. I also think that he’s more “well known” by people from Indian/Bangladesh from the people I’ve asked. Some (not all) of the original quotes of the original article claims can be verified by e-mailing the authors of the books/ magazines. He’s also had a FamilyTechShow USA Radio interview, which has been verified at the article. However, there are a lot of the previous claims that were made during the last nomination for deletion that have been difficult to verify and this should taken into consideration when voting. Overall, I feel that all information that is now present in the article is verifiable, whether this is enough for an article is up for interpretation. My overall feeling is that aladin is not overly notable but is more notable than a lot of the inclusions in wikipedia. I urge everybody who votes to look at the facts and make up their own minds, whatever that may be. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 23:25, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, but, being a minor cabinet adviser by itself isn't notable. Emailing the authors of books/magazines isn't verifiable, that's original research, and since the books/magazines mentioning him aren't notable to begin with, even if their claims of his existence can be verified, we have no idea if these claims come from mere copying from press releases and no indication that mention there means the person is notable. We would need REAL sources to establish notability, and the only sources so far claimed have been fraudulent (like the Inside Magic claim, which actually said they never heard of the guy and not all the wonderful praise that was there), unreliable and unverifiable. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 00:43, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Delete or Redirect</b>, as Ragib suggested. Take a look at the history to see that there are major concerns of sockpuppetry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aladin&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aladin&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>: Every few weeks, somebody switched to a new alias to promote this person: From Magicsucks to Themeat, then Thegirlinwhite, Selfpublicitysucks (indeed!), the list goes on and on. Truly a non-notable entry that tries to misuse the wikipedia project for self-promotion. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 00:19, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Relisting this article at this time makes a complete mess out of it. You do not need to have a vote to delete in order to redirect something, never have. Now we have people voting for total delete, delete but then make a new one to redirect, keep because they like the article, keep but then redirect... It's impossible to sort it all out, as the keep- redirects and delete-redirects have almost the same function but get counted separately. What could have been handled by a simnple concensus of editors is now all over the place due to this relisting. I think that this vote should be ended with a <b>speedy keep with the proviso that the article then be turned into a redirect</b>. Redirecting the article preserves the talk page comments, and really, those need to be saved so that if someone tries to recreate the article or the editors involved go sockpuppeting elsewhere, that we can track them. Deleting the article only to recreate it and redirect erases all that valuable information. I would imagine anyone voting delete here would, if their delete vote doesn't come through or the vote is canceled, much prefer a redirect of the article than a keep, and when the votes are counted I hope the fallback positions are kept in mind instead of anyone falsely interpreting speedy keep + redirect as a regular old keep vote or delete votes as being against a redirect. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 00:43, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b> nonverifiable. Article's author(s) went lengths to stuff the article (now stripped) with wealth of nonvewrifiable claims, also presented in a misleading way. For example, the main notability argument was that he had a feature artile in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i>, while in fact (and I corrected it) it was a certain <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Saturday_Times_Magazine_4fb4.html" title="The Saturday Times Magazine">The Saturday Times Magazine</a></i> (if it was at all). Information about his descent is contradictory in different published places. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 03:35, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, that's not correct. Unless the article shows, or any other reference proves that Eenasul Fateh uses Alaudin Ahmed as a pseudonym, or vice versa, we can't assume that both persons are the same. It is very much possible that Mr. Alaudin Ahmed uses "Aladin", a shortening of his actual name, as his stage name. Besides, I don't see any reason why Eenasul Fateh, son of <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abul_Fateh_554d.html" title="Abul Fateh">Abul Fateh</a> would use the name Alaudin Ahmed, a completely different name.
