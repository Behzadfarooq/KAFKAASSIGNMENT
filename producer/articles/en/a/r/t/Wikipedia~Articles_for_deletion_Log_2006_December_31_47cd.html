<li><b>Keep</b> Upon reading the nomination reason, I was under the impression that each issue had a seperate article. However, it's actually giving quick summaries of all the story arcs on one page (except the last arc) which should be trimmed. Some formatting would probably help improve the article.

<p><b>Comment</b> - I would really like to see some of the <i>Keep</i> advocates discuss how this article fits in with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> #7, which is official policy here on Wikipedia. ""Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic. <i>Until that happens I fail to see any valid reason for keeping it. <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> 01:58, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Speaking of the Spider-man page, which is how this page can be if it's fixed instead of deleted: real world context = creators and dates. historical significance = first appearances and deaths. sourced analysis = Notes like "This storyline is continued in the video game.", differnces with the original Spider-man continuity, etc. This is the larger topic that reasonable sized plot summaries can accompany. I agree this page needs work, but it doesn't need to be deleted. It sounds like we're going to disagree on what constitutes a valid larger topic, but I'd like to point out this is just a matter of opinion, not an obvious fail of WP:NOT. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 03:35, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In and of itself when related to articles, no. However, I was pointing out that the material being used to shield what is essentially an arc by arc summary of the entire run to date from Wiki guides, is, for the most part, duplicated on the parent article. Hence it carries less weight in evaluating this article. If the material was unique, then it would be a strong argument for retention of the article. As it stands, the primary aspect is the summary, the notes do not add enough to outweigh that, even in the revised format of "Tomorrow People" and "Magical". — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 08:15, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We fixed the first sections plot so it isn't overly long. Anyway, it sounds like you're confusing interpretation ("Any interpretive claims require secondary sources") and summarization.

<dd>I'm arguing that this article is utterly useless without intepretation, and interpretation is verboten. Right now, it doesn't offer useful context to any encyclopedic commentary, just unadorned plot summary. People who want to know nothing more than what happens in the comic can read the comic. This is why <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> counsels merging plot summary to articles with encyclopedic commentary, and redirecting when additional plot detail isn't needed. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 08:30, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Problems do exist with this article.</i> I do agree with many of those who chose "Delete" that this page has a large problem: lots of plot summary and not much else. Worse, it was all from an in-universe point of view. However, I don't believe a large problem means it is an unfixable problem. Peregrinefisher and I have worked toward providing better formatting and less summary in three of the sections: The Tomorrow People, Magical, and Cable. The sections still discuss plot, but we've added references to more real world perspective such as an interview where Robert Kirkman (the current main writer) describes how his perspective on the 90s mainstream Cable affected his choices when introducing the Ultimate version of Cable.</li>
<li><i>A problem also exists with the main article.</i> The main page for the Ultimate X-Men is now 30kb. According to the Rationale section of <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_break_up_a_page_610a.html#Rationale" title="Wikipedia:How to break up a page">WP:Summary</a>, 30kb is the point where articles start to become lengthy. I know <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia isn't a crystal ball</a> but I'm going to gamble that the Ultimate X-Men series will not end or be discontinued soon. The article will continue to grow larger when Brian Singer takes over writing, and larger when subsequent changes happen to Ultimate X-Men. Much of the information from the plot section on the main page can be merged to or added to the story arc page. This would leave more space to add additional general information on the main page while putting more detailing information on the story arcs and their creative teams (in a NPOV, out-of-universe style) on a seperate page without leaving either page lengthy.</li>
<li><i>The page is not unfixable given work and time.</i> Is the page or even these three sections perfect? No. However, making a featured article or a good article takes time. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies_d339.html" title="2006 FIFA World Cup controversies">2006 FIFA World Cup controversies</a> is an example of an article that went from AfD to Good Article status. I know some editors are worried that few improvements happened between the first and current AfD. However, the page history shows that since this AfD started many edits have been made. I personally have worked hard to contribute, and it would not end after the AfD ended. <a href="../../../f/m/m/User%7EFmmarianicolon_02b0.html" title="User:Fmmarianicolon">fmmarianicolon</a> | <a href="../../../f/m/m/User_talk%7EFmmarianicolon_bdb5.html" title="User talk:Fmmarianicolon">Talk</a> 03:37, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is kind of fun but hardly encyclopedic. Wikidepia is not a collection of trivial information.

<li>"I think that it's a trivia.", the rationale used by several editors here, isn't a reason for deletion, conversely.

<li>That would be a circular rationale: "It's unencyclopaedic because it's trivial. It's trivial because it's nonencyclopaedic."

<li>No, I meant that trivial things are unencyclopedic, and unencyclopedic things don't belong in wikipedia. <s>It's trivial because it isn't important.</s> In particular, I mean that this list isn't notable by itself.

The main point of an entry in an article's "External links" section is to link to content that cannot or may not be included in the actual article. But you yourself have just stated that a list of calculator words <i>can and may</i> be included in an article. Since you yourself have just argued that a list of such words is acceptable content for an article, what is your basis for arguing that this article should be deleted? It cannot be that the list is non-notable. (If it were non-notable, why have so many separate people compiled and published such a list?) It cannot be that the list is unverifiable. (One can verify it against the several lists that have been linked to both in the article and in this discussion.) It cannot be that this is unacceptable content for an article. (You've just argued that a list of calculator words <i>is</i> acceptable.)

<li>The purpose of the list is clearly informational. The scope of the list is well-defined, and is not excessively broad, given that there is both a limited alphabet and a limited word length. All verifiability and original research concerns appear to be a matter of cleanup, not of deletion, given that the article is verifiable from many sources who have already done the research of determining what words can be made, such as <a href="http://www.dr-mikes-math-games-for-kids.com/calculator-word-game-upside-down-list.html" class="external text" title="http://www.dr-mikes-math-games-for-kids.com/calculator-word-game-upside-down-list.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, <a href="http://homepages.strath.ac.uk/~cjbs17/calculator/calcwords.html" class="external text" title="http://homepages.strath.ac.uk/~cjbs17/calculator/calcwords.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and <a href="http://www.langmaker.com/calculatorwords.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.langmaker.com/calculatorwords.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<li>According to the article, that translates to "fool". Fortunately, we don't base our decisions upon what Wikipedia editors personally think to be foolish.

A condensed version in the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculator_spelling.html" title="Calculator spelling">Calculator spelling</a> article, along with maybe an external link to a more extensive list, would suffice to explain the concept.

This article has well and truly passed that point. It ought to go, simply because it is just a mindless heaping of data.

<li><b>Delete</b> as nom. I always thought <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> was a dangerous thing to have lying around. I strongly feel that it should not apply in determining wether material should be included in Wikipedia mainspace articles. In this area the rules are crucial- everyone is bound to want to save there favourite unencyclopedic articles on the bases of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> which just becomes <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> on a policy footing. These words were <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">dreamed up in school on many days</a>. Sometimes such ideas can become widespread and popular amongst those of school age, but that does not make them worthy of an encyclopedia article where there content is unimportant and not notable (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Common_room_cricket_d507.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Common room cricket">Common room cricket</a> for an example of a recent AfD of this sort).

<li><b>Comment:</b> This whole list is available on websites linked to from the article <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculator_spelling.html" title="Calculator spelling">Calculator spelling</a>, and it should be noted that many of these words aren't words that <i>anyone</i> ever used before--they're just all possible words. There may be some value in this list, for some purpose, but for the purpose of the encyclopedia I think that we should just pick the most common calculator words to place in the main article on calculator spelling, and remove the list. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 13:14, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>And what source are you proposing to use for determining what are the "most common" words? Or are you proposing that editors perform <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>?

<li><b>Addendum:</b> I want to state clearly, since I'm not certain people recognize it, based on comments: there is already a page about the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculator_spelling.html" title="Calculator spelling">practice of spelling words on a calculator</a>. The arguments that have been used about how everyone knows about spelling words on a calculator, etc are arguments in support of keeping the article <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculator_spelling.html" title="Calculator spelling">Calculator spelling</a>, but what we are concerned with here is the article List of calculator words. The practice of spelling words on the calculator is notable enough for an article, but the list of all words doesn't merit an article of its own. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 13:21, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Long, long ago, a list like this one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Calculator_spelling&amp;oldid=39899393" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Calculator_spelling&amp;oldid=39899393" rel="nofollow"><i>was</i> present on the page you cite</a>. Note the list's arbitrary nature ('donkey' in German...a great intro to calculator spelling!), and also its absolute uselessness. Any longer and it becomes useful, but unwieldly; any shorter or at that length, and it is manageable but pointless. It absolutely requires a separate article.
<p>I would, however, lightly agree that attempting to list <i>every</i> word in <i>every</i> language is a futile task. When some non-arbitrary boundaries ('your favourite calculator word sucks' doesn't cut it) can be agreed upon by the community, I will gladly bring the list down to something sensible yet useful. I will always be strongly in favour this article's continuation, but I do understand criticism of its length. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpamguy_4135.html" title="User:Spamguy">Spamguy</a> 19:42, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yeah, that works for me. My main concern was with duplicating what's out there already. You've provided a few sources that list calculator words - there's no reason we can't list a fair bunch of examples in the calculator words article, then link to those outside pages as web resources which provide a full list of words. By doing that, Wikipedia readers will still have access to the full list - we just won't have to maintain it. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 01:08, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The RIAA's official website notes they got a Gold single in the US, plus they had a No.1 single and No.2 album in Germany in 2004 (noted on reasonably reputable charting sources). There's several claims about a multi-city sell-out tour in the US but I can't find any independent confirmation of that. I've completely rewritten the discography section just now (note I had nothing to do with the original article) and provided refs to the above, but I'll let others decide what sections of the prose should be removed (IMO - most of it). <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 02:51, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hope Im allowed to write here; if not please forgive me Im only aware of how to write articles not the other workings of this site&#160;:p. Anyways Im the one who started this page and no its not a hoax. The history is similar to what is described: they were one of Lou's last 'successful' boybands and there biggest hit in America, Germany, Malaysia, and Japan was 'Put your arms around me' in 2000 and 2001. They had a lot of success in Germany (see German page) but didnt take off much here. They charted in the German top 20 for most of their career and the band ended in 2004 again as described. Marc Terenzi went on to marry Sarah Connor (German Britney Spears if you will) and hes charted in the top 50 himself. Maybe my tone wasnt right but the whole article is fact. That much I can say. Many of the links are long gone...Lou deleted their website (naturalofficialsite.com) which usuing the wayback machiene you can see (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010509141202/http://www.naturalofficialsite.com/" class="external free" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20010509141202/http://www.naturalofficialsite.com/" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20010509141202/http://www.naturalofficialsite.com/</a>) and if you check amazon their CDs are listed especially on amazon.de. As for the tour in the US I dont know if it sold out but they did tour with the Monkess and partner with Claires as Claire's site still has the press release (<a href="http://www.clairestores.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=68915&amp;p=irol-newsArchives2001" class="external free" title="http://www.clairestores.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=68915&amp;p=irol-newsArchives2001" rel="nofollow">http://www.clairestores.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=68915&amp;p=irol-newsArchives2001</a>).

<li><b>Comment</b> These are indeed fictional characters, but some of these characters are pretty important in the setting, not minor. Karl Franz is the leader of the Empire in the Warhammer Fantasy Universe, Sigmar is its founder, Magnus a major Emperor. However, in the case of at least some of these articles, I see that there may be a <b>copyvio</b> problem. The article on Karl Franz for example, reads almost identically to his entry in the Warhammer army book for the Empire. I get a similar feel from the Magnus article. The others seem a little better, but I'm not sure. I think somebody should really check into this situation. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:36, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>* <b>Keep</b>, <b>Merge</b>, and some <b>Commentary</b> <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Jaeger_61a0.html" title="Felix Jaeger">Felix Jaeger</a> is one of two main characters of a fairly long-lived series of adventure novels (8-9 books, plus short stories). Sigmar has had his biography published (Black Library's <i>Life of Sigmar</i>). These two qualify as very significant characters from a very popular wargame/rpg/fantasy series. I'm sure they need cleaning, but need of cleaning is not really a reason for deleting the articles. I would recommend <b>Keep</b> and tag for cleanup and copyvio fixes where present for these two. Magnus and Morglum on the other hand... I don't think that there is enough material on Magnus to make a very significant article. <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Empire_%28Warhammer%29_cff7.html" title="The Empire (Warhammer)">The Empire (Warhammer)</a> or some such article is likely most appropriate.

<li>Well, notability is at least a reasonable concern, however I can't agree with you that the subject of several bbooks(Felix), major characters in a world setting (Sigmar and Karl Franz) are not notable.

<ul>
<li>"Bravo Bravissimo" which appears to be a national and international show/competion in which she won the national competition. This tends to support notability if more can be demonstrated about the prestige/notability of the contest.</li>
<li>Two recorded albums which may meet Item # 4 of WP Musicians: <i>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels</i>, if the label is important. Meeting this criteria is an automatic notable</li>
<li>In 2003, Diana entered the Portuguese Idol competition, where she reached the semi-finals -- not individually notable, but tends to support</li>
<li>Several songs had substancial success by being featured in several national soap opera(s). This tends to give credibility to the significance of the two recorded albums.</li>
<li>Even though we are an english language based medium, we should be including notables from other cultures. She is considered notable at Portugese WP: (see <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Lucas" class="external autonumber" title="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Lucas" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>). While this article is new here it has been on Portugese WP since July.</li>

<li>While she may appear in our Portuguese sister publication, I fear they've made a mistake. A principal test of notability for a pop artist is a chart hit, or a claim to be a major influence on others in the field. Although she's done well in what appears to be a local radio poll, when I look at the Portuguese article I find no evidence that she's had a hit in a national or European chart, nor does she appear to be particularly influential in her own right.

<li><b>Keep and Rewrite</b> I usually vote delete on 99% of the AFD's, but this is one I feel could be rewritten to be NPOV (I agree it is POV btw). Her name got over 70,000 google hits.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I, too, am mostly for weeding out non-notability, and in general a spokesperson with no independent activity/identity (i.e. who is just one staffer among many in a public-affairs operation) is not notable. That said, if she is/was in fact senior spokesperson for the DoJ, at a time when the Department's role, because of issues such as the Patriot Act and factors such as the Padilla case, is especially important in national politics. The article would indeed need much rewriting/bolstering. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 07:13, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not able to make up my mind on this one. Perhaps this article could be merged into the Padilla one in some way. Somehow I'd like a record of who she is, but she's not really done anything notable per se: as a spokesman she was just doing her job, which isn't notable. She seems to have had a walk-on role in somebody else's story, and that's it.

<li>I can't say I buy the idea that a second-place mayoral candidate is notable enough for an article just because she was a candidate. As far as I'm concerned, at the level of municipal politics we generally need a person's notability to extend demonstrably <i>beyond</i> the boundaries of the city itself; we need to be able to show that people who don't even live in the same <i>province</i> are reasonably likely to have heard of the person: either because they're on the council of a major metropolis with a high international profile, or because they've gotten national media coverage for one reason or another. <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dar_Heatherington_f08e.html" title="Dar Heatherington">Dar Heatherington</a>, for example, merits an article, but that's because of the international press coverage she got when she claimed to have been abducted, <i>not</i> because she was a city councillor. <a href="../../../i/k/e/Ike_Awgu_b633.html" title="Ike Awgu">Ike Awgu</a> merits an article because he hosted a program on a national cable network, <i>not</i> because he unsuccessfully ran for mayor of <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa.html" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is a faulty guideline (among the worst, in my opinion) that permits elimination of a potentially great source of neutral information about the many businesses that impact thousands of lives every day. Coming anywhere near passing <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> should be a guaranteed keep, but failing it really isn't a decent reason to delete articles since impact of even average corporations is far greater than an average pop band on the charts, and that's why it's such a terrible guideline. A partial rewrite of this article is in order. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 17:47, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Doesn't appear to satisfy <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, which, like it or not, is where we should probably start. My own rule of thumb is that "existence is not notability". We're not a directory, so the fact that this company exists is not enough: for a corporation to be notable it must be doing something more than simply being in business - it has to be notable for actively doing something. If the firm were doing something new and important I'd say keep, but it's not: it's simply a company with some funding and a business plan, which is not enough. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:44, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can probably call spam on this. But, it seems that selling is the secondary purpose of the site, and simply showing the movie. But looking closely, the movie and/or song is a means of evangelism - which is exactly one of the many things that Wikipedia is not. Aside from that, doing a google search and eliminating wikipedia and the artist's sites turns up less than 100 ghits (yes, <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOGLE_1973.html" title="WP:GOOGLE">I know</a>...), and many of those seem to be either blogs or places where to buy the album with the tune on here.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> For very simple reason, He is absolutely <b>not notable</b> and <b>unheard in My country</b>.Most of the sources are in fact written by himself and contain false information, such as calling himself a columnist when he has only 4 article for a certain newspaper!!!. Does anyone know how many Sri Lankans write articles or columns to local news papers&#160;?? I guess it could be thousands, and do we need articles for every single person who write something to news papers&#160;? And there are several hundreds of NGO in Sri Lanka and anyone, even I ,can start a new one..So I am not sure how that would make someone notable. And for the google hits, both rajkumar and Kanagasingam are extremely popular names among Tamils and I am rather surprised that there were ONLY 4000+ hits. Please do tell us how many of those hits are actually belong to the author himself..finally, this person has nothing to do with India hence this debate should not be included in the india-related deletions..Thanks<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki"><font color="blue"><b>Iwazaki</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/w/a/User_talk%7EIwazaki_7b86.html" title="User talk:Iwazaki"><font color="red">会話。討論</font></a></sup> 06:58, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Whether the references are non-trivial or not is an editorial decision, but in my opinion (and that of the majority of editors commenting in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rajkumar_Kanagasingam_Archive_b4e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rajkumar Kanagasingam/Archive">first AfD</a>) it is clear that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam30.JPG" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam30.JPG" rel="nofollow">this article</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam13.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam13.jpg" rel="nofollow">this article</a> both have the subject as the main focus of the article and are non-trivial. This is enough to satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Remember, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">notability is not subjective</a>. The article still needs much work, and Mr. Kanagasingam's behaviour has not helped things, but the article should not be deleted on the basis of non-notability. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 14:54, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He is not notable because he has won a peace medal. He is notable because there are multiple, independent media reports on the subject in reliable sources (see here) and therefore this article satisfies the primary notability criterion of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Aside from the argument of <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> who believes that the many newspaper articles discussing the subject are not non-trivial (I disagree), there have been no policy-based reasons put forth to delete this article by any of the editors commenting. All the pro-deletion agruments I see are based on "I haven't heard of him" or "I don't like him", cite the apparent COI issues that surround this article or are just the lazy "per nom" (please see: <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions</a>).

But that wasn't all I wrote. True, I hadn't heard of him, but I'm very willing to concede that I haven't heard of most noteworthy people. (Example: I haven't heard of a single skateboarder, but I'm reliably informed that <a href="../../../s/k/a/Category%7ESkateboarders_be12.html" title="Category:Skateboarders">they</a> can be noteworthy for skateboarding alone, let alone for their other achievements.) And I don't know why I should have to make such a banal declaration, but I neither like nor dislike Rajkumar Kanagasingam. Reason, I think, for deletion (from the very page Ccscott cites): <i>Subject fails to meet the relevant notability guideline (WP:BIO, WP:MUSIC, WP:CORP and so forth),</i> of which the important member is <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. But perhaps I'm wrong and he does meet WP:BIO. If so, how? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:55, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologize for not addressing this directly but I have provided the link several time to the off-line articles, written independent of him, that discuss the subject directly. Again, the list can be found on the talk page for this article. Specifically: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam11.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam11.jpg" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam30.JPG" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam30.JPG" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam13.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam13.jpg" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> are published newspaper articles completely independent of the subject which are primarily focused on the subject (and are therefore non-trivial). There are also numerous more marginal published articles (a few are: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam29.JPG" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam29.JPG" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Businessaward.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Businessaward.jpg" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam9.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam9.jpg" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam3.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam3.jpg" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam6.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Rajsingam6.jpg" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> and more here ) which discuss the subject in a more trivial fashion. This amount of news coverage is sufficient to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> easily in my opinion and that of the editors participating in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rajkumar_Kanagasingam_Archive_b4e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rajkumar Kanagasingam/Archive">first AfD</a>. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 12:04, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neither the peace medal nor handing out an <i>unknown</i> report make this person notable..I don't see anything but pure propaganda in those pictures..In case you don't know, It is not a big deal to have your photo on a newspaper..Some people when they get married put an add on the papers, some when they passed an exam do the same, some others prefer to notify the whole Sri Lanka when they win a medal or competition(in most cases just to boast) by having their picture on the papers..So, just because one has some photos on a newspaper he/she won't automatically become notable , kinda common sense. And, no one here saying things like <i>i don't like him</i> and bla bla..People have come up with very good points and I would kindly ask you to read them instead of dragging this into a different direction.Oh,,You can always shed some light on this by showing us anything written of him in media BY others..So far i have failed to see a single article or anything reported in local media <b>OF him</b>, quite strange for such a notable person, isn't it? <a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki"><font color="blue"><b>Iwazaki</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/w/a/User_talk%7EIwazaki_7b86.html" title="User talk:Iwazaki"><font color="red">会話。討論</font></a></sup> 01:52, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> COI issues aside (I personally don't feel COI should lead to deletion unless the article is in such a poor form it's best to start over), it's not clear if this article establishes notability.

Nothing else clearly established notability to me. Also there appears to be bad behaviour own both side. It is <b>inappropriate</b> to spam people about an AFD, especially if it's an article about you &amp; those people are ones who have previously supported you. However it does appear the nominator is involved in a dispute with the editor with some controversy. Editors involve in disputes <b>should not</b> nominate articles for deletion about the person they're involved in the dispute with. Even if the editor genuinely feel it should be delete, this raises COI issues and just looks bad. Rather, you should bring the matter to the attention of other people, e.g. via the village pump or perhaps COI notice board and mention you are involved in an unrelated dispute and don't want to cloud the issue by nominating it. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 14:34, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>And you're welcome to make a comment further emphasising those facts.

<p>Ok, I understand that WP only wants to see "verifiable proof" that an artist has been successful all over the place...which really confuses me. Obviously in ths case we have a person that has accomplished MUCH in his career (read "Accomplishments") and yet because he has not had songs on the top 40 charts, WP wants to see him deleted. Very, very sad and unfortunate indeed...but typical. If a person hasn't made millions, nobody cares.</p>
<p>This person travelled with one of the most well-known Christian music artists, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rich_Mullins_3e08.html" title="Rich Mullins">Rich Mullins</a>, yet should I assume that the article would need some sort of proof of this? Too bad it was in the early 80's, and now that Mr. Mullins has passed away, we can't get a quote from him.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am willing to "tone down alot" the "hagiography" as requested, if you'll allow this well written, well laid out, and interesting article to remain on WP. Either way, I had fun spending my ENTIRE DAY putting this article together, only to have it nominated for deletion before the ink was dry.</p>

You may also want to look at the general <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines; it's quite possible that he may be notable as an evangelist rather than a musician, but we'll still need independent proof of this. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 05:38, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, it states on the Notability page: "A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, DJ, musical theatre group, etc.) is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria"</p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> (vote changed, see below). First, I'll make something clear: I may be biased. I have some issues with the horn-tooting about somebody's evangelistic accomplishments - this is something you do for God, not something you do to boast about what you do for God! That said, I'll put aside my personal problems with this, since Wikipedia is <i>definitely</i> not the place to go on about this, and note that there are major POV issues with this article. Aside from that, it's clear he's notable within <i>at least</i> the Christian music realms, if not within Christianity as a whole, but there is the issue that intra-group notability is not <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> as far as meets the Wikipedia standards (we've seen much of that with some of the furry deletia recently), and it's exceedingly rare that a Christian artist breaks out of the strongholds of CCM - those inside consider doing so harmful, and of the few who actually do, most seem to fail spectacularly. I'm also not seeing assertion within the article of meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Clean up the article or get rid of it.

<dd>Update - found 2 cites from 2001 and 1994 which reference his trips to China and Uzbekistan, but both are from the local newspaper Dayton Daily News in Dayton, Ohio. I'm surprised that no Asian-region or US newspapers or religious journals reported on the China visit in particular. The reference to the "Samarakand city museum" seems suspect - I tried searching under "Samarkand", the correct spelling, and found no reference to Lee at all. If anyone can think of anywhere else to look, this article might be salvageable - but it's leaning towards a rather reluctant delete from me&#160;:( <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 12:47, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for youur comments, Dennisthe2. I must point out you are then in disagreement with articles on such people as <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Graham_526a.html" title="Billy Graham">Billy Graham</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Graham_446a.html" title="Franklin Graham">Franklin Graham</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gaither_a3f3.html" title="Bill Gaither">Bill Gaither</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_W._Smith_dd4b.html" title="Michael W. Smith">Michael W. Smith</a>, and so on and so on. It just happens to be their career, and it is their American right to have a career as an evangelist. Anyway, these folks can have an article I suppose because they have won awards and sold millions of books and records in their careers as evengelists. You're right, WP is not the place to go on about this, since it is clear that WP allows articles on such people.And once again I repeat that the article now meets WP:MUSIC criterion #5: "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable." I have inserted the criteria here exactly as it appears in WP"MUSIC, so I'm not sure why there's any question. As for China and Uzbekistan, we have plenty of photos. Is that sufficient? Or not because we took them? We have photos from several different concert venues in the Philippines, as well as appearances in Thailand. As for why there are no articles in Chinese newspapers about the TV event, might it be because China is a Communist country? They do not necessarily support an event that has an American singing a "Christian" song on their airwaves. I can understand why there might not be any press on this. However, we may have some things in print that are not online. Does every source have to be an online source? Still learning.Kutlessfan777 17:59, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Don't get me wrong, I'm not harping about their careers - but thinking more about it, it's kind of a paradox.

That leaves the issue of <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a>: it reads more like something for a church or for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvest_Crusade_60f2.html" title="Harvest Crusade">Harvest Crusade</a> than an encyclopedia article, and many people who read this article are going to balk when they see that it's got a Christian evangelistic bent in its tone. As such, I'm changing my vote to <b>Keep</b>, but it needs cleanup due to the point of view problem.

<dd>My opinion only, but the consensus lies between weak keep and weak delete, and work can be done on this article to improve it. I don't think there's any doubt that within the field or area this individual is notable, so it wouldn't fail notability - the main issue is verifiability and published reliable sources, which I would think to be more of a cleanup issue. Perhaps what we should do, and what I might propose as a compromise that could be acceptable to all here, is to close this AfD debate, whack a big cleanup tag on it, fix it up, find more sources (I've found two, Kutless may have a few more) and if within, say, 2 or 3 weeks we haven't got or can't get it to the stage where it's a decent article that cites sources, then revisit this debate. (In answer to a question you asked me, Kutless - a magazine that is out of print can be a reliable source as long as someone else can find it in a library somewhere. Much of my work is with geographical articles and most of the information can only be found in either the nearest local library or in the State Library.)

<dd>To be honest, I don't think we've even established that he's notable within the CCM community. We have two album reviews from 15 years ago, and two articles in a local newspaper. As an absolute minimum, I think we need evidence that he's been in the CCM charts. We should, of course, let the AfD run to completion, but I still think that we should delete the article if more sources aren't forthcoming, with no predjudice against re-creation if such sources are found subsequently. I'm sorry to sound sceptical, but it's important for us not to rely on unsupported assertions of notability. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 21:18, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will do my part. However, I want to point out to Tevildo that you continue to ignore the fact that the article DOES meet the requirements of WP:MUSIC criterion #5: "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable." I have inserted the criteria here exactly as it appears in WP:MUSIC. Why does this continue to be overlooked? It is very clearly spelled out, and WP:MUSIC is very clear in the criteria. If the notable sources are weak, but nonetheless are THERE and may just need "cleaned up" as Orderinchaos suggests, AND criteria #5 is covered without question, then why do you still suggest keeping this debate open?Kutlessfan777 21:31, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That would only apply if Mr Behnken and Mr Webb performed together as a group (rather than as soloist and accompanist) - and, indeed, if Mr Webb <i>is</i> notable. We have no article on him at present, and his involvement with the (undeniably notable) <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gaither_%28Gospel_singer%29_ca8f.html" title="Bill Gaither (Gospel singer)">Bill Gaither</a> doesn't appear to be major. I'm not saying that this applies to the current situation, but a session musician _might_ be notable for performing with a major artist; that doesn't automatically convey notability on anyone who's ever performed with that session musician. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 22:01, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> since JEF wants me to comment on the individual article, the article is unencyclopaedic, written in utterly uncritical terms, and there is no evidence of the reliable secondary sources which could be used to fix that failure of core policy. Or indeed on which to base a verifiable article (another core policy). There is no assertion in this article that this church is in any way remarkable. Most churches are not, after all. Wikipedia is not a directory, and this is a (rather spammy) directory entry. Hopefully JEF will accept the validity of this argument, which addresses the individual subject article in some detail. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 17:00, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - Although we have articles on future film releases... All the article and the references say is that it has a name, a star and a director. No plot, coverage, budget or any other information. The only reason there's a name is that it's been registered ( I assume to prevent poaching ) and the article has NOTHING beyond the name.

<li><b>Delete'</b> It <b>may</b> be true that Wikipedia is American (or Western) centric, but that doesn't change the fact the film is non-noteable. The internet is <b>world-wide</b> and if something as small as this project was, had gotten press, there would be plenty of ways to prove noteablity. The notion that it article is being deleted because Wikipedia is American centric is not a worthy arguement. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 11:40, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- America-centric is a valid concern. Notability, in my experience, can be far too culturally relative a yard-stick to be useful.

<dd><b>Comment</b> In all honesty I don't feel terribly strongly about this. However, for the purposes of having a proper debate - could someone who has voted "keep" explain to me why the man himself needs an article, distinct from the article about (1) CDA of which he is chair and (2) the important libel case which he was party to? Yes, the CDA is notable, yes, the case is notable - but is he?</dd>
<dd>There are plenty of clubs, pressure groups etc. more prominent than the CDA, the leaders of which don't have articles (and rightly so). There are <i>much</i> more important landmark legal cases where the plaintiff and the defendant don't have their own article (and rightly so).</dd>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment in response to Sandy Dancer</b> I think that we need to look at this in three parts. Firstly there are more assertions of notability than the two mentioned. There's the leadership of the Monday Club's "ultra" wing in their last days, then there's the attempt to expel Smith personally for from the Conservative Party that forced the Tories to back down after attracting a number of unhelpful media articles and finally there was the candidacy in Portsmouth North for UKIP which was credited by Smith, the Tory candidate and the analyst Richard North for stopping a Conservative win in that seat. These are all backed up by quite a lot of non-trivial coverage in the mainstream press. Now these are all related to his political activities but the political activities are not all within the realms of the CDA.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The second point is that even with the two assertions of notability - they are seperate enough to warrant a bridging article. When you count in the other political activities (particularly the UKIP candidacy in Portsmouth) this point is more crucial. While the argument that if he only attracted attention as the leader of the CDA, or only the UKIP candidate or only the plaintiff in <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith-Smith_v_Williams_c783.html" title="Keith-Smith v Williams">Keith-Smith v Williams</a> then he would have no independent notability might have some merit, as someone who attracts attention from all three fronts then he merits an article as a bridge between these.</dd>
<dd>Lastly there's a more general point. Politics is never simply about the people who hold official office it's about the sea in which these fish swim. It is important for a student of politics to get an idea of the people who are in the background influencing the political climate. People such as Mike Smith, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Montgomerie_a093.html" title="Tim Montgomerie">Tim Montgomerie</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_MacGregor_2d71.html" title="Mark MacGregor">Mark MacGregor</a> may not be well known to the public - sometimes by their own choice - but their influence means that they should be known - at least by those who wish to find out. <a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_Wilson_1ebd.html" title="Des Wilson">Des Wilson</a> in the Liberal Democrats or <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Lawson_2dfa.html" title="Neal Lawson">Neal Lawson</a> in Labour would fill similar positions. While I have little sympathy with vanity articles or articles for every councillor on a particular council, influential non-office holders should be included - whether or not one agrees with their politics.</dd>

<p>I was a member of the List of Lost episodes mediation a few months ago, where we unanimously came up to a consensus regarding season/individual episode articles. The guideline that we established for season episodes straight from <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Lost_Episode_guidelines_a509.html#General_article_guidelines" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Lost/Episode guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Lost/Episode guidelines#General article guidelines</a> reads as follows:</p>
<p>"In lieu of Episodes of Lost (season X), Lost season X may be created, consisting of a summary of the main themes and developments of the season, for the reader who wants a broad overview before diving into the individual articles. These season wraparound articles should be relatively brief, link to the individual episode articles where appropriate, and should not attempt to summarize individual episodes but rather emphasize broad themes, plot arcs and character developments."</p>
<p>As of now, these pages do not discuss any themes or character developments; they are blatantly plot summaries. Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> Point 7 (<i>Plot summaries. Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic.</i>), the current season pages do not pass this policy and should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedical_7c58.html" title="User:Wikipedical">Wikipedical</a> 06:53, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Note: I definitely do <b>NOT</b> want this AfD to be seen as an attempt to overpower the mediation. I am not presenting any arguments whatsoever regarding redundancy with individual episode articles.</dd>
<dd>I am merely acting as a committed member of WikiProject Lost and fully believe that deleting these articles now will overall benefit the quality of our Lost articles and Wikipedia as a whole. I also hope and expect this deletion to be temporary until we as a Project can create meaningful pages discussing thematic and character developments over the seasons. <b>Delete</b>, as nominator. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedical_7c58.html" title="User:Wikipedical">Wikipedical</a> 07:07, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I am also disappointed that there was so little attempt to gather further comment (just a brief note on the WikiProject page, in the middle of the holiday season).

<dd>you should follow your own advice and go through the article nicely. check out Susam Pal#Assistance to Indian Tourismv. it says he found a vuln "which could be exploited by an attacker to bring the site down thereby making it inaccessible to intended users". "bring down the site" is the definition of a dos. and whether or not it can be is moot. it violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and mistates the vuln. 207.229.176.46 13:08, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>LOL! Whatever is written in the article is true. It is an SQL Injection in the site which can be used to drop tables in the site in question there by causing the DoS attack. I hope you have understood the meaning now. (How the tables can be dropped is not a publicly disclosed fact and is still a guarded secret of the Indian underground community). Ok if that particular statement violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, then that particular line can be removed and it can simply be written that he discovered SQL Injection in the site and demonstrated standard probing techniques.

<dd>i will concede that i had not thought of dropping the tables. that said, you're still a fucking idiot. SQL injection allows an attacker do a hell of a lot more than DoS attacks do and to call it a DoS attack is highly inaccurate. here's an example:</dd>

<dd>would it be more accurate to call that xss or sql injection? technically, it's both, but if you could only chose one, it'd be more accurate to say sql injection, because that's, ultimately, what is enabling the xss. your calling of an sql injection vuln a dos is akin to saying that the above is xss, which is wrong. 207.229.176.46 18:11, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, there is a difference between a vulnerability that you post in some XYZ forum like a school kid and some vulnerability that is reviewed by SecurityFocus Bugtraq team and included in the Bugtraq Vulnerability Database. If a vulnerability posted by you enters the Bugtraq Vulnerability Database, network scanners all over the world include this vulnerability in their scanning list. For instance, Susam's Apache vulnerability disclosure is used in scanners.

<dd>There's also a difference between a story that you post in some XYZ forum like a school kid and some story that is reviewed by the slashdot.org team and included on their website. If a story by you enters slashdot.org, websites all over the world cover the story. since your argument can be so easily adapted to advocate wikipedia entries on everyone who's ever gotten a slashdot.org story accepted, you must also believe that? otherwise, please explain to me how you're not being hypocritical.</dd>

<li>your an idiot if you think including an article on someone who has a few stories on securityfocus is akin to citing the bbc. that comment is attacking the notability of securityfocus or secunia - it's attacking the notability of susam pal. a more proper analogy would be creating a wikipedia article on everyone who has ever written an article that's been published on the bbc. but no matter. you say wikipedia has stooped "so low". well, congratulation's - you've stooped even lower. if the only counter you have to arguments is by misrepresenting them, you shouldn't waste anyone's time trying to counter them in the first place. 207.229.176.46 13:16, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> - The following comment was made:- "Subscribing to all security-related mailing lists and registering at all security-related websites doesn't make a person notable." by JyothiSingh. I would like to make a correction. We are talking of two differen things. Security Mailing Lists and Security Organization Reports. It is quite easy to get your name into every security mailing list of the world. Just post a mail in the Bugtraq mailing list and it would soon be copied by all other security mailing lists. I agree with this point. <b>But the story is different in case of Security Reports</b>. All the references in the article are those of security reports. A security report is published only after verifying the security incident or vulnerabiliy. Only when it is found verifiable and worthful by the security organization, it is published as a report or advisory. So the subject in question had no way of forcing his name into the thousands of security reports that are available in his name. This is just a clarification. Of course the administrators have the right to decide what is the best thing to do with this article. -- <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoot_exploit_dcdf.html" title="User:Root exploit">Root exploit</a> 14:40, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> - LMAO!!! Who tagged this article for deletion?&#160;:-) I don't understand what has gone wrong with Wikipedia. Why are we tagging just anyone and everyone as "not-notable"? Come on guys! If you don't find them notable, it doesn't mean that it actually is not-notable. There are security folks in Wikipedia who need such articles to exist in Wikipedia because we believe that these guys and organizations have done really good work. -- Smith.norton 15:37, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That it was selected as DYK does not make it notable in my eyes, it's just another kind of original research in my eyes. And the argument about the Russian search result is not valid either in my eyes, I guess most of the results are due to the fact that Star Wars is in the title. <font color="green"><b>Snailwalker |</b></font> <b><a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnailwalker_86d1.html" title="User talk:Snailwalker">talk</a></b> 20:08, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think you may possibly be mistaken on how Google searching works, or at least it appears so from the above response. If you search for the entire title as a quote, only sites taht directly reference that title will be returned as results. If I just search for Star Wars as loose words, I am going to get about 3 billion results. (give or take)... it is only if I search for the entire title that I get meaningful results, which is what I believe Alkivar did. Selection as DYK doesn't itself confer notability. But what it does is suggest that (since the DYK process downchecks non notable articles all the time) that the selectors DID think it was notable, whether they (our new process means one person selects, and usually another vets it before it moves to the page) actually turn up here to comment or not, and that perhaps they saw notability where you did not. Hope that helps. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 21:46, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - I hardly think that the DYK thing is grounds for notability. This "fanfilm" (more a remix, if I read the article properly) is virtually unknown in the Star Wars fanfilm community, and I see nothing that lends any notability to it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRealFennShysa_6315.html" title="User:TheRealFennShysa">TheRealFennShysa</a> 20:06, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - it's sort of an "anti-fan"-film, actually. It is known in Russia, although not terribly popular. It is also not directed at the Star Wars community or fans, but at the general audience. The amusing part is not the plotline (which is warped beyond recognition), but rather, numerous quotes and episodes from Soviet and Russian history and media. This makes the remix interesting almost exclusively to those familiar with these realia, mainly, Russians themselves.

<p>The subject of this article is a 22-year-old sports journalist. The article does not clearly establish notability, and the external links provided just go to the front pages of sites or companies he has worked for, not to anything that specifically relates to or identifies him. A Google search was unsuccessful because his name is apparently quite common; among the other Simon Gilberts is a musician, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Gilbert_%28drummer%29_d5cc.html" title="Simon Gilbert (drummer)">Simon Gilbert (drummer)</a>, who was previously covered by this article but has since been moved to his own article and is not the subject of this nomination. I previously submitted this article about the journalist for <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">proposed deletion</a>, but the PROD tag was removed with the edit summary, "Big name on Fleet Street. Notable in the opinion of many." Since I am unable to determine who the "many" are who consider Simon Gilbert a notable journalist, I recommend that this article be <b>deleted</b> due to lack of evidence that he meets any of the criteria at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 10:57, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Objectively on the basis of WP:PROF. It is only necessary to meet one of the conditions, and he meets criterion 3.3, The work must be widely cited. Seven publications in good journals isn't bad for a beginner, and the top 3 of them had 21, 22, and 28 citations in Web of Science, which is "widely" since the average number is between 1 and 2, varying by field, &amp; this is an order of magnitude higher. (And all are peer reviewed journals). Negative results on Ghits is not conclusive for academics -- Use Google Scholar as well--there were 12. And it is not necessary to work in the US to be notable. But, normally a university lecturer in the UK, which I think corresponds roughly to a US Assistant professor, is not yet notable in any subjective sense, unless the work is extraordinarily good. However we have an objective (albeit still disputed) test. The only way to dispute it is to quibble on <i>widely</i>. If we follow our own rules, it's keep. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:02, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I am going to disagree with this logic and quibble on <i>widely</i>. Criterion 3.3 has to be read in conjunction with the criterion 3, in particular -The person has published a significant and well-known academic work.- In this context, I believe, widely means cited by groups beyond the immediate geographic and research area (not from within the same research institution or group) and not merely a numbers game, which is not demonstrated. As mentioned by User:Drew30319 <i>Editors should be careful when deleting articles that are outside of their field of expertise.</i>. As someone in the field, the article as it stands shows Dr Hooley has done little more than that which is required as a researcher in the UK to maintain their research funding. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 10:44, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per DGG and Yeanold Viskersenn. This is not my field but the number of published articles seemed relevant enough that I contested the speedy.

I also cite the 'fandom' section of the Xena: Warrior Princess article in which, it was stated, "However, in the interviews and commentaries on the DVDs released in 2003-2005, the actors and producers continued to stress that the question about Xena and Gabrielle's relationship was never answered and was up to each viewer's interpretation.” This article was originally posted separately from the Kim Possible page to avoid this sort of situation.

<li><b>Comment</b> The greatest chance of this article not getting deleted is if reliable sources are found for this topic. WP:IAR is not used to justify original research. You mention that the creators of the show are aware of this topic; if you can find a source for that, it could be a pretty strong argument for the inclusion of it somewhere on Wikipedia, whether in its own article or in the Kim Possible article. -<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">SpuriousQ</a> 20:30, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Retain</b> - Kigo is a very prominent aspect of Kim Possible. It may not appear on screen, but anyone who watches the show and discusses it with another person of some kind will eventually discuss this in rather great detail, either the validity of it or the "hotness" of it. It doesn't matter how the fans discuss it, the point is that they do. A LOT. As such, it should be found on Wikipedia, as people come to it for information.

<p><b>Delete</b> - indiscriminate list drawing largely unrelated articles from a wide variety of genres, difficult if not impossible to maintain and will never aproach completeness. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:43, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Seems like a useful organization tool that only includes notable characters. It isn't indiscriminate because it deals with a specific subject. The fact that it can't approach completeness is not an argument for deletion either, since no article on Wikipedia will ever hope to encompass all knowledge on the subject. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 18:21, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Many of the agencies already have categories, which I still contend are superior to lists for this information. Many if not most of the listed characters don't even have individual articles. They just link back to the TV show or film the character is from. Rather than a separate list for the members of a particular show's agency, or lists of fictional agents not otherwise notable enough for individual articles, list the agents in the article for the show itself or, if the fictional agency is significant enough for its own article (c.f. <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenant_%28Alias%29_7d83.html" title="Covenant (Alias)">Covenant (Alias)</a> list the agents there. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:44, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>A lack of individual articles indicates to me that a list could be far more useful than a category. (this is not to say a category is useless mind you, but categories and lists do not exist in opposition to each other). And while sometimes the source material may cover the material adequately, at other times it might be worth having a separate list. For example, members of the FBI are in the X-files, Law and Order, and dozens of other works. While there is a category for them, I know there's a lot that don't have an article about them (and probably shouldn't). This indicates to me that a list would work better. Putting them in the real article about the FBI won't work either. I suppose <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_portrayal_in_the_media_8f0f.html" title="FBI portrayal in the media">FBI portrayal in the media</a> can fulfill this role, so it's not a huge issue, though more articles on that sort of thing should be done. (can't find the equivalent for the CIA for example). But then we have to factor in size issues. <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenant_%28Alias%29_7d83.html" title="Covenant (Alias)">Covenant (Alias)</a> may be able to list all of its members, but I can't say the same of <a href="../../../s/2E/h/S.H.I.E.L.D._6d56.html" title="S.H.I.E.L.D.">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>. I think a similar issue could happen with regards to the CIA, KGB, MI-6, Mossad, even if they had an article like the FBI one. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:02, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are right that only a pedant could think {db-empty} is relevant, so why are we arguing about it? As for the lack of information, in my view an organisational structure IS information (this is self-evident, I hope: correlating fact A with fact B adds something more than fact A and fact B both appearing separately in the encyclopedia <i>somewhere</i>), and this list provides an organisational structure that isn't available in the category.

They are also responsible for authoring books and other publications, but this list is being compiled and will be added. Same goes with news / media clippings. Please note that these articles are rather young and content is being added gradually, as soon as the certain community of contributors are mobilized. Thanks and Happy New Year 2007!

<li>Previously deleted, and nothing so far to justify them returning. An organisation concerning a thousand people is not necessarily notable (there's that number on my train or in my street), but since deletion authors have had a chance to get their act together and provide evidence of notability BEFORE remaking articles.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Greetings all, thanks for your time and effort into this discussion. A user friend staple across this:&#160;::<a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gururaj_Ananda_Yogi" class="external free" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gururaj_Ananda_Yogi" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gururaj_Ananda_Yogi</a> and was cool enough to let us know in the talk page. And it seems it has been there for a while. I should have made this search earlier and simply having it translated from Spanish to English and other languages (since the article was already accepted in the Spanish Wikipedia). I notified some Spanish speaking wikipedia users and they promised that they will take over soon; and if anyone else knows Spanish and English is most welcomed to contribute!&#160;:)) For the time being, I just added a link of the corresponding Spanish wikipedia article in the English one.</dd>
<dd>About the rest of the people, Rajesh Ananda and Jasmini Ananda, yeah, their articles are currently poor in content and citations. I will personally will not remove them (as I disagree), but <i>thankfully</i> a friend told me that he will take over; he found list of books that they written by them (and their ISBNs) and other information and stuff so to increase their notability. He also told me that he will gain access to news clippings archives from newspapers, magazines and television stations and use them too. well, good luck and hopefully soon we will see some quality contributions, until then, be well and c u laser, MarekTT 16:32, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> - a number of similar categories, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_December_5#Category:Fictional_heroes" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_December_5#Category:Fictional_heroes" rel="nofollow">Category:Fictional Heroes</a>, were recently deleted on the grounds of POV. The same POV concerns would apply to a list, which also has the added problems of maintainability and impossibility to ever approach completeness. Actually I'm thinking we may need to take a look at all of the lists of fictional characters by profession. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:22, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hmm. I don't think POV is the issue here, as it seems to be fairly clear in fiction where a character is being presented as a hero. The issue for me is that it's a fairly random list of people from wide areas of fiction. It seems to fall foul of "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information". I would <b>delete</b> although I'm capable of being persuaded differently if there is a good reason. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 15:25, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> broad list that lack sources. "Heroes" is subjective. At least the anti-heroes list is carefully cited, unlike this list. A big problem with this one is that it's too broad, covering so many kinds of heroes from so many different media that the list becomes useless. It will also be painfully incomplete. When fleshed out, it will be too long to be useful. Who will read a list with four million entries? <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 17:52, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> "Hero" is synonymous with "protagonist" which is a feature of nearly any literature, and one can place items on this list based on whether secondary-sources consider them heroes. The main problem with this list is that it is incredibly large. I would recommend trimming the content of the article to include only those characters where we can point to a secondary source that discusses the character in the context of being a protagonist (not simply articles about them as a character). <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 17:58, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Forgive me, but I think you're digging a bigger hole for yourself with the observation that 'hero' is synonymous with 'protagonist'. In many cases, the protagonist of a piece of literature is far from heroic (think Humbert Humbert, for one). <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 18:12, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I see, you are interpreting "hero" to mean, roughly, "a good guy." When I read "hero" in the context of literature, I assume the author is using it as a synonym for protagonist.

<p>This list is absolutely humongous and completely unmaintainable. Most of the biographies on Wikipedia aren't listed anyway, making this a <i>huge</i> waste of space as it is unsusable. If people want a list of all the biographies on Wikipedia, then this could all be made into 26 huge categories (one for each letter). I am nominating <b>all subpages</b> along with the base page in this nomination. —<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 15:44, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's obvious that a lot of work was put into setting up this complex of pages, and so I certainly wouldn't want to see them deleted or deprecated without thorough discussion. If there is a problem with keeping the pages updated, that may be a result of insufficient awareness of them: I have contributed 50 or so biographical articles, but I never heard of these pages until I came across this AfD discussion, so of course I never added my biographees to the pages, which I would have been happy to do. I just added one of my bios to the page as a test, and I had to go through a number of subpages to get to where I needed to be, so it will be a challenge to get the list comprehensive, but if it's a useful list could be worth it. Am wondering if the list has been useful to others, and what the editors at Project Biography might think. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 16:49, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But wouldn't categories just be much easier? A bot can run through and place everyone in Category:xxxx births into the correct category. —<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 16:59, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, categories are obviously useful, but they typically group by just one criterion, as opposed to the few words of description after each name on this listing. By the way, has anyone asked the people who set up these pages what they think they are useful for? <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 17:09, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Wow, I've never seen this list before. What a Herculean effort! Someone should write a bot to transfer all this information into <a href="../../../p/d/a/WP%7EPDATA_a744.html" title="WP:PDATA">Persondata</a> templates.

<li><b>Comment</b> I can see a good reason to keep something <i>like</i> this, in that it could be a useful organizational tool for people to look up a name when they can remember something vague about a name but not its exact spelling. The main problem with these pages is that it appears to have some major technical problems in that it takes a long time to load. Is there a better way to address the problem that this page is attempting to solve? <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 18:07, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, there is a better way, and that is putting these into letter categories. —<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets501</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 18:09, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I simply cannot see the use of this list. It does not aid the user in finding anyone. Anyone looking for a specific individual will use a search engine rather than dive three or four levels deep into such a list. Anyone who isnt certain of a name, but knows attributes (ie: profession, nationality, etc) will not be aided by this list.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is potentially a useful resource, but I think there ought to be a better way of presenting the information.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The list's functions cannot be replaced with Categories, as Cats are presently implemented, for several reasons:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Red links placed on <a href="../../../l/o/p/LoPbN_8d81.html" title="LoPbN">LoPbN</a> have a high rate of turning into lks to bios.
<dl>
<dd>Rd lks cannot be assigned to Cats, so replacement of LoPbN by any Cat scheme would destroy this popular venue for calling attention to needed bios.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Multiple LoPbN entries for a single biography are important for people whose names don't fit the typical "Western" pattern of a one-word given name (possibly with initial(s)) followed by a one-word surname:
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>the obvious exception is Chinese names (to which Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and traditional Hungarian names behave similarly) which, depending on the individual, may appear in their proper order, inverted for convenience of ignorant Westerners, or sometime one way and sometimes the other for the same person -- but don't forget</li>
<li>compounds formed from two surnames (sometimes with and sometimes without hyphenation), related to noble status, or (at least in Britain) eligibility for inheritances or assertion of female equality, or gods-know-what in the case of <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_Viardot-Garcia_58af.html" title="Pauline Viardot-Garcia">Pauline Viardot-Garcia</a>, whose maiden name was Garcia and whose name is so non-conforming that we mistakenly entitle her bio <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_Garcia-Viardot_4a3a.html" title="Pauline Garcia-Viardot">Pauline Garcia-Viardot</a>,</li>
<li>the reflection in Spanish-speaking cultures of mother's original surname, and (apparently different) practices in Portuguese-speaking cultures,</li>
<li>surnames that include a prefix, raising the question of whether to alphabetize according to the prefix (<a href="../../../1/6/4/Category%7E1641_deaths.html" title="Category:1641 deaths">Van Dyck, Anthony</a>) or not (<a href="../../../1/8/2/Category%7E1827_deaths.html" title="Category:1827 deaths">Beethoven, Ludwig van</a>),</li>
<li>non-inherited Icelandic last names,</li>
<li>many surviving tribal-culture naming practices (<a href="../../../e/r/i/Eritrea.html" title="Eritrea">Eritrean</a> names were recently cited to me), and, moving beyond modern commoners,</li>
<li>ancient Roman names ("Julius" is simply the name, IIRC, of the <i>family line</i> that the great <i>Gaius</i> Julius Caesar came from, but it is common to assume otherwise),</li>
<li>European names from before the adoption of surnames (which tend to exist in different English-language texts in an Anglicized, a Latinized, and at least one version reflecting a language local to the person's origin or work),</li>
<li>names of noble rulers (James I of England was the same person as James VI of Scotland, IIRC, and i think most Holy Roman Emperors were also monarchs under other titles and usually numbers), and</li>
<li>other bearers of titles, who are likely to be sought under different parts of the alphabet depending on how many of their eventual titles they had inherited or been granted, by the period of their life that the seeker saw discussed.</li>
<li>Besides these classifiable patterns of repetitive problems, there are misspellings and misrememberings of rare names, some of them also predictable, like <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byron_Janis_7272.html" title="Byron Janis">Byron Janis</a> (whose LoPbN entry i stumbled on, long after adding a rd lk for <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byron_Janus_3c52.html" title="Byron Janus">Byron Janus</a>), and worthy of preemptive duplicate entries.</li>
<li>Less obviously, some quirky and unpredictable mistakes like <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_James_Ford_495b.html" title="Henry James Ford">Henry James Ford</a> need a duplicate LoPbN entry because they are so widely found on the Web. How can such quirky mistakes be so widespread? Sometimes bcz they got made by WP editors, were not quickly caught, and have been spread far and wide by cloners of our content. It would be irresponsible for WP not to be helpful to users misinformed by such WP errors.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Multiple tags in an article for the same Cat produce only one entry on the Cat page, so relying on Cats is useless to a user who knows only variants differing from the title of the bio sought.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>There are many groups, each with numerous bios of similarly or identically pronounced names like <a href="../../../h/o/f/List_of_people_by_name%7E_Hof_78cb.html#Hofl_-_Hofs" title="List of people by name: Hof">Hofman, Hofmann</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/f/List_of_people_by_name%7E_Hof_78cb.html#People_named_Hofman" title="List of people by name: Hof">Hoffman</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/f/List_of_people_by_name%7E_Hof_78cb.html#People_named_Hofman" title="List of people by name: Hof">Hoffmann</a>, and Huffman (none presently on LoPbN, tho 11 are listed on <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category: Living people</a>). Cross references could be added on those LoPbN sections to alert users whose memories rely on sound more than spelling, or who heard a name in a lecture or broadcast, that they've not considered all the options. (A few of these have been done by me and others, tho i haven't made it much of a priority, and can't remember an implemented example at the moment.)
<dl>
<dd>Cats offer no facility for putting instructions, let alone cross-ref lks, on the Cat page. And altho you could have smaller Cats, for people named Hoffman, or for people with surnames that sound like Hoffman it's hard to see what good either of those could do for people who are expecting the bio's title to have a spelling <i>other</i> than "Hoffman" as its surname.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Speaking of "unmaintainability" (the name being bandied about here in place of the truth, which is <i>undermaintenance</i>), pick a common <i>given</i> name, and go to the corresponding page on <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a> to see how many bios for people with that given name are listed in the Cat among people with surnames that start the same way as that given name.
<dl>
<dd>Fortunately for users seeking bios misfiled on Cat LP, LoPbN has two factors making it more maintainable against such errors, so that is serves as a backup for some such cases:
<ol>
<li>The errors occur much less often, bcz those who make them in most cases have to place them adjacent to entries that are clearly filed by surname, whereas you can put a biographical-Cat tag on an article without piping the tag, are likely see no examples with piping, and don't see the rendering of the Cat entry without following the Cat lk on the page you tagged to the Cat page.</li>
<li>When an LoPbN maintainer notes such a misfiling (usually a given name like James or Henry that has a heading ending "... as surname", containing lks to monarchs surnamed James, Henry, or whatever), they may be keeping {{<a href="../../../l/i/s/Template%7EList_of_people_by_name_exhaustive_page-index_%28sectioned%29_cedf.html" title="Template:List of people by name exhaustive page-index (sectioned)">List of people by name exhaustive page-index (sectioned)</a>}} open in a window or pane, and can use it to lk directly to the correct page for the lk, use its ToC to lk to a roughly 24-line section, cut and paste the offending lk from page to page, and if necessary repipe that lk (or re-code it using {{<a href="../../../l/o/p/Template%7ELoPbN_Entry_0dd0.html" title="Template:LoPbN Entry">LoPbN Entry</a>}} and get the piping done for free). (Those maintaining bio Cats re misplacement may have to wade thru an <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_van_Beethoven_69c9.html#External_links" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">oversized section</a> on the bio article, or even scan the 18 Cats 3 times before it occurs to them to look at the <i>top</i> of the page for the offending Cat tag!)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>The assertion that Cats would be a valuable supplement to LoPbN, let alone a superior replacement, is belied by the fact that <s>no one has created</s> no one suggests that there exists a Cat that embraces all bio articles except thru its descendant subcats, and i am confident that no Cat (except hopefully Cat LP, which lacks subcats) exists that embraces <i>solely</i> bio articles thru its descendant subcats. In order to find a bio using its subject's name as the most definite information, you have to have people of all fields of endeavor, eras, and nationalities on the same alpha list, which we try to do via Cats only to the extent of all <i>living</i> people. The existence of LoPbN is no barrier to the creation of such a Cat, so either its creation would be not worth the improvement over LoPbN that it would provide, or all the other editors on WP are stupider or less responsible than the Del voters on this AfD, who are trying to destroy something that colleagues consider useful but not taking any action to create what they think should replace it. At the very least, it is inconceivable that LoPbN should be deleted without the creation first of an automated tool that can verify that every bio listed on LoPbN is tagged with (at least) a descendant of <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a>. (Ideally, those descendant Cats that do not consist overwhelmingly of bios should be detected, so that a <a href="../../../d/i/r/Directed_acyclic_graph.html" title="Directed acyclic graph">DAG</a> descended from Cat People can be searched, rather than all descendants of Cat People.)</li>
<li>The above list is not intended to be exhaustive.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>It is also important to mention that proposals for enhanced Cat features, that some argued would meet some of these needs, began being discussed soon after the introduction of Cats, and there has been no sign of motion toward those enhancements. (The reason may be despair abt making the Cat structure into a DAG, which is also a further reason to dislike using the current Cat system in place of LoPbN.)<br />

However, I'm really uncertain for a few reasons. First, the load time is intolerable. This is due to the many sublevels of templates. At least on the top few should be substed. Second, I think the list is lightly used, and thus lightly maintained. It will thus perennially stay incomplete. For this reason, I <s>tagged</s> <i>tried valiantly but failed due to timeouts to tag</i> it with {{<a href="../../../d/y/n/Template%7EDynamic_list_5af6.html" title="Template:Dynamic list">Dynamic list</a>}}; it might need additional disclaimers. Finally, this isn't the best format for such a project, but there's no better way to implement it on MediaWiki.

<li><b>Keep</b> - If editors are willing to maintain these pages (even if imperfectly), I find it problematical to force a more restrictive view of what type of indexing is useful in Wikipedia. I'm sure there are a lot (quite possibly the vast majority) of Wikipedia users who have never used (or found) these index pages, but for a minority - assuming whatever load problems there are can be fixed - they are presumably very useful. In short, this index is clearly the sort of thing that should be done by better categorization software and/or by a bot (using categories or other structured data). But the reality is that neither of those things exist at the moment. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 16:35, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>_ _ I did not lobby. I did make well-informed users on the topic aware of the situation of this long-standing resource, which BTW has withstood not one, but about a half-dozen previous deletion attempts, each ending in a lopsided Keep vote, explicitly or implicitly covering the tree as whole -- a fact that would have come out in more careful decisions to vote for deletion. IMO the support and contributions it has received in the past indicate a valuable resource at risk.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>_ _ The significance of the risk particularly struck me as calling for an alert because i became aware of the deletion only the next day when i received a talk-page msg, and probably would not have, before the 5 days expired, without such a msg. (I monitor the LoPbN-tree via {{<a href="../../../l/i/s/Template%7EList_of_people_by_name_exhaustive_page-index_%28sectioned%29_cedf.html" title="Template:List of people by name exhaustive page-index (sectioned)">List of people by name exhaustive page-index (sectioned)</a>}}, a dynamic list of something over 700 LoPbN-tree pages that does not include the "unmaintained" page that is so fully developed that virtually no one but deletion nominators needs to edit it, and that Tl also provides a much more convenient means of access to pages.) Others may be in a similar position -- in contrast to the possibility of holiday-bored AfD browsers finding the opportunity for a deletion-frenzy with an "absolutely humongous" target to rouse their blood. I think it would be foolish to advocate that deletion of large structures require AfD tagging every page, and outrageous to rule out a reasonable mechanism for alerting a reasonable number of those who would have been alerted by that measure. My messages seem to me to fulfill that reasonable mechanism. But if there is sufficient concern that i made a bad choice, it would be reasonable to disallow the 13 votes, and restart the 5-day clock from zero at the time when the nominator suitably places an AfD notice (roughly imitating the look and feel of the AfD template) on <a href="../../../v/p/_/WP%7EVP_dc2f.html" title="WP:VP">WP:VP</a>, which should include a high-profile notice of the disallowing of those votes and their caster's option of responding <i>to the VP notice</i> by recasting them. <i>However</i>, it should be expected that this would ensure that any future editor who <i>seeks</i> unfair "canvassing" advantages will organize it by EMail or other private media, instead of leaving the public record that my effort left.</dd>
<dd>_ _ While i drew the attention of those who had previously voted to their previous position, in presenting them a lk to their respective previous arguments, and described to some one basis of my concern, i asked no one to vote for retention nor to make their "weighing in" conditional on continuing to support retention. I will, within the next 12 hours, provide below a list of lks to those 14 edits by me, to make firsthand examination of my wording convenient.</dd>
<dd>_ _ It seems to me that the appropriateness of my action can probably be gauged to some extent by looking at the results of these messages to this doubtlessly quite admin-heavy group of 14: i left messages for 14 colleagues, of whom 10 responded only with (IIRC) sober responses here, 1 responded by echoing my holiday greeting, sending family news, and responding soberly here, and 3 made no response on this page or my talk page. (Let me be explicit: none of these 14 raised a concern here or to me about the propriety of my request to them.) To further answer the concern, i will ask those three to indicate here any procedural misgiving that played a role in keeping them for voting, and i will inform you which of them have saved edits since my posting -- since one doing so ensures their being notified to look at the msg (mine) on their respective talk page.</dd>
<dd>_ _ At this point, i think questioning the 13 on their talk pages (as opposed to via this page) would be an unreasonable disturbance, but of course that should not be up to me. I ask only that anyone who thinks they need to be interrogated discuss it here, and that that not be pursued without agreement on a plan for minimizing the disturbance of those of the 13 who <i>fail</i> to respond to this discussion.<br />

<dd>My message to a relatively new editor, who had taken enough care to ask well thot out questions on LoPbN stylistics.

<p>Careful readers will note some small errors in the statistics that i previously quoted from my hand tabulations without checking them against the records cited in this message.</p>
<p>I submit that the clear positions stated by those who previously voted should not be disregarded simply bcz they didn't happen to notice the capricious reopening of the closed debates, and that (with the possible exceptions of Eliyak and Chrislk02) the remaining editors i contacted are a good sampling of, and much fewer in number than, those who would have taken note of the AfD during its 5 days if it were legalistically posted on all 700+ pages whose deletion was requested. Eliyak &amp; Chrislk02, tho not typical, are better qualified than average to grasp the issues, and can only improve this process, in which the numbers are only a valuable guideline, with closing admins exhorted to consider them only in the context of the relative quality of the Keep and Del arguments.<br />

<dl>
<dd>== Notice of Process Inquiry re my msg to you, "New AfD on LoPbN" ==</dd>
<dd>_ _ A colleague has <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_people_by_name_%282nd_nomination%29_1ae2.html#.22Canvassing.22_Issue" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of people by name (2nd nomination)">questioned the wisdom and/or propriety</a> of my messages <a href="#New_AfD_on_LoPbN" title="">to you</a> and to 14 others, each a retention-voter in a <i>previous</i> LoPbN AfD and/or recently showing heavy interest in <a href="../../../l/o/p/LoPbN_8d81.html" title="LoPbN">LoPbN</a>. For the benefit of the eventual caller of the current AfD, and secondarily as it reflects on my individual behavior and judgement as a Wikipedian, i have undertaken to place this 2nd message before you and the three others who have not acknowledged my respective earlier msgs to you-all.</dd>
<dd>_ _ I defended my actions in part by asserting the responses to my talk-page messages do not support misgivings on the part of those recipients, while admitting that the non-responding recipients might have been inhibited from responding at least in part by just such misgivings. At my own initiative, i am making this second contact to ensure that at least knowledge of the process question informs your choice to remain silent or comment on the AfD subpage.</dd>
<dd>_ _ The AfD nomination is stamped 15:44, 31 December 2006; 5x24 hours expires at 15:44, 5 January 2007, approximately (as i post this on the AfD sub-page) whoops, an hour ago, with closer attention of course more likely after midnite UTC, 8 hours hence. I assume potential closers will give it <i>at least</i> a full day from now if any of you have not saved edits between now and then.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It is interesting to note that polar-opposite arguments are given by delete proponents, i.e., the list is too bulky, and it also does not include enough of the names. --<a href="../../../s/l/y/User%7ESlyguy_9d30.html" title="User:Slyguy">Slyguy</a> 21:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ironically, the problems are not diametrically opposed, and hence can both be true. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 21:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>_ _ I stretch the don't-further-edit rule here, by posting my last few hour's work, that i completed as nae' sent me notice of calling the AfD as Keep. I'll try to compile the views here in the <a href="../../../l/o/p/Talk%7ELoPbN_55c3.html" title="Talk:LoPbN">Talk:LoPbN</a> structure.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>_ _ Alvestrand has indeed so proven. The primary barriers to it that are currently visible to me are
<ol>
<li>the plethora of unmaintained <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a> tags, whose effect can be observed e.g. among 10 entries for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Living_people&amp;from=Jonat" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Living_people&amp;from=Jonat" rel="nofollow">Jonathons</a> (altho i cannot find other examples that i thot i recalled, suggesting that someone's systematic work against this problem has had at least a temporary success),</li>
<li>the info that probably needs to be manually added to any software for traversing the <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a> tree, in light of descendants of it that are not bio articles</li>
<li>perhaps the likelihood of cycles that would be encountered in attempting to traverse <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a> as if it were a <a href="../../../d/i/r/Directed_acyclic_graph.html" title="Directed acyclic graph">DAG</a>.</li>

<dd>(I assume that the recent introductions of {{<a href="../../../l/o/p/Template%7ELoPbN_Entry_0dd0.html" title="Template:LoPbN Entry">LoPbN Entry</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDeln_trk_list_entry_fbca.html" title="Template:Deln trk list entry">Deln trk list entry</a>}}, and at least one family of permanently rare Tls could be handled as a series of <a href="../../../s/m/o/SMOP_3e2d.html" title="SMOP">SMOPs</a> using a registry of LoPbN-entry Tls.)</dd>
<dd>_ _ Another contributor above mentioned {{<a href="../../../p/e/r/Template%7EPersondata_2dda.html" title="Template:Persondata">Persondata</a>}}, potential enhanced versions of which i regard as
<ol>
<li>a potential substitute for explicit Cat tags for any <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a>-descendant Cat, and</li>
<li>close to a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_mover.html" title="Prime mover">prime mover</a> for the automatic generation of a resource that <i>could</i> be indistinguishable, by non-editors, from the current LoPbN. Note that this does <i>not</i> contradict Alv's deprecation of a "completely automatic" scheme: my proposal is for moving the manual work from one entry (or in some cases several entries) the central list to the individual bio's Persondata markup. Nor does it have to imply abolition of LoPbN rdlks, even tho they by definition have no Persondata markup. (It would also need
<ol>
<li>a small database of "sounds similar to" and "may sound identical to" relationships among surnames and perhaps given names, and</li>
<li>another of more complicated relationships re transliteration or (at least) Mandarin and Cantonese pronunciations of the same Chinese character, and the variety of established romanizations of each, such as i have hinted at for the name <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li_%28%E6%9D%8E%29.html" title="Li (李)">Li (李)</a> in <a href="../../../n/a/m/List_of_people_by_name%7E_name_Li_758b.html#People_named_Li" title="List of people by name: name Li">List of people by name: name Li#People named Li</a> (which should in due time mention the character, if not w/ a lk):

</li>
<li>perhaps, either permanently or as an interim measure, structural information, analogous to that about pages that is implicit in the layout of {{<a href="../../../l/i/s/Template%7EList_of_people_by_name_exhaustive_page-index_%28sectioned%29_cedf.html" title="Template:List of people by name exhaustive page-index (sectioned)">List of people by name exhaustive page-index (sectioned)</a>}}, but covering section and (if used, as i advocate) multi-level bullet-lists as well.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>a solution (applicable for bios only), to the non-bio-descendant &amp; cycle problems mentioned above,</li>
<li>an equally natural vehicle for serving, for bios, the purpose of the perpetual <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fata_Morgana_%28mirage%29_01d3.html" title="Fata Morgana (mirage)">fata morgana</a> of a flat view of a category's descendants (which i suspect reflects the apparently intractable problem of keeping the Cats within the specs of a DAG): subject to standardization LoPbN of nationality and occupational terminology (presently diffident but often visible), and tightening up slightly the vital-stats format, maintenance such as deciding that a particular person has only three causes of notability rather than five could remove them from 3 lists each for their birth and death years and decades, by nationality and among all nationalities. I hasten to add that some of these lists would correspond to Cats without subCats, so that the list would offer no advantage over the Cats, and others would never or seldom be used; by generating the various lists (and single-page or single-screen portions of lists) on demand (and caching the results under discard-<a href="../../../l/r/u/LRU_875e.html" title="LRU">LRU</a> discipline), we would extend the powerful principle that WP is not paper by providing access to information that is not only not occupying paper, but not occupying storage dedicated to it.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> With due respect to the admirable goals of this organization, nothing in the article asserts notability (potential speedy per A7). I did get a lot of hits on google, but it is mired in a lot of confusing subjects with a similar name (such as anti-slavery organizations dating to the US Civil War). <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 17:18, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Notability is demonstrated by the uniqueness, critical value, and utility of this article. Google hits is a rather inaccurate method of determining whether or not something is notable. For example&#160;: there are many hits for editor-reviewed articles of Britney Spears - yet the value of this information for purposes of improving humanity's knowledge base is limited. Also, BLTC Research is a sister site of the Abolitionist Society, as well as Hedweb, and David Pearce is it's cofounder.67.189.71.183 18:37, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete without prejudice</b> The creator of the article referenced <a href="http://www.utilitarianism.com/biotech.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.utilitarianism.com/biotech.html" rel="nofollow">[78]</a>, where "abolitionism", "abolitionist" and "the abolitionist project" is mentioned. The article may cover a legitimate subject, however, it conflicts with the Abolition Society of the 18th Century, and the understanding of the use of <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abolitionist.html" title="Abolitionist">Abolitionist</a> without referring a researcher to the possibility of that definition. The title "Abolitionist Society" differs from the lead definition, "abolitionism". The article should be, at least, rewritten and the title changed by renaming or adding a qualifier.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> there are many definitions for a single term. Abolitionism is a philosophy - too late to change the name of it or the Abolitionist Society, just have to do with making messy looking addendums to let people know that there are multiple pages for the same term.67.189.71.183 18:34, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> there is only one 'Abolitionist Society' in existance today - which also happens to rank #1 in google search the rest use qualifiers like "Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society". the abolitionism page does not cover the Abolitionist Society or the meaning of Abolitionism that it promotes. how do you determine if it's a '<b>real'</b> philosophy?</li>

<li><b>Response</b> As I said, the article in its present form isn't solely about the Society, nor even very much about it, but rather it appears as an attempt to define the philosophy. The problem comes with renaming it to the more appropriate "abolitionism". An alternative would be to make it clearly about the society, but then I'd expect it to do less well in the current deletion debate. As for whether it's "real", I mean to say if it's not a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> (see <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>), and I don't attempt to answer that question either way&#160;;) – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup><i>(</i><a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a><i>)</i></sup> 18:53, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> Good for you as moderator I guess...&#160;;) The perception of attempt is irrelevant. Relative 'newness' to determine whether or not it is a real philosophy - How much time is your criteria for when something becomes a neologism? Clearly there is unique utility - though the content needs to be improved - why not spend your time there instead?

<li><b>Comment</b> "Generally speaking, neologisms should be avoided in articles because they may not be well understood, may not be clearly definable, and may even have different meanings to different people." - from the WP:NEO article. So we are trying to promote clarity of information - however, these issues are easily resolved with the articles content or by making additions to its content.67.189.71.183 19:20, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>How famous does a band have to be in order to merit an article? They released a CD on a record label, and it got reviewed by third parties. Is this not enough? <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkoosh_95d4.html" title="User:Skoosh">skoosh</a> [[User_talk:Skoosh|(háblame)]] 17:19, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> See <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. Fame is subjective, but whether they've been noted by the media and/or the charts isn't. This one might be a keeper, might be notable--the article includes one independant music review. Unfortunately their name gets an enormous number of google hits because it is used in a lot of other places. Perhaps someone familiar with the band could provide an additional reference, otherwise it probably isn't going to meet <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>.
<ul>
<li>That's exactly why it's so hard to find information on this band via search engines (excluding the term "bridge" seems to help). In fact, even the term <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terabithia.html" title="Terabithia">Terabithia</a> in Wikipedia just redirects to the article on the novel. Part of my motivation for writing the article, in fact, was to attract casual editors who could add something I don't already know. Thanks for the link to <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. At this point, I'm not sure if this band is notable enough to have an article either, but here's <a href="http://www.splendidezine.com/reviews/nov-2-98/terabithia.html" class="external text" title="http://www.splendidezine.com/reviews/nov-2-98/terabithia.html" rel="nofollow">another short online review</a>, for what it's worth.

<ul>
<li>Given that you found two independant reviews I'd say they have a tenuous grip on notability. As far as I can tell, both references come from independant, non-personal sources with some editorial control, which is the standard for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. That should be added as a reference in the article. I'll put down a weak keep. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 22:34, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - we recently deleted a number of categories for "heroes," "villains," "anti-heroes" and the like on the grounds that inclusion was too subjective. A listing of anti-heroes suffers the same problems as a category for them, and has the additional problems of incompleteness and maintainability. See also the Afd for List of fictional heroes a little up the page. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:29, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - It isn't subjective because we can use secondary sources who identify the characters in the list as anti-heroes. Seems like a good article that can be made even better. I'd like to see more sourcing to scholarly literature that talks about some of these characters in the context of anti-herodom. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 17:55, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I'd agree, if not for the policy that states that <b>there must be a verifiable source confirming that the character is an antihero</b>. There <i>have</i> been cases where users randomly add their favorite characters but I and other editors have worked hard to keep them out of it and their edits are usually reverted the same day. A category which cannot verify if the articles are representative is not the same as a list with legit, cited sources.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 18:38, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is different from the list of fictional heroes. Anti-heros are fairly easy to determine and only occur in particular genres of fiction. This can be a useful list. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 18:44, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The list is verified (every example has at least one reliable source) and is strictly monitored (by me and others) to ensure it remains as such, rather than become unmanageable or full of POV and OR as has happened with previous versions of the list and with the categories. And incompleteness is hardly reason to delete an article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMidnighters_8ade.html" title="User:TheMidnighters">TM</a> 18:57, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as the article is sourced with scholars which identify the characters as antiheroes the subjectivity issue is eliminated by the presence of a body of professional opinion establishing that said characters fit the form. If someone really has a problem with the list as it is named. Perhaps rename it to List of Characters Argued to Be Anti-heroes or something. Though I find that a bit weasel worded myself. — <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalerin_2c97.html" title="User:Falerin">Falerin</a><sup>&lt;<a href="../../../f/a/l/User_talk%7EFalerin_31b4.html" title="User talk:Falerin"><b>talk</b></a>&gt;,&lt;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Falerin_21b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Falerin"><b>contrib</b></a>&gt;</sup> 19:29, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> This article is carefully referenced and policed by numerous editors. OR is rejected. POV is rejected.

<li>Regarding the rumor thing, if you simply LOOK on the page that I put as a source, you can read everything on that page. I don't see why this person <i>can't</i> be notable. He made one of the biggest MMORPG's to date, with thousands and thousands of players. He's an interesting person, and I felt that it would be nice to inform people about him, since not much is commonly known. ~ <a href="../../../r/i/h/User%7ERih29_7752.html" title="User:Rih29">rih29</a> 00:31, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Although his notability has been questioned in the past, the fact that he is indeed the creator of one of the largest websites on the Internet (Alexa WT ranking: 819) definitely gives him notability. Besides being a popular website, it's one of the leading MMORPG's of our day, and with millions of people playing the game, I think that makes him and his creation unique. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 18:47, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

If a student union is notable at all, notability needs to be demonstrated here as per the standards - and in this case we're not seeing notability being demonstrated. Please also note that, per my replacement of the removed afdanons template, this is not a tally vote, this is a concensus, and this requires a good argument.

<li><b>Delete</b> I had been doubtful of the sheer existence of this term in the discussion for Qi lolita, and while I still maintain no such thing as "Qi lolita" or anything related exists in Japanese, I did find "和ロリ" or Wa-rori (Wa-loli) in the ja.wiki <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ロリータ・ファッション" class="external text" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ロリータ・ファッション" rel="nofollow">Lolita fashion article</a> under the heading "Related fashion". Now, this is, per said article, a related fashion statement, so not necessarily to be considered part of the Lolita genre even with the name that would suggest so. Further on, even if it is included in the ja.wiki article, this doesn't necessarily mean it's not an unnotable neologism. Searching in google with the term 和ロリ gives <a href="http://www.google.si/search?hl=sl&amp;q=%E5%92%8C%E3%83%AD%E3%83%AA&amp;btnG=Iskanje+Google&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.si/search?hl=sl&amp;q=%E5%92%8C%E3%83%AD%E3%83%AA&amp;btnG=Iskanje+Google&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">about 15000 hits</a> on text and <a href="http://images.google.si/images?hl=sl&amp;q=%E5%92%8C%E3%83%AD%E3%83%AA&amp;btnG=Iskanje+Google&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi" class="external text" title="http://images.google.si/images?hl=sl&amp;q=%E5%92%8C%E3%83%AD%E3%83%AA&amp;btnG=Iskanje+Google&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi" rel="nofollow">about 100</a> picture hits.

<p>Poorly-defined list article (i.e. what exactly is meant by the term "building" the fourth wall?) with potential original research. Most of the examples can already be described in more clearly-defined articles such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fiction_that_breaks_the_fourth_wall.html" title="List of fiction that breaks the fourth wall">List of fiction that breaks the fourth wall</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metafiction.html" title="Metafiction">metafiction</a>, etc. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStratadrake_113f.html" title="User:Stratadrake">Stratadrake</a> 19:45, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>My own vote is, of course, a <b>delete</b>. When I think about it, the fourth wall is an inherent characteristic of any and all fiction; it's impossible to "build" the fourth wall per sé because the fourth wall is <i>already there</i>; it can only be respected, or broken. And using a <i>fictional</i> fourth wall as a plot element does not actually constitute breaking the fourth wall, but <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metafiction.html" title="Metafiction">metafiction</a> instead. --<i><a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStratadrake_113f.html" title="User:Stratadrake">Stratadrake</a> 19:54, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</i></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this. Breaking the fourth wall is a known dramatic concept, building it is not and I would challenge you to find reliable sources for either the concept or the inclusion of any given entry. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 19:56, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Is this actually an established term in literary analysis or critisism? As the list stands, it just appears to mean "List of fiction with an explicit narrator", which would seem to include all the Sherlock Holmes books (purportedly written by Dr Watson), "The Lord of the Rings" (purportedly written by Frodo), etc etc. Without a definition that doesn't include 95% of all fiction, this list is unmaintainable. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 20:19, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Principality of Freedonia, an internet nation based on libertarian ideals, hopes to set up a physical state, either on&#160;:Norfolk Island - if the Australian Government agrees to sell it - or in a remote part of Somalia.</dd>
</dl>
<p>...</p>
<dl>
<dd>More than 260 people are involved in Freedonia, according to its leaders.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Founder, Texan John Kyle - who prefers to be known as Prince John I - claims to be involved in negotiations with the Sultan of Awdal in Somaliland with the intention of setting up a Libertarian nation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kyle says his nation is still some years away from becoming reality. "The next thing to do is send an emissary to North Africa and Pitcairn and to consider fundraising and making preparations," he says. "We're about five years off."</dd>

<dd>Even the "unstable" Somalis appear to have become leery of the Freedonians, exemplifying the difficulties internet-based nations have in getting off the ground. When The Australian spoke to a source close to the Sultan of Awdal, there was a swift denial of any links with the libertarians of Freedonia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The source says the Sultan agreed to the deal after a Somali Freeport representative, Ethiopia-based Flory Barnabas, made an approach.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Sultan Ibrahim and elders of Awdal had no idea about the connection between these groups," the source says. "When I called today, the Sultan and rest of the elders were surprised.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> There seems to be some question about the <i>New York Times</i> article from May of 2000. In an 1114-word article, there are just 120 words on Freedonia, most of which are about the kid who started it:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>THE PRINCIPALITY OF FREEDONIA: www .freedonia.org A country of libertarian leanings, Freedonia has very little connection with the Marx Brothers' fictional country of the same name. Its leader, John Alexander Kayle, is a student at Babson College in Massachusetts. He is studying for a degree in investment finance and professes a fondness for the writings of Thomas Jefferson and Ayn Rand. Mr. Kayle, who uses the screen name John I, and his fellow Freedonians hope to purchase a chunk of territory in Somaliland and establish a libertarian enclave. Notwithstanding its homelessness, Freedonia has minted its own money (silver) and even written a national anthem that has this refrain: <i>Oh, Freedonia, Freedonia the land that saves, Freedonians never shall be slaves.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My opinion is that this does not make the micronation notable. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 15:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Wired article also has just one graf on these guys, with the bulk on <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talossa.html" title="Talossa">Talossa</a> (whom the Freedonia site refers to as "imaginary," which may be Freedonian for "not notable"). The Der Spiegel article is behind a wall, unfortunately. But the real reason I'm commenting is this: I don't buy the riots/deaths story at all. It's mentioned on the Freedonia site, and in that one English-language Somali publication that only says that the Freedonia issue is "believed" to be the reason behind the riots, but then refers to the Freedonia project as a fake. Is there a better source for this particular story? I'm pressing that point because that claim in the article more than any other bit sent my delete-o-meter to red (per <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>). | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 15:56, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well the article posted above from The Australian at a minimum confirms that Freedonia representatives were in contact with the Sultan. It would be appropriate to note that most of the details come from Freedonia itself, but I don't see why that means the article should be deleted. I think the "fake" bit was the Somalis' impression of Freedonia people as a group of pranksters playing a joke on a tiny country rather than a serious organization looking for terrority. Even if it is just a joke, it's a notable joke which merits inclusion in the encyclopedia. <span style="color: #F06A0F">–</span><small><span style="border: 1px solid #F06A0F"><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#F06A0F">&#160;Anþony&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User_talk%7EAn%C3%BEony_4ae4.html" title="User talk:Anþony"><span style="background-color:#F06A0F; color:white">&#160;talk&#160;</span></a></span></small> 17:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I suppose it's a question of what constitutes notability. I see passing mentions in articles about other, more notable micronations.

<dd>I have a hard time understanding how you can keep referring to this as <i>joke-like nature of the project</i> despite the well documented fact that their very real attempt to purchase land on which to found an actual physical independent micronation was sufficiently real that it resulted in a riot and fatalities. That is the most serious real-world incident involving any micronation project in the 20th century. Despite the fact that it admittedly <i>started</i> as someone's made-up project while in school, Freedonia <i>clearly</i> moved beyond that into having very real and serious real-world activities. That they went nowhere ultimately is not in dispute - but their active pursuit is well documented and in a sense notorious. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 19:27, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That bit of rhetoric does not address the very real question of whether the riots or fatalities ever took place. It's just a claim by the Freedonia founders, picked up by one news outlet none of us had ever heard of which in the same blurb referred to the Freedonia project as "fake." We've seen no mentions of it in reliable news sources, no photographs of the riots - nothing. There's no actual evidence that the riots or fatalities actually took place, or even if they did, that they had anything to do with Freedonia. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 20:06, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You can't go around just rejecting sources and saying "You haven't verified this!". They're reliable by WP standards. You have provided no referenced information claiming that those sources or events are bogus. All you have is your opinion and suspicion. Those aren't valid reasons for deleting an article. Evidence and references are - and we've got them reliably cited now. If someone's pulling a megascale media hoax on all of us then they've done so across a very wide array of otherwise completely unrelated sources. The burden of proof is on you to show that there's something suspicious about the sources. You keep claiming I'm attacking you instead of the question - that's because you've stopped attacking the article's former lack of sources, and now are attacking the sources themselves. You can't do that.

<dd>Mr. Poole, neither of your links mentions Freedonia at all.

<dl>
<dd>The multiple sources you've already been directed to are perfectly "bona fide" as far as Wikipedia is concerned. They show that people associated with Freedonia travelled to Awdal, had discussions with clan and/or govt officials there, and that after those people were deported, public disaffection resulted in the shooting death of a protester. Incidents of a similar unfortunate nature occur throughout the world daily. Few, if any of them are reported in any mainstream media outlet. On the balance of probabilities the events described in the article took place. The fact the New York Times or Fox News didn't report doesn't make them any less real or verifiable. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 02:10, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You've pointed me to two sources. One is the Freedonia site itself, which does not qualify as a reliable source. The other is apparently the site of a newspaper in Somaliland, which referred to Freedonia as "fake" - so if we're going to accept it as a reliable source, then that's a clear motion for deletion of this article. Is that what you're saying? And is there some other source that indicates that the Freedonia visit to Somaliland led to a riot? Because right now I count ONE. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 03:50, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've personally pointed you to 2 sources, <i>neither</i> of which is the Freedonia site, yet both of which support assertions made on that site. Others here have pointed you to other references, including one above in the national Australian broadsheet daily which also plainly support those assertions. It is for you to demonstrate how being described as "fake" is a "clear motion for deletion". Continuing to claim that there are no reliable sources is symptomatic of disingenuity, wilful deception or outright stupidity.

<dd>Stunning display of personal attacks, Mr. Poole. You pointed to one source, <i>The Republican</i>, the accuracy of which I have questioned; the only connection made between Freedonia and the demonstration is unsourced ("The demonstration was believed to have been triggered by a government decision to deport two foreigners who arrived in Borama recently..." - believed by whom?). The other source you gave (the obit of the Dutch libertarian) never mentioned Freedonia at all. The Australian article, printed in full above, doesn't mention riots or fatalities, nor does the paragraph in the NY Times. There is no source other than the Republican article and the Freedonia Website (which isn't reliable, per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Self-published_sources" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Self-published_sources</a>) that verifies these alleged riots or fatalities. Your ardor to defend a micronation like your own is admirable, but the verification of these alleged riots and fatalities is sorely lacking, and if they are part of the argument for notability, I take issue with it. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 05:45, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hang on, MrDarcy.

<dd>Oh, I agree with that. I still don't see notability, but the fact that the best reliable source we have on the project's efforts in Somaliland refers to it as a fake is rather telling to me.

<dd>OK, first off, it should be pointed out that all of the reputable media articles mentioning Freedonia -- including The Australian article, the Wired article, the New York Times article, and the Santa Cruz Metro article -- were printed prior to the December 2000-January 2001 trip to Somaliland, so it's pretty obvious why they wouldn't mention the trip. For that matter, that I can name that many reputable media articles mentioning Freedonia at all should be sufficient to prove notability.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's clear from several sources that Jim Davidson and Michael Van Motten really did travel to Somaliland and spoke with local authorities. The Van Motten obit doesn't mention Freedonia because the men weren't actually involved with Freedonia. Freedonia claims that the Somalis mistakenly associated the men with Freedonia because their website made reference to Awdal as a potential location. I would guess that the website likely mentioned Davidson by name since he was actively promoting the region via the Internet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>According to The Republican and The Australian, the Somalis had a very low opinion of Freedonia. They thought it was a sham/hoax/fraud/fake, whatever. That has nothing to do with notability here, but the fact that they formed an opinion on Freedonia at all is proof they were aware of the group.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Given that the Somalis were already suspicious of Freedonia, this last bit makes sense, but honestly can only be attributed to The Republican and Freedonia itself: The two men were (erroneously) associated with Freedonia and deported, resulting in a protest which was put down with lethal force. It would be entirely appropriate to note that the claim originates from Freedonia and can only be confirmed by a small Somali newspaper. <span style="color: #F06A0F">–</span><small><span style="border: 1px solid #F06A0F"><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#F06A0F">&#160;Anþony&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User_talk%7EAn%C3%BEony_4ae4.html" title="User talk:Anþony"><span style="background-color:#F06A0F; color:white">&#160;talk&#160;</span></a></span></small> 18:36, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Multiple people writing about all sorts of things spend ink mentioning stuff that WP rightly doesn't bother with. (Consider all the ink devoted to the minutiae of soap operas, the moral implications of televised "wardrobe malfunctions" [was that the phrase?], etc.) I was willing to be persuaded that "Freedonia" is notable as "micronations" go (which is nanonotability, as "micronations" are merely private fantasies fueled by <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_Bullshit_ab8a.html" title="On Bullshit">bullshit</a>). MrDarcy is leading me to doubt even this negligible claim. But if there is indeed something to it, well, "Freedonia" can get its own sentence or even little paragraph within the article on micronations. (To me, the potential significance of Freedonia is that a young Youessian would unwittingly use <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedonia.html" title="Freedonia">this staunchly Marxist term</a> for his "libertarian" fantasy and yet have even a tiny number of other Youessians look at it with straight faces.

Web references or any references even if they are realted to the perpetrators of the "creation" are still notable and reliable enough for an encyclopedic article especially if they are published and have been recognised worldwide. This nomination is done in bad taste, and I feel once again a down pour of "deletionism" as at the heart of this nomination with disregard for the truth and facts behind this article. Perhaps this article needs more work, but careless deletionism is not justified simply because the majority of people voting refer to it being "non-notable" which in my opnion is a bunch of garbage.

<li><b>Delete</b> I have mixed fee about his article. As I mention on Talk:10:08, I strongly doubt many of the claims that are made here. On the other hand, the subject of how watch hands show up on advertising has been around for a very long time, I gave a reference from 1922 on the talk page. There *are* many facts that can be verified, such as not obstructing the logo or the date window commonly found at the 3:00 position. Unfortunately, some of the other "facts", such as most ads use 10:08, can be verified to be incorrect. I could see this article being cleaned up and made into something that could be kept, but I don't see much evidence that this will happen. <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 21:26, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I immediately checked the catalogues in the house (yes, yes, WP:OR), and noticed that all the Timexes were set to 1:50, but all the non-Timexes were set to 10:10. I idly wondered if perhaps Timex had somehow "trademarked" ten-to-two in visual ads.

It is clear to me that this is a notable subject that could have verifiable facts documented about it. Those facts could include such things as people having the impression that there is "one" time that all watch manufactures use for all advertising for all of history, and the misunderstanding that people may have with the relation to that time to famous people dieing. Other facts include major watch manufacturers stating that the reason they use a given time is so that the hands won't obscure important logos and names. What is also somewhat clear to me is that this article doesn't currently meet those standards and I don't think it is likely that anyone will put the effort into fixing it. <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 17:21, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I have an unusual and quite amusing problem. I "know" that people who sell analogue watches set them to specific times. I know this from firsthand experience, because I once had a job that involved (amongst other things) adjusting the positions of the hands on watches being displayed for sale. But I cannot immediately give you a source for this, because the knowledge was imparted by word of mouth. Wikipedia articles must not be based upon the sole words of pseudonymous editors.

I'm going to hunt for some sources, but given what sources we <i>already have</i> I'm currently at <b>weak keep</b> with the strong provisio that the article requires a major rewrite to remove the unsourced speculation and hypothesising and to include the material from the Elgin source, and almost certainly renaming (to something like watch times in advertisements) as well.</p>

<p>I nominated this article because it belongs either on Wiktionary or as a small section on the Film page. It's basically a short definition that I don't feel could be expanded further. I am also submitting <a href="../../../a/b/o/Above_the_line_%28film_production%29.html" title="Above the line (film production)">Above the line (film production)</a> for the same reasons. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 21:41, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> "Above the line" as dicdef. <b>Weak Keep</b> and <b>Rename</b> to Below The Line (magazine) on "Below the line" - the magazine has the potential to be notable, at least. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 22:26, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I've added more clarification to the different jobs that fall under "Below the Line" and the distinction between ATL and BTL is very important in film budgeting. Also the ATL deletion box links back to here; there is no deletion page for it. But I'm also for <b>keeping</b> the ATL page. I've added more clarification to it and again it's important for the people that will actually be searching for it. Joey 23:26, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep <s>both</s> one</b> - The article should be expanded (and not only for costs, but also for crew classification). The term is well know so it should be possible to expand with good material. <s>Eventually</s> <b>merge</b> <a href="../../../b/e/l/Below_the_line_%28film_production%29.html" title="Below the line (film production)">Below the line (film production)</a> into <a href="../../../a/b/o/Above_the_line_%28film_production%29.html" title="Above the line (film production)">Above the line (film production)</a>.

<li><b>Merge</b> I think I agree that these terms don't necessarily need their own articles; as important as they are, there isn't much more to say. There is actually an article on <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_budgeting.html" title="Film budgeting">Film budgeting</a> which would be the perfect home, and a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Production_budget.html" title="Production budget">Production budget</a> stub which references ATL and BTL could be merged too. There are several similar articles/stubs in Category:Film and video terminology; some are deserving of their own articles but perhaps others may be merged into other pages. The list <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motion_picture_terminology.html" title="Motion picture terminology">Motion picture terminology</a> is a place to start. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRhani_baa1.html" title="User:TheRhani">TheRhani</a> 02:52, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b> - ATL and BTL is not only about budget. I use it also for notability in AfD: BTL (technical and artistic crew) are per se n.n., ATL people needs more checks (an awarded film "creates" notability of some ATL). So merge BTL into ATL, but keep one! --<a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECate_0f06.html" title="User:Cate">Cate</a> | <sub><a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECate_6c8d.html" title="User talk:Cate">Talk</a></sub> 10:31, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

(Full professors at research universities well into their careers often have h numbers in the 20s or higher). <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabricationary_b588.html" title="User:Fabricationary">Fabricationary</a> 23:05, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>use rational criteria</b> The source for scientific articles by a physician is PubMed. The way authors are listed there is by name and initials, so he is "Schultz BC" He has written 11 articles listed there, one in Journal of the American Medical Association; the latest in 1998. His book was published in 1985 and it is therefore not surprising that almost all the entries in Google were used book dealers. The H-number generator works with Google Scholar, and more than half of Google Scholar's content is from 2000+, while all his articles were earlier. But in any case the first step is to use the name in the standard format for the field, and if you do the h-number is 2, not zero. (There is no magic number, and no intelligent database.) He is an associate professor in a major university, but it's an associate <i>clinical</i> professor, which is a distinction most medical specialists get with time.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>But adding all of this up, it does not amount to notability in a general sense, though he may well be notable among Chicago area dermatologists.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article needs improvement, but the move to delete is misguided. This band is well-established and popular in Nordic Europe, an integral part of the gothic/symphonic metal scene thriving there. Appropriate Google and established rock reference searches will easily confirm this. I accept that appropriate references need to be added, and given enough time either myself or another editor will add them. This is the third time I have had to defend an article from individuals ignorant of a band and the genre with which they are associated. If these AfDs were raised by those knowledgeable of the field, in this case Symphonic Metal, this would be a reasonable debate, but there is a flaw in the system that allows articles to be removed on the initiative of people who know nothing about the associated genre or anything musical that goes on outside of North America. In short, I resent having to defend knowledge against the unknowledgeable (in the field concerned). I believe that the upgrading of an article, (which is certainly needed in this case) and proving beyond reasonable doubt its worth to the layman should not be to a deadline after which the article is removed. In my last two experiences, justice and the preservation of knowledge triumphed over ignorance, and I hope that experience is repeated with this article, because this is what is at stake. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeadshaker_dad8.html" title="User:Headshaker">Headshaker</a> 07:00, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have read the "And The Band Played On" section and found it disturbing if not sinister. Is its author seriously suggesting that even if a band makes the cover of Rolling Stone, they would be excluded from Wikipedia because they pushed their luck before they got famous? Would that not make Wikipedia itself vain and arrogant? I would argue that the objective of the enterprise is the preservation of knowledge. If that principle is sacrificed to make a point then mindless bureaucracy has triumphed over reason. Returning to the matter in hand, I will address each "point" in turn:
<ol>
<li>The absence of a Major label deal or prolific discography are not the sole criteria: extent of fanbase is also important. Given time it can be demonstrated that this band has a significant European fanbase and therefore are worthy of inclusion.</li>
<li>Symphonic Metal specifically and the European metal scene generally is <b>not</b> a "minor regional sungenre". Regional yes, but a multi-million dollar regional industry with a massive fanbase. Metal in general is mainstream in Northern Europe. Some knowledge of it <b>is</b> required in order to make a fair judgement of an individual band's significance within it.</li>
<li>Nemesea has had considerable coverage from the regional rock media of Northern Europe. Given enough time, that can be demonstrated. The AfD came to my attention only 24 hours ago.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Finally to point out that I have no direct interest in Nemesea, and only have one of their tracks. I have however in a relatively short time learned much about the metal scene in Northern Europe in general and Symphonic Metal in particular, so I know about that of which I speak. Proof will be forthcoming, but I resent having to produce it (again!) just because some individuals in North America know nothing about a scene thriving far from their shores. I am also passionate about the proliferation and defence of knowledge. I plead that a travesty of justice is in danger of being perpetrated. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeadshaker_dad8.html" title="User:Headshaker">Headshaker</a> (<a href="../../../h/e/a/User_talk%7EHeadshaker_a207.html" title="User talk:Headshaker">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Headshaker_4916.html" title="Special:Contributions/Headshaker">contribs</a>) 19:54, 1 January 2007.</small>

<li>I don't think that's what the article is suggesting - it's pointing at a possible path that the article can take if it keeps popping up. I mean, if this were 20 years ago and you had (say) <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toad_The_Wet_Sprocket_7f70.html" title="Toad The Wet Sprocket">Toad The Wet Sprocket</a>, if I may name one amongst millions of examples, they would possibly have been rejected before 1991, when their third album (Fear) was released - or possibly later, when it went gold. Point being, local notability doesn't work unfortunately, and thinking it would may get the article killed if they do become popular enough for Rolling Stone. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 06:22, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you for trying to explain, but by your own last sentence, the cumulative effect is that a band making the cover of Rolling Stone would not have its own article. That is just plain wrong. I know the significance of Toad The Wet Sprocket and as part of a new movement it would also have been wrong if they had been excluded, gold album or not. Regarding "local notability", in the case of Nemesea, we are not talking about a few bier kellers in Amsterdam, but a fanbase across Northern Europe. --<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeadshaker_dad8.html" title="User:Headshaker">Headshaker</a> 07:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I have added some references to the Nemesea article as external links and divided them into two sections. The first is "band-sponsored", ie endorsed by the band. The second section consists of references to the band from independent sources such as online magazines.

<li>It is very hard for me to respond to most of the above points because I simply can't understand them. Plain English please! I did get the NPA bit, to which the short answer is that my remark that people moving to delete this article are uninformed is not a personal attack but a statement of fact. Unless any of them can tell me that they actually know about the European metal/goth scene, it is perfectly valid for me to question their credibility in attacking articles related to it. If I had accused them of being uninformed generally (which I clearly wasn't) that <b>would</b> have been out of order. If anything <b>they</b> are out of order for failing to assume my good faith. I defend the article out of a sense of right and wrong, not from any personal stake. As a matter of personal morality as opposed to Wikipedia policy dogma, I would never move to delete bands just because I had never heard of them, particularly if relating to whole genres and (major!) regional scenes of which I was previously unaware. On the contrary, I would feel gladdened that I had learned something I didn't know before. I believe passionately in defending knowledge and people's access to it, and I am well within the bounds of politeness and Wikipedia policy to point out that in this case, in the eyes of any reasonable neutral, those judging this article as not worth knowing do not have the credibility to do so.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeadshaker_dad8.html" title="User:Headshaker">Headshaker</a> 20:43, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Having had a good night's sleep, I went back to the Weregerbil's arguments to see if I could make more sense of them with a fresh mind. It was still very hard to read (which is not a personal attack but a statement of fact), but I have the following counter-points to make:
<ol>
<li>In the limited time I have had available I have included neutral recognised information sources in the external links to back up the article, so I do not agree that I have offered nothing towards criteria for inclusion.</li>
<li>The fact that the band are established and well-known within the field of European gothic/symphonic metal <b>is</b> a valid point to make. Researchers into this genre would want to know who the established bands were.</li>
<li>It is most definitely <b>not</b> valid to counter arguments I never actually used. I have <b>never</b> at any point said that <b>I liked</b> the band. On the contrary, I have already stated that I only had one of their tracks in my possession.</li>
<li>Not only are policies quoted inappropriately, but in Wikipedia policy itself, in the same set of guidelines as I LIKE IT, it also clearly states that simply quoting policy is not a valid argument, unless it is properly backed up with how the policy is breached.</li>
<li>Instead of asking ME to chase round looking up all these misused policy articles in order to counter the points, it would have been more useful to neutrals viewing this argument if the relevant passages had been quoted directly here. I couldn't even find the part that started "Also, please bear in mind..."--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeadshaker_dad8.html" title="User:Headshaker">Headshaker</a> 06:30, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
