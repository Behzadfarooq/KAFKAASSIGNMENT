<dd>Please explain, why do we have a category called <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_culture_6e1a.html" title="Category:Wikipedia culture">Category:Wikipedia_culture</a>? Isn't it there so that wikipedia culture can be told to the rest of the world? If the wikibully page is deleted, even though it represents real wikipedia culture, as experienced by at least one wikipedian, namely me, then using your logic, the entire category called <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_culture_6e1a.html" title="Category:Wikipedia culture">Category:Wikipedia_culture</a> and all articles in it like, Wikiwidow, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiGnome_db9e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiGnome">WikiGnome</a> etc., need to be deleted as well.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>We, peaceful wikipedains, need the wikibully page, so that when one of us experiences the horrific feeling when he is wikibullied, he knows that there's some place he can turn to, and register the wikibully as such, so that the wikibully cannot continue his anti-social behaviour indefinitely, unchecked, unnoticed and unabated, hidden among the ocean of user talk pages, and other vandalized user pages all across wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Once the spotlight is on the wikibully's deeds, and all wikipedians know about him, in most cases, once confronted by a multitude of victims of his, the wikibully would simply give up his bad act, at least that's my hope and desire. Because most people, when shown the ugly face they show others, in a mirror, don't like what they see and simply learn a new thing: tolerating others' views even though they may be different from their own. That's what civil society is all about. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemolition_Man_2686.html" title="User:Demolition Man">Demolition Man</a> 14:13, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_culture_6e1a.html" title="Category:Wikipedia culture">Category:Wikipedia_culture</a> (mostly) contains pages <i>in the Wikipedia: namespace</i> that have been a part of Wikipedia culture for a long time and are more or less well-known to many veteran Wikipedians. Maybe some of them don't belong in the category, but that is neither here nor there. If there is conflict with another user, there are many other, better places to register your dispute or discontent with that user: <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>, <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">WP:RFAr</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikimediation_2f1f.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikimediation">Wikipedia:Wikimediation</a>, or bring it directly to an admin that you trust. "Registering" another user on a big list of "bad people" is terribly uncivil and, IMO, un-Wiki, especially when there are so many other ways to solve your problems. <b>Delete</b>. Alternately, this could be moved to Wikipedia:Wikibully, where its status as some sort of policy proposal should be made clear, but that's probably unnecessary because such a policy would never gain acceptance. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 16:36, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think I like the spirit in which this article has been written. But I dislike the idea of having one big bad list of bad wikipedians like <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> has stated above. Keep the article but either lose the bully list, or may be, there could be a process in which proof of bullying is presented from the alleged bully's edit histories that he has been running around mouthing off peaceful wikipedians, minding their own business and the bully is given adequate warning to cease and desist from bullying and once warned if he continues to bully, he is put on the universal bully list for all to see, alongwith evidence of his bullying nature. Yes, I think I really like this idea. Whirling Dervishes 18:45, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>hahaha, that's funny. Anyway, I'm for definitely keeping this article. The term wikibully may be new to wikipedia, but bullying behavior is by no means foreign or new to wikipedia and I can assure you that I have been bullied and I have seen other users being bullied who were too weak to stand up for themselves or simply didn't have time to fight back and some of them seem to have quit wikipedia because wikipedia seems to have no way to easily spot and remedy bullies and bullies' standard harsh methodology of forcing their views down everyone else's throats. All bullies basically have the same negative attitude and it's time we did something forceful about it, that is specific to bullying behavior. If a similar policy was enacted at Columbine, I'm sure the Columbine massacres would never have taken place at all, because the bullying behavior at its root would've been nipped in the bud.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those users who are voting to delete imho, are either not active contributors or if they are, then they haven't tackled some of the really controversial pages on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">wikipedia</a>, where people literally become vicious with their attacks and the discussion can hardly be called civil at all.</p>
<p>The same minority of wikipedians, displaying bullying tendencies, are seen spreading their message of hate, with most normal users too busy with their lives to go after them using the lengthy wikipedia processes. There should be simple and straight forward way to deal with bullies on wikipedia.</p>
<p>Take a look at this scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>A bully harasses another wikipedian for something, like inserting comments that he, the bully, dislikes or does not share.</li>
<li>The user warns him, that he should change his hostile attitude and stop his threats, and the user reminds the bully, that through the bully's edit history, the bully is digging his own grave by continuing to bully the user.</li>
<li>If the bully does not stop, his name is submitted somewhere along with a list of his bullying edits gleaned from his edit history.</li>
<li>The bully is then officially warned by an admin to stop his bullying and shown the bully's list of bullying edits as proof which is undeniable.</li>
<li>It would be a completely insane bully who still does not get the message and still does not stop from bullying. Most bullies would stop bullying at this stage.</li>
<li>The bully would learn the lesson that <i><b>bullying does have negative consequences</b></i> and also that <i><b>no one likes a bully.</b></i></li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, I say <b>keep it</b>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Bulldozer_6c7d.html" title="User:The Bulldozer">The Bulldozer</a> 19:39, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thank you to those people who are supporting to keep the wikibully and especially for taking the time to express their views on it, much better than I did.

<li>Personally, I disagree with doing so. For one thing, no moves should be done EVER during a VfD; it messes up link structure on VfD pages. If the consensus is to move to Wikipedia:Wikibully, then an admin will do so. Otherwise, let the VfD run its course. In any event, if it were to be removed, much of it would have to be rewritten as a "How not to be a Wikibully", "How to deal with Wikibullies", etc. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> 20:48, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't exactly recall saying I don't believe in God, at least not here, but I will admit I do not believe in superstition, including religion, nor tribalism, including patriotism, nor do I even believe absolute freedom exists, and I certainly people talk about it without having any idea what it means. I am certainly not a commie or a fascist, and as for Darwin, well, I generally believe he existed, which is more than I can say about God. America is an awful big thing to hate wholesale, but I don't like nations in general. Nor am I overly fond of people, as a species, come to mention it. Political assasinations.

<dd>Threatening the life of the leader of the free world is not a joke. You are this close to landing in the slammer my little foolish friend. Aren't you aware that the American secret service does not allow threats to be made against the President, even in jest. People are interrogated and imprisoned routinely in my country for saying what you just did (which I'm not even going to repeat). The only thing of note that you just blurted out above, is that may be, just may be, somewhere there's a little part of America, that you don't want to see eliminated from the face of the earth. Thank you so much for that! May be I should call the white house, and ask the President that he declare August 1st, a national holiday from now on, since it was on this day that your majesty gave his permission to America to continue to exist? <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazy_Little_Woman_6498.html" title="User:Crazy Little Woman">Crazy Little Woman</a> 04:44, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't recall threatening anyone's life. I just said political assassinations weren't such a bad thing. Presidents Reagan and Bush seem to agree (executive orders notwithstanding); they tried to kill Quaddafi and Hussein, respectively. Fine with me, but unfortunately they killed all the wrong people. I think if people killed the leaders of nations rather than the poor dupes who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time the world would be better off. Then again it might be better off if no one killed anyone, but that might be too much to ask for. Oh, and perhaps I should have mentioned another thing I don't believe in is treason. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:56, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>America kills <b>only</b> the right people. Ever hear of the Lockerbee Plane bombing? It was that assh*** Quaddafi who did that. Ever heard of the invasion of Kuwait and the gasing of thousands of innocent civilians of his own country as well Iranians? It was that other assh*** Hussein who did that. Ever heard of the tactical nuclear missiles that the soviets dared to park on America's doorsteps? It was that son of a bitch Castro who let them do that. I'm beginning to dislike you and your ultra libral views immensely. Please remember, that it was our boys in WWII who freed that bowl of dust known as Europe, a continent that loves to hate America. USA handed Europe its freedom and prosperity on a silver platter. And what do you give us in return? <i><b>Pure and unadulterated contempt</b></i>. Your last entry about treason, better not be a jab at me. I wear an American flag with pride. I wave my American flag from my American car with pride. I have an American flag waving from my front porch at <i><b>all</b></i> times. If I wasn't slightly disabled, I would have joined the military and killed all those sons of bitches in Afghanistan who attacked my country on 9/11 and that cunt called Usama bin Laden would have seen his intestines pulled out by me, while he was still alive.

<dd>Yes, I'm enjoying this immensely. I know one isn't supposed to feed the trolls, but some trolls are really hard not to feed. I guess I should call it quits, though. I've gotten in a few similar discussions in the past, and they really just don't end.

<dd>But we <i><b>did</b></i> save your butts in WWII. Would it <b>kill</b> you to admit that? England would be a tourist attraction today, <b>submerged</b> in the Atlantic ocean, France would have been Deutscland's <b>whore house</b>, and all other pathetic little European countries would be taking dictation from either that little man with the little moustache or that other not so little man with a not so little moustache. As for those klingons called Indians &amp; Pakistanis, it was not that butt naked half blind beggar called Ghandi or that I wanna-be-a-white-man self-important fool called Jinnah that freed the Indian lands from the Brits. Hitler pummelled Britain so much that they had no choice but get the hell out of there. They <i><b>still</b></i> did not want to quit India. But once again, it was the <b>mighty &amp; proud</b> American President who told them to hurry it up and get out of the Indian countries. Otherwise, those naked beggars had been fighting since 1857 to throw the Brits out - AND HAD FAILED COMPLETELY. Now these beggars love to hate the USA and <b>not once</b> have they ever thanked the USA for its role in their achieving their independence. But interestingly, now that they are all free, they are piling over each other to try and go to Britain. Idiots should have never thrown out the Brits, and they would all still be citizens of the United Kingdom. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazy_Little_Woman_6498.html" title="User:Crazy Little Woman">Crazy Little Woman</a> 16:39, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't like the spirit in which it's been written, and I don't consider it to have been written in good faith, given that the author has <b>zero</b> main namespace edits under this user name (apart from this article, which should be in the Wikipedia: namespace anyway). On top of that, an aggressive and bitter piece such as this is not a profitable way of dealing with "Wikibullying" anyway, even if it is really such a serious problem, which I don't believe it is. <b>Utter delete</b>, and look at our existing mass of policy before writing something like this again. <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a> <a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjorford_13fb.html" title="User talk:Sjorford">ââ¢â</a> 22:11, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you don't <i><b>like</b></i> the tone please feel free to change it so that it is to your liking. Please know that bullying occurs more commonly in at least certain parts of wikipedia than you or me might be aware of. There are over half a million articles in the english language wikipedia, and many others in other languages, and no comprehensive way to keep track of abusive users. The <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> policy and any other IP address blocking policies are unenforceable, as all that does is block IP's which can be counter-productive since many innocent wikipedians also suffer, because many users share ISP's and proxy servers and therefore, IP addresses. Please read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPA#Remedies" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPA#Remedies" rel="nofollow">NPA (Remedies)</a> page.It says on the page itself and I quote:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>==Remedies==</dd>
<dd>If you are personally attacked, you may remove the attacks or may follow the dispute resolution process or both. In extreme cases, the attacker may be <b>blocked</b>, though <i><b>the proposal to allow this failed and the practice is almost always controversial.'</b></i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>So, the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> page speaks for itself and that's what I'm saying: Blocking policies have failed miserably. But we can still tag and track bullies, so that they may be shamed into stopping the bullying. Being in a state of denial or personally attacking me is not going to make the problem go away. So, why not at least document the problem. It'd be the first step towards solving it. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemolition_Man_2686.html" title="User:Demolition Man">Demolition Man</a> 23:03, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
