<li><b>Comment</b> this is the weirdest high school article I've ever seen. It's essentially an article about high school sports at Dodgeville, and apparently the article was started after information was moved from an article with a name something like "Dodgeville school sports", but I can't find that original article on Wikipedia, even as a redirect page (was it at the losing end of some old deletion decision?). If the single editor who's put so much time and effort into this indends to keep up the massive (34 kilobyte) ongoing collection of school sports coverage, I don't really have a problem with it, so long as he cleans up after himself (or herself) after graduation. I'm sure the school's received local sports coverage, so the article should be notable. But the information should go into the original name -- something to do with sports needs to be in that name. Right now it's misleading. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:12, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I find it very unlikely that the fact that the Dodgeville boy's basketball team was 8-13 under coach Tank in 1999 is either encyclopedic or of interest to anyone outside of Dodgeville. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanjunk_9f8a.html" title="User:Ryanjunk">Ryanjunk</a> 16:12, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> School District and <b>Relist</b> Wilson (<b>Keep</b> Wilson if no Relist). This article was always about the District and never about the School so I have moved the article to <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodgeville_School_District_0d86.html" title="Dodgeville School District">Dodgeville School District</a>. The four schools in the District play under the same sports banner so the High School teams represent the District as well as the School. All School Districts, as government establishments, are inherently notable. The article, as <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanjunk_9f8a.html" title="User:Ryanjunk">Ryanjunk</a> rightly says, needs cleaning up but that is an editorial matter; AfD is not a clean up squad. Coach Wilson needs to be considered separately. As a previous college footballer and a triple Hall of Famer as a coach, he has some notability but he needs relisting by himself so that the sports fans can consider him. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 22:44, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I can't say it better than TerriersFan. Ryanjunk's point about <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS</a> isn't quite on point, because Coachland was arguing about precident and the clear pattern that's developing about keeping high schools. Actually, I'm not so sure it's a developing pattern so much as an ongoing one. After WP:SCHOOLS went down in flames, perhaps we should create another proposed guideline on school notability, accepting high schools and school districts and coming up with something on other schools. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 20:52, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I can't say I've seen too many articles where I would recommend trimming down material, but this article is top-heavy with sports minutiae. The content that is here is adequate to demonstrate notability. I agree with <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> that we need to revisit a WP:SCHOOLS successor that would clarify notability of school districts and high schools, and then establish criteria for other schools. Using <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> as our only standard leaves every single school AfD a repeat of WP:SCHOOLS and WP:SCHOOLS3. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:00, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I read your essay and found it very interesting. I still disagree, though. The main guideline for notability, at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> gives the primary criterion for notability: "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject." Regardless of how notable a secondary school is to its students (and I am not arguing that a school does not play a significant role in one's life), nearly none of them are featured in non-trivial works. My grandmother is extremely notable and important to the members of my family, but she certainly is not notable enough to merit an encyclopedia article. The article in question has only one independent source: the first two are merely directories, the next three are created by the school itself, and the one semi-independent source is from the local town paper. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanjunk_9f8a.html" title="User:Ryanjunk">Ryanjunk</a> 16:55, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, WP:N is a guideline, and a heavily disputed one at that, not a policy. Just because an article does not meet the particular criterion you quote, it should not be deleted. If we deleted everything that was not "the subject of at least one substantial or multiple, non-trivial published works" then we would delete a large portion of the articles on Wikipedia and lose much information for the sake of the dogmatism and inflexibility of a handful of deletionists who seem to believe that it is better to shrink Wikipedia than to expand it. I'd be the first to say that there is a lot of junk on Wikipedia - utterly pointless rubbish that deserves to be deleted. But I do not think that even the most fanatical deletionist could claim with any credibility that an article about a school was pointless rubbish. And I tire of saying that lack of sources is not a reason for deletion - if its existence is verifiable, which a school's blatantly is, then it is perfectly acceptable to keep it, even as a stub (which, as I also tire of reiterating, is a perfectly acceptable form of article). Incidentally, I fear you didn't read my essay properly - your grandmother is notable <i>to a few members of your family</i>, not to thousands of current and former pupils and to the local community as a school is - I thought I made that point quite clearly with the house analogy. I really wish people would direct their efforts towards what genuinely needs to be deleted and not what a disputed guideline says might be deleted. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 18:57, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you want to be technical about "guidelines vs. policies", we're in a weird place. The official <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> lists as a reason for deletion: "Subject fails to meet the relevant <a href="../../../i/n/c/Template%7EIncGuide_0522.html" title="Template:IncGuide">notability guideline</a>." So we have an official policy which points to a "heavily disputed" policy. I'm not trying to be "dogmatic and inflexible" here, I just don't know that Wikipedia is the proper place for a school to keep detailed records of its sports program. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume good faith</a>, please. If we really must have a stub article about every single secondary school on the face of the earth, so be it. Just make it a stub without piles of crufty sports trivia, please. To borrow from <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hodgman_e95e.html" title="John Hodgman">John Hodgman</a>, for further details on sports, please consult <i>every other aspect of our culture</i>. As for my grandmother, you don't know how big my family is. If my extended family included thousands of people, would she then merit an article? Finally, lack of sources is definitively a reason for deletion. Just the ability to verify that something exists is not enough to make that something article-worthy. Every single citizen of the United States verifiably exists, but certainly not all are worthy of an article. This is why we have notability guidelines, and why it is an official policy that those topics which are not notable are subject to deletion. If there is a "large portion" of Wikipedia which needs to be deleted due to being unsourced, then it should be deleted, not used as an <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">argument to keep other stuff</a>. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanjunk_9f8a.html" title="User:Ryanjunk">Ryanjunk</a> 20:11, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
