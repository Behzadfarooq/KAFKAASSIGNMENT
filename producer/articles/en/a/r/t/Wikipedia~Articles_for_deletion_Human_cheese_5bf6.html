<p>I have researched this subject myself, some, and never found a reliable source discussing the existence <s>(or even hypothetical existence)</s> of cheese made from human breast milk. The article itself cites three sources, only one of which is about cheese (the others are about milk), and that one source (<a href="http://oxhouse.org/~brent/writing/human-cheese.txt" class="external free" title="http://oxhouse.org/~brent/writing/human-cheese.txt" rel="nofollow">http://oxhouse.org/~brent/writing/human-cheese.txt</a>) is far from being a reliable source. In external links, there is a blog post on the topic as well: again, very much not a reliable source. Also, much of this article as it now stands is original research, extrapolating what the nutritional value of human cheese would be, based on the nutritional value of human milk. <b>Delete</b> —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 17:41, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Correction. I forgot myself; I did find this <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=10037" class="external text" title="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=10037" rel="nofollow">Savage Love column</a> discussing the possibility, which I guess is arguable an RS. The columnist makes a few calls, including one to a cheesemaker who says "The department of health might have something to say about that." But is it possible? "You could probably do it, I don't see why not--provided you could get your hands on the milk." See <a href="../../../c/h/e/Talk%7ECheese_7be8.html#Human_Cheese" title="Talk:Cheese">Talk:Cheese#Human Cheese</a> for a little more.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The newspaper column is, I think, a fairly famous one which gets reprinted from time to time and has appeared in newspapers across Canada and the United States, since Dan Savage's column is syndicated to several other alternative newspapers. In the same way that Wikipedia has articles debunking urban legends, here we have an article which says "it's possible but probably wouldn't be a very good idea". The points in the article seem adequately referenced (and the fact that some don't mention cheese is fine - the references are illustrating points about human milk), except for the suggestion about it being appropriate for vegan diets. However, I think the article has adequate sources. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 18:21, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The 16,200 google hits for "human cheese" suggest that people are interested in the concept. Even the nominating editor admits to having done research on this. People are interested! (So, human cheese is notable.) The article is sourced; the Savage Love article (and I can't find the older version on The Stranger website, but I think I remember Dan Savage getting lots of responses to that column) and the external link blog (with pictures!) are a very good start. The milk content sources are useful, relevant, helpful sources that make the case for you-can't-make-human-milk in this article very well. The sources have bit and pieces that, when put together as they are in the article right now, make that case better than any of the sources taken alone. This is a characteristic of a good article, not a characteristic of original research! Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a how-to-manual, so the fact that you probably CAN'T make human cheese is not a problem! It is also not a problem that the FDA would not approve of human cheese; wikipedia isn't a list of food approved by the FDA. If people are interested in the concept of "human cheese," having a wikipedia article that tells them that they can't buy it, and probably can't make it, either, is actually really useful. <a href="../../../e/n/u/User%7EEnuja_0ca9.html" title="User:Enuja">Enuja</a> 09:04, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Not meeting "original research" and "verifiablity" are two different reasons to delete an article. It's not "original research" because of the Dan Savage article and the blog. Neither of these are particularly "good," reputable sources, but they do strongly show that this concept is extant. However, there are "good" reputable sources for what's in human milk, which makes this article verifiable. As I said above, it's noteable for the sheer number of goole hits (although some of them must be about the sex thing, I don't think most of them are).<a href="../../../e/n/u/User%7EEnuja_0ca9.html" title="User:Enuja">Enuja</a> 03:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
