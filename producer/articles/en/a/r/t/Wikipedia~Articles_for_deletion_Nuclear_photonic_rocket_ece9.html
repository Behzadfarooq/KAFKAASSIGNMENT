<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems pretty reasonable to me. The maths looks correct, where it refers to existing technologies it is correct. I see this as reasonable material in an encyclopedia entry.

<dd>Ok, perhaps you can list which facts are unverifiable? When I read through the article it certainly contains lots of statements such as 'other particles are baryons', or 'A nuclear reactor generates 5 times more heat than electricity'. These statements seem quite verifiable to me (by looking at the page on baryons or fission reactor respectively). Are you just asking for each line to have a link to an article that details the fact? This seems quite doable, and a weak reason for deletion.</dd>
<dd>Or, do you mean the general concept of using photons to accelerate a spaceship is unverifiable? Or that we can't build nuclear reactors? I really don't understand what you mean by unverifiable here - we're not talking about introducing some new physics, merely detailing the calculations giving upper limits on a plausible technology.<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathanHurst_9ea1.html" title="User:NathanHurst">njh</a> 23:44, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Most of what I find comes right back to Wiki <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nuclear+photonic+rocket&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nuclear+photonic+rocket&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Does it exist? If not, is it a widely accepted theory? If someone can provide legitimate sources and makes a good case for the subject, I might reconsider. <a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPJM_3604.html" title="User:PJM">PJM</a> 18:04, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>(Now <b>no vote</b>.) <s><b>Delete</b> as original research</s>, lacking credibility as well as sources. For example, why bother converting the reactor power into electricity (with the attendant reduction in efficiency) if, as the article admits, you can just pipe out the coolant and use the thermal radiation directly? Another point is that at white-hot temperatures the glowing filament (tungsten or graphite) would evaporate and form a blackening deposit on any containment vessel or reflecting surface - which would then reduce the reflectance progressively to zero. Without proper argument and sources this article just doesn't ring true. It also lacks of any mention of the "nuclear photonic" rocket's principal competitor (the <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ion_engine.html" title="Ion engine">ion engine</a>), which is a proven technology. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 18:23, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Not original research; this is an article about blue-sky thought experiments that were popular among physicists and lay readers of science magazines in the 1950's and 1960's. Folks like <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeman_Dyson_c83a.html" title="Freeman Dyson">Freeman Dyson</a> used to turn these sorts of ideas out by the metric tonne. Agree that article is in dire need of references. -Ikkyu2 21:09, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>An interesting point, but where is the evidence for this interpretation? I agree there were (and are) thought experiments, such the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_sail.html" title="Solar sail">solar sail</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_thermal_rocket.html" title="Nuclear thermal rocket">nuclear thermal rocket</a> etc.. With references, OK, I could agree that it's an improbable blue-sky idea; without references it is purely and simply <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">something made up at school/college one day</a>. The physics/engineering doesn't make any sense. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 00:20, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, whether it's published somewhere or not isn't dependent on whether this article has appropriate references - i.e., absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. I agree that the physics seems ridiculous - the thing would have to be hotter than a sun to provide any appreciable propulsion, and then you'd have to attach a spaceship. But other thought experiments, like <a href="../../../p/u/r/Pure_fusion_weapon.html" title="Pure fusion weapon">pure fusion weapon</a> and Dyson's <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Orion_604a.html" title="Project Orion">Project Orion</a>, do have decent articles. I'd argue for the conservative "Keep" until we have better proof this is a hoax, under <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>.
<dl>
<dd>Both of the examples you list have fully-readable references available. This article does not. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 16:32, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have downloaded the article which is referenced now; my university apparently subscribes to this. If you like, I will mail it to you. Among its assertions are "It should be noted that the development of photon engines for space flights is an old dream of the mankind. This concept was always associated with the nuclear reaction of annihilation or fusion, however its space application has not been invented to date, and in any case it would be very expensive (Lenard et al, 2000)." The Lenard article is cited: Lenard, R.X., and Lipiniski, R.J., "Interstellar rendezvous missions employing fission propulsion systems," in <i>Proceedings of the Space Technology Applications Int'l Forum</i>, 2000. I believe this dispels the concerns about OR; the idea is being talked about at space technology meetings. -Ikkyu2 20:11, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have found and added two further references to the article, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AIPC..608..596S&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=43dbd51f4130937" class="external autonumber" title="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AIPC..608..596S&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=43dbd51f4130937" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AIPC..608..828G&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=43dbd51f4112230" class="external autonumber" title="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AIPC..608..828G&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=43dbd51f4112230" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> , whose abstracts discuss this (improbable) idea; so I've withdrawn my delete. There should be a source for every point made in the article, but I accept that the concept itself has been previously described.

<dd>I split the original article out of a much larger one that used to be at <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spacecraft_propulsion.html" title="Spacecraft propulsion">spacecraft propulsion</a>, so I didn't exactly originate this article. However, I recall coming across the concept in other places before. I just did a quick search and I found a couple of references.
