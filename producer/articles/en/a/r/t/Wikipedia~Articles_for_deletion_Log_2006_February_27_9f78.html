<dd>The best analogy I can give is that Striver is wikibombing to boost the notability of individuals doubting the official 9-11 timeline. He started by slapping a POV tag on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, demanding that the official timeline be called "9/11 Bin Laden Conspiracy Theory", i.e. putting it on equal footing with the rest of the ideas at the 9-11 Conspiracy Theories page. To do this he cites a policy that requiring a "<b>significant</b> minority" to believe in any alternate theories. To boost the significance of these people, he has resported to creating articles for them. Then created articles which he could cite (e.g. 9-11: The Road to Tyranny). Then created items like Problem Reaction Solution to boost notability of the former. Notability in this case is highly circular. On the individual's pages he's claiming that they're notable because they are the most famous <b>among those that hold these alternative views.</b> Then on Talk: September 11th Attacks he claims that these views are notable because these people hold it. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 04:39, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Are you <i>kidding</i> me? This site gets referenced all the time on US video game forums. It's an enormous repository of screenshots, promo scans, etc. This is probably the dumbest AfD I've read yet. Why not go ask on any of the multitude of major video game forums whether it's notable. As a long-time admin of a video game website myself, I cannot believe I'm reading this (and no, I haven't made a page for my forum). The only think I would think as tolerable is a rewrite if there's promo-like problems with it. If you have <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> or <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameSpot_fd17.html" title="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>, this is also notable as a video game site. Just because the majority of people who troll these AfD lists aren't ardent video gamers shouldn't create a crusade against our articles (although I have never editted this article myself).

<li>What behavior if I may ask? Read that thread without prejudice and you will notice that I never told anyone to come here and vote and after the voting started I never told anyone to come here and help.

There was no voting yet when I made that post.

<li><b>Keep</b> not massively popular, so I'd only go on "weak keep" on grounds that in this case the site can't really hurt, and I think a website is definitely notable enough if I've run into it several times based on references outside of Wikipedia; I'm bumping it to Keep on grounds that this is seems to be an editor squabble and when articles go on AfD over this, nobody's having fun in the end.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Two appearances is US News and World Report, the front page of the LA Times, a mention in a New York Times op-ed piece and at least one (perhaps now two) appearances on CNN all add up to notability. I don't know if it's due to this group promoting itself or what, but it seems it has come quite a way since their first (clearly premature) article and its VFD over a year ago. I would dismiss any one of those media mentions on its own, but they've got enough coverage that I'm certain people will search for this. That being said, keep on eye on it for POV and third party verifiability and the like. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:13, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Since the last time this article was deleted as non-notable, the subject has simply accumulated a few more passing mentions in the media. I see no evidence the group/"movement" has become more notable for any <i>intrinsic</i> reason beyond these media mentions. As I said in the deletion review discussion, I don't see the additional information (at least what was provided in DRV) as terribly substantial, or as providing the verifiable and neutral information that we would need to create a neutral article. I concur that this will need close watching for NPOV (and the linkspamming that was common with earlier versions) if kept. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 05:02, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> The media references are passing mentions and do not indicate that it is "a worldwide religious movement" with any substantial number of adherents. If we are going to be impressed by a mention in U. S. News, we should note that according to <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/050802/2religion.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/050802/2religion.htm" rel="nofollow">that article</a>, the Universist organization in Birmingham, Alabama—where the group was founded—is small enough to meet in a coffee shop. Their website does not indicate a street address or a telephone number, and I haven't been able to find any indications that they have one. With regard to the claim that there are 7000 "registered" Universists, the website says <a href="http://www.universist.org/npovuniversistmovement.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.universist.org/npovuniversistmovement.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> "a number based upon people who have submitted a statement to Vox’s website agreeing with Universist principles and asserting that he or she is an Universist." It would be interesting to have a count of the number of people who have physically attended a Universist meeting of any kind. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:42, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The point of these comments is, I think, that if we cut the article down to verifiable facts and remove the self-promotional language and the media mentions, we're left with not much more than a group of people meeting in a coffee shop. I meet people in coffee shops all the time, but I don't claim these meetings are notable subjects for encyclopedia articles. In all this discussion I've seen no verifiable evidence that the group itself has become notably large or well-established. No such evidence was produced for the prior VfDs. So the debate here reduces to whether the media mentions, in themselves, make the group notable, if it wouldn't be without them. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 17:07, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, if the group were six guys in a coffee shop then CNN, LA Times, US News, BBC etc wouldn't bother with them at all. While obviously not everything they report is hard-hitting, pulitzer-caliber material, these are well respected news organizations. We're not talking the Weekly World News, or even the Sun. For an encyclopedia that has articles on god knows how many internet memes, it seems that just widespread familiarity is enough to at least deserve mention. Take away the internet mentions of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Kid_6b75.html" title="Star Wars Kid">Star Wars Kid</a> and what do we have but a guy pretending he's weilding a lightsaber?

<li>The interesting thing to me here is that you suggest cutting the article down to verifiable facts, and removing the media mentions. The media mentions *are* the verifiable facts; they are what we have to go with. Those are the notability criteria we have; those are the notability criteria we're stuck with. That means that, given the community consensus about what merits notability, these are the articles we're going to have: editorial compilation of various media mentions deemed notable. If you don't like that (I don't like it either), debate it at the talk pages of the various inclusion/deletion criteria, not on AfD. -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 23:42, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think you've misunderstood me to be asking for the removal of the media mentions from the Universism article, rather than offering an account of why I believe the group isn't notable, based on the available facts, despite the media mentions. I recognize that other editors believe the media mentions in themselves make the group notable, but I disagree. I don't see how mere media mention establishing notability is a matter of settled consensus policy. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 00:55, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>What I <i>suspect</i> we have is perhaps a dozen groups of twenty or so people in various cities, meeting in coffee shops and each others' living rooms, plus a very fancy website, plus a guy who is very skilled at giving newspaper feature-writers suitable material for them to use. Now, religions have indeed been started on much less. (Indeed, when you think about it, how else could any religion <i>start?</i>) But this isn't a religion yet, and seven thousand people who checked a box on a website saying that the text on the website expresses their views is not quite the same thing as seven thousand people who have travelled to a physical building and taken a year of instruction and gone through a ceremony... It will be interesting to know how many people actually show up at the Sept. 14th Universist session in Montreal. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:40, 27 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, I'm sure they don't have 7000 actual practicing Universists, and I made the article reflect that better (I also changed it from "worldwide" to "international", which I think better reflects the scope of the group). I think if we look at this less as a religion and more as an organization it looks a bit better. Certainly a religion with a couple thousand members is miniscule, but an organization with that many is not so bad. Not that I'm saying they even have that many, but it's clear it's not a local group anymore (something that wasn't clear at the first VFD). As I said, any one of its media appearances I'd shrug off, but all of them together I think mean something. I too am curious about how many will appear at the convention. I'd guess less than a coupel hundred anyway. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:23, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Comment: Before you call this article a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>, look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baden-Powell#On_his_sexual_orientation" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baden-Powell#On_his_sexual_orientation" rel="nofollow">here</a>, at the section called 'On his sexual orientation' in the main article for <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Baden-Powell_a8fa.html" title="Robert Baden-Powell">Robert Baden-Powell</a>. You can see that the topic is summarized concisely in the main article, and that the article under nomination is linked from the main article as a spinout due to length. After looking at that, and maybe at the discussion on the main article talk page, if you still want to say it's a POV fork, be my guest.&#160;:) -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 20:50, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Question</b> Why so much detail? Why isn't the short statement in the article enough? How much information do we need on something like a person's sex. orientation?

<ul>
<li>This is an old comment of mine. But yes, there are situations where too much information can turn an article into crap, regardless of what the policy says. Quality writing/communication of information involves knowing what to leave out as well as what to put in. In fact, the whole idea of writing anything involves defining what you are trying to say, and to say we should just add all the information we can means to throw out the definintions. Articles are crammed with crap all the time, and the concequence is that they become unreadable garbage. I'm glad I'm not crass crass enough to put some of these assumptions to the test. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 21:03, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>And another thing to set the record straight: I'm tired of people taking my comments and trying to imply that I'm wanting to delete legitimate info., as that is not what I've said anywhere. I simply can't fathom that people don't understand the concept of economy. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 21:11, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> As I am the user who originally gathered and posted the material in the main Baden-Powell page (and then consented to the POV fork so as not to have an unbalanced article, since a fair synopsis was left behind), I have some thoughts on this matter. First of all, it is the farthest thing from my mind to "smear" Baden-Powell or his memory. As I already expressed on the talk page of the main article, this kind of analysis does not "smear" the man, it makes him more real, and humanizes him. "Revisionism" is what historians do, as our base of information grows. The material was carefully sourced, it is based on <i><b>the</b></i> authoritative biography of the man, and the theme of his homoerotic attractions (coupled with his misogyny) has been shown to run strong throughout his entire life. This is not some chance apocrypha blown out of proportion, indeed I could have written an article twice the size and adduced much more relevant information, had I had the time. But this suffices. Now, however, <b>not only are the Scouts here not happy with having removed the "incriminating" material to a separate article, they are trying to further mask it by burying it into an unnecessary "book review" article when what is of encyclopaedic interest here is NOT a book review but the homosexual leanings of a man who founded the greatest youth organization in the world (the American branch of which has turned homophobic and militantly religious).</b> Thus what needs to be deleted is the book review article itself, and this article on his homoerotic inclination preserved. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 12:49, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep as is</b>. This was heavily debated on the talk page of the article on Baden-Powell and the consenus was to have the separate article with a summary in the main article. The book review page should stay too, it simply needs expanded into coverage of the full book, not just 5% of the book. After the fork from the main article, a merge was proposed and shot down quickly. Merging the content back into the B-P main article would simply reignite an already debated issue. This sexuality article is not a POV fork. Just so everyone knows, I am Scout leader and I am obviously NOT trying to bury the entire issue. My feelings are: the book review should cover the whole book, the sexuality article should stay where it is because no one can conclusively prove he was a homosexual--it's all second guessing and supposition, and the summary on his orientation should stay in the main article.<a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 16:23, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The idea that is a smear is not supportable. The content comes largely from the book by Jeal, which is very well researched.

To many people he is a hero and they can not face up to the fact he had weaknesses. There has been much debate about this among those who have contributed to the article on Baden-Powell.

<dd>Comment. This is getting rather unclear. That 'homosexuals are having "issues" with the BSA' is POV. You could just as well say that 'the BSA are having "issues" with homosexuals' - an issue that Scouting in Canada, Australia and Europe do not have. If the "author" refered to is Jeal, the author of a well researched biography, then he had no view on the BSA issues. He is British I believe and wrote the book before the BSA issues came to a head with Dale. You can not sensibly call the conclusions of a well researched biographer a "smear". It is clear that Jeal had no such intention in writing his book. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 22:04, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not necessarily. The Wiki guideline you quoted says: "Even if the subject of the new article is controversial, this does not automatically make the new article a POV fork. Provided that all POVs are represented fairly in the new article, it is perfectly legitimate to isolate a controversial aspect as much as possible to its own article, in order to keep editing of the main article fairly harmonious." Now, read the article up for afd and the talk on the main article. This is exactly what occurred: the new article was created to keep the main one harmonious and per the guide this is perfectly legit as long as all POVs are represented in the new article.

A man attracted to young girls or a woman to young boys would not be called a heterosexual, at least not as a complete description.

<li><b>Response to comment</b> I am not sure I understand your "If it doesn't fit into the main article, even if it is in no way a POV-fork, it's still not encyclopedic." I am sure you are not questioning the practice of spinning off sections which are overlarge. That is the <b>only</b> reason it was spun off, as far as I am concerned. As for the material not being encyclopaedic, I beg to differ. In today's intellectual environment is it of the greatest interest to examine closely the habits and motives of our ancestors, especially (and unfortunately) when it comes to the sexuality of important figures who are role models in today's world. Many scholars have studied and written about the sexuality of Lincoln, or Alexander the Great, and there is no argument in scholarly circles that there is value in that research - as opposed to, say, the sexuality of Lincoln's chambermaid. If Jeal (and other scholars) focus at great length on the erotic motivations and impulses of the founder of the Boy Scouts, who are we to claim that this research is irrelevant, and should be kept out of encyclopaedias?! Forgive me Daniel, I have a lot of respect for your work here, but I think <i>you</i> are the one who is passing the buck with this approach, and promoting a culture of denial. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 17:57, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b> I mean fit as to both size and relevance. You can get overdetailed on some things, and I simply believe that this is a case of that. If we are squeezing in so many details that they need to spill out, perhaps some should be pruned rather than making a new article on something so specific.</dd>
<dd><strike><i>sexuality of Lincoln, or Alexander the Great</i>: Are you serious? Look, I understand what you are saying here, but <i>make me a case</i> that this guy is <b>that</b> important. Would you make an article on George Bush's sex life? This is not an historical figure. No one said anything about it being <i>irrelevant</i>. Examining the sexual habits of our "role-models" is just not something I agree is productive.</strike> Cuture of denial? That isn't my intention here, and I hope it's not taken that way. About passing the buck, I mean in the sense of not passing it to the Wikideletion system have to deal with articles popping up on every Jim, Jake and Bob's sex life because this could set a prescendent.</dd>
<dd>I don't mean it's irrelevant or unimportant; I don't mean to imply that at all. I know this is important to some of you and likely to many others as well. I just think it can be reconceptualized a bit. Perhaps an article on the controversy overall around this guy? I'd need to read into it with more detail, but I hope you can see what I mean. Instead of gearing it to be about so-and-so's sex orientation, how about "So-and-so and the Scouts" or "The So-and-so Controversy" or something that is not quite so focused and in which some other material could be added to round out the subject.</dd>

<li>Perhaps I didn't communicate clearly. My point is that BP's sexual orientation is material for the BP page.

<dd><b>Ad infinitum</b> We should drop the whole thing simply because this conversation is not worth the space it is taking up. But, as a couple of closing thoughts . . . different time periods will have different perspectives on what is encyclopaedic and what is not. The ancients would be laughing themselves silly over this whole to-do. "What is the big deal," I can hear them say, "the fellow obviously loved boys more than anything else in the world, gave his life to them, and for some reason kept his hands off them. And did not care much for women and only put up with them when he had to. What else is new, he's just like us!" But we are not among the ancients, we live in a real culture of denial, one that has disneyfied a complex and very bright man into some paragon of modern middle class virtue, when really he belongs much more among the ancients than among us. This has led several top notch historians to put great effort into debunking that myth.<br /></dd>
<dd>The reason Jelks and (presumably) Rosenthal felt obligated to dwell at such length on this topic is because it is counterintuitive to most readers and thus instinctively dismissed, for reasons I will not go into over here, but having to do with the natural conservatism of most people. Thus if you are going to present such an eccentric point of view, you better be able to back it up. They, who know the topic better than any of us, obviously felt they <i>could</i> back it up. For us to casually mention the outcome of their research, without summarizing the argument in enough detail to convey its strength, cheats them <i>and</i> the reader of their due.<br /></dd>
<dd>Than being said, I share your discomfort with the <i>apparently</i> prurient nature of the article. I would not object to changing the title. But how to make it encyclopaedic and easily findable? And how to get away from the clinical terminology without obfuscating the point that it is his erotic drive that raised him to greatness? We could call it Baden-Powell and pedagogic eros or some such, but that begins to look like original research. You suggest discussing general controversies about him. But I am only aware of this one. The Scouts will not be pleased to have all this land back into the main article, and I too think it is a bit too thin to accomodate lengthy discussions.

<dd>I think we are dealing with a kind of unique situation here. As long as we can make a caveat that this person's sexuality was important to this historical organization, it might be ok. We can try to work together, all on the same side of this, and brainstorm and see what ideas we can come up with. How about "Homosexuality and Scouting"? Perhaps too broad?

<li><b>Keep</b>. I like this a lot. It should be expanded, actually, if possible. Encourage expansion of content on notable subjects, including breaking off content into subarticles where it is appropriate. Obviously people on the "delete" side are coming at this from two directions: some think it is excessive information (deletionism), and some people suspect POV in the basic nature of the article. I don't think either is correct. Deletionism is a worthless philosophy for reasons that have been stated and restated; the POV issue is irrelevant to me, because I figure you could branch out articles on several other aspects of the man's life, if you had enough information to work from and it was in a notable context. I'm not going to have a bias against this because it deals with a controversy; it's only natural controversial stuff gets the most attention. If I'm trying to grow a garden I'm not going to go and pull up the first plant that sprouts because it got things looking uneven by sprouting earlier than the rest: some things will get done sooner, some will get done later, and some will never get done. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:09, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Re-conceptualize</b> Changing my vote from delete, as I don't see that as quite the point. I think it should be considered that, while intentions here may be noble, having an article purely on (or at least titled) a person's sexual orientation would lead to others making articles with much less noble intentions, and would simply like to make a plea to giving some thought to that aspect.

<li><b>Keep</b> This nomination is POV...why should only the <i>straight</i>, and in some people's point of view <i>good</i> be written about Baden-Powell. So he was gay, and the millions-strong organization he founded frowns on that orientation. Seems encyclopedic to me. The censorship of this article would be a smear on homosexuals: should we all live in the closet to please the nominator? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 18:04, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>. I still think this is a content fork (non-POV), but don't want to give the idea that I think the material is unencyclopedic. I just think that a balanced treatment of this issue should be read along with the core biographical information on his life. If this information was located in a broader article treating the issue of <i>homosexuality in scouting</i> I might feel differently. But I think that biographical information on BP is best placed on the BP page to put it in the proper context. I do not feel that bidirectional linking is strong enough to tie the material together. Note that there is good treatment of the issue on the BP page already, so there might not be much more to merge, but I vote Merge nonetheless.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A POV-fork is an article that discusses only one side of an issue.

These two things are both historical and important and affected each other to an extent that an article might be a good idea.

<p>A worthy enough aim, but I find it hard to establish notability. Sounds like somethign widespread, but turns out to be a ministry of a single church. COEBA gets a few Googles, but as an ETLA many of these are not for this organisation. "Conference On Evangelizing Black America" gets around 150 unique Googles, including numerous directories. I know it has established an average of 1.5 churches per year, but is that actually a notable achievement? Maybe it is. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:07, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> In Fundamental Baptist circles an organization "should" fall under the authority of a church. On the other hand, this church could not have accomplished this without the aid of a large number of supporting churches ("members" referenced above. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a>) The costs are just too high. To date, COEBA has started over 20 churches with two more to start in 2006. Notability becomes more apparent when you consider what existed back in 1994. Thoughout the U.S. You could probably count Independent Baptist churches pastored by black men on your two hands. Today they number around 50! Over one third from COEBA activity.

<li>A non-wikipedia member wrote regarding this issue:</li>
</ul>
<p>COEBA stands as the only significant fundamental Baptist effort targeting church planting in black communities. The measurement of this organization's "notability" may be skewed due to a lack of understanding of COEBA's ongoing work. COEBA would be more properly termed a "movement" than an "organization." Its absence of tangible infrastructure renders its success difficult to quantify, particularly by the casual observer. However, closer inspection and polling of those directly affected shed light on this fundamental movement that is nothing short of a phenomenon.</p>
<p>In addition to the more than twenty churches planted, this effort has single-handedly redefined the perception of black Americans in fundamental circles. Of the more than 10,000 fundamental Baptist churches in the United States, significantly fewer than 100 are pastored by black American men. Most fundamental Christians have never served alongside a black person. The great majority of the pastors of those 10,000 churches have been acquainted with COEBA on some level. This has led to an unprecedented effort to understand, accept and evangelize black people either directly or indirectly through the ministry of these churches. COEBA has done more to raise awareness of the need and potential than all other efforts combined.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1990's, COEBA was a rare and dominant church planting voice in fundamentalism, thereby helping to spark a revival of church planting emphasis in many circles, irrespective of race. In the movement's brief twelve-year history it remains the unrivaled source of counsel, inspiration and hope for pastors, laymen and Christian workers with issues regarding fundamentalism and the black community. There simply is no other cause that holds the position that COEBA has in fundamental circles. More than 300 churches support this effort verbally and through financial contribution. A majority of fundamental Bible colleges and organizations stand firm in endorsement. With nearly five million missions dollars given through the ministries of COEBA churches, COEBA has proven that its foremost commitment remains that of world evangelism.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important facet of this movement is its training of the next generation of Christians, i.e., children in churches across the country. These youth possess great talent and skill and are leaders among their peers. Should the Lord tarry, they will grow into America's first measurable generation of fundamental black Christians.</p>
<p>COEBA's regional and national gatherings have consistently drawn representatives from hundreds of churches, Bible colleges and Christian organizations. Its most effective work, however, is through grass roots influence, counsel, education, encouragement and peer-to-peer contact. The impact of the COEBA movement vis-a-vis fundamental circles is an ever-evolving force that is changing the face of fundamentalism.</p>
<p>It takes time, and, perhaps, a generation to change the psyche produced by decades of missteps regarding Black America. Still, there are many on the bandwagon. Here is what several prominent fundamental leaders have said about COEBA: (the quotes below are copied from a 1999 COEBA magazine)</p>
<p>"COEBA, the vision of Lou Baldwin, a preacher of the gospel, draws my admiration and attention because it applies Bible remedies to the sinful human hearts of Bible-starved souls..." <b>Bob Jones III</b> - President, Bob Jones University</p>
<p>"I thank the Lord for the COEBA movement with the great objective of soul winning and the building of churches... This organization is doing a work that is much needed." <b>Dr. Lee Roberson</b> - Chancellor, Tennessee Temple University</p>
<p>"New Testament curches are the salt and light America needs. Praise God for Pastor Lou Baldwin and COEBA -- a gift from God to Black America." <b>Dr. Sam Davison</b> - Pastor, Southwest Baptist Church</p>
<p>"Pastors across America should thank God for raising men like Dr. Lou Baldwin ... It is my prayer that through COEBA many thousands of lives will be influenced as we move into the 21st century." <b>Dr. Paul Chappell</b> - Pastor, Lancaster Baptist Church - President, West Coast Baptist College</p>
<p>"COEBA is on of the greatest biblical missionary movements of this generation." <b>Dr. Don Sisk</b> - President/General Director, Baptist International Missions, Inc.</p>
<p>"This is a movement that has the hand of God upon it. The Lord has provided visionary leadership through Dr. Lou Baldwin to reach so many millions with the gospel." <b>Dr. Clarence Sexton</b> - Pastor, Temple Baptist Church - President, Crown College</p>

<p>The result of the debate was delete, with a redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Zelda_series_209c.html" title="The Legend of Zelda series">The Legend of Zelda series</a> thrown in totally of my own accord. This discussion conflates two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name "Zelda Universe" has official provenance. The pratice with items like this per Wikipedia:Notability (websites) is a redirect to the parent when they don't have stand-alone notability. No one has suggested that the official site does.</li>
<li>The name "Zelda Universe" is also a fan site. Nothing has been presented to suggest that <i>it</i> satisfies the notability guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, given that neither one nor the other can stand on its own, delete and redirect is the appropiate outcome. In the event that greater notability arises (for whichever incarnation) it's trivial to replace the deleted content.<br />

<p><b>*EDIT - Withdraw request for deletion, request page re-write</b> - Zelda Universe is the official name of Nintendo's Zelda.com web page, as well as all international iterations. A fan site does not hold presidence over an official site, and this article is nothing more than an expanded summary of the "about" page on the fan site. <a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETSA_3997.html" title="User:TSA">TSA</a> 07:17, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> - Zelda Universe is *now* the official title of Zelda.com, but this name was not actually chosen or implemented by Nintendo until March of 2001 (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.zelda.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.zelda.com" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>), while Zeldauniverse.net was launched at least a month earlier. A fan site does *not* hold presidence over an official site, but people who visit Zelda.com probably do not regularly refer to it as "Zelda Universe" (since typing Zelda Universe into google will yield the fansite before the official one, and typing zelda.com will yield a site that is labeled "The Legend of Zelda"). And even if a person does refer to Zelda.com as "Zelda Universe", this sort of occasion is exactly what disambiguation pages were invented for. Deletion is way too harsh, and honestly I think you're only proposing such a thing because you are the owner and operator of a rival Zelda fansite. Andi- 11:53, 27 February 2006 (EST)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'll have to second that, <b>don't delete</b>. There is really no good reason for deletion here. The fact of the matter is that this site has been the largest fan-site in the Zelda community over several years, and one of the bigger game-specific fansites on the entire web. To me that alone makes it worthy of it's article. Not to mention your reasoning behind the proposed deletion is pretty weak. There have been few to none mixups throughout the years between ZeldaUniverse.net and the official Zelda site, Zelda.com, which has only used the name "Zelda Universe" irregularly for the past few years. And as the user above me pointed out, that's what the disambiguation pages are for in any case. The article needs to be cleaned up and rewritten however. Lars-Christian</li>
<li><b>Comment - no vote</b>. Name conflicts with an official site is not a criteria for listing. Let the lawyers sort that out. However, with an Alexa rank of 72,971 I don't know if it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. —<a href="../../../w/r/a/User%7EWrathchild-K_cab0.html" title="User:Wrathchild-K">Wrathchild</a> <sup><small>(<a href="../../../w/r/a/User_talk%7EWrathchild-K_6125.html" title="User talk:Wrathchild-K">talk</a>)</small></sup> 17:22, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment - no vote</b>. The criterias are a little vague, but I would believe it meets them, seeing as it has been featured in several magazines, as well as on TV in France. Not my call to make however, so I'll leave that up to those in charge. Lars-Christian</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Additional input</b>: This isn't a vandetta or anything, it's about being accurate. Perhaps I was too brash, but something has to be done. Zelda Universe should, first and foremost, point to an article about the <a href="http://www.zelda.com" class="external text" title="http://www.zelda.com" rel="nofollow">| Official Zelda Web Site</a>. There, on the same article, can be information about this site, or a tag at the top which directs people looking for the fan site to go to another page. I thought I read that infringing on IP or misleading information was grounds for deletion - but please understand I do not want this content removed because of any other reason than it is taking the place of the official Zelda.com website. It is confusing to a fan who does not know any better, and yes there have been fans who confuse content on Zelda Univerise.net for OFFICIAL information endorsed by Zelda.com (Zelda Universe). That's my rationale. And Zelda Universe was used since 1995 on the AOL portal page of Nintendo. Camp Hyrule linked to it in the chat room used then. The website Zelda.com did not use the name Zelda Universe until it was launched as its own hub site - beforehand Zelda games got their own micro sites. Also, Zelda.com was originally a domain for pornography, and Nintendo went to court to retain the domain. Or else earlier Zelda.com would have been around sooner. --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETSA_3997.html" title="User:TSA">TSA</a> 00:53, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's true. It is just pretty much a carbon copy of the site's about page. I know this because I'm the one that did it. I figured some other people would've straightened it out by now, but evidently not. I couldn't care less what happens at this point. --<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Cornflake_5bc4.html" title="User:Captain Cornflake">Captain Cornflake</a> 19:51, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
<b>Additional input</b>: Wouldn't information on the official Zelda website go under the <b>Zelda</b> page? Why would an official website for a video game (which contains nothing but official information) need its own wikipedia article? Does Coca-Cola.com need its own page, while we're at it? Just for the record, I will admit that I didn't know that this wikipedia article existed until I decided to do a random wiki search (ironically, it happened to be just a few hours after TSA suggested the article for deletion. But now that I do, the page will be updated quite a bit.Andi-</p>
<p><b>Edit</b>: The page has been changed a bit, and the fact that "Zelda Universe" is also a name for the official website has been pointed out (And a link has been provided). Andi-. 21:36, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In response to the keep vote, I'm all for a merge with <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_doll.html" title="Sex doll">sex doll</a>. I think that RealDoll should be merged with <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_doll.html" title="Sex doll">sex doll</a>, as well. And I'd like to get rid of <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleshlight.html" title="Fleshlight">fleshlight</a>. Generally, there are some ugly trademarks all around the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_toy.html" title="Sex toy">sex toy</a> article. If it is a single sort of something, and a trademark, to boot, I'm all for getting rid of it. <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_doll.html" title="Sex doll">Sex doll</a> really covers both RealDoll and other makers AFAIK. I don't have time to do all this myself.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, while I should assume good faith, I am suspicious instead. Esoterik1 has a very short editing history that includes the creation of this article, and insertions of links to this article in other articles, but nothing else. This is a classic pattern for astroturfers.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Due to the nature of this topic, one should expect a higher than usual instance of unregistered users and/or sockpuppets. Note that in RealDoll's history page, more than half the edits were done anonymously, and the great majority of those were by people of good will. See the long response under Keep (below) for more on the tradition of anonymity in on-line forums that deal with sex dolls. Esoterik1 IS a nom de plume/pseudonym/sockpuppet, created SPECIFICALLY for this contribution. Any contributions I make in Wikipedia that touch on this topic, even peripherally, will be made by Esoterik1. Without revealing more about myself than I am comfortable sharing, as it happens, I am a published author. Clients and peers Google my name with some regularity. If the only acceptable editors for this topic are those who have registered with their real name and listed personally identifiable information on their User page, then a Google search on my name would include an article on sex dolls in Wikipedia. Speaking strictly for myself, I would rather voluntarily blank the article than suffer possible negative professional and/or personal consequences. Wikipedia would simply have to wait for a braver contributor than I, or a wiser one who doesn't freely admit to first-hand knowledge. And there's the catch. The Acid Test is: what do you know for sure? Incidentally, I don't feel the same way about other topics I write about. In other respects I enjoy attribution, kudos, and laurels. In this instance, the knowledge that my contribution made a difference will have to suffice. BTW, I like your handle. It's a cool word, rich with history, and one that has been in my active vocabulary for many years.--Esoterik1 04:03, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, Defenestrate, for re-evaluating the article after the re-write. I appreciate your "due diligence". This review will be closing soon, I would imagine. Is anyone else going to look at the edited version or give the 15-second video clip (linked below) a glance before that happens? You might feel differently about the new version of the article, and the video clip might satisfy any question of notability. If not, your criticism might lead to a needed improvement. I would regret it if the effort to write it (and especially the time it took to ask the company for a license for the photo) turned out to be a complete waste of time. One hopes to make a difference. --Esoterik1 06:36, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> On account of a major edit to conform with NPOV policy. Intensifiers were aggressively deleted and word count was reduced from 679 to 473. Give it a second look, please, and let me know if the changes made a difference, or if further editing is needed. As the author who seeded the core information, I feel responsible for at least bringing my contribution to the topic up to Wikipedia's high standards. The characterization of "Insanely obvious astroturfing," though a clever bon mot, is speculative, and, as it happens, inaccurate. But rather than take it personally, I was led to ask why the article might be so perceived. The resulting edit is an improvement on account of that input, however, and I am grateful. I started to cite references and quotes for each point, but it began to read more like a dissertation than an encyclopedic entry, and the increased length didn't seem justified by the topic. So I went the other way and slashed whole sentences, making it, I believe, more neutral, pithier, and more interesting on account of brevity.</p>
<p>I was guided initially by the prior existence of the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realdoll.html" title="Realdoll">Realdoll</a> topic, which has been in existence since August, 2003. It has survived 2 AFD reviews (one in November 2003 and the latest earlier this month), and it is now a stable article, though currently slated for clean-up. I found 2 existing references to CybOrgasMatrix, one under <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_doll.html" title="Sex doll">Sex doll</a> and the other under <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandora_Peaks_74f6.html" title="Pandora Peaks">Pandora Peaks</a>, but they weren't linked to anything internal or external.</p>
<p>I have no axe to grind, although I have become somewhat ego-involved with the article as my time spent contributing and discussing it here has grown. I would characterize myself as an enthusiast with a dose of expertise who should (by consensus) eschew the tendency to evangelize. I was moved to contribute because this is something that interests me, and I know some stuff about it that I felt would be interesting to others (and that's as much as I care to share of my personal life in this area). Because it was personally interesting, I know more about the topic and the industry now than I did when I began to write about it, since a useful contribution imposes an obligation to do a good deal of research.</p>
<p><b>Popularity:</b> In support of the argument for inclusion, here are the results of some search engine tests run mid-day today, Feb. 28, 2006, on the word "cyborgasmatrix" with adult filtering turned off-</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Yahoo Test:</b> 1280 hits, reduced to 1270 when clicking on the last page. However, Yahoo's advanced search form does not support the exclusion of the manufacturer's website, and that skews the results upward.</li>
<li><b>Google Test:</b> Starting with the widest parameters first, there were 1430 hits for the word "cyborgasmatrix" with adult filtering off, and omitted results included. Repeating the search with the manufacturer's website excluded and omitted results excluded yielded 1060 sites listed, which reduced to 283 websites when clicking on the last page. There were 4 hits for the spelling "ciborgasmatrix" (3 with omitted results excluded), and 6 hits for "cybergasmatrix" (4 with omitted results excluded). Using the lowest values for these searches yields <b>290 websites</b>.</li>
<li><b>Alexa Test:</b> Ranks cyborgasmatrix.com at 406,325 over the last 3 months, with 20 linking sites.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.dollforum.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.dollforum.com/" rel="nofollow">The Doll Forum</a></b> The CybOrgasMatrix section of the Doll Forum has <b>1218 posts on 128 different topics</b> dating back to early 2002. Although this isn't a place one would think of going for a Google Test, it is worth considering when evaluating the popularity of a specialty item like this. It's membership is comprised of over 14,000 registered users who seem to be well fairly well-informed doll enthusiasts. It has a number of forums within, 9 dedicated to specific dolls, RealDoll and CybOrgasMatrix among them. It appears to be a good place to go to gauge public opinion on the product. A Wikipedia search yields 218 references to "Doll Forum." Due to the personal nature of the discussions, all but a few brave souls use handles rather than their names. This tradition seems to have followed RealDoll into Wikipedia; a brief glance at the history page accompanying the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realdoll.html" title="Realdoll">Realdoll</a> article will show you that of the 66 edits to date, half of them (34 to be exact) are anonymous contributions, either by unregistered users, or by people who don't log in when making the edits.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to several of the posts in the Doll Forum, the CybOrgasMatrix has never been advertised. They claim to have been around before RealDoll, but they spent the first 7 years working in development and research, outside the public eye. All of their customers have come to them by word of mouth, forums, or search engines. The company has attended only one trade show. In the course of obtaining the license to use the image of the doll used in this article, I learned that the BBC was interested in filming a documentary about CybOrgasMatrix, but it came to nothing when they were informed that due to work under development they would not be permitted inside the factory, even without cameras. The apparent lack of marketing or media relations might explain why more people aren't aware of the unique qualities that distinguish CybOrgasMatrix from anything else, but that is pure conjecture on my part.</p>
<p><b>Noteworthiness:</b> However, the argument for inclusion ought not to rely solely on popularity. It is noteworthy for the innovations mentioned in the article, namely: the degree of realism that is unmatched by anything yet invented in its category. Although that wording does not appear in the article, at first blush it is wildly POV. But I'll back it up below.</p>
<p>When I saw that there was a stable article on the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realdoll.html" title="Realdoll">Realdoll</a>, I reasoned that if that information was fit for inclusion in Wikipedia, then an invention that represented a significant improvement over all <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prior_art.html" title="Prior art">Prior art</a> would be relevant by the same standard. I was surprised that the topic did not yet exist. <b>The case for relevance and basis for inclusion can be summarized as follows:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_doll.html" title="Sex doll">Sex doll</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realdoll.html" title="Realdoll">Realdoll</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandora_Peaks_74f6.html" title="Pandora Peaks">Pandora Peaks</a> have all withstood Wikipedia peer review and are now stable articles.</li>
<li>CybOrgasMatrix is an invention that represents the current state-of-the-art in terms of realism, with significant improvements over anything that has been invented in the past. As such, it is sufficiently noteworthy to have its own topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>The basis for this assertion comes from <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a>, who said that true knowledge is based on firsthand experience, and the best that can be said of anything else is that is a "correct opinion," however well-informed it might be (I am paraphrasing Benjamin Jowett's translation here). That was the seminal influence for my contribution (sorry; it was too tempting to resist). I would not have bothered to contribute on the basis of mere opinion based on something I read. I submit to you that anyone who has direct experience with the CybOrgasMatrix AND the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realdoll.html" title="Realdoll">Realdoll</a>, and who isn't too shy to share that knowledge, will validate the 2 points that make the invention unique and distinct from all <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prior_art.html" title="Prior art">Prior art</a>, namely the degree of realism achieved by lifecasting, and the tactile realism of the material used in its manufacture in simulating human flesh. Because it is not as well known (yet) as RealDoll, a lot of people may be unaware of this distinction. Although I am speaking freely in the context of this discussion, this is not a POV issue, because it can be verified by anyone motivated to do so. It would be most informative to hear from others with "true knowledge" who are willing to come out about this issue. True knowledge in this case can be as simple as the personal experience of having seen and felt the 2 side-by-side at a trade show, for instance, and not necessarily that someone happens to own both of them. I can certainly understand if someone is reluctant to share due to social taboos and stigmas. After all, the early prior art was pretty absurd, and no one wants to invite ridicule. Short of true knowledge, if someone is going to evaluate the merits of inclusion or deletion, I would think that at the very least they would want to take 15 seconds to verify this for themselves in order to make a more informed decision. I believe that could be accomplished simply by watching the first <a href="http://www.cyborgasmatrix.com/TorsoScans/images/Torso.mpg" class="external text" title="http://www.cyborgasmatrix.com/TorsoScans/images/Torso.mpg" rel="nofollow">15-second video clip</a> on the official website (adult content, but very soft; interesting, but not offensive). It should play in Internet Explorer; I'm not sure about other browsers. I chose that clip as a representative example that immediately illustrates my point for the purposes of this discussion. However, linking to it in the article would be improper.</p>
<p><b>Dolls category propriety:</b> Regarding impropriety, I chose to delete CybOrgasMatrix from the Dolls category. I listed it there initially because I noticed that the RealDoll was also listed in that category. But upon further consideration of the fact that most people going through the Dolls category index are kids or parents looking for toys and action figures, clicking on a text link that brought them to the RealDoll or CybOrgasMatrix article would very likely be an unwelcome surprise, possibly a damaging one. As you will see if you follow the Wikilink above, RealDoll is still listed there. I will leave it for the community of Wikipedians to determine if this is correct, but as far as my contribution goes, a sex doll does not belong in the Dolls category.</p>
<p><b>Merging with Sex dolls topic:</b> It may well be the consensus that the CybOrgasMatrix topic should be merged into <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_doll.html" title="Sex doll">Sex doll</a>. The argument has some merit, and there is an existing discussion topic in <a href="../../../r/e/a/Talk%7ERealdoll_bd58.html" title="Talk:Realdoll">Talk:Realdoll</a> that speaks to that issue. My first post on the Talk:CybOrgasMatrix discussion page posed the same question. If this turns out to be the consensus, had we not best apply the same standard to all sex dolls? In that case, shouldn't RealDoll be listed under Sex doll, as well. The advantage that RealDoll has that no other invention will ever have is that it was the first of a new generation. That's golden to an industrialist. Just ask Ping-pong, the makers of the first table tennis ball, or the people at the Crescent Tool Company, who invented the adjustable wrench. The company name is now synonymous with the product, the activity, or even the industry. Xerox and Figidair are 2 more examples. That should be enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECompanies%2C_corporations_and_economic_information_1ff1.html" title="Wikipedia:Companies, corporations and economic information">Companies</a>, but does that, in and of itself, merit inclusion to Wikipedia?

<li>For a start, CBN Media, the owners of the website in question (Cyber Slam), which is a lot more than the forum section pictured has <i>nothing at all</i> to do with IGN. Please at least get the facts straight if you wish to flag an item for deletion. Secondly, it takes time to make a great Wiki entry (for some us anyway). I'm learning as I go but at the moment all I'm noticing is people who are very keen to get rid of new content and discourage people from contribiting. Third point, there are a number of people on the same IP as me, my guess is one of them wrongly removed the original 'flaged for deletion' item. On a fourth point there are many website Wiki entires with a lot less content and many with out-dated and very <i>nn</i> content. While this point may not be a valid argument to some people, it does make you wonder why its hard to get new stuff on Wikipedia when the <i>delete happy people</i> seem unable to find anything unless it is new. With more time to add the <i>notable</i> content, I'm sure people will reconsider the entry (again, some of us do not have as much free time as others). Sixth point, If the <i>delete happy people</i> read the Cyber Slam entry they would have noticed there is more to Cyber Slam than just a forum. The <i>delete</i> vote above by Capitalistroadster referers to <i>webforum</i> which implies a skim of the content and a click on the image. The entry by Terenceong1992 is the same and states <i>nn web forum</i>, again clearly someone who did not even read the entry. <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigger-oN_654e.html" title="User:Tigger-oN">Tigger-oN</a> 12:10, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> there are two claims of notability. Firstly, that it is a notable web forum - I don't see evidence currently that supports this claim. Secondly that it is a notable organiser of FPS tournaments. Capitalistroadster's point refers to the need to verify this information. If either of these claims are verified by independent sources then that would probably satisfy the notability criterion and I'd change my vote to Keep. As it is, the article currently says that Cyber Slam is a forum for buddies to hang out at and is an organiser of some FPS tourneys. On the process, it isn't wrong to remove the Prod tag - it should come with an explanation as to why it is being removed. That tag is different to the AfD tag that is currently on the article which wikipedia process does not approve of removing, there's no blame attached here. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 12:46, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Once again we see a very clear delete vote from some one that has not even read the entry, and if they have, feel that a site dedicated to running and hosting online Tournaments in Australia can be classified in one word as <i>forumcruft</i>, a word that does NOT appear on Wikipedia, nor could <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=forumcruft" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=forumcruft" rel="nofollow">dictionary.com</a> find an entry for it.

<ol>
<li>The user/admin <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> flagged Cyber Slam as a <i>non-notable subsection of an <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a> web forum, dedicated to organising Halo tournaments in Australia.</i> Cyber Slam has nothing at all to do with IGN and while Cyber Slam has organised Halo PC events, it has also done a LOT more for online gaming in Australia. Key word, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, which has a much smaller population than the UK or USA, so the impact on a global scale may make Cyber Slam appear as <i>non-notable</i>. Australia wide however we are known.

'<i>On a personal level, there is a questionable joke on the Proto user page. Something I find somewhat offensive and surprising for a Wikipedia Admin.</i></li>
<li>The user/admin, <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerenceong1992_0ff6.html" title="User:Terenceong1992">Terenceong1992</a> stated the reason for deletion - <i>nn web forum, vanity</i>. Terenceong1992 is currently on a <i>Wikibreak</i>, so it is unlikely this 13yr old Singaporean has seen the changes that have been made.</li>
<li>The user/Admin, <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComputerjoe_570e.html" title="User:Computerjoe">Computerjoe</a> stated that Cyber Slam did not meet the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> standard. The entry has been updated since then. If there are now any sections that the Cyber Slam entry is weak on, please inform me so I can source the content from Cyber Slam staff and players.</li>
<li>I have also been looking into <i>vanity</i> (in relation to Wiki entries) and the use of <i>fourmcruft</i> and I'm guessing the Cyber Slam entry would come across as vanity to many people outside of the Gaming community of Australia. It is a real shame very few of the online Gaming community of Australia are not also Wiki Admins. These people would be the real judge as to how notable Cyber Slam is, at least in Australia.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've noticed heaps of Wiki entries that seem to <i>really</i> be <i>nn</i> in comparison to the Cyber Slam one. I do totally understand that just because there are invalid entries does not mean there should be more invalid entires. It just seems to me that some people are keen to delete new stuff because it is so much easier to find. Here is a very short list that took all of 5 minutes (I've noticed heaps more, I just can't remember them!):</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> You've done a good job updating the article. Please assume good faith regarding AFD discussion - Terence Ong is a very experienced AfD debator for instance. There is a tendency to bias in favour of internet/gaming articles on wikipedia in my opinion so there has to be something that makes the article stand out as notable which I think you've achieved. A couple of votes have changed to keep as a result of your good work and at present, I'd be surprised if the end result was delete. Of those you've listed, Fileplanet is notable in my opinion but I haven't heard of the rest. If you want to list any of them for deletion then you should feel free. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 17:38, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Sorry, even with the references it doesn't met <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The SMH reference makes only the slightest passing reference, the 2nd one is coverage about a tournament, the 3rd is an online entry form!, the 4th is simply information about ACON 5 event, the 5th an opinion piece by someone clearly not independent (he later became involved in running this event) and the 6th is a info piece which is clearly sourced from Cyber Slam. <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECursive_f668.html" title="User:Cursive">Cursive</a> 12:28, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Response to Cursive</b> I don't see how coverage of a Cyber Slam Tournament on free-to-air television could be seen as invalid at all! To get <i>any</i> coverage of any tournament on TV can only be seen as <i>notable</i>. The opinion piece was from someone independent at the time the article was published. Part of what makes Cyber Slam interesting is the fact that the players and the public can and do get involved. Cyber Slam invited Mike Longley to assist with the Final because he had such strong opinions. There are more <i>References</i>, however (sadly) its taking time to get them from the Cyber Slam staff. <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigger-oN_654e.html" title="User:Tigger-oN">Tigger-oN</a> 12:06, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>MERGE</b> to <i>La Salle College</i>. I do not think that having <i>every single</i> reference to an article neither in the article nor in English is meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. This is the English Wikipedia, and as it stands it is impossible for most people in the world who choose to read this article to verify its contents. One or two of the sources even require registration! However, AGF says that the sources say what it is claimed they do and this only barely touches the two-thirds level, so I think a smerge to the school is probably enough. I'm just going to redirect and leave the merge to someone else from the history; painful detail about the headteachers upbringing would not work well in that article, nor would much more than a mention in the infobox. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:43, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: The principal of one of the ten most famous schools in Hong Kong is more than enough of a notable person to be mentioned here. Moreover, the article is in this current non-neutral state only because it has received heavy vandalism from people against Paul Lau, which are anonymous users. If these vandalism materials are being reverted, the article is certainly neutral in general. The current state of the article without a biography section, is only a transitional state as if many other comprehensively-written biographies were at their early weeks. I believe with this proposal of deletion rejected, the article will certainly receive improvement and expansion. As an experienced editor on Wikipedia and a person who knows Paul Lau in real life, I'm certain that I can expand the contents of this article while keeping it neutral, provided that it's not being deleted right here. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="brown">De</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan"><font color="green">ryc</font><font color="#007DFF">k C.</font></a> 13:43, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, as per Deryck C., I do not agree that the article is not notable.

<dd>With the school's fame, Paul Lau often appears on newspapers in Hong Kong.

<dd>One even more unreasonable point concerning your action is that you don't know how to read Chinese, but before you ask for help in translation or verification of the sources you conclude that you cannot confirm Lau's notability. There are many many Wikipedians who are neutral about this issue and knows how to read Chinese, such as <a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> or <a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a>.

<dd>I asked for a source to verify the article's content. None was provided. (The article still lacks any references, by the way). Sources were, however, provided for those who could read Chinese and/or were willing to pay for the information. I was very careful in phrasing my subsequent comment, in that <i>I</i> couldn't verify the article's content. Then you declared that I had verified the content; when I commented on this incorrect assertion you declare me to be "unreasonable". This does not seem terribly polite.

<li><a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> has little to do with my nomination. I don't assume the article starter wrote the article in bad faith. I believe he does think eMule P3P is going to be a great file sharing application, but the problem is that the application does not exist and shows no sign of existance beyond a low-activity web forum (his posts are about all the activity there is). Even if the application will spark into existance at some future date (which I think is highly unlikely, given my basic understanding of how the supposed technologies involved work), Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. It's fine if he wants to get more exposure for this potential future application, but Wikipedia is not a suitable venue for it. <a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaakon_f760.html" title="User:Haakon">Haakon</a> 18:57, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you click on her name you would see that she has an IMDB entry. Also how do you know she had a "<i>very minor role</i>" in the one hollywood flick? Have you seen the movie? The recent article on her in the Philippine Daily Inquirer implied that she was a big star at one time in Asian countries and has made a significant number of films. Apparently you have not bothered to try to verify any of the articles you have nominated. Furthermore, calling this material "<i>gibberish</i>" is astoundingly insulting to people interested in this genre. I believe these noms should be immediately withdrawn. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 13:02, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you read the 'articles' in question, you will see that they are, indeed gibberish for the most part. And your insinuation that I 'did not bother to try and verify these articles' is incorrect. I did indeed attempt to verify these articles. There were many more created by this user which have been verified and matched up to IMDB sources; I did not nominate those for deletion. Please try and assume good faith. Nevertheless, I have been convinced that this is not the best way to remedy these articles, and so I have withdrawn this AfD. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">Proto</font></span></span></a><font color="#555555"><b>||</b></font><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">type</font></span></span></a></small> 13:29, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Close nomination</b>. This is impossible. User:Edbon3000 has created a metric truckload of articles about Filipino actors/actresses, many unquestionably of poor quality in terms of Wikipedia style as well as English (e.g. inserting his email address), and has been unresponsive to messages on <a href="../../../e/d/b/User_talk%7EEdbon3000_d2c2.html" title="User talk:Edbon3000">his talk page</a> trying to get him to write better articles. That may be cause for concern. However, the question here is these articles, some of which are verifiably notable, many are probably notable but unverified, and there's no way we're going to be able to sort through a combined nomination for all of them. I say 'close nomination' and not 'speedy keep' because some of these articles undoubtedly need to be deleted, but this isn't the way to do it. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 12:21, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is a big task. Should we therefore not bother, because it's a big task? If you think individual nominations are the way to go, good luck to you.

<dd>Good luck to me? You're the one nominating these for deletion, and since it won't happen like this it's up to you to find an alternative avenue. On the other hand, PRODding them might work. Edbon seems to be a create-and-run sort of editor - I've never seen him improve his articles after the initial edits, or defend the ones that have come up for AfD - so he probably won't take the tags down. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 12:40, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> this AFD is asking a lot of editors. I can't offer a vote as I can't check them all right now. Prodding may be a useful tool here, my main concern with prodding is that doing that to all of these may just be moving the issue to prod and the same difficulty arises in that there are so many of these and they're not necessarily all directly related articles to each other so it's going to take quite a bit of effort for editors to work out which should be kept and which not. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 12:55, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article about the administration of the British Admiralty is from the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica. It is also hopelessly out of date. It is about the current (1911) state of affairs, so there's no good historical information, either. There might be some information that is still accurate, but verifying the article, statement by statement, does not seem worthwhile.

<dd>Hi Krash, You have a history of voting for deleting articles. What is this word "Urantiacruft"? <i>Why should the article be deleted?</i> Urantiacruft is a meaningless word and doesn't exist anywhere. The editor who wants to write the article deserves an educated, reasonable, answer and vote. <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanely_adfd.html" title="User:Hanely">Hanely</a> 20:36, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi, Hanely, You're observant of my actions, but that has little relevance right now. <i>"Urantiacruft"</i> is a portmanteau combining the words <i>"<a href="../../../u/r/a/Urantia.html" title="Urantia">Urantia</a>"</i> and <i>"<a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">cruft</a>"</i>. I'm sorry if that was not clear. As stated above, I feel that the article should be deleted because a) I agree with <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">User:MLA</a>, b) it appears to be a <a href="../../../f/o/r/WP%7EFORK_4e79.html" title="WP:FORK">content fork</a>, and c) I think the article is little more than <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruft.html" title="Cruft">cruft</a> related to Urantia. --&#160;<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrash_3aff.html" title="User:Krash">Krash</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKrash_5bb4.html" title="User talk:Krash">Talk</a>)</small> 23:54, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Krash, Thanks! Yes, I can see how you perceived it to be a fork. But the history of the article talk page shows that editors need to either split the article or make a series, this is currently in process and ongoing. I believe it was the editor's attempt at getting that started (same with epochal from that article). Cruft? I followed your link and skimmed; well - you're entitled to your opinion, of course, and it is worth considering, and should go without saying, but it's uninformed IMHO. Esoteric is more accurate. IMHO. (I also saw fancruft, and agree only by the word-symbol for a concept that is actually reasonably known among spiritual philosopical and religious thought. I think it should be kept until the editor has opportunity to fine tune it, though I would understand if you insist it be fine tuned before posted. <b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanely_adfd.html" title="User:Hanely">Hanely</a> 14:59, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How much time does the editor need to fine tune the article and what tunings are in the works? That said, I'm not really sure if fine tuning or even major rewrites would remedy the real problems. Everything from about the second paragraph on is badly POV, written in an unencyclopedic, soapbox tone. Without any secondary sources, the article qualifies as proselytizing original research. Cutting all the problems would leave little more than a glossery term per User:MLA. --&#160;<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrash_3aff.html" title="User:Krash">Krash</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKrash_5bb4.html" title="User talk:Krash">Talk</a>)</small> 17:15, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The term "thought adjuster" is important enough to merit its own article, and developments / improvements should continue to make it a better article. My thoughts on the objections listed so far:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"proselytizing" / NPOV -- I agree POV isn't up to wikipedia standards. I've made some additional improvements. Just having an article on a religious term doesn't mean the intention is to prosyletize, the article is meant to explain a rather central concept to the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Urantia_Book_1493.html" title="The Urantia Book">The Urantia Book</a>. Lack of neutrality in and of itself is being stated as the main reason to delete the article, but wikipedia policy directly addresses this as not usually being reason enough. I don't believe this is one of those exceptional cases where shortcomings with NPOV are enough to merit the drastic action of deletion. Good faith efforts should be made by editors to improve the NPOV and address concerns.</li>
<li>"cruft" -- More correctly, it's <a href="../../../d/e/v/Development_stage.html#Beta" title="Development stage">beta</a>. Articles rarely spring forth from Zeus' forehead as an Athena of perfect prose, that's never been a reason to delete an article. Krash, if you have more of a "release early, release often" Cathedral-vs-the-Bazaar mindset toward software, this is best seen as an "early" release of text on the subject.</li>
<li>"content fork" -- A "content fork" is mainly when an accidental or unintentional duplication of an article occurs, which isn't the case here. This is the natural growth of a topic beyond the space considerations of the parent article.</li>
<li>"POV fork" -- Perhaps because the POV has had a prosyletizing feel it was thought to be an attempt to put that POV in this article? I'm guessing... It'd be helpful to clarify the "POV fork" argument, because while I see the NPOV shortcomings, I don't see how this is a fork.</li>
<li>"Without any secondary sources, the article qualifies as proselytizing original research." -- Could you cite support for this argument from wikipedia policy? Setting aside "proselytizing" as a separate issue, I know the policies well and your basic argument was a new one to me. The wikipedia policy page <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_original_research.html" title="No original research">No original research</a> doesn't say a "secondary source" is needed in order for an article to not be "original research". The "original research" policy is that articles themselves can't be original -- this article clearly cites that its reference is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Urantia_Book_1493.html" title="The Urantia Book">The Urantia Book</a> and it isn't inventing the term "thought adjuster" or the explanations about it. As this book is in the public domain, direct links to an online edition of the book were even possible, going above and beyond what most articles are able to attain regarding verifiability and adhering to "no original research".</li>
<li>"glossary suffices" -- The entry in the glossary is a short two sentences, and links to this article, exactly because in no way can the glossary by itself adequately get across the topic. It requires treatment in an article.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In many ways this can be seen as analogous to articles on <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> terms like <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thetan.html" title="Thetan">Thetan</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operating_Thetan_ca0f.html" title="Operating Thetan">Operating Thetan</a>, just to cite a couple of examples out of hundreds on wikipedia regarding <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movement.html" title="New religious movement">NRMs</a>. I'm not a Scientologist (or a "Urantian" for that matter, though I know the topic well), but I recognize that movements such as these have beliefs that readers may be curious to read more about and wikipedia is a place where those topics are appropriate. I would agree with MLA on nearly all the terms in the glossary, that they don't merit articles on their own, but of the handful that do, Thought Adjuster is very much on the list. My "keep" vote is as someone who has read the book. <a href="../../../w/a/z/User%7EWazronk_b308.html" title="User:Wazronk">Wazronk</a> 20:04, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> as un-cool as that link is Naconkantari, I fail to see why that should change your vote on the other article, which is well written, and accurate.

<p>The article is completely idiosyncratic.

<p>But the real problem is the assertion that "The date of last eruption determines the classification of the type of volcano", which is not really true, and so nullifies the whole point of the article and make my attempts to figure out how to fix it not really lead anywhere. <a href="../../../j/l/l/User%7EJll_a192.html" title="User:Jll">Jll</a> 14:28, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article was PRODed with reason: "does not meet standard for author/actress, unverifiable". Article was then blanked twice probably by somebody else than author but as the blanker was an IP address it cannot be said for certain. Thus I decided to take the article into AFD as I am not sure whether blanking meant support for deletion or objection. As for the PROD reasoning, existence of Rebecca Davison can be confirmed via Google, she realy published those poems. I added link to the article. As for notability I am not sure. Thus my position is <b>neutral</b>. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJan.Smolik_bd31.html" title="User:Jan.Smolik">Jan Smolik</a> 15:00, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> not someone I've heard of, the link in the article doesn't work for me, and I can't find that much google evidence.

<li><b>Delete</b> I prodded it, thanks for taking care of this Jan. She simply doesn't pass notability required for an author, that being the publishing of a book or, in this case, a collection of poetry. Having one or two poems in a larger volume just isn't enough.

<li>I'm aware of it; I did the redirect anyway on purpose. I thought it was a simple, reversable way of resolving the issue, so I considered it OK to disregard the "letter of the law" in this case.

<p>This article was prodded and a detailed comment left on the talk page. I thought it would be better for AfD where it could get some discussion. My own personal opinion is <b>delete</b> as it is a mess and can always be redone at some later date with better content. If this AfD prompts somone to write a better article this week, then <i>keep.</i> Here is the original prodder's thoughts</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reason for this proposed deletion is that the article seems confused. It partly seems like it's trying to define the crime of sedition, but also gives the impression (by the title) that it is speaking about a single piece of legislature. One statement, which I deleted, said that this was also known as the Alien and Sedition Acts, but those laws were passed in 1798. In addition, I have found no reference to a "Sedition Act of 1861" on the internet except on Wikipedia mirrors. Perhaps the article is meant to refer to the arrest of war protesters and southern sympathizers in 1861? Fightindaman 00:25, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I honestly have no idea how I'm supposed to add to the discussion, so if jsut editing this page was the wrong way, I'd like someone to tell me the right way. It it means anything, receSs is an actual student organization at GWU, as can be seen <a href="http://studentorgs.gwu.edu/merlin-cgi/p/so_printRegisteredOrgDetail/d/462" class="external text" title="http://studentorgs.gwu.edu/merlin-cgi/p/so_printRegisteredOrgDetail/d/462" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The entry in question was written by members of the troupe, so there's no need to fear us accusing wikipedia of slander or spreading false information. At the very least, please wait until after the weekend to decide anything for the page. Because all the members of the troupe are students, we have schoolwork to do during the week, and cannot devote too much time to improving this entry before the weekend.

<li>This is absolutely the right way to add to the discussion. Unfortunately, ReceSs does not seem to have achieved the notoriety necessary for an encyclopedic article that adheres to our policies on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. See also <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> for an idea of how high the bar is set. I assure you that we don't delete articles for being too short or needing improvement, so you don't need to spend so much effort here. If you can think of something that makes ReceSs more notable, such as a national award or media coverage, just add it to the article. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 22:52, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Whoa whoa whoa, receSs is one of the oldest college comedy groups in the country. Our alum have gone on to do such things as moving back in with their parents, starring in FedEx commercials, and getting normal jobs with a wife and kids. I think you people are mean.

<li>I'm sorry you feel that way. Sometimes in life, you're not going to get what you want; presumably that's one of the lessons you learn in college anyway. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 02:33, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not that the age itself is an issue regarding deletion, of course, but there are certainly older college comedy troupes; offhand I can think of several at my former school, including <a href="http://www.exitplayers.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.exitplayers.com/" rel="nofollow">The Exit Players</a> (1984), <a href="http://www.yale.edu/vq/" class="external text" title="http://www.yale.edu/vq/" rel="nofollow">The Viola Question</a> (1985), <a href="http://www.yale.edu/crayon/" class="external text" title="http://www.yale.edu/crayon/" rel="nofollow">The Purple Crayon</a> (1985), and <a href="http://www.yale.edu/justaddwater/" class="external text" title="http://www.yale.edu/justaddwater/" rel="nofollow">Just Add Water</a> (1986). While they are relatively popular in the amateur comedy scene and have notable alumni, none have Wikipedia articles, and rightfully so, I feel. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 21:00, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If it makes any difference, I can vouch for receSs' notability. I am a GW student and can say that receSs is a driving force on campus. They consistently make positive contributions to not only the GW community, but the comedy community as a whole on a national level. ReceSs is one of the oldest and most historically rich college comedy groups in the country. It would be a shame to see this article deleted because of lack of notability or importance. They make GW and America laugh, and laughter is the most important thing in life. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 128.164.102.27 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.164.102.27_0e88.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.164.102.27">contribs</a>) 23:51, 27 February 2006.</small></li>
<li>In all reality, this group has had several members move on to create their own performance groups, such as the No Time Players, Gibney and Gore, and TJ Miller, all with respective amounts of fame and fortune. However, on the basis of your own guidlines, the sheer volume of shows Recess itself has performed on and off campus greatly exceeds the minimum of "5,000 albums, CDs, or similar recordings (see WikiProject Music's Notability and Music Guidelines)" for musicians. Perhaps if we had each played an instrument during our show we wouldn't be being deleted? At approximately 150 people per Recess show, plus one show each semester at a new Comedy Festival (averaging 300 attendees), plus our current rate of three charity shows per semester (averaging 100 attendees), and seeing as how this marks the fifteenth year Recess has been on campus, this would say that Recess has performed for well over 15000 people. These numbers do not even include the fact that originally Recess performed weekly shows rather than monthly. But if you hold comedy groups to a different standard than such "notable" musicians as Racey, Maldita Vecindad y los Hijos del Quinto Patio, or The Arrows. Haven't heard of them? Me neither. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Csingel (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csingel_5a43.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csingel">contribs</a>) 12:24, 1 March 2006.</small>

<li>1) I don't see Wikipedia articles on No Time Players, Gibney and Gore, or TJ Miller. 2) <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> refers to purchases of released, published material, not exposure at performances. 3) You say "we wouldn't be being deleted".

<p><b>Comment</b>. They are not indiscriminate. It is the best way I could think of presenting what is an important, major theological dispute in a NPOV as informatively and concisely as possible. Wikipedia is not intended as a source of general entertainment - there are plenty of tedious index style articles. The point of the quotes is that they make the representation of a viewpoint beyond doubt. Its very different to the titanic example as it allows the religiously inclined to determine for themselves if the contradictions exist. If you think the page is quote heavy, write some analysis. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrippled_Sloth_4708.html" title="User:Crippled Sloth">Crippled Sloth</a> 17:32, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

There is a process of summarizing, grading, organizing and collating involved, to ensure that the resulting articles are as useful as possible for readers seeking both detail and overview</a>. If the quotations are the result of your own research, then that makes it original research; but even if not then the fundamental problem for me is the style. See, for example, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html#Interpretation" title="Christianity">Christianity#Interpretation</a> on how an article might approach the differences between the two branches (although for my tastes that section is lacking in sources). I agree that it could probably be fixed by adding analysis, although I lack the expertise (and the inclination) to do this. I would also be picky about how NPOV the article is. e.g. "(Most) Protestants see salvation as coming..." – How do we know what most Protestants believe?

<li><b>comment</b> The entire section of quotes is still just that, a list of quotes. If you want to write an article about a position (so-and-so feels catholicism is not christianity) then do it. As it stands now it is still a list of quotes preceeded by a brief statement of "context." I would suggest taking each of your sections, writing what Rick Jones, or someone else, believes, and using the quotes to evidence their position. I am open to recinding my vote, but at this time I remain in favor of deletion.

<li>Well biblical views vs catholic views is how many protestants see it (reported POV of some protestants not authors POV), call them catholic bashers if you like. Im reporting this oppinion objectively, not holding it. Its a genuine theological dispute, to claim that reporting it in detail is nasty is censorship. If catholicism is consistent with the king james bible then the 2 views should be the same. As I used a NPOV i left this assesment to the reader. There are a huge number of christians who claim the bible is accessable and says what it means. That profesional scolarship is required to understand the bible is a biased oppinion. If you want to write a section at the end about those who believe that the bible needs expert interperetation, be my guest. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrippled_Sloth_4708.html" title="User:Crippled Sloth">Crippled Sloth</a> 19:33, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's irrelevant that "many Protestants" see it that way. The terminology is inherently biased and directly implies "Well, there's the Catholic view and then there's the <i>Christian</i> view." It's a thinly-veiled way of saying "Catholics aren't real Christians." That's an opinion, not a fact, and opinions are not allowed to be posted as fact on Wikipedia. And I'm not accusing you personally of holding these views; it would be fine with me if you did, as that's your business, not mine. I'm purely concerned about the article and whether or not it adheres to Wikipedia policy. By the way, Catholics generally don't use the King James bible. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 20:02, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Moreover, comparison articles are almost never encyclopedic, nor do they often maintain a neutral point of view. The content in the article is clearly written to advance the notion that catholicism is incompatible with biblical texts; there is no conceivable way to edit such content into a perspective that respects the breadth of religious interpretation that is required to preserve a neutral point of view. —<tt><a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonhalcon_96f2.html" title="User:Donhalcon">donhalcon</a></tt><sup><a href="../../../d/o/n/User_talk%7EDonhalcon_64c9.html" title="User talk:Donhalcon">〒</a></sup> 20:25, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

This tells a researcher and a casual reader precisely nothing about the scope and depth of the topic under discussion and, more importantly, attempt to cover a Point of View. Articles shouldn't be partisan and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is a guide to avoiding this stance. The article tells me nothing about the dispute between the two authors but instead prompts in my mind the question "What line is the author trying to push in the debate?". Secondly, presenting illustrative quotes to raise awareness of a debate is not the same as contributing an encyclopædic article about said debate. <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_write_a_great_article_687a.html" title="Wikipedia:How to write a great article">How to write a great article</a> is a good guide towards constructing something for inclusion in WP. Please read it whilst thinking of further improvements. Why not precis the debate? What is the context? What are the points of view of the contending authors? A NPOV guide to the debate is worth far more than a series of quotations which are really quite boring to read. Sources and citations for researchers? Is this debate continued in journals of religious studies? References to these would be really worth having for any researcher interested in the debate. In summary, NPOV; introduction with topic &amp; scope; analysis of POV of subjects' work; one or two illustrative quotes so as not to disrupt the flow of the article; summary if appropriate; citations, references and further reading. I hope that my comments are useful.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>: 1) the fact that it's quotes makes it original research. Possibly someone else's, but original research nonetheless. An article on the alleged controversy might be encyclopedic, but only if the controversy itself is verifiable. 2) The Bible is inconsistent with itself - you can't reasonably expect any document to be entirely consistent with it. 3) Mainly it violates NPOV as it is merely thinly-disguised Church - bashing. The Catholic Church doesn't claim the catechism is consistent with every single word in the Bible. I only looked through a few examples (I just couldn't take any more) and they all said, not that the Catholic Church isn't Christian, but that it isn't Protestant, hardly a fact meriting it's own article. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 08:35, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>What does <i>Biblical</i> mean? NPOV is violated by the implication that the catechism is flawed, that the contradictions imply something. The Bible is interpreted in a particular context. Aside from the lunatic fringe that believes the Bible is to be interpreted literally, there is no objective measure of what it is to be Biblical. And, again, the catechism isn't intended to be Biblical by <i>Protestant</i> standards; you might as well have an article that the Theory of General Relativity isn't Biblical. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 18:11, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Biblical means consistent with the bible. That the catechism is flawed/contradictions mean something is not an implication. Its the oppinion of many protestants which i am reporting in NPOV. "there is no objective measure of what it is to be Biblical" - most protestants, in fact almost all christians would disagree. Most believe that the bible is literal except for certain well defined parts (the parables) - especially the reported speech of jesus is considered literal. This is an important article as these contradictions are behind much protestant rejection of catholicism - which is noteworthy. No one in their right mind would consider the theory of relativity a biblicaly/christian doctrine - catholicism on the other hand... <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrippled_Sloth_4708.html" title="User:Crippled Sloth">Crippled Sloth</a> 22:04, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>All that you're saying is that Catholicism isn't Protestant (in fact a very specific meaning of Protestant), not that it isn't "Biblical", whatever that is. You're also saying that Catholic (and presumably Greek and Russian and Bulgarian Orthodox) perspectives are not valid in assessing what is Biblical. You might want to check, you know, the Bible, it mentioned Jesus' opinions of the Pharisees who believed they monopolized interpretation. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 23:42, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> I thought I had gotten out of this, but I can't help but come back in now. When you say that almost all christians would disagree that there is no objective measure of what it is to be biblical you are doing one of two things. Either claiming that catholics are not christians, which backs up that this is personal advocacy, or claiming that almost all christians agree to a strict literalist interpretaion of the bible, which is patently false. Most don't care about wearing cloth of two different fibers, for example. Even those that do accept a strict literalist interpretation usually grant some wiggle room for potential human error in transcribing the perfect word of God. Otherwise many would argue that a strict literalist interpretation would make the bible not internally consistent. That is another topic though. The point is that your claim about the meaning of biblical is by no means agreed upon by "nearly all christians". <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENot_my_leg_8d24.html" title="User:Not my leg">Not my leg</a> 22:56, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> i cant see any definition of biblical other than "what the bible says". Some Protestants claim that the inconsistencies mean catholics as non christian (<b>they</b> see christian and protestant as synonymous). This line of argument i am reporting, not advocating. Possibly my last comment came out wrong. what i meant to say was "nearly all christians do not think you can interperet the bible however you like and still call yourself a christian". Most christians see some books (ie gospels) as strictly literal, and others as metaphorical (ie genesis). Not - its all whatever you want it to be. 129.234.4.76 10:42, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>cant see any definition of biblical other than "what the bible says"</i> That's the bias right there.

<p><b>Comment:</b> Summary of the defense case thus far. There seem to be 4 main areas of debate.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>1. Is it NPOV?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I would say so. Its intended as an article on <b>the belief that catholic dogma is inconsistent with the bible</b>. Such a belief is biased and some would call it church bashing. I think i have reported it in NPOV - the quotes from the catechism are catholic view <b>fact</b>. The quotes from the king james are biblical view <b>fact</b>. The commentary is relatively short (and i believe completely objective). If anyone still believes that to be biased/weasel words ill change it if they tell me whats wrong. I think thats everything. It doesnt give catholic counterarguments, see style.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>2. Is it an apropriate topic to wikipedia?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>To reitterate Its intended as an article on <b>the belief that catholic dogma is inconsistent with the bible</b>. If such a belif had a name (something-ism) this dispute wouldnt arrise. The fact that it does not have a such name does not change its appropriateness as it is a theologicaly important, published belief. If you can think of a better name for such an article, then by all means suggest a move - i was at a loss when writing it.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>3. Is is original research?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The quotes given for each argument are the same as in one of the sources, Rick Jones - Understanding Roman Catholicism.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>4. Style</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, its not great. It could really do with more context, and more sections than just the quotes one (for which ive put suggestions in the talk page). Im new to wikipedia, and was under the impression that people could submit work in progress articles and people would help them finish them. If this is not the case, and articles should be finished/rounded before submission then i guess delete it, ill "finish" it outside wikipedia and resubmit it.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>On NPOV</b>. What exactly do you all define NPOV as? I undestood it to mean 1)giving all opinions in reported speech, and 2)not using biased/weasel words in commentary. As far as i can tell ive done this. Are there any requirements ive missed?</li>

<li>Thank you for taking the time to clean up the article. Regading the discussion, <a href="http://dmc.tv/en/index_template.php?title=whatDMC" class="external text" title="http://dmc.tv/en/index_template.php?title=whatDMC" rel="nofollow">this page</a> on the web site states it's satellite. On another note, since the article's been wikified, There might be less reason to delete it now. (Though I would stil consider it far less notable than the 6 free TV and the 20 or so cable channels run by <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Broadcasting_Corporation_3ee3.html" title="United Broadcasting Corporation">UBC</a>, non of which have entries, but I have no idea what their (or other satellite channels') viewership is like, and that shouldn't be the reason this article shouldn't exist anyway.) <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_012_98de.html" title="User:Paul 012">Paul C</a> 10:54, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>HMMM</b>. Clearly Wikisource material were it not the fact that I suspect this text of the license itself is probably not public domain or GFDL. So I'm not going to transwiki and will tag as a possible copyvio. There is no indication that the text itself is licensed under the license (if it were it couldn't be transwikied) not that all rights are released, so we have to presume they are not. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:07, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Update: I realised it has been deleted as a copyvio before. I agree that it is indeed such a violation and have now re-deleted it. Just because the license is for free software does not mean that the license itself is free. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:10, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I was going to AfD InterBase Public License since it's more or less an identical case (though a <i>slightly</i> different license) to the above, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=delete&amp;page=InterBase_Public_License" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=delete&amp;page=InterBase_Public_License" rel="nofollow">it's already been deleted</a>. What's more, it's been deleted and recreated a couple times in the past. I see that this article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Initial+Developer%27s+Public+License" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Initial+Developer%27s+Public+License" rel="nofollow">has also been deleted as copyright violation</a>, which is kind of odd as it's a dump of a license which clearly gives permission to copy! That said, it's clearly unencyclopedic, and whether or not you'd like it on Wikisource it doesn't belong here, so I don't want to quibble with the old deletion too much. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraig_Stuntz_f2ad.html" title="User:Craig Stuntz">Craig Stuntz</a> 17:49, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is the entire text of the article: "Lily Loat was, for many years, secretary of the National Anti-Vaccination League of Great Britain." The remainder of the page? A list of publications (all <b>two</b> of them), two external links, and -- naturally -- "See also <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_vaccine_topics.html" title="List of vaccine topics">List of vaccine topics</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_controversy.html" title="Vaccine controversy">Vaccine controversy</a>." When an article is created as an excuse to post external links, it's called "linkspamming" and it's a criteria for speedy deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> pretty low sales numbers on that book... no opinion on inclusion, but if kept this should probably be moved to John F. X. Knasas.</li>
<li><b>Author's comment</b> Philosophy books generally sell poorly... who reads them besides philosophers within their own interest area, anyway? Amazon sales aren't a good criteria, since libraries are the main purchasers of philosophy books, and they purchase directly from the publisher or through distributors. Also, Knasas has 32 cites in the ISI Web of Knowledge over the last 18 years or so, which means he's active, publishing and recognized. And within the realm of Catholic philosophy, he carries weight... not a "big fish" but up-and-coming. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikNorvelle_557d.html" title="User:ErikNorvelle">Erik Norvelle</a> 15:57, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A consensus is suggested, but you usually do so on the talk pages of the two articles in question (do a <a href="../../../m/e/r/WP%7EMERGE_94d1.html" title="WP:MERGE">WP:MERGE</a> <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerging_and_moving_pages_8b77.html" title="Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages">Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages</a> process). Basically, tag the Merge From on the Tiberian Sun article and Merge To on Tiberian series, note this on both talk pages, explain why there, wait a few days, and then merge and redirect.</dd>
<dd>AfD is the wrong place for the note/consensus. Good that you thought to ask for consensus, but this is the wrong place 8-) I suggest/recommend you cancel your nomination here and do the merge process on the articles per above. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 20:21, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I propose this article to be deleted. What is described is vaguely similar to the CDM, and perhaps mixed up with green investment schemes. The term the author used 'kyoto credits' is sometimes used interchangeably with credits from CDM and JI, though it is not official terminology. The author also cites no sources. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 10:01, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> I originally got involved with this when somebody mentioned it on AfD, asking why this apparant spam was let stand while their article was being proposed for deletion. It does get a few Google news hits, but they seem to all be press releases from Kosmix (and I didn't see any being picked up by any major outlets). Listing here following removal of {{<a href="../../../a/d/v/Template%7EAdvert_8bb0.html" title="Template:Advert">advert</a>}} tag, which indicated to me that if kept, this would always look like spam.

<p>Hi, I'm the owner of the site www.thule-online.co.uk and also host the game server. May I add that the game is actually fully working and has been for 3 years, you may join the game for free. The "under development" bit is a NEW game we are designing using the same engine but completly redesigned. I added this entry as I'd like to add some game faq's and let our players edit the contents, hints &amp; tips etc for the game. 22:45, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That contradicts what is said in the article. The article says that <i>Astonia</i> has been finished for years, but <i>Thule</i> is still under development. ("It will eventually (loong into the future_ be completely independant from it's inspiration with regards to storyline and gameplay.") Unless this changes, <b>delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a crystal ball. I will reconsider my vote if the claims in the article are wrong, and it indeed is about a finished game. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 23:31, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me explain it this way:</p>
<p>We bought the game engine of a game called Astonia V2. Astonia V2 is no longer operating and has been superseeded by Astonia V3 a much improved version. We purchased the license to V2 engine. our intention is to use this engine and make a whole NEW game. Meanwhile we are using the old "world" as a template and have expanded massivlely on it by adding our own quests gfx etc. If you were to view the forum activity you'll see that this is very much an active community and an active game which is fully working. I can understand the confusion between the "under development" and "fully working". i will reupload the image as png if the entry is "accepted" ...never though it was this hard adding an entry to wikipedia!.....</p>
<p>00:02, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There are still a couple more problems with this topic. First, it fails the (not yet active) inclusion guideline <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, having only about 500 forum members. More importantly, it fails the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy, since there seem to be no independent sources writing about this game (correct me if I'm wrong). Third (but that can easily be corrected) it reads a bit more like an ad than like an encyclopedia entry. The way it looks like right now, the game might be worthy of a Wikipedia entry in the future, when it has become more notable, but I don't see that it's there yet. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 00:26, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Never mind...please delete the entry. I don't desire a wiki entry this much...too much hassle. 06:27, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>How can anything fail a not yet active anything? The game is active (ie. up and running), the community is active, permissions are active. It's under development in that it's being continuously developed, quests added, graphics improved, engine developed, etc., as is the case for most active online roleplaying games. It's in their nature. I notice in the complaints regarding this entry a lack of proper research though. How big does a community have to be to be included though? This is not just a piece of software, the software is being used by other games as well, and may or may not be used by 5000 people. It's worth reading that whole page though: "The bound of 5000 users is only one of the criteria for notability, and is intended for software of general use (e.g., a text editor); notability of specialized software is better established by the other criteria." It's quite clear we're not talking about a text editor. Other criteria could be an active and growing community.--84.208.123.136 12:39, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
As the lead developer on Thule I am shocked over the ignorance shown by the moderators here. We have 539 registered users. That is those who is registered, we have several more who play the game but do not visit the MB, but then again some who visit the MB do not play as well. As for the game it is quite as Gekko says fully operational and we move each day further and further away from what MoA was. We have a build server where we update the game, and thus I think we can safely say that the play server is not under development. It just gets updated..:P See how easy it is to twitch the meaning of words just like you yourselves do? Anyway I see no point in continuing this argument as it seems you guys have already made up your mind. Arild N. Lund</p>

<p>I put this up for prod, but the article's creator removed the tag, so I'm listing it here instead. The article is about a band that appears to fail <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. They have no Allmusic page, and I can find no commercial listing of any kind for their album. Google finds only two pages with the band's name: one is a wikimirror, and the other is on MySpace. Also, the article's creator re-inserted a copyright tag at the bottom of the page after I had removed it and suggested that he acquaint himself with the GDFL. The username of the article's creator is the same as that of a member of the band, making this a likely violation of <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> as well. For all of these reasons, I believe that it should be deleted. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 23:01, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I was the one who started the asphyxiation techniques article to create a unified structure for various methods and terms used in forensics, combat sports, in military application. After some research i've however discovered that several methods such as <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strangulation.html" title="Strangulation">strangulation</a> are not pure asphyxiation techniques, and i'll create separate articles for these. I agree that it would be pertinent to <b>merge</b> it into the article on asphyxia, and i'll do it myself. --<a href="../../../-/m/a/User%7E-Marcus-_f62d.html" title="User:-Marcus-">-Marcus-</a> 16:10, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> So my issue is with the term "methods" and similar terms that imply <i>intent</i>. If the article were about ways in which people get asphyxiated, no problem. When it's about how to asphyxiate people, it seems kind of iffy. Could you remove all references to "method" and "technique" and suchlike? --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 16:38, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>No methods are descibed in detail. However this is an encyclopedia, and no topic should be too "iffy" to be covered. Asphyxiation is a major component of chemical warfare and other forms of violence.

<li><b>Merging complete</b>. There seems to be a lack of words to replace "method" and "technique".
