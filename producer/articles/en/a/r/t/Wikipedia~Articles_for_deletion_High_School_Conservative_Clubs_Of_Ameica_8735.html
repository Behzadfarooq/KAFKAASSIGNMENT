<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 11 "delete" votes, 6 "keep" votes and 2 people who abstained. The article was moved (to correct a typo in the title) and edited during the discussion. One of the keep votes was conditional on a "major rewrite" but was made <i>after</i> the rewrite had been accomplished (which implies that the rewrite may not have been sufficient). Reviewing the history, the rewrite strikes me more as copyedit and formatting that the major overhaul requested by the "delete" voters.</p>
<p>I am going to call this one as a "no concensus" which defaults to keep for now. If the article is not substantially improved in a reasonable period of time, it may become appropriate to renominate the article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:34, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Reads like vanity, and every school or university has several dozens of different clubs, some of which are conservative, and most of which are extremely not notable. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 11:18, Jun 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> The title is wrong so it should be moved if it is kept, when doing a <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22High+School+Conservative+Clubs+Of+America%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22High+School+Conservative+Clubs+Of+America%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">search for "High School Conservative Clubs Of America" on google</a> there seems to be a lot of news articles on it though, but I didn't notice any mainstream papers though. If GNAA can have it's own article then perhaps this group as well? --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaunMacPherson_703f.html" title="User:ShaunMacPherson">ShaunMacPherson</a> 12:06, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm afraid that's apples and oranges, since the GNAA is one group with a reasonable amount of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infamy.html" title="Infamy">fame</a>, and the HSCCOA are a large number of small local groups, none of which are particularly special. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 13:10, Jun 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I've never seen Wikipedia's systemic bias so nakedly demonstrated. GNAA, if it's famous at all, is known only as a bunch of Slashdot trolls. This group made headlines and has been noticed by UCB School or Law and the National School Boards Association, and the founder has spoken at the California Republican Assembly's anniversary convention. There's no comparison. HSCA is one organization an ordinary person might in fact have read about in a newspaper and want to know about. GNAA is not even well known to anybody who sets his Slashdot filter to a reasonable level. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:09, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> that this is most certainly a sign of systemic bias on wikipedia. However, I believe we are best served by eliminating both articles. I see no evidence here that this group has done anything important. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 04:01, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but rewrite more NPOV and less vainly. The way the article is written currently, it borders on needing deletion for vanity, but the organization does at least have momentary notoriety in the sphere of freedom of speech in the public school setting, in the form of a <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/national/20031229-105705-1963r.htm" class="external text" title="http://washingtontimes.com/national/20031229-105705-1963r.htm" rel="nofollow">Washington Times article</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> Very poorly written, I would support it with heavy revision. Too much personal promotion of a realatively insignificant figure outside of the local community to which he belongs. - <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouieS_5c23.html" title="User:LouieS">LouieS</a>17:03 Jun 10 2005</li>

<li>Delete: Not a single thing at all, but rather a collection of things not discussed as a topic, but, rather, as if they were coherent. I.e. there is no subject here for a discussion of this type. Instead, there would be a mere whiff of a mention at some conservative-politics-related lemma. However, the clubs in question appear to have next to no effect on the world, so it's very doubtful that even such a mention would be worthwhile. (HS clubs in general don't have much effect, except on themselves.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:17, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Lots of things make the newspaper once. It remains to be seen whether this has any long-lasting impact on society - which can only be judged into the future. Right now this organization has done nothing of note except be in the paper. --<a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 10:49, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This sounds like special pleading to me. We're not making value judgements about the achievements of an organization, we're deciding whether it's reached the level at which it is of interest to more than a few people. We know that UCB School of Law and National School Boards Association are tracking this organisation. We also know that Bueler shared a podium with a Republican Congressman, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Tancredo_2130.html" title="Tom Tancredo">Tom Tancredo</a>, at the California Republican Assembly's 70th anniversary conference in April, in his role as founder of this organisation. That's more than enough. Defending this article feels rather odd to me as a person whose politics are extreme left wing by US standards and virtually diametrically opposed to everything Bueler stands for, but there you are.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:43, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
