<p><a href="../../../c/o/n/Contamination.html" title="Contamination">Contamination</a> (in <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>) most often occurs when seeds which will be sold to be planted are gathered. In this process, <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weed.html" title="Weed">weed</a> seeds may be caught with the product. Most larger seeds are found and removed, but sometimes smaller seeds may continue with the desirable seeds. When planted, the hidden weeds compete for space, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a>, and <a href="../../../n/u/t/Nutrient.html" title="Nutrient">nutrients</a>, which creates an annoying problem for <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farmer.html" title="Farmer">farmers</a>. If the weed is not native to the area and introduced by the seed, it could potentially become very invasive and harmful to other <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plant.html" title="Plant">plants</a>.</p>
<p>Almost the same process can occur with <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flower.html" title="Flower">flower</a> seeds. When the seeds are gathered, weeds are also gathered. Since flower seeds are often sold throughout the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World.html" title="World">world</a>, there is a greater danger that a wild plant could be introduced to an area.</p>

<p>Preventing seed contamination in agriculture is fairly hard, almost impossible. Better <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machines.html" title="Machines">machines</a> constantly help to reduce the number of foreign seeds gathered.</p>
<p>Preventing seed contamination in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetic_engineering.html" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a> is simply a matter of seperating "pure" seeds from contaminated ones.

<p>Pierre Bourque sr. Pierre Bourque sr. (Pierre Henri Bourque ) Developer Ottawa, Canada</p>
<p>Pierre Bourque sr. was born in Lowertown Ottawa in 1932, youngest son of Mayor E.A. Bourque and Evelyn Martin.</p>
<p>He attended Technical High School and Ottawa University.</p>
<p>In 1950 he worked in heating and air conditioning equipment sales for Bourque Freres Ltd,</p>
<p>In 1960 he began his career as a developer.</p>
<p>He purchased part of the Eastern arm of Wakefield Lake, Quebec, subdivided it and sold cottage lots</p>
<p>In 1962 he purchased the Wallingford Fish and Game Club, an 11 lake preserve in Perkins, Quebec, 20 miles from Ottawa.</p>
<p>Perkins Sure le Lac soon became a desirable cottage site. Roads were built and electricity was brought in. Hundreds of cottage lots were sold.</p>
<p>In 1963 he became a partner with brothers Edouard , Bernard, of Laurentian Realties Ltd.</p>
<p>The company won a tender call for downtown Ottawa office space and built the E. A . Bourque Memorial Building in honour of his late father.</p>
<p>They purchased the following two Quebec City companies</p>
<p>Cie the Photogrametrie LtÃ©e. The company executed mapping contracts for the Province of Quebec</p>
<p>Photo Air Laurentide Ltee owned several planes and helicopters and did aerial photography for the Province of Quebec, kept and operated the province`s photo library</p>
<p>In 1963 Bourque built the Carrefour building rue Principale in Hull, Quebec, and leased it to Metropolitan Stores, Laura Secord, Bata, etc</p>
<p>In 1964 his company won another tender and built the Sir Wilfrid Laurier Building, which housed the Department of the Solicitor General.</p>
<p>Bourque bought and leased the Connor Washing Machine plant in Hull, Quebec, to Indian Affairs.</p>
<p>In 1973 the partnership with remaining living brother Edouard was dissolved.</p>
<p>Bourque buildings were sold and Quebec City companies were sold to the Province of Quebec.</p>
<p>In 1980 Pierre Bourque founded Bourque Pierre FILS LtÃ©e</p>
<p>The new Company purchased a 125-acre quarry from Ciment Lafarge LimitÃ©e in the heart of Hull, Quebec</p>
<p>People claimed Bourque had taken leave of his senses, that the deep stone quarry was only good for garbage disposal. Bourque maintains that history will uphold his vision that this site will become the most prestigious piece of land in the Outaouais.</p>
<p>In 1981 Bourque sold eight acres to Provigo for a food store and a few shops. Bourque cut the pumps at the bottom of the quarry and allowed water to find its natural level , becoming a lake in the center of the City of Hull</p>
<p>In 1982 Bourque won a Tender call from Public Works Canada and built the Louis Saint Laurent Building in Hull, which is leased to the Department of National Defence and houses 3,000 employees.</p>
<p>Bourque. gave more than 12 acres of land to the City of Hull of land for Boulevard de la Carriere.</p>
<p>Bourque gave three acres of land to the Quebec Govt. for Exchange St. Raymond.</p>
<p>In 1990 Philippe Bourque, Pierre's youngest son, opened an Acura automobile dealership at the corner of St. Raymond and Boulevard de la Carriere.</p>
<p>In 1986 Bourque purchased La Culbute , the waterfalls between MacArthur &amp; Grand lakes. He added to the this some 3 miles of waterfront on Grand lake. ,as well as one mile on MacArthur lake. This year round high end home development is known as Grand Rivage</p>
<p>In 1990, Public Works called a tender for a building to house Transport Canada.</p>
<p>Bourque engages world-renowned architect Moishe Safdie to design the building.</p>
<p>Bourque's was the winning tender but the Government cancelled the project, citing capital costs when, in fact, none were involved. The building was to be leased only.</p>
<p>Bourque renegotiated a new 25- year Lease-Purchase agreement with the Conservative Government which provided an option for the Government of Canada to purchase the Louis St. Laurent building in for $15,000,000 (Fifteen Million Dollars) in 20016</p>
<p>In 1991 Bourque sold 10 acres to Canadian Tire to build a giant store.</p>
<p>In 1992, the Company won a competition and sold land to Casiloc, the Quebec Casino Corporation.</p>
<p>In 1995 Casino du Lac Leamy opened its doors. and year later, a 250-room Hilton Hotel and Conference Centre was built - an investment of $500,000,000 (Five Hundred million Dollars.)</p>
<p>Since 2000 Bourque has been waging a legal battle with mortgage holder, Sun Life, et al, who want to take the possession of the St. Laurent Building.</p>
<p>Bourque is suing Sun Life for $11,000,000 (Eleven Million Dollars) in damages. Since 1991, Sun Life has never missed one month's rent from the Government of Canada.</p>
<p>The Rent is based on Government of Canada bond rates. Quebec Superior Court judge Marcelin called Sun Life as "piggish" for wanting to charge Bourque with 12% interest, 4.5% additional percentage points in interest over the 7 3/4 % going rate and the one set by the court. Sun accepted the court set 7 3/4 %.</p>
<p>Pierre Bourque is asking the Quebec Superior court to fast track his lawsuit .</p>
<p>In 2005, Pierre Bourque became a consultant to IMMOBILIARE Developments Ltd, one of his son Philippe`s companies.</p>
<p>The company is offering to build 1.3 million square feet of office space for the Government of Canada on land adjoining the Louis St. Laurent site.</p>
<p>The $200,000,000 (Two Hundred Million Dollar) complex could accommodate 5,000 federal employees.</p>
<p>Pierre Bourque has been an avid connaisseur of Canadian art since the middle 1950s. At different intervals he has had in his private collection works of his friends Stanley Cosgrove , Goodridge Roberts, Leon Bellefleur , Claude Picher , Henri Masson, and A.Y.Jakson. Other artists of interest include Rene Richard , Marc Aurele Fortin, John Eaton , Molly Lamb Boback , Bruno Boback , Norval Morrisseau , Muelstock, William Pratte,George Pepper, Robert Hyndman , Pierre Huot ,and numerous others</p>
<p>In 1956 Pierre Bourque married Barbara Joan McNeil. They have three children.</p>
<p>Pierre AndrÃ© Bourque ( Bourque Newswatch )</p>
<p>Julie Mariette (Milton), RN, CMPA</p>
<p>Philippe Henri ( Casino - Acura , Immobiliare Developments Ltd.)</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bourque reside in Ottawa.</p>
<p>In 1996, Pieere Bourque Sr. was convicted in Superior Court, Ottawa, of Income Tax Evasion. He was also the subject of investigation after the Canadian Liberal party, then in governent, was found to be over-paying him for the St. Laurent building in Hull.</p>

<p>Josef "Sepp" Allerberger is recognized as the second leading German sniper of WW II with a total number of recognized kills at 257. Josef served all of his time, 1943-1945, on the Eastern Front fighting the Russians. In one engagement alone he killed 58 Russians which prompted his recognition by higher and the eventual award of the Knight's Cross. Due to the German Army's strict accountability system he was never given full credit for his total number of kills. His total number of kills was most likely double of what is recognized.</p>

<p>Officer Candidates Class (OCC) - Like the Marine Corps other commissioning programs, PLC (Jr, Sr, Combined) Officer Candidates Class is another means by which one can qualify to become a commissioned Marine Corps Officer. The basic premise of the OCC is to train, screen and evaluate those candidates who have already graduated from a four year college or university. Candidates can expect training exactly of those in a PLC combined course. Courses are conducted throughout various times during the year, mainly in the summer and winter. Candidates receive training and academics on basic infantry tactics, Uniform Code of Military Justice, weapons handling, basic navigation, and Marine small unit leadership. Physical training in an OCC class is rigorous and demanding. Daily physical training (PT) along with PT events such as obstacle courses, endurance courses, stamina courses, individual movement courses, navigation courses, combat courses, and individual runs are conducted to evaluate a Marine Officer Candidate's level of physical fitness and command ability, as Marines are expected to "lead from the front." The OCC is usually a ten week course. After successful completion, Candidates are normally commissioned as 2nd Lieutenants in the Marine Corps Reserve. www.marineofficer.com</p>

<p>Mud weight refers to the density of drilling fluid in a well bore, measured in terms of Mass/Volume e.g. lbs/gallon, lbs/cubic foot, kg/cumbic metre.</p>
<p>Drilling fluids are important to lubricate and cool the drill head, prevent unwanted inflow of fluids into the well bore and to prevent collapse of the openhole and casing.</p>
<p>It is important to balance the weight of the mud against the anticipated pressures down the well. Unexpected sudden jumps in the pressure regime can cause the inflow of fluids into the well which can lead to a dangerous blowout. Having to high a mud weight can cause loss of circulation of drilling fluids, infilling pores and damaging the drilled stratigraphy.</p>

<p>In the unoffical novels based in the Halo universe Dom or Spartan 118 is a experimental solider for the spartan 2 program. He is paired of with three other soliders to form the ultimate tactical squad.</p>
<p>Dom is the leader of the unit and uses his modified sniper rifle which he personally created himself Although he works efficently with all squad mates he works bes with 069 who he refers to as his brother weather or not that is true we are unsure but they act as thoguh they are.</p>
<p>The spartan squad in the origanal novels were more comedic but in the newer novels the spartans become more serious and put the mission ahead of themselves</p>

<p>He displays incredable strength but has never used it in an actual one on one fight, many have fought him but only a few have seen him close up, this is because he attacks from long range and rarely ever engages in hand to hand combat.</p>

<pre>
o-y is a term developed from Northeastern Massachusetts in the Lowell area. 
</pre>
<p>The term is used in context of something bad happening (usually a strike or blow to the groin area). The term "o-y" came to be because that is what is usually uttered by the person as the bad event is occuring to him or her.</p>
<p>"oh, why!"</p>
<p>FACT: o-y also came to be as a variation of Nancy Kerrigan's "Why me?" however it was used inappropriately as "Oh why?"</p>

<p>Most catalogs tout the term "ringspun cotton" to describe the fiber used in their garments, but few people know what it means. "Ringspun" refers to cotton spun using the ring spinning method. This method of spinning came into being in 1828, when John Thorp patented the ring spinner, but did not actually catch on in wide use until the 1840s. It displaced other earlier spinning methods like the mule because it had the advantage of spinning the fiber continuously and winding it onto a bobbin for storage in one motion. Although it too was a continuous spinner, the flyer frame was largely abandoned after the Civil War in favor of the ring spinner.</p>
<p>Today, ring spinning is the most widely used method for spinning fibers, and is used not just for cotton but for manmade fibers, whether they are fine or coarse.</p>

<p>Roddy Woomble is the lead singer and lyricist of the Scottish band Idlewild. Born on August 13th 1976, Woomble moved around significantly during his childhood, living in France when young before moving to America where he started his first band with a friend, called The Zoobies From Mars. He recalls with amusement that they had a song called The Zoobies from Mars Will Kick Your Face. He then moved back to Scotland and at nineteen began a degree in Photography. Living in Edinburgh, he met Colin Newton and Rod Jones, both future members of Idlewild. Woomble took the name of his band from the quiet meeting place in Anne of Green Gables, his favourite book at the time â an ironic choice since the band was reknowned in their early days for their loud and chaotic gigs, during which Woomble would contort himself desperately into manic shapes behind the microphone. However as Idlewild matured, they have mellowed into a gentler band and Woombleâs deep and richly melodic voice, now more often heard singing rather than yelling, has on many occasions been justly likened to that of Michael Stipe from REM. He moved back to the United States after the success of Idlewildâs top ten album, The Remote Part, and lived in New York for some time developing a love for America whilst nurturing his pride in Scotland. Having hinted in an interview in More magazine in 2002 that he was keen on messy-haired bassist ladies, in late 2005 Woomble married his girlfriend Ailidh Lennon, who plays bass for the Glaswegian punk-folk band Sons and Daughters, a group that has supported Idlewild on several occasions.</p>
<p>Projects outside of Idlewild In 2002, Woomble worked with the Reindeer Section on the album Son of Evil Reindeer, providing the lead vocals on the gentle ballad Who Told You. He also collaborated with Kate Rusby for her 2005 album Girl Who Couldnât Fly which was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2006 BBC Folk Awards, singing backing vocals for the songs No Names, Wandering Soul and Fare Thee Well, which was nominated for Song of the Year. He is now working with songwriter Karine Polwart (to whom he presented the award for Horizon Award at the BBC Folk Awards 2005) and producer (and husband of Kate Rusby) John McKusker on his first solo album which is set to be released in mid-2006, around the same time as the upcoming Idlewild album. He performed live with John McKusker in Glasgow and with Karine Polwart, both in January 2006.</p>

<p>Hollis, Thomas (1720â1774), political propagandist, was born in London on 14 April 1720, the only child of Thomas Hollis (d. 1735). Hollis was educated at Adams Grammar School in Newport, Shropshire, then in St. Albans for a short while before spending 15 months in Amsterdam, where he learned Dutch, French, writing, maths, book keeping in preparation for a business career. He lived with his father, who died in 1735, and then under the guardianship of John Hollister. He took chambers in Lincoln's Inn, though without reading law, from February 1740 to 1748. By then he was extremely wealthy, having inherited from his uncle and also from his father and then in 1738, his grandfather.</p>
<p>In 1748â9 he toured Europe with a friend Thomas Brand (late Brand Hollis), and, then during 1750â53, mostly on his own, during which he met many leading French philosophers and several Italian painters. Back in England he was an dedicated member of the Society of Arts, and chaired for a time its committee on the polite arts. A member of the Society of Antiquaries, he proposed <a href="../../../p/i/r/Piranesi.html" title="Piranesi">Piranesi</a> for membership of the Society of Antiquaries, gave numerous commissions to <a href="../../../c/i/p/Cipriani.html" title="Cipriani">Cipriani</a>, and, as amongst Canaletto's closest friends in England, commissioned six paintings from him. he became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1757. He was accused by some of being an atheist, Hollis was a rational dissenter, he favoured Caleb Fleming's ministry at Pinners' Hall. He was anti-Catholic and campaigned vigorously against popery; he became convinced that he was the intended victim of a Catholic plot. He had a wide network of friends, among them liberal churchmen such as Francis Blackburne and Theophilus Lindsey, John Wilkes, several peers, and especially the elder William Pitt.</p>
<p>Hollis believed citizenship should be active: individuals had an important role to play in public life. He fulfilled this responsibility by charitable work as a governor of Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals, and a guardian of the asylum and Magdalen Hospital.</p>
<p>Following his great-uncle Thomas's practice, Hollis was a great benefactor to American colleges, especially <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a>, sending donations and numerous books, often decorated with libertarian symbols. From 1755 his principal American correspondent was <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Mayhew_7ded.html" title="Jonathan Mayhew">Jonathan Mayhew</a> of Boston, and, after his death in 1766, Andrew Eliot. He also followed worsening Anglo-American political relations during the 1760s. Declining to participate directly in politics he published short pieces in the newspapers and printed and circulated colonial tracts in Britain, frequently subsidizing the printers to ensure their appearance. In particular he contributed to the successful campaign against the appointment of an American bishop by reprinting sermons by Mayhew and others. He also compiled The True Sentiments of America in 1768; it incorporated John Adams's Dissertation on the Canon and the Feudal Law, which he greatly admired. But he denied inciting the colonies to independence.</p>
<p>Horace Walpole considered Hollis âas simple a poor soul as ever existedâ. Cipriani, described him as being over 6 feet tall and Herculean in size &amp; strength, possessing bright brown eyes, a short nose, and laughing mouth. He also remarked on his gentleness and sweetness of manner. Exhausted by the effort of what he originally intended as only a ten-year campaign to disseminate libertarian tracts, Hollis retired in 1770 to Urles Farm, at Corscombe, Dorset, where he owned about 3000 acres. He died there suddenly on 1 January 1774, and was buried in one of his fields and the grave ploughed over. He was unmarried, and after minor legacies left his estates to Thomas Brand, who added Hollis's name to his own.</p>

<p>George Wooten was an obscure proffesional boxer during the 1970's-mid 1980's. He was known as "Chicken George" as, being from West Virginia, he was a well known "Cock Fighter" from the region. He was known mostly for his powerful all or nothing boxing style and going his entire career without losing a single match by knockout. At the height of his career he was schedualed to fight with the, then recently turned proffesional, Mike Tyson, though due to weather conditions this fight never took place. He has since fallen into obscurity, and according to some local officials in his home town of Oceana, WV he has a mounting police record. Sadly, this is the fate of a great deal of boxers who cannot keep up with the "ride" of Championship Boxing.</p>

<p>In my childhood i was very not indifferent to music, my parents discovered music talents in me and sent me to study piano playing. In the school very quickly i got spoiled with the fact that the teachers are taking me as a very gifted kid and easily forgive me being not pedant with doing my homework, and, being a normal kid, i used to prefer spending my time outside with my friends over playing piano for hours and hours. So i did not become a brilliant piano-player (later - violin player as well). Once i was in one of the summer pioneer camps, where, as it was usual in the pioneer camps, there was a choice of hobby-groups organized to full a pioneer's free-time, like sewing, drawing, pyrography and more. What was special - there was a band where i joined immediately. There i was singing popular songs from movies, we were performing in our pioneer camp and in ones around, i liked it so much, that after the season was over and everybody went back home i decided to continue doing this, found out that in the culture center of our region there is a band rehearsal place. I came there and asked a band if i can join them, but the answer was "no", because i am too young - 11 years old. 2 years later, in 1987, i was studying in the school of young geologist in the Moscow State University, after finishing this school i was planning to go on with geology, but it did not happen because there was a boy in our group who was a HMR fan. He inspired me a lot, so one day me and my friend got to the concert of a Russian thrash-metal band "Master". Inspiration that we got that day i have been surviving till now, next week we started our band with 2 acoustic guitars and microphone from stereo-recorder. With time we developed into a normal band with normal stuff and i started to play bass.</p>
<p>Part II. Serious experience Here i want to tell only about the most serious bands i used to play with. The first serious band I joined was "Female Disease", in the beginning of rock'n roll movement in Soviet Union this band was famous as the one and only female punk-rock band, shocking with lyrics, behavior and the rest of complete. I used to play with them from 1991 till 1993, till the time when I started my own band, where I could express my own musical ideas, which was for me much more interesting, because the punk-rock style is not what I ever liked.</p>
<p>That band used to call "Binger", another female band in my life. We had all the experience, from the beginning with rehearseling in our flats till concerts at respectable places, playing in big festivals and appearing on TV and radio music shows, later, in 1999, with a guitar player from "Binger"- Ira "Monstr" (she is sweet, that's why we called her "rock monstr" or just "monstr") we did a project of electronic music, called "XL". What is always happening with young girls - they are getting married, getting pregnant, that problem we could not avoid, that's why "Binger" was finished somewhere in 1999.</p>
<p>While "Binger" was in it's blossom, I joined a band, that i really liked a lot that time, "Boney Nem", Together we have spent 2 years, made a CD "Melodies and rhytmes of world's pop - II".</p>
<p>Next was "8 Marta", another punk-rock female band, but there's not much to remember about that time, maybe, because a big part of it me and Galina, leader of "8 Marta", spent in trips and psychedelic researches.</p>
<p>Time changes music a lot, music in my head - too, by the end of 90's it was not rock'n roll anymore. To express the new-time inspiration we've made "XL", got a contract from a biggest and the best, as we thought, label "Mediastar". Was good, we did something, but after a year by a few reasons we've got apart.</p>
<p>And this is the beginning....</p>
<p>Listen to "XL"</p>
<p>Visit the "BoneyNem" website</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Part III. In Holland In September 2003 i moved to live in Amsterdam. Soon after this i have met a very nice band called "Airbag" that was looking for a bass-player, we liked each other and i joined this band.</p>

<p>Teen Missions International is an interdenominational evanagelical Christian mission organization that specializes in sending teenagers on short-term mission trips, usually during their summer or holiday breaks. Teen Missions is headquartered in Merritt Island, Florida but has bases situated around the world. Their training is a boot camp style jungle camp incorporating Bibilical and evangelical Christian themes. The training program is known as "The Lord's Boot Camp." The training lasts one to two weeks. The teams of teenagers and adult leaders are then commissioned to their project locations for another three to eight weeks. They end their project time at a one week debrief location, usually at one of multiple Teen Mission's bases around the world. Teen Missions runs year round mainly operating to prepare and support the short term teenager programs. Teen Missions also runs Bible,Missionary,and Work (BMW) training centers and orphanages around the world. It runs a conference center at its Merritt Island, Florida location and a campground nearby. Teen Missions also sponsers a touring group of international young adults known as the Missionaries To America and a life size replica of the Biblical Isreali tabernacle which is housed for tours at different locations throughout the United States.</p>

<p>History</p>
<p>Teen Missions International was started on May 6,1970 in Ohio. The founders included director Robert M. Bland, Bernie Bland, Gayle "Widder" Will, and Jim Person. Robert Bland came up with the idea for Teen Missions while serving as director for the local Youth For Christ. He seen a need for an effective program for teenagers to experience missions work firsthand. The initial program was started in Ohio in 1971 and was later relocated to a swampland area off of Hall Road in Merritt Island, Florida.
