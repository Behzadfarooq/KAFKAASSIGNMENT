<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I'm sorry to say, but Consumption Junction were to be deleted, we would have to delete anything else along these lines.

<li><b>Strong Neutral+Comment</b>. It doesn't violate WP:ATK, Wikipedia's not suitable for minors, and there's nothing that says that thie site can't be allowed. That being said, this is not an easy choice, as there are no references an it doesn't look encyclopedic as it it written now. Granted, no one ever bothered to put an unrefernced tag up (i'm doign that after I post this). But yeah, all these anon keeps aren't helpign matters at all, and they're almost pushing me towards delete.

<li>Does "freedom of speech" mean that you can go down to your local newspaper and demand that they print your manifesto? No? Then why does "freedom of speech" mean that Wikipedia needs to have an article about a website which can't demonstrate that it meets Wikipedia's pre-existing criteria for notability? Sorry, but the freedom-of-speech issue is a total red herring. There's no freedom of speech being impinged here. When someone is preventing you from saying what you want to say using <i>your own</i> resources, <i>then</i> there's a freedom of speech issue.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Find sources to state that CJ is as big as some users above claim it to be. According to alexa.org, it is in the mid 2000's rank or so. Thousands of websites are larger, and there surely arent thousands of article dedicated to every one of those articles that outrank CJ in terms of traffic. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, I think this discussion has been poisoned by CJ, the website users there tend to be a bunch of wanna-be tough dudes and wanna-be sick people who think it's heroic to screw with a discussion with a legitimate website like Wikipedia. I saw if this fails, we do it again, most of the supporting users have no history at all with Wikipedia, and we ought to keep our eyes wide open for shill votes and arguments pulled from thin air.</p>

<li>Keep: Unless our function is to prevent those people who are too weak to prevent themselves from clicking on a site that might offend them. This is an information site, not a censor. "Google" that particular web site and WP is just one of hundreds of hits. I'm sure that any of the search engines will produce the same result. Deleting it will only serve to discredit WP as a viable resource.Bobozr 18:23, 7 January 2007 (UTC) <small>â€” Bobozr (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bobozr_dc91.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bobozr">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li>Dictionary.com is an information site. Should it have an entry for consumptionjunction? Google Maps is an information site. Should it have an entry for consumptionjunction? Instead of merely claiming that Wikipedia <i>must</i> cover your favored website in order to retain its credibility (because we've never heard <i>that</i> argument before, of course) why not produce some evidence that the website <i>meets Wikipedia's criteria for what information to cover</i>? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:35, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> with a chainsaw. There is nothing in this discussion that even mildly comes close to qualifying as a legitimate reason to keep it. Contrary to the claim that Wikipedia is an "information site", <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is, in fact, specifically <i>not</i> a collection of information</a>, it is an encyclopedia. The assertion that removing the article constitutes "censorship" is ludicrous--first because using that as a rationale for "keep" is a blatant admission that the WP article is nothing more than an advertisement, second because it clearly indicates an abject failure to understand the meaning of censorship. When WP goes out and tries to get this website shut down, then that silly argument will hold a little bit of water; until then, it's crazytalk. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 20:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Stile project has an entry, and no request that its entry be deleted. CJ is at least as prominent, and shares similar history and user base (mentioned online by Howard Stern, outrage over the Nick Berg video that garnered national media attention). At most, CJ should be combined into a single page for the SickSite Network, like StileNet's entry.</p>
<p><b>GALVINIZED KEEP FROM FORMER AND DISGRUNTLED CJ WRITER!</b> Humbly stated, for all this vaunted, anacronym laden attempted highbrow "discussion" and back and forth is clearly over an issue that is most certaintly not about what does or does not constitute a valid Wikipedia article, but rather what a minority of individuals find to be intellectually palitable. Oh how shallow the depths of the mind become in action; in the short and sweet, if CJ was a site representing a financial quarterly that just happened to pull in an estimated 1.4 million unique IP per day audience, I grately doubt there would be such a fuss to be made. Consumption Junction created a legitimate cultural phenomenon, and whether the fruits of its proliferation would be welcome in the living rooms of the happily veiled "Moral" financialy secure class is utterly irrelevant. If Wikipedia is to be a depository of information made "by actual and average/real" individuals, it is at best elitism and at worst blatant censorship/revisionism to so calously delete the existence of this very real part of american media and culture, regardless of the fact that the entry was put together extremely poorly and was in desperate need of copius amounts of re-working, most likely due to the fact that Aaron "Phil" Dinin was involved, and should probably made to wear a helmet when he leaves the house, as everything he touches on CJ instantly turns to a parodoxical mix of attempted low brow humor and hidden high society roots. I have read the words, in great majority, calling for the reinstatement of this article, and here I add mine, even though I left the site, even though I would rather practice corporal mortification than work with the current editorial administration, no one can take the site away from its millions of patrons, nor can they take away what it was, and what it may again be in the future. <b>Carlin</b></p>
