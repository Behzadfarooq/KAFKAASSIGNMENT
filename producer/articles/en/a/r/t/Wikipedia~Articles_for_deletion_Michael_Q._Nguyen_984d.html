<p>So now every high school student with a few thousand hours of community service on their resume and a few newspaper cites deserves a WP article. Tried a speedy delete on Michael Nguyen, admin deleted it then the article was moved here. Subsequent speedy delete was not even contested, just removed by the two adamant editors. I think its pretty much clear that this does not meet WP notability. --User208.251.153.9 00:20, 27 March 2006 (UTC) <i>NOTE: User's first edit to Wikipedia.</i></p>

<p>According to User208.251.153.9 above, I disagree. Although I have tried to improve the article to make it become more of WikiPedia's standards, the article itself could be further improved. I don't believe admin deleted this particular article (only the redirect move from SallyD1265.) Although I have only restructured how the information was presented originally by author SallyD1265, and have read/heard bits of information on Michael from several people through making my contribution, the speedy deletion was always contested and the original speedy deletion was deleted upon changing the article. I stuck to WP's standards. To settle this dispute, the subject of the context, Michael Nguyen, should be contacted in order to state whether he may want his information disclosed like this. KhoiFish 04:44, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS. Not every high school student can achieve a high number of hours such as this. 1,000 hours is equivalent to approximately 47 days without rest (working 24 hours a day), therefore making it significant. A typical (non-homeschooled) student on average spends approx. 8 hours a day on education, I believe (from time spent at school.) This article seeks to inspire others to follow his example and state that despite going to school, one can also achieve in other things as well. KhoiFish 04:47, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not trying to produce a not worthy WP article, however this subject has caught my attention as a figure who has potential to develop himself. His work that he's done for others should speak for itself. KhoiFish 04:51, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> not notable. Doing charity work and being involved in minor up-and-coming political work is not sufficient.

<li><b>Keep</b> per SallyD1265. (moved decision) - after withdrawn old ruling. More: Just would like to comment on user Denaar's comments - Orange County, California and Los Angeles County, California is one of the most industrialized and populous areas. Newspapers and media from around the area mainly focus on crime and improvements, not only student achievement. To surpass and make the headlines in the region is something that must be distinguished and not "just another kid" who does charity work. In addition, Denaar stated that kids "work" more than 11.5 hours a week - is this voluntary or paid? As stated in the article, Michael's work has all been UNPAID. - Hard to live in Orange County, California (per homes/territorial costs) with an unpaid position, if you ask me. This shows unselfishness, dedication, and his good quality work to be a great asset to the community. Not many people work without a salary or no monetary gain for themselves.

<li>None of which is relevant to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">inclusion standards</a>. "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" and "persons being featured in the paper" are, to me, two completely different things. Why should we have an article on him and not about every other person mentioned in the links provided (for example, <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/ocr/2004/09/25/sections/news/news/article_251148.php" class="external text" title="http://www.ocregister.com/ocr/2004/09/25/sections/news/news/article_251148.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>)? No one is denying that this student is doing good things, and I certainly wish him the best in the future, but at the same time, I'm hard pressed to find, even among all of the keep recommendations, any indication of meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> (<a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>Wait, wait. Volenteer work helps with admission into hard-to-get-into Colleges and Universities. Are you telling me he won't benefit from this? Its great for his resume, he will definately benefit, as he has obvious political aspirations. Nothing he has done meets the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO inclusion standards</a>. Therefore it doesn't belong here. I also would be shocked to find a newspaper that does NOT have human interest stories, even the Chicago Tribune and Sun Times have human interest stories. Denaar 01:09, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - It is true that volunteer work helps with admission into hard-to-get-into colleges and universities, however, excessive volunteer service and low academic marks does not merit or suffice getting an acceptance. Colleges are looking for well rounded students who are lucid and demonstrate excellence in both academics and extracurriculars. It doesn't state exactly anywhere in the article Mr. Nguyen's GPA and/or test scores, however it does state that he's in the Troy Tech and International Baccalaureate Programs and Troy High School is the 21st Ranked HS in the Nation, that does have some say in that he's not just another person, but at least a bright kid. I remember back in my high school years I didn't have that much community service or awards to talk about. 69.227.174.34 01:28, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>MORE: It seem as if the "CHOC" linked article back to the Orange County Register, plus look at the date (2004, Sept. 25) -doesn't state how many hours or specific achievements; it only speaks about one aspect about [those] respective individuals. It only serves as a summary of one activity. The focus should be on the work done in other accomplishments that are notable, such as (for example, <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/homepage/article_777636.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/homepage/article_777636.php" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) Still, there are probably more places on the net, however not yet posted in the article's external links. 69.227.174.34 18:43, 2 April 2006 (UTC) ADDITION: As per meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> The following statement(s) are present: "The following types of people may merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them. This is not intended to be an exclusionary list. Just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted." Those bullet points do not make a complete listing of what should be put on or off Wikipedia, only as a guideline. If the person has influenced many people, isn't that go towards the public liking him? (i.e. if he does good work, not bad.) I agree with user Kinu that not everyone should merit an article on WikiPedia, however those who exemplify something that surpasses the overall population should be taken into consideration as well. Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales has called it "an effort to create and distribute a multilingual free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language." and through this the more significant articles that they have the better. This is one of them. My perception is that hoax articles and "trashy" written ones who present one-time non-notable achievements should be put away and speedy deleted. This article, is different in that it is different in consistency and with progressing achievements. It has a good chance of being expanded in the future, as Michael goes on to continue his work with this pace. 69.227.174.34 19:13, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Kinu. Denaar 12:48, 27 March 2006 (UTC) More: 1800 hours in 3 years is 11 hours a week. Many high school kids have jobs that are more than 11.5 hours a week, I know I did. I was on the front cover of my local newspaper 4 times in Jr High/High School, I'm certainly not notable (enough for Wiki ^o^). Local news coverage, local awards, student seat on a local government? This is all "15 minutes of fame." Looks like a vanity article to help the future career of this student. Denaar 17:02, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per KhoiFish. Michael Nguyen has recently been recognized by the latino-dominated culture of the City of Santa Ana for presenting "the volunteerism experience" to school district board members and was featured on Adelphia Communication's Southern California News, in three appearances. Although media is limited, it is rare for a high school student to be featured numerous times during their time in school as well. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESallyD1265_6c1b.html" title="User:SallyD1265">SallyD1265</a> 06:35, 30 March 2006 (UTC) <i>NOTE: User has already recommended "keep" above.</i>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Um, in response to your comment, a person would have to know more about your life in order to render such a decision of either to be on WikiPedia or not. Specifically, being on the paper doesn't mean much, only the things accomplished that really matter. This young man out of the hundreds of thousands of teens in the region where he lives HAS made a difference and benefitted others from the things that he does. The role of the Media serves to depict him to others who he has not had a chance to come in contact with about his life. 69.227.174.34 01:28, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Exactly. I'm not notable. Student politicians are not notable (I didn't get in the paper because of politics though). That's what Youth Councils are - youth members of political parties join them.<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 01:40, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - On your statement above: "student politicians are not notable" - are you discriminating/stereotyping everyone to never be notable. This is outrageous. What you're saying is that if you're a student, you basically are worthless and haven't accomplished anything. It is a bit prejudicial. 69.227.174.34 01:48, 3 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - In the context of what we are talking about, " student politicians are not notable " - means that they are not notable, unless they do something more with it, that it is not a sufficient baseline criteria. "Not notable" also means not sufficient to be included for WP, this does not mean that they are useless.<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 01:57, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

The reason that I believe for this article to be noteworthy is because I have witnessed myself the leadership ability of Michael, by knowing him indirectly through school organizations. He is a unique - or if not - freakish individual when it comes to Community Service. As by WikiPedia standards, I know that everyone has a say and I am in no way trying to violate this policy by asserting my opinion.
