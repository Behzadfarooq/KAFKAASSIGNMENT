<dd><b>Comment</b> No independent sources in the article. If Wikipedia itself is the only possible source, then the subject is undeserving of an article. Seems like just an inappropriate self-reference to me. Is the article on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> not enough to satisfy any of our "articles about Wikipedia" needs? (Save for "offshoots" of the article on Wikipedia, like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_in_popular_culture.html" title="Wikipedia in popular culture">Wikipedia in popular culture</a>.) Please prove to me how it passes WP:WEB, WP:SELF, and WP:NOR. <font color="green">—</font><b><a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdGl_582c.html" title="User:EdGl"><font color="DarkGray">Ed</font><font color="DarkKhaki">Gl</font></a></b> 22:30, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would say that all of the information in this article is easily derivable from Wikipedia's own information content services, as well as Bi-lingual Wikipedians who contribute to both Wikipedias. (and we'll assume that there are sources for the language of the Maldives, if not, then you'd best object to that elsewhere). And the reason why the article on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is not appropriate for this information is simply a matter of convenience. That article is large enough without trying to describe every language. Yes, this is a shorter one, but some of the others are not, and those have enough details that they should clearly be kept. Given that, I'd rather keep articles on all of the languages than none. And I don't have to prove how it meets any of those standards, since I don't believe any of those standards are appropriate in deciding whether or not to keep this entry, or any of the others. It's clear to me that Wikipedia should document itself, and part of that documentation is information on the foreign language version. To do otherwise just seems strange to me. But then, I said as much in the Czech language discussion. You aren't offering anything new, in fact, you're repeating the same arguments given there. They aren't convincing. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:20, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I have a strong argument in that this article violates policies and fails notability guidelines. The "repetitiveness" of my arguments have nothing to do with their strength, and "they aren't convincing" is merely your opinion (which I respect). You said "And I don't have to prove how it meets any of those standards, since I don't believe any of those standards are appropriate in deciding whether or not to keep this entry, or any of the others." What makes this article an exception? We can all of a sudden disregard policy and notability guidelines? I am very skeptical about your statements, which provide a weak argument at best in my opinion. <font color="green">—</font><b><a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdGl_582c.html" title="User:EdGl"><font color="DarkGray">Ed</font><font color="DarkKhaki">Gl</font></a></b> 01:53, 29 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, we can disregard guidelines like that, when they're not appropriate. It's called common sense, and it's a valuable asset in making all decisions. Wikipedia should describe itself(Wikipedia is notable, for many reasons, but even if it wasn't, I'd say it would be important for the site to be able to describe itself). Wikipedia has foreign-language components(if you don't believe this is the case, I suggest you visit wikipedia.org). Since they clearly exist, they should also be described. Given the potential length of those articles, having seperate articles is probably the best way to do that. Can you come up with a good reason why having this article is a real and substantial problem? I can't. Can you come up with a better way to do things? I doubt it, but you're welcome to make suggestions as to other options. However, deletion is not one of them. It's not effective. If you've gotten any objections to the content, you can check it seperately, but please don't try AfD's for cleanup. Anyway, you can cite policies all you want, but if you'll check things like WEB, SELF, others, they have exceptions and clarifications that clearly show they aren't to be adhereded to like a bunch of mindless machines. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:52, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>we can disregard guidelines like that, when they're not appropriate</i>. I hope the closing admin will take comments like that into account when deciding on something like this. If we start ignoring <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, then where does it stop? We might as well throw <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> out the window. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 18:28, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The first paragraph of <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>: "Topics in most areas must meet a minimum threshold of notability in order for an article on that topic to remain on Wikipedia. This is a necessary result of Wikipedia being a neutral, verifiable encyclopedia. The terms 'importance' and 'significance' are also in use, and for practical purposes on Wikipedia they are similar." That is why this article is problematic. Also, if I could have come up with a better way to do things, then I would just do it. But, since I don't believe this article deserves to be on Wikipedia, and I want to get a consensus on whether it should be kept or not, I brought it here. By all means, if you convince me that this article should be kept, I'll change my mind. I want to see what the community thinks first. I want to get suggestions out of <i>you</i> guys&#160;:-) <font color="green">—</font><b><a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdGl_582c.html" title="User:EdGl"><font color="DarkGray">Ed</font><font color="DarkKhaki">Gl</font></a></b> 18:26, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, the very first part of Notability is: <i>This page is considered a guideline on Wikipedia. It is generally accepted among editors and is considered a standard that all users should follow. However, it is not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception. When editing this page, please ensure that your revision reflects consensus. When in doubt, discuss first on the talk page.</i> . Note the not set in stone, common sense, occasional exception.

</dd>
<dd><i>Clearly</i> one of those? Well <i>I</i> don't think so. Take a look at the article again (Divehi Wikipedia). It has been around for eight months, but it is grown to be no more than a five sentence stub. Without independent, reliable, and verifiable sources, I don't see this article growing at all. I don't even think this article has the <i>potential</i> to grow. An article about the smallest nook/cranny about Wikipedia shouldn't exist. The "occasional exceptions" would include the other "language Wikipedia" articles (that have <i>thousands</i> more articles than the Divehi Wikipedia) that I <i>didn't</i> put on AFD. <font color="green">—</font><b><a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdGl_582c.html" title="User:EdGl"><font color="DarkGray">Ed</font><font color="DarkKhaki">Gl</font></a></b> 21:56, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So, it's a slow growing encyclopedia, which is no surprise given the number of speakers. So what? It's a simple article, with nothing that needs extensive verification outside the wikipedia software. Believe it or not, it's quite possible to check the number of articles it has<a href="http://dv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics?action=raw" class="external text" title="http://dv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics?action=raw" rel="nofollow">All you need is this link</a> and you can verify the date <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Multilingual_statistics" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Multilingual_statistics" rel="nofollow">at this site</a>. Other than that, the only other information refers to the language itself, which I assume you're not questioning. All in all, no big deal. Does this article need to grow? I suppose, but that would depend on Wikipedians who speak both languages being interested in informing us. I doubt it'll happen quickly, if at all, but so what? That's just a result of the idiosyncratic growth of Wikipedia, not an argument as to merit. As it stands though, what content is there right now is not a problem, no matter how much you try to make it out to be. This is not a mountain. It's not even a molehill. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:46, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
