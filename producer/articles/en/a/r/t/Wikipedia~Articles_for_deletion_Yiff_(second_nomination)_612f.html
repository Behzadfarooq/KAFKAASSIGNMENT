<li><b>Comment</b>. Check the history, this article has had a <i>lot</i> of edits made to it, and there used to be a lot more to the article. It does appear to me someone pared this down a ton to get it this small so they could get an easy delete. No vote on the AfD itself, but I just wanted to make sure the article history was considered too, not just how the page currently stands. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 17:00, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Yiff is a fairly bizarre phenomenon but a well-established one, and I'm sure there are RS out there that can verify that. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 18:06, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for the reminder; I did look at the earlier version, and this is my conclusion. I think it's entirely possible that sources will be found and the section will grow to the point of spin-off, but it isn't there at the moment. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> 23:20, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Claiming that this article "can't be expand beyond a dicdef" is patently false; the article was significantly more than a dicdef before most of it was deleted last night. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 19:30, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - the article can be improved. The criteria for deletion is unverifiable, not unverified. WP:IDONTUNDERSTANDIT is a redlink for a reason. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiltopia_1488.html" title="User:Miltopia">Milto LOL pia</a> 09:44, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> - It seems to me that most of the material in the old revision was totally unsourced, or sourced from Wikifur - which is, in my opinion, most certainly not a reliable source. It won't be more than a dicdef until more reliable sources are found, but I am open to the possibility that they could be (though it seems unlikely that they will be found right now).

<li><b>Keep</b> - This page got crippled in the last week - beforehand it was a page that had alot of information in regards to this particular fetish, regardless of the information's source, now it's basically a broken page that is begging for deletion or movement. Restore the page to it's prior state and then verify it. The images were appropriate and I believe they were fair use as well.

<li>Old English Yiff has absolutely nothing to do with our furry issue. Wikipedia is not a dictionary, nor a random selection of information. Also, sources like Wikifur are not acceptable.

<li><b>Keep</b> - So the article is knocked down to three lines and then almost immediately hit with an AfD for being too short. Cute. And I must say it reflects poorly on the AfD when the one who proposed it personally stands guard over the article reverting expansions; do I smell an agenda? I agree that the article's unsourced or poorly sourced content needed to be cleaned out, but it's going to take time to replace that stuff with better, more objective content. As has been noted, unverified is not the same as unverifiable.ShroomofDoom 00:57, 5 February 2007 (UTC) [ <small>This is the users first and only edit. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 11:32, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</small> ]

<li><b>Keep</b> Appears to be a bad-faith nom. Removing the majority of an article (uncited or not) and then immediately AfDing it seems suspect to me. Especially when the nominator made no effort to reply to the ongoing discussion on the talk page until three days later. To be clear, I am not suggesting the content removals were improper -- they appear mostly to be in line with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, barring an acknowledged mistake or two -- but the AfD is too hasty, coming less than one full day after the nominator's first edit to the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> It was an unfair comment, but this is a rather strange deletion vote. She acknowledges that reliable sources exist, so the article is verifiable, even if it weren't currently verified (which I would dispute). It's also clearly notable -- even the short version of the article has two independent print sources. This is a strong argument to keep, not to delete. Also, since people insist on misreading the citations as to web pages, I have removed that aspect and reinstated them in what I hope is a clearer fashion, referring to the original documents themselves. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 19:58, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My vote stands based on the rationale of almost all the keep votes, namely, that the article was cut down and then AfD'd. The full article should be deleted, and to suggest otherwise is to ignore WP Policy. If you want to start with a referenced stub, then delete this pile of OR and start over. I agree there are sources out there that REFERENCE it, but not necessarily that such sources make it notable. The same book, for example, spends a paragraph on minor fetishes such as attraction to clocks and plants. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 22:44, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough. On a side note, though, I wasn't under the impression that it's WP policy to delete articles that are verifiable and notable, as you've acknowledged this one is, because of their current (or former) states.

<dd>So people should keep unreliably cited/uncited information in just because it's on VfD? That's not a good thing to think. If so, I could go to any number of articles on VfD and make up a bunch of stuff about them to make them seem like great articles. The information should be more reliably sourced precisely <i>because</i> the article is on VfD. I don't think this is a malicious VfD. Hashish doesn't seem to have an agenda. He/she had not even edited any articles relating to furries before nomming this for deletion. Heck, I think the article as it is should be deleted, but it could be a great article on the subject with sources. Aren't furries usually complaining about MTV and Vanity Fair doing something? Those things are probably about yiff, aren't they? If this article gets deleted, an article that asserts notability and gives cited information beyond a dicdef would most likely be approved by the majority here, and I'm sure that most would not be against a creation. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVoretus_d72f.html" title="User:Voretus">Voretus</a> 19:40, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
