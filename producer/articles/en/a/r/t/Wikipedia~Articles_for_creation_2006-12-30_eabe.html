<p><b>History</b> Annually, there are a surmountable number of student enrollees in public high schools at the beginning of the school year. And each year, secondary schools strategically located in various barangays throughout the city were overwhelmed by these increasing numbers resulting into congested classrooms, lack of teachers and school facilities. Thus, such predicament would result into underrated quality education that is way beyond the main thrusts of DepEd Valenzuela.</p>
<p>Such circumstances lead the locals of Mapulang Lupa, under the administration of Hon. Domingo R. Liwanag, to speak up and propose to have their own national high school in order to alleviate the problems brought up by the densely populated public high schools in which the usual targets were the students and parents as well. He seeks support and aide from Dr. Aquilina Rivas, School’s Division Superintendent during that time, to put up a new school in Mapulang Lupa. The proposal was not turned down. Together with the financial aide coming from the City Government of Valenzuela, spearheaded by the city mayor Hon. Emmanuel “Bobbit” Carlos, they decided to construct a three-storey building situated in Pabaya Street that will serve as a training ground for the students of its locality and nearby barangays.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as the project gains its momentum towards its accomplishment at the first quarter of 2003, the need for a temporary site arises since the plan was to establish the institution for the school year 2003 – 2004. As a short-term plan, the administrators and local officials resolved the problem by constructing temporary settlements under a covered court located in San Agustin Village that would cater incoming freshman students.</p>
<p>Human resources (such as teaching and utility personnel) and school facilities necessary to start up a school were provided by its mother school – Valenzuela National High School in Marulas, under the directives and guidance of Mrs. Amelita SP Madarang.</p>
<p>Known as VNHS - Mapulang Lupa Annex, it started with 210 first year students, 6 teachers, and a guard provided by the local barangay. Under the leadership of Dr. Genindina M. Sumbillo, Officer – In – Charge of VNHS – MLA, the institution opened its doors to those students who seek knowledge and had high hopes for what education can bring them into to their future.</p>
<p>Under the management of Dr. Alma Bella O. Bautista, the new School Superintendent, Hon. Sherwin T. Gatchalian, newly elected mayor of Valenzuela City; and Hon. Antonio M. Serapio, re-elected congressman of Valenzuela, pool all of their resources and management strategies to carry out the project that already runs for almost two years now. Such effort was needed since the San Agustin covered court can no longer accommodate the multiplying numbers of student enrollees.</p>
<p>On July 15, 2005, the new school building in Pabaya Street was inaugurated. Such momentous occasion was a dream came true not only for the students of Mapulang Lupa but also to those individuals and significant persons who helped out in the project.</p>
<p>Another milestone in the sector of education has been taken. Thanks to the good governance and coordination of all the leaders and stakeholders of such undertaking. For the people of Mapulang Lupa which remains hopeful and optimistic for the long wait, are assured of the basic quality education needed by their children is already at hand.</p>

<p>Entheogenesis: Pronounced [en-theo-jen-uh-sis]. Used to describe the short or long term process of using entheogens and developing into a new person with a different outlook on life specifically as a result of eating an entheogen. It does not describe the particluar outcome of the process and specific beliefs that develop but more importantly the process of self-transformation itself based upon one's interaction with entheogenic plants or fungi. A specific example of a fungi that has entheogenic properties is the mushroom Psilocybe Azurescens (ex <a href="http://www.fungi.com/info/gallery/gallery1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.fungi.com/info/gallery/gallery1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fungi.com/info/gallery/gallery1.html</a>). The word entheogenesis is derived from "entheo(gen)" and "genesis." The first portion of the word, "entheo," comes from the Greek word Entheos. Entheos literally means "god (theos) within," more freely translated "inspired." The Greeks used it as a term of praise for poets and other artists. The second portion of the word "genesis" can be broken up into two items: "gen" and more completely - "genesis." In Greek "gen" is geneshtai. Genesthai means "to cause to be" or "becoming." So an entheogen is "that which causes God (or godly inspiration) to be within a person". And genesis (to begin; to be subject to creation) added to it creates entheogenesis. It is important to furthur define Genesis to understand the meaning of the entheogenic process. An entheogenic experience (which is normally defined as one session with a specific plant (or plants combined together) or a fungi that kicks off the aforementioned state of being in a person) doesn't mean you realize or think you've become God alone (as in you alone are God controlling all that is seen and unseen) with omnipotent and everlasting capabilities. It means the "one in the all" (ie the spirit of life) is brought to life even more fully and you become aware of it (moreso than without the entheogen). It also means the way you think and feel is drastically transformed for atleast a few hours as the experience ensues. As to the details and the specific content of an entheogenic experience, these are almost always very personal experiences that are difficult for many to articulate. They can vary between people and not all experiences are reported as "easy to digest." Again, the specific content of the experience is highly personal and varies (even for the same person using the same plant(s) or fungi at different times in their life. With entheogenic foods we are not merely dealing with the issue of divinity but also the subject matter (content) in one's thought s that occur during this time. Content can range widely from person to person. Genesis itself means an origin, creation, or beginning. Although dictionaries do not associate the process of transformation (as in the Earth was already in existence and yet was transformed at the time God generated the heavens and earth (ref The Bible), the word clearly shows itself to be transformative (ref The Bible) in a radical and profound way. It is then, not just about a starting point (as in rebirth or recreation of an indiviual), but also about an ongoing experience that allows one to see life with a different perspective that reaches a religious and extremely spiritual level. This is important soas to describe the power of a genuine entheogen utilized in the appropriate manner (with the right timing and in the right place). Entheogenesis itself is the process of generating (by means of a plant(s) or fungi typically) a growing knowledge and identity associated with an interactive measure of the spirit of God within one's self and beyond.</p>

<pre>
See "entheogen" and "genesis" in various dictionaries. 
</pre>
<p>The word "entheogen" is rather new and is not found in older dictionaries nor even some the newer dictionaries - but it is out there. It is a very well used phrase among many people familar with the subject including scientists, professors, mycologists, naturalists, environmentalists, and others. Entheogenesis is an even newer word. It is growing in popularity online. I first learned of the word through <a href="http://www.stainblue.com" class="external free" title="http://www.stainblue.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stainblue.com</a> but is also used among the following online locations: <a href="http://entheogenesis.org" class="external free" title="http://entheogenesis.org" rel="nofollow">http://entheogenesis.org</a> , <a href="http://www.entheo.net/" class="external free" title="http://www.entheo.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.entheo.net/</a> . For general information on the key food ingested to have an entheogenic experience, please first see the book "Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World" by Paul Stamets (the preface and first two chapters in full). It is important that this word be interpreted and understood. I challenge the respected editors of Wikipedia and any collaborators to investigate and test the power of this word and to know its meaning individually or collectively after seeing firsthand what I've written. No other word is currently available to accurately (and so specifically) describe the process of seeing the world and life itself as functions and beings of God Almighty via plants and fungi.</p>

<p>Gigwise.com is a UK based online music webzine featuring news, reviews and features on indie, rock and electronica acts from the UK, US and Europe.</p>
<p>The site was started by Simon Perlaki in June 2001 as a gig guide for the Liverpool area. He was joined in January 2002 by Andy Day who began a live review section. Gigwise quickly spread its coverage firstly across the north west of England, then all major UK cities. There are also regular reviews from the US and Europe.</p>
<p>The site has grown to become a complete UK gig guide, which also features gig, album, DVD and single reviews, interviews with new and established indie acts, video streams and competitions, as well as a UK music industry directory, a lively forum, in-depth artist profiles and an unsigned band section.</p>
<p><i>In 2004 Gigwise introduced spin off sites as part of the Gigwise Network, Festivalwise.com and Ticketwise.co.uk.</i></p>
<p>In September 2005 the network was joined by Entertainmentwise.com, which although shares some music news with its sister site covers broader entertainment topics.</p>
<p>In 2006 Gigwise.com was nominated for a Record of the Day award for Best Music Website.</p>

<p>Hanna Karttunen is a professional Latin American and Exhibition dancer. She was born in Oulu, Finland.</p>
<p>Specialising in Latin American and representing England with Paul Killick, she won the prestigious titles of UK Open Champion, International Champion, World Series Champion, World Masters Champion and British National Champion four times.</p>
<p>She was also runner up in every major professional championship, such as the World Championships, European Championships and also the most prestigious competition of them all, the British Open Championships, where she was placed first in two dances; Rumba and Paso Doble.</p>
<p>Before Paul Killick, she also danced professionally with Sandro Cavallini for Italy and Geir Bakke for Norway.</p>
<p>In 2004, Hanna took part in the BBC television show 'Strictly Come Dancing', where she danced with EastEnders actor Christopher Parker.

<p>Paul Killick retired in May 2004, and Hanna went on to partner her fiancé Victor Da Silva in the style of Exhibition.</p>
<p>Together they have won the World Championships twice and the British Open Championships twice.</p>

Mrs. Baird was born Edith E. Helen Winter-Wood in Brixton, England on February 22, 1859. She was the daughter of Thomas Winter-Wood. Her father, who died in 1905 at age 87, was a chess player and a problemist, as were her brothers, Thomas Winter-Wood and Carslake Winter-Wood. Eventually her daughter, Lilian, also became a chess problem composer. But Edith was the best of all of them. In her books, she tended to follow the custom of the day by referring to herself as Mrs. W. J. Baird.</p>
<p>Mrs. Baird published over 2000 chess problems in her lifetime. Although she won many awards, winning first place in the Hackney Mercury three-mover tournament in 1893 was her highest achievement.</p>
<p>Edith Baird died on February 1, 1924 in Paignton, England.</p>
