<p>This is still a list of random historical or pop-culture "references" in Pokémon, and is a collection of indiscriminate trivia. There's no good place to merge it, and no real use for it as a standalone article. The Pokémon Wikiproject, as far as I can tell, hasn't shown much interest in fiddling with this list of trivia, and other than some vandalism patrol and bot changes, it hasn't been touched since the last AFD.</p>
<p>Please note that this is <i>not</i> a merge target, and deleting it will not result in a bunch of Pokémon stubs popping up.</p>
<p>For those interested, this has been on AFD twice before. The previous AFDs are <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cultural_references_in_Pok%C3%A9mon_b178.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cultural references in Pokémon">here</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cultural_references_in_Pok%C3%A9mon_2_c0f9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cultural references in Pokémon 2">here</a>. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 13:28, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Speedy Keep</b> You have attempted to VfD this article twice <i>in the past two months</i>. Both times it was kept. Do not attempt to delete articles through attrition. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:56, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I listed this for AFD a month and a half ago; Apostrophe listed it a second time a week later, and I would have advised him not to. Both times it has received a majority of delete votes; the last AFD had a 2d:1k ratio, with several of the keeps because of the too-quick relist.<br />
Note that it has been a month since any non-vandal, non-bot edit of this article, despite being listed on <a href="../../../p/c/p/WP%7EPCP_c57f.html" title="WP:PCP">the Pokémon Wikiproject</a>'s talk page. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 14:03, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Going a month without a major edit is hardly a reason to delete a substantial article which survived two very recent deletion attempts. If you really want it deleted, unlist it and try again in 6 months. 3 AfDs in two months is completely unacceptable. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:29, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Both times it barely survived AFD for reasons unrelated to the quality of the article (a mistaken belief that it was a merge target, a much-too-soon relist). Both times it received a majority of delete votes. The only relevant Wikiproject has no interest in doing anything with this. Had I just redirected this to <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_%28anime%29.html" title="Pokémon (anime)">Pokémon (anime)</a>, I'm doubtful anyone would have noticed.<br />
Don't be so hung up on process, especially when there aren't any applicable formal rules. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 14:39, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>There aren't any applicable formal rules?! Surely you've read and are familiar with <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, which explicitly states: <i>"In some cases, repeated attempts to have an article deleted may even be considered disruptive.

<li>I'm curious what this AFD is disrupting, exactly. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 15:23, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Here's two for a start: (a) AfD now averages some 150+ entries a day, and is more than bloated enough without re-noms of things twice kept in less than two months (b) repeatedly re-nominating an article hurts its chance for natural development and cleanup, as editors are unlikely to work extensively to cleanup something that gets an AfD nomination every couple weeks. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 17:15, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Unreferenced Original Research Cruft. I've not seen the "I Feel Skitty" episode, but does Meowth really kick someone in the style of Chun Li? Was this an actual cultural reference, or someone picking up the merest coincidence with something else? Meowth's ability to speak is reminiscent of Garfield? Even if the script writers confirmed these things, I still don't think Pokemon episodes should have every facet which deals with real life in a article. I mean, one of the episodes contains a samurai? Is this a notable event in the Pokemon world, do people sit up and think, "Wow, Samurai were mentioned, that's an important cultural reference in my favourite show!" - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 16:41, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're right. I apologize, I didn't really mean bad-faith. I really should have just agreed with Starblind that this is getting a bit repetitive and possibly disrupting.

<li><b>Keep</b> or merge somewhere (I'm not sure what the best target would be).

<li>As the other two AfDs, I have no idea what on earth to do with this. Its a garbled mess. I could do with splitting and merging between various articles but I don't want to do it. Despite this however, the fact that it's been on AfD twice before and kept twice makes me lean towards <b>keep</b>. --<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Cel</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">stianpower</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">háblame</a></sup> 18:12, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> While it has scraped through by the skin of its teeth twice, it has improved beyond being a list of "references to general human culture in Pokemon"! I will however pop it on my watchlist and if any edits I consider blatently ridiculous come up again I will delete them with haste. Lets face it, before the edits half of it was complete rubbish and I fear the article may well attract the same kind of blatently obvious and pointless trivia it contained before...

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Sorry, but this is just inherently unencyclopedic triviacruft.

<li>"Even in the cleaned-up version, it's mostly nonsense" To be honest I wish the article had never existed! However it has been through AFD twice and got through, once with myself voting against it. 'All's well that ends well'? Considering that two sub-characters are called Romeo and Juliet, this could be easily seen as a cultural reference!

<li>I don't think at the page is original research fundamentally, although it may need a rewrite/cleanup to better align to what we can reasonably say from the sources we have.

<li><b>SPEEDY KEEP IT RIGHT NOW</b> I can't believe you're trying this sh*t again, AMIB. You've tried before, and you failed. Give up already! <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolKatt_number_99999_b352.html" title="User:CoolKatt number 99999">CoolKatt number 99999</a> 02:56, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Oh, and if the result is keep, I want an admin to make sure that no one can ever put this on AFD ever again <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolKatt_number_99999_b352.html" title="User:CoolKatt number 99999">CoolKatt number 99999</a> 02:59, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>That is unlikely to happen. That said, I won't relist this again (ever) if there's a bonafide consensus to keep. I only renominated after two AFDs that closed no consensus with a majority of delete votes.<br />

<li><b>Strong delete</b>, plainly unencyclopedic; it not only an arbitrary list, but an arbitrary list based entirely on the interpretations, readings, and original research of a few editors. Relisting a deletion because new information has come up or because the original vote was based on errors strikes me as entirely approprate; but if deletion fails because its relisting was too soon, please do remember to list it again as soon as enough time has passed to dispel that concern. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 04:06, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
