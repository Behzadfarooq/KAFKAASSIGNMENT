<p>Non-notable company - blatant spam--<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 21:57, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I find it truly interesting that <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> (who can't even spell the word "blatant" correctly, by the way) arrogates the right to decide which companies are notable and which are not. Why does he not then request the deletion of articles about similar companies in the same line of business, such as <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applix.html" title="Applix">Applix</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Objects_%28company%29_1013.html" title="Business Objects (company)">Business Objects</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognos.html" title="Cognos">Cognos</a>, <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperion_Solutions_6efe.html" title="Hyperion Solutions">Hyperion Solutions</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/MicroStrategy_53a5.html" title="MicroStrategy">MicroStrategy</a>, <a href="../../../q/l/i/QlikTech_e303.html" title="QlikTech">QlikTech</a>, etc.? <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> must provide some pretty good reasons why these other companies are notable, while a very similar company such as <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimensional_Insight_0bfd.html" title="Dimensional Insight">Dimensional Insight</a> is not. Failing that, and unless he is asking to delete all <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_intelligence.html" title="Business intelligence">Business intelligence</a> vendors, I must conclude <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> is biased. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 23:42, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Well, firstly, you must define "notable company"; secondly, you must explain why and how you have become the single judge of this matter on the Wikipedia, when you don't seem to know much at all about <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_intelligence.html" title="Business intelligence">Business intelligence</a> vendors; thirdy, you must explain why you have attacked this company specifically — indeed, to the point of describing information about it as "spam", clearly without any knowledge of fact — but not <b>other</b> companies, such as the ones I have listed above, which operate in the same line of business and produce similar products. As you have not requested the deletion of those other comparable companies, I must conclude that (1) either you have an axe to grind, or (2) if this is simply an unmotivated, random attack, then you are in fact the "spammer" here! <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 15:24, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

How does it compare with others in the field of <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Intelligence_dba6.html" title="Business Intelligence">Business Intelligence</a>? I concede that I was a little hasty in labelling the article as 'spam' and I would like to retract that part of my statement.

<ul>
<li><b>I couldn't disagree more.</b> I happen to know this company well and use its products daily. When I created this article, I specifically patterned it on articles about a number of similar companies, which produce and market similar products (e.g.: <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applix.html" title="Applix">Applix</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Objects_%28company%29_1013.html" title="Business Objects (company)">Business Objects</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognos.html" title="Cognos">Cognos</a>, <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperion_Solutions_6efe.html" title="Hyperion Solutions">Hyperion Solutions</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/MicroStrategy_53a5.html" title="MicroStrategy">MicroStrategy</a>, <a href="../../../q/l/i/QlikTech_e303.html" title="QlikTech">QlikTech</a>, etc.). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> says: "'If article X then article Y.' is a fallacious argument, for obvious reasons." I beg your pardon: What obvious reasons? Quite the contrary, in fact. What's good for the goose is good for the gander, I think, is the rule of thumb. The article includes a link to the company's web site (<a href="http://www.dimins.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.dimins.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dimins.com</a>) that provides all the information you need (same as for those other companies). Again, no one can tell me what the "notability" criteria are. If there are indeed such criteria, then they should be enforced for all businesses, not just this one.
<ul>
<li>Rubbish. You've already been told three times what the criteria are, both in this discussion and in notices in the article itself, all of which have linked <i>directly</i> to the criteria to apply and how to demonstrate that they are satisfied. You'll not make a case by arguing as you are continuing to do. Your only way to make a case is to do what I said to do above. So stop making erroneous arguments about some supposed arbitrariness or unfairness of the long-standing criteria that we apply to <i>all</i> companies, and start citing those sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(1) <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> seems to be asking for a list of customers and a list of directors. That is what the company's web site is for. If you need more information, you can call the company directly and ask for informational materials, but I don't see how that belongs to the Wikipedia article.</li>
<li>(2) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> asks for sources. Again, from what I can see, the company's web site is usually the only source provided in articles about other companies. What other sources do you need? Customer testimonials? They are on the company's web site.</li>
<li>(3) <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienter_8af3.html" title="User:Scienter">Scienter</a>, apparently without any direct knowledge, asserts the company is "NN" and invites me to <b>assume</b> good faith on the part of <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a>, when in fact I happen to know quite a bit about <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_intelligence.html" title="Business intelligence">Business intelligence</a> software, while, with all due respect, <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> doesn't seem to. I say to <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienter_8af3.html" title="User:Scienter">Scienter</a>: Please assume my good faith!</li>
<li>I am sorry, but this all seems quite preposterous to me. I have been a Wikipedia editor for two and a half years, I have made several thousand contributions, started numerous articles, and have never come across this kind of biased, targeted scrutiny. I strongly urge <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> to withdraw his unmotivated AfD nomination and I strongly urge <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> to remove his arbitrary notability warning. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 20:49, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not arbitrary. They are the criteria that apply to all company articles. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The companies Pasquale refer to all carry at least one claim of notability. <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applix.html" title="Applix">Applix</a> <i>were one of the pioneers of integrated Speadsheet/Word Processing/Graphics office automation suites running on Unix workstations,</i> <a href="../../../m/i/c/MicroStrategy_53a5.html" title="MicroStrategy">MicroStrategy</a> created a <a href="../../../d/o/t/Dot.com.html" title="Dot.com">dot.com</a> which <i>was among the first services to broadcast custom alerts (such as stock price alerts) to wireless devices,</i> and so forth. The article on DI, by contrast, lists no such pioneering developments and is therefore non-notable in it current form--<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 21:13, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: (To echo Edchilvers and expand a bit: <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Objects_%28company%29_1013.html" title="Business Objects (company)">Business Objects (company)</a> has about 20 times the number of customers of DI and is publicly traded; <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognos.html" title="Cognos">Cognos</a> has 3,500 employees and 23,000 customers (versus 1500 for DI); <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperion_Solutions_6efe.html" title="Hyperion Solutions">Hyperion Solutions</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/MicroStrategy_53a5.html" title="MicroStrategy">MicroStrategy</a> are publicly traded (NASDAQ), and <a href="../../../q/l/i/QlikTech_e303.html" title="QlikTech">QlikTech</a> has 3 times the number of customers. That leaves <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applix.html" title="Applix">Applix</a>, which sold office productivity software starting in the 1980s to a wide market, and so has a rich history (one admittedly not well documented in its article, which really should be stubbed). In short, not very good examples, and even if they were, <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a> would still be citable. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 21:15, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for all the clarifications, but I am still trying to understand what the "notability" threshold is here. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> points out, quite correctly, that <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperion_Solutions_6efe.html" title="Hyperion Solutions">Hyperion Solutions</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/MicroStrategy_53a5.html" title="MicroStrategy">MicroStrategy</a> are publicly traded, while <a href="../../../q/l/i/QlikTech_e303.html" title="QlikTech">QlikTech</a>, like <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimensional_Insight_0bfd.html" title="Dimensional Insight">Dimensional Insight</a>, is not. However, says John Broughton, QlikTech has 3 times the number of customers as Dimensional Insight. Ha-ha! Now I am finally beginning to understand. We are down to the number of customers. In other words, Dimensional Insight will be notable when it has 3 times the number of customers. Is that what you are telling me, John Broughton? I am sorry, but this all sounds like ad-hoc argumentation, i.e. the criteria keep changing as it seems convenient from moment to moment. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasquale_0bb9.html" title="User:Pasquale">Pasquale</a> 21:48, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, we are <i>not</i> down to number of customers. You've been pointed to the actual criteria to satisfy three times, now. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

So, to repeat so that the question doesn't get lost: what is the basis for your statement? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 16:33, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I heard this from a friend who was telling me about an employee of Dimensional Insight who had recently posted an article about the company and was defending it against deletion - without mentioning that he's an employee. My friend doesn't actually work there, but he knows someone who does. So, technically my statement is hearsay, but I have no reason to disbelieve it. Really, the article now looks just as good as those of other similar companies, but I thought that Pasquale's association with the company should be known. <a href="../../../d/y/f/User%7EDyfrgi_6693.html" title="User:Dyfrgi">Dyfrgi</a> 05:21, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Having used Dimensional Insight's products, I can say that they compare favorably with those of most competitors. Considering the major mergers in the BI industry in recent years, Dimensional Insight is indeed notable for remaining privately held and maintaining positive growth each year. This baseless attack on an informative and non-offensive entry should be ignored. MahmoudAmadinejad 03:00, 1 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— MahmoudAmadinejad (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MahmoudAmadinejad_467a.html" title="Special:Contributions/MahmoudAmadinejad">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li>(I moved the foregoing down to the bottom of the page.) Welcome to Wikipedia, and please remember to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. Neither the quality of the product, nor the company's profitability matter for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notability</a>. Nor is anyone's nomination of a previously unsourced article about what seemed to be a non-notable company in anyway "baseless" or an "attack." Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html" title="WP:Not">not a battleground</a>, and AfD is not meant as an affront.

<li>This debate has clearly stirred a great deal of feeling, which I suppose is understandable. I don't deny that editors have worked very hard to create this article and I can see how they may feel that their efforts are unappreciated. Let me assure you on my own behalf this is not the case. The purpose of an AfD discussion, IMO, is to bring to the attention of other users articles which, in their current form, do not match the Wikipedia notability criteria, articles which require a little bit more information or sourcing in order to make sure that they come up to scratch. Once this has been done (and efforts have certainly been made as regards to this article, although as has been pointed out I am not an expert in this field and cannot say whether it will be enough) there is no reason why the article may not remain on Wikipedia--<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 16:20, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
