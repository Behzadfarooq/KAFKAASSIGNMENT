<li>My bad (it's just that I see a lot of stuff on VfD that's "Merge and Redirect" so I assumed this was the place to get a concensus). I have since done similar redirects with <a href="../../../h/o/c/Hocotate.html" title="Hocotate">Hocotate</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/c/Hocotate_Freight_Company_d746.html" title="Hocotate Freight Company">Hocotate Freight Company</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 6 July 2005 05:27 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Thing is, both installments, IIRC, have hit one million copies sold.

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>. "Notable character in a popular series" does not mean that the character could have enough written about him to merit branching off a separate article. -<a href="../../../g/t/r/User%7EGtrmp_2ffc.html" title="User:Gtrmp">Sean Curtin</a> July 9, 2005 03:03 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But you're only ASSUMING that it cannot have enough extra stuff written. With Wikipedia, you give an article the benefit of the doubt. Maybe not with one silly article, but when it's about the star of a multi-million dollar franchise, you don't even seem to be BOTHERING to give it a chance to improve. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> July 9, 2005 03:33 (UTC)</li>
<li>There, I've improved it, adding several bits of information that, if you were speaking the truth, couldn't have been added, because there would be nothing to add. But then, I showed that there was. And with the upcomming Pikmin 3 game, even MORE information will be added. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> July 9, 2005 03:53 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All you did was give a synopsis of Pikmin 1 and 2, as well as mention a future game (all of which is more relevant on the Pikmin Series page), and mention the SSBM trophy (which is fairly trivial, given there are hundreds of trophies). All information on Olimar should go on the <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikmin_series.html" title="Pikmin series">Pikmin series</a> page. IF and WHEN there has been enough written about him to justify splitting it off, then we should make Characters of Pikmin. If there's enough written about Olimar himself to justify splitting him off from that, then he can get his own article. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 9 July 2005 04:05 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There IS enough information, if you had ever read the logs. It delves in on his personality. For one, SSBM was always there. Pikmin and Pikmin 2 may tell the plot, but they ARE the plot. The character has a wife as well, which is not mentioned in the Article. If that's not mentioned, imagine how much else isn't. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> July 9, 2005 04:21 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I still stand by my previous statement. If and when enough information is written about him (as in, on Wiki) then we can split pages off of the <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikmin_series.html" title="Pikmin series">Pikmin series</a> page. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 9 July 2005 04:38 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For one, there IS enough content on him. Several paragraphs on the star of a million-dollar franchise WITH plenty of content to add onto the article is no grounds for deletion! You're basically saying that a character IS well-known, popular, notable and has enough content, but should be removed until the content is added. As long as it is known that the content is coming, there should be zilch for a problem. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> July 9, 2005 04:49 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And, like I said, almost all of what is actually there is a repeat of what's on <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikmin_series.html" title="Pikmin series">Pikmin series</a>. There's no reason to have two pages with the exact same content. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 9 July 2005 08:12 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then delete Pikmin series' content. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> July 9, 2005 08:23 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> It looks like an okay page. Sandy M 9 July 2005 08:57 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b>. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 9 July 2005 15:42 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't really see what everyone's problem is with this. It's pretty well-writen, it's accurate, it's formatted, it has several paragraphs of information, and there's plenty of information that can be added to this. And if you say that we can't use log books, a lot of other famous characters use stuff that's not even in the games. Even Nifboy conceded that Olimar may have enough content to be his own page, but we should 'delete it until he does'. You know what? Why don't we delete that single paragraph of plot in <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikmin_series.html" title="Pikmin series">Pikmin series</a>? Then there'd be no need to merge, delete or redirect, because there's no duplicate information. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> July 9, 2005 18:47 (UTC)</li>
<li>And to debunk the idea that it's not good Wiki to describe the storyline that surrounds them, look at <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link_%28Legend_of_Zelda%29_c806.html" title="Link (Legend of Zelda)">Link</a>. His article has a large section about the story for each game! And that's a featured article, too. I don't see why telling the plot of Olimar's or Link's games is bad; the games are ABOUT them. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> July 9, 2005 18:57 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> This page is very useful and informative and it is ridicuous to merge this page with the Pikmin series because of the content, while admittedly sharing info with the Pikmin series, is enough to stand on its own. -- Cvxfreak 9 July 2005 19:19 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think the Olimar article has a whole lot of depth outside of the Pikmin series, but that can be fixed. <b>Keep</b> for now. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan"><b><font color="mediumblue">Andre</font></b></a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan"><font color="royalblue">talk</font></a>) 20:13, July 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
