<li><b>Comment:</b> Wow... Yes, I'm the one who started the page. Beckjord <i>is</i> a very well-known figure among people interested in paranormal phenomena, so I still think we should <b>keep</b> this article. As far as my sources go, his museum was actually mentioned by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9704/19/ufo.museum/" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/US/9704/19/ufo.museum/" rel="nofollow">CNN</a>, and you can find some more information about him on <a href="http://www.coasttocoastam.com" class="external text" title="http://www.coasttocoastam.com" rel="nofollow">Coast to Coast AM's page</a>. I've also participated on some of the message boards where he trumpted his claims. (For example, you can find a reference to his activity on <a href="http://www.cryptozoology.com/articles/interview.php?PHPSESSID=c87d63fe25ad08c0ab9da7a3dd1f895c" class="external text" title="http://www.cryptozoology.com/articles/interview.php?PHPSESSID=c87d63fe25ad08c0ab9da7a3dd1f895c" rel="nofollow">cryptozoology.com</a> - though most of his posts were under false names, or have been deleted.)</li>

<dd>If possible, I think we should try to make an objective rewrite before deleting the page entirely (just leave me a message). <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 15:46, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> to Zagalejo et all.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Even if he is notable, he's not <i>very</i> notable. So adding his bio only adds a tiny amount to Wikipedia's value as a reference tool.</li>
<li>Keeping this article means that it will have to be NPOV.</li>
<li>This will likely enrage the subject, causing him to try to get more people to vandalize Wikipedia.</li>
<li>If successful, this will force the diversion of resources to preventing that -- resources that could be be spent creating and improving useful articles.</li>
<li>Therefore, retaining this article is <i>likely</i> to result in a net loss to Wikipedia's value as a research tool. And that's the bottom line, I think.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Yes the diversion of resources and general headache is bearable, but why? <i>Who needs it?</i>. I had a very similar comment a couple days ago to to someone who created (re-created I guess) an article for hyper-disruptive editor Marc Perkel. It adds up, and <i>how, exactly, does this help to build an encylopedia</i>? And this guy is worse than a disruptive editor. He's <i>recruiting</i> disruptive editors. Wikipedia is not a suicide pact.<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 16:06, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually your argument indicates why we should <i>not</i> delete on the basis of disruption. If we do, we encourge people to disrupt other articles because they don't want an NPOV article to exist for a controversial topic. Whether to keep or delete should be decided purely on other factors. <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred;">Caerwhine</small></a> 16:55, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I have to agree with DanielCD (and not because we have the same name) and Caerwine. The subject of the article may be a crank, but we don’t delete articles because the subject is a crank. He seems to be making a name for himself, mostly because he <i>is</i> a crank.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think DanielCD's rewrite is pretty good. I do understand the concern, though. We should wait and see how EB reacts to the new edits. If he's still disruptive, then maybe we have to delete the page. However, I still think he is notable enough to deserve a place in Wikipedia, so I hope we can work something out. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 18:41, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> He may be a nutcase and a potentially disruptive editor, but that doesn't make him non-notable. I don't think it would be too difficult to make the article conform to NPOV standards.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I wouldn't be too afraid of him. Each time he comes on site it only takes him a few minutes to break enough rules to be blocked. Eventually he'll get bored and move on.

<li><b>Comment</b> He's having a fit actually... Here's what he's telling people:</li>
</ul>
<p>"Tell them that it is good they edited my page or the page about me, to be more fair than before, since really nobody but a sysop or an admin can make any edits in the main page article "stick". Wikipedia has this quaint idea that non-experts can edit the work of experts. Amateurs can edit the work of pros,etc. This puts Joe Six Pack on the level of Dr. Steven Hawking. Any, try to enter that www.ufomind.com is a a trashing site and some 15 victims have tried to sue the webmaster, who thumbs his nose at them. ufomind.com is trashing me als, and many fools actually believe it is written on the internet, that it MUST be true. Bonk! Am I vitriolic? Only when unfairly attacked, first. Am I malicious? Only against hoaxers and attackers. Do I flame? Only against flamers. Wikipedia people are very naive and ignore all this. Is is "bad" to threaten a lawsuit? Only in the mind of a naive 16 yr old. Oooh, ooh, he threatened a lawsuit! WOW! Nasty! Mean! -- -well, jerks, what if a car runs down your mother and you have to sue the driver? Is this "bad"...??? Or is someone defames you unfairly, --OOH,OOH, he threatened to sue....OH DEAR! Wikipedians, get real... however, my thanks for at least some fairness. Next, how about some reality on new items on Bigfoot? The Bigfoot page is bad,bad,bad."</p>
<p>My own experiences with the man lead me to believe he's a complete wacko. He's been known to edit and photo shop in his efforts to legitimize himself and he has a habit of stalking people.--<a href="../../../v/i/l/User%7EVilaWolf_febe.html" title="User:VilaWolf">VilaWolf</a></p>

<p><b>In defense</b> 1)Beckjord has removed 6 days ago, maybe 7, from his forum, any suggestion to trash Wikipedia. There is no such threat of vandalism. Repeated reference to this non-event are irrelevant from the guy with the Russian letters name.Evidence: visit <a href="http://www.bigfootforums.net" class="external free" title="http://www.bigfootforums.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigfootforums.net</a></p>
<p>2) Who is interested in Beckjord? 20 Million People on the Letterman show, 15 million on the Jay Leno show, nine million people on the Coast to Coast AM show. Other millions from NBC,CBS, CNN,BBC and others. Unpopular (as science pioneers often are) as he may be to some, he has come to represent Bigfoot research and CZ research. His work is cutting edge and is evennow influencing writers as Chris Murphy, "Meet the Sasquatch" who previously held to older ideas. Reference? Evidence? visit <a href="http://www.hancockhouse.com" class="external free" title="http://www.hancockhouse.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hancockhouse.com</a> and click on the Murphy Files forum. You will see a sea change in this man.</p>
<p>3) Beckjord does no "vandalism". He offers his expertise in the topics. He does edits and critics jump in and declare, unfairly, that these edits are vandalism, when they in fact are not. Evidence: common sense.</p>
<p>Merry Wikipedia to all, and a Happy New article. If I offer multiple comments, it is in order to refute false info. beckjord<a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.208.227.49.html" title="User:205.208.227.49">205.208.227.49</a> 19:08, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: And this my friends, is standard behavior of Beckjord, man of a thousand IP addresses. He's also failed to bring up the fact that he's repeatedly made false claims such as his 9/11 "consulting services" that were nothing more that his boosting his own ego and trying to profit from disaster. "Calls not from media are returned collect." as he is fond of saying.

<p>In further defense: I have just web-published ( <a href="http://www.beckjord.com/originoflife" class="external free" title="http://www.beckjord.com/originoflife" rel="nofollow">http://www.beckjord.com/originoflife</a> ) my Multidensional Theory of the Origin of Life , which ties in with alleged interdimensional travel by alleged strange beings as often discussed in cryptozoology. (Kangamoto,Bigfoot,Nessie,etc) In time, I will submit this theory for an article in Wikipedia. I do not have to be Einstein to follow up on his ideas, nor do I need to be Kant or Hegel to suggest a theory. BTW, somemone accused me of extreme arrogance to suggest I had "done" a Jane Goodall-type experiment with Bigfoot. First, I know Dr. G in person, and second, I merely *attempted* such an experiment. Bigfoot creatures ate my food, appeared once, but they never sat down in my lap. They did, however, show up on film, even if not seen. <a href="http://www.bigfoot.org" class="external free" title="http://www.bigfoot.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigfoot.org</a></p>

<p><i><b>KEEP</b></i> Reason: There is independent matter that exists that supports the position that Bigfoot may be <b>both</b> a simple animal <i>and</i> be a Interdimensional Creature. The reason there are no bodies is that predators and scavengers destroy them, (which also frustrates law enforcement looking for evidence in murder cases), in the case of the animal bigfoot, while a alien(to us) has abilities that are considered bizarre, and this thing may be from another plane of existance. <i><b>Personally</b></i>,I believe that Bigfoot is BOTH a simple animal native to Earth <b>AND</b> I've seen <i>independent</i> evidence that indicates that a alien "Bigfoot" is also visiting this planet. The Interdimensional Bigfoot has known bizarre abilities such as glowing eyes, superstrength, teleports, is telepathic/empathic,and if fired on, weapons have no effect. There are as stated <b>two</b> creatures, one is a animal native to Earth, the other one is a alien from another dimension. As for "vanity", one should dump <i>all</i> of the celebrity articles such as Jay Lenno, David Letterman, Howard Stern, since they personally promote them. The reason I'm investigating Bigfoot myself is that I'm monitoring the Fouke,AR situation, and have heard that one was seen in a nearby county I was living in. As to the "nuts" references, read the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robertson_Panel_866f.html" title="Robertson Panel">Robertson Panel</a>. This states that the CIA had initiated this to "reduce" interest in <a href="../../../u/f/o/UFO_9768.html" title="UFO">UFOs</a>, and one facet is to have people who has had encounters w/ UFOs/Aliens to be declared mentally unfit, since psychiatrists are also employed to do this. Should there be alien contact, some of these people may revolt out of vengeance and/or for religious reasons. While travelling the US, I've been told about this matter as well. I travel the US as, among other things, as a prospector and as a paranormal investigator, and I've seen things that are beyond belief. The reason people are shooting @ Bigfoot is to provide the "Skeptics" a BODY for their examination.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 21:09, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b>. Has anyone seen the man's <a href="../../../b/e/c/User%7EBeckjord_caa6.html" title="User:Beckjord">user page</a>? It inspired something of a heated exchange between him and myself on his talk page. The highlights: he compares himself to Albert Einstein and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Alan_Wolf_a545.html" title="Fred Alan Wolf">Fred Alan Wolf</a> and declares his intention to flout policy when he believes that it needs flouting. The talk page discussion is similarly rich; he trots out the old claim that Wikipedia is flawed because the common editor has as much clout as "experts" and he reiterates his belief that since we're all wrong and he knows better, he can do whatever he feels necessary to fix it. Hell, look above: he's already planning to submit material which is unequivocably original research.</p>
