<li><b>weak delete</b>. The content of this page (which was almost certainly cut'n'pasted from a website) should certainly be deleted.

<li><b>Very weak keep</b> - it's one thing to have sub-stubs of people or concrete events/dates/etc., but for an abstract concept such as this it's a bit hard to justify.

<li><b>Comment</b>. First, the article is now much expanded, certainly no longer a stub. Second, I see nothing wrong with creating a stub on a worthy topic. I've done so many times, with the hopes that persons more knowledgeable than myself on the topic would add their knowledge. If not, then I'll go back and expand it. In light of this, perhaps the suggestion that it "does nothing but increase the authors contribution count" is uncharitable. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> June 28, 2005 21:45 (UTC)</li>

<p>Comment: I take your point, but is it not possible that such a stub could have been lost in the mass of 600K articles and never be expanded. My belief is that in the wikipaedia projesct a substantial article no matter how flawed ( and I think you article is very good) is far better as a basis for revision than a tiny stub.--<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorturology_8c86.html" title="User:Porturology">Porturology</a> 29 June 2005 00:53 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> — <i>this</i> is what VfD should be about. Not getting rid of vanity articles endlessly but determining whether there is some value in an apparently value-less article. This is great work. I still think that it reads somewhat as an essay, but it does now have references and things so this is clear-cut-keep.

<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>Several people argued for a redirect. Subsequent comments, however, showed that 1) the redirect would have a typo in it (and thus be non-preferred) and 2) that the article had only a single author who has already moved the relevant content into the more general article (thus obviating the need to merge and redirect to preserve GFDL). I am going to exercise my discretion and call this one as a delete but without prejudice against re-creation of a redirect at the proper title. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 9 July 2005 04:44 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>Redirect</b> Think Big Era (New Zealand) to <a href="../../../t/h/i/Think_Big_1b1f.html" title="Think Big">Think Big</a>. Since there is a disambiguation on Think Big, then if any other country has a "think big" the disambiguation can sort it out when necessary. (N.B. the typo is a space after the "(" and the redirect should not include the space). There are already links to <b>Think Big Era (New Zealand)</b> and so at the very least a redirect is needed to preserve them. I think the two articles need to be merged and so it is only a question of what the title of the article should be. Although <b>Think Big Era (New Zealand)</b> is more future proof and more exact, the existing <a href="../../../t/h/i/Think_Big_%28disambiguation%29_ec0c.html" title="Think Big (disambiguation)">Think Big (disambiguation)</a> can deal with things at this stage. As the author of <b>Think Big Era (New Zealand)</b> I appreciate the discussion and somehow missed the fact that there was already a <b>Think Big</b> article when I created my one. <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanuga_e549.html" title="User:Zanuga">User:Zanuga</a> 5 July 2005.</li>

<li><b>Keep and clean up</b> Did either of you bother to read this article? I didn't think so. This (despite its rather disorganized appearance) is a very well researched article with 23 references, regrettably not included. I have no idea how this qualifies as patent nonsense; just because you don't get it doesn't make it so. <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?biw=682&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Oregovomab&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?biw=682&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Oregovomab&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Google</a> is your friend. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 2005 June 29 03:39 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is unclear where you have obtained the number 23 from. There are 0 references in the article. Where does the number 23 come from? Does it come from whatever copyrighted original article was copied&amp;pasted here in violation of our <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_policy_c6a7.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright policy">copyright policy</a>? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> June 29, 2005 11:12 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A number of paragraphs quote reference numbers which must correspond to some actual references. As I said above, they are not included with this article, but I don't imagine someone would throw in fake reference number just for fun. I would also suggest you show good faith in the author of this article, Uncle G. I have found no evidence in Google of copyvio, and unless you yourself can provide proof, it is unfair to state this as fact.

<li>Not every copyright violation is copied from a web page that the Google Web spider reaches, or even from a web page at all. Read what <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simoncursitor</a> said again. And as <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> says, the formatting of the wikitext, including the extra blank lines after many paragraphs and the obvious headers whose formatting has been lost, clearly indicates that this has been copied&amp;pasted. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> July 1, 2005 10:57 (UTC)</li>

<li>Denni: please don't misinterpret this: I'd be pleased to vote for a <i>keep</i> if it wasn't for the fact that 1) the article reads like promotional copy for the companies involved, and 2) it reads as if it's directly transcribed from a pharmaceutical source journal. I'm not expert enough to scan all these and take the decision, but until someone assures me this isn't a <i>copyvio</i>, I'm going to <b>abstain</b>. --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 29 June 2005 06:57 (UTC)</li>

<li>The NASCAR reference is simply that "The Lady in Black" is used as the nickname for Darlington (South Carolina) Raceway, often considered the circuit's most difficult track to master.

<li><b>Keep</b> Ian (who wrote the article) DID NOT start The Boredome. "Madcow" started the Boredome, and he was not the one who posted this article. Therefore, it is not self promotion. As well as that, many many people on Div-arena take The Boredome seriously, including the forum administrator - who has given it a seperate forum. Hell, it even has a .com. It is simply a form of art; saying its nonsence is like saying that Picasso was nonsence because the ears and the noses and the legs, etc, were all in the wrong place. If modern "art" can get an article - on a FAIR Wikipedia - so can this. User: N/A 29 June 2005 18:48 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> the article speaks about a specific form of art which is growing quite a following.

<li><b>Keep</b> I wrote the article. I also have very little to do with Boredome. I didn't create it, I don't own the website, and I wasn't one of the few people who pioneered it. I only occasionally create Boredome art. I wrote the article because it's a fascinating genre of art that has had literally hundreds of contributions from dozens of people around the world, and which continues to grow. In addition, I was careful to abide by the rules governing articles on Wikipedia, including objectivity. - Ghotistix 30 June 2005 06:03 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. It seems to be completely unknown outside the Div-arena forum and that's simply not notable enough. I think the art is amusing, but it needs to have some significance in a larger context to be encyclopedic. I also think the article is original research, since the references provide examples of the art, but they don't define it in the terms used in the article. Actually they don't define it at all, so I don't see how much of anything can be written about this subject without falling into the original research trap. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 30 June 2005 15:24 (UTC)</li>

<li>It'd be greatly appreciated if someone could explain to me what I've done wrong with writing this, perhaps so I can write better articles in the future. I've been using Wikipedia for a year and I have great respect for the guidelines governing articles. Boredome is a relatively obscure genre of art, but I'm sure a large quantity of Wikipedia articles have begun in the same way. And the subject is far from stagnant, considering the growing number of contributions and the approaching launch of a dedicated website for showcasing the art. It's especially frustrating to read so many votes for deletion citing original research and bias when I actually have very little to do with it, and also claims of its limit to one website while it has already spread to several.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article states that as of 2004 he plays for Aberdeen F.C. He is no longer playing for them and I have no idea if he is even still playing football.

"Laurent Djaffo" and "Laurent D'Jaffo" get (combined) nearly two thousand Google hits, and most of what's on the first few pages of each of those searches is relevant to this player.

<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The strict vote count was inconclusive with a clear majority voting to delete (made stronger after the discounting of several anonymous and very new users) but not the overwhelming concensus usually required. After careful review of the comments, evidence presented and the referenced websites however, I have to conclude that both the title and contents of the article are currently <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">unverified</a>. Speculation and rumor are explicitly <i>not</i> allowed in our encyclopedia articles (unless it is an article <i>about</i> an especially egregious and noteworthy article) and "placeholder" articles are typically justified in only the rarest of circumstances. In accordance with Wikipedia policy, I am going to exercise my discretion to delete this article. This deletion should not be considered as precedent if the article is re-created <i>after</i> it has been released (when we can be sure of having verifiable information and assuming that the game is, in fact, released under this name). <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 9 July 2005 04:58 (UTC)</p>

<p>Firstly this game doesn't exist yet, secondly it hasn't been announced yet, thirdly there are no hard facts in the article just internet fanboy speculation. When it's announced by Rockstar, then it can have an article <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexp73_ff12.html" title="User:Alexp73">Alexp73</a> 28 June 2005 21:19 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, the game doesn't exist yet, and no there's no hard facts, but the game has been referred to numerous times by those at the head of Rockstar. I don't think that it should be deleted, but at the very least, GTA4 should not refer to Vice City. One thing that is certain is that Vice City and San Andreas are part of the "GTAIII Trilogy", so perhaps this emphasis should be put in their respective articles. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeromaru_9d80.html" title="User:Zeromaru">Zeromaru</a> 28 June 2005 21:27 (UTC) EDIT: For those unaware, <i>GTA4</i> previously referred to Vice City.</p>

Perhaps we should vote for deletion of all those pages too? Guys, there are some things you can safely insert as place holder. It helps build the community of information on wikipedia. If there was no page, then people who may have useful information will be turned away. That's the last thing a small growing project like Wikipedia needs. There's a reason the {future} tag was invented. If Wiki didn't want speculation, the {future} tag would be a deletion device.

<li>That really <i>wasn't</i> a personal attack, just a choice of phrasing.

(I will happily respond on my Talk if you want!) I really think the reason other sports don't have this coverage is because Wikipedians haven't tried. I (and other participants in the WikiProject) believe this is a fantastic asset to Wikipedia's cricket coverage: it's something that's not available anywhere else, and when the season is over and we get the various articles finished it will be the only place people can come to look if they want detailed accounts of a club's performance through a season. --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> 29 June 2005 10:34 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Especially in original form, if someone with the know how will ascertain whether such practise does not put a strain on servers. I think it's a wonderful use of the technology available, and yes, why not expand it out to all sports if they so desire. Why shouldn't wikipedia attempt to collate such information?

Perhaps the use of the subpages in this way should be put into a policy/guidline proposal, but I see no reason for not doing it other than that nobody thought of it before. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 29 June 2005 08:18 (UTC)

<li>Sports reference books such as Wisden give articles similar to these, too, and they're published six months after the event - suggesting that they're not ephemeral. Plus, these articles are only there to act as "feeder" articles for the bigger picture articles (which is why people have argued they should be subpages). No newspaper would publish a detailed review of the entire season for each team, which is what we intend to do. Temporarily, we at WikiProject Cricket feel this is the best solution until the "final" update is written some time in October. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 29 June 2005 22:13 (UTC)</li>

Wikinews is the newspaper (and takes all of the match reports you can give). Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia.</i> — <b>okay, let's have a look</b> — <i>News reports. Wikipedia should not offer first-hand news reports on breaking stories (however, our sister project Wikinews does exactly that). Wikipedia does have many encyclopedia articles on topics of historical significance that are currently in the news, <b>and can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known</b>. See <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current events</a> for examples.</i> To my eye the exclusion refers to breaking news, rather than newsworthy events, a distinction which I think applies here, and makes the issue one of notability and context. These articles should be looked at in the proper context of their transclusion, and then the issue of notability should be applied. I would argue that an article on the County cricket season is notable, and since these articles are intended to be a part of that article, rather than standalone articles, I think they are notable and should be kept. I think perhaps this VfD should be set aside and the issue of the use of transclusion in this way should be put forward as a policy suggestion.

<li>A very very small number have some primary source material. It would be nice to think that WikiProject Cricket was large enough to have at least one member attend every first-class, list A and Twenty20 match. But alas, we're not that big yet. Most of the material I wrote is a mixture from Cricinfo, the BBC and The Times, with occasionally other sources coming in too - such as the county websites. You'd have to ask other contributors what their sources are, but as the major contributor is in Norway, my guess is that he isn't a primary source either (unless he has an awful lot of airmiles:) ). What we are doing here is writing something better than Wisden, produced much more quickly, and ultimately covering all Test nations, not just being English-based.

<li>We've always said that the transclusion is a temporary measure until the season is over, when there will be an opportunity to fully copyedit and amend the articles in the light of how the season ended up. At that point (probably at the end of October), the articles will be "subst"'d into the main articles. Transclusion is a necessary tool whilst the articles are being constructed, otherwise it would just take prohibitively long to create them.

<li>I just said above that I think this VfD is a bit of a red herring distracting us from the real issue, and that this VfD should be set aside for the moment and the matter of the usage of transclusion in the way it <i>was</i> being used to present these articles put forward as a policy suggestion, if it is currently frowned upon, since that seems to be the issue worthy of greater discussion. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 30 June 2005 07:45 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is a policy against this, actually. You're not supposed to use templates to masquerade as article content. That these templates reside in mainspace rather than template space is irrelevant.

<li>No, since an article like that combines a large number of events from the past. But for current events and all future cricket match reports, I think Wikinews is the best place (it would be nice if all the cricket reports on Wikinews were combined into a format like that.)<br />
What's more, I don't think that subpage's content is encyclopedic, but since it isn't in the main namespace, it isn't harming anyone. --<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_a1eb.html" title="User:Ardonik">Ardonik</a>.<a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdonik_e62b.html" title="User talk:Ardonik">talk()</a><a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_I_ate_my_cat_a1df.html" title="User:Ardonik/I ate my cat"><sup>*</sup></a> July 7, 2005 17:56 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> (I am gonna kinda play Devil's Advocate here so bear with me) Although this group is not huge, this page does not appear to be advertising.
