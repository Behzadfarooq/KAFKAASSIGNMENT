<p>The article is a <a href="../../../f/o/r/WP%7EFORK_4e79.html" title="WP:FORK">WP:FORK</a> of evolution from a perspective of creationists. The idea of "unguided evolution" is one that is claimed to be an atheist scientific view that eschews god.

<li><s><b>Delete.</b> This is a POV fork of <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>; an attempt to shift the concept widely known as "evolution" to a new name (one that is little used; it only gets 650 odd Google hits despite all the screeds written on this topic, suggesting that it's something of a neologism) to support the intelligent design POV.

<dd>Zocky, "guided evolution" is arguably Intelligent Design. "Unguided evolution" is simply evolution. That's why its a POV fork. A Google of evolution + guided + unguided - did you look at the returns? They were all, or very nearly all (I didn't follow *every* link returned) about the difference of Intelligent design and Evolution. We already have those articles. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 16:46, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is merit in the argument that a sane person who accepts that evolution is a real phenomenonon does not necessarily have to accept that it is <i>impossible</i> for some intelligent being to have tampered with it. In that light, believing in unguided evolution is a stronger version of believing in evolution. But that sort of info belongs in <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>. Rather, I see this as a dicdef++ article, like we have for many terms. There seems to be enough to write about the usage and meaning in different contexts. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 18:16, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - A neologism would not have as much information or provide as much insight into a creationist argument. If this information duplicated or were shorter I would suggest a merge but I found the article interesting and useful. My only complaint/suggestion would be to provide a "warning" at the top of the article to make it clear that this is only one viewpoint and is disputed by all other parties.

<li>That's why I put it in quotes. We have plenty of disputed warnings, NPOV warnings, spoiler warnings, ... I'm sure there are lots more.

<p>The article is a <a href="../../../f/o/r/WP%7EFORK_4e79.html" title="WP:FORK">WP:FORK</a> of evolution from a perspective of creationists. The idea of "unguided evolution" is one that is claimed to be an atheist scientific view that eschews god.</p>

<dd>No, actually an scientific view that eschews God's <b>intervention</b>.

<dd>This statement belies an unfamiliarity with the issues involved. It is your own opinion that this is a "scientific" view.

<dd>Red herring. Intelligent Design is a movement that is recognizable and notable as a subject that people agree they adhere to.

<dd>Original research means that you are writing based on your own perspectives and ideas based on the subject.

<dd><b>Comment</b> And I wasn't going to say anything before, but this comment pushes me over. It's really freaking disturbing to see an admin make these kind of comments. Wikipedia founding principles do not say "admins get to push their own POV into any articles they want and threaten other editors when they complain". I would suggest that Ed simply remove himself from all Evolution articles since he is unable to deal with the encyclopedic standards and consensus on these issues. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 17:44, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Thoroughly agreed with DreamGuy. Ed's conduct here is far, far beyond what is acceptable from a Wikipedia administrator. He's now not just threatening, by the way -- he actually did block Joshua, although another administrator unblocked him. Ed has systematically destroyed any pretense upon which we can continue to assume any good faith on his part. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 19:37, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Concur with DreamGuy also. Ed cannot seem to maintain neutrality or remain reasonable regarding evolution. I agree that he should recuse himself from this subject, and possibly create a website elsewhere if he feels his POV must be heard. WP is not the forum for this - and his abuse of admin privileges in order to push his POV is disconcerting, to say the least. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 19:05, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
