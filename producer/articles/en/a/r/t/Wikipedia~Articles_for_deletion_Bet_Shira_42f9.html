<p>As per past AfDs on religious groups and organisations, this one doesn't seem notable enough - no assertion that it's widely known outside the local area and/or Conservative Jewish community. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 17:59, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Bet Shira is known as one of the largest congregations of Conservative Jewry in the south. The Rabbi and Shul are well known in South Florida, and many Rabbi's continue to stay in the area and lecture on the Sabbath because of the large crowds Bet Shira draws. Elliot Dorf, the member of the Conservative movement who wrote the argument for allowing Gay marriage in Judaism will be an scholor staying at the Shul in febuary.

<li><b>Delete both</b>. Most individual religious congregations are non-notable, and the <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bet_Shira_2289.html" title="Bet Shira">Bet Shira</a> article has no sources and is written in the first person plural, thus making it unsuitable for Wikipedia per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micah_Caplan_3fe4.html" title="Micah Caplan">Micah Caplan</a> has been ordained as a rabbi for less than 5 years, thus making it unlikely that he qualifies under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The source used in the article about him only devotes 2 out of 26 paragraphs to him. Finally, the claim that he is "spiritual leader to the majority of Conservative Jews in South Florida" is impossible because there are 9 other Conservative synagogues just in Miami-Dade County, some of which are larger than Bet Shira, without even taking into account Broward and Palm Beach Counties. <a href="http://www.uscj.org/cgi-bin/synagogue.pl?fl" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uscj.org/cgi-bin/synagogue.pl?fl" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:36, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> has explained, the relevent Wikipedia policies here are <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> for the congregation and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>) for the rabbi. <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> requires proof that the organization's activities are national or international in scope and/or that the organization has been a principle subject of articles in independent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> has similar requirements.

None of these articles currently have any sources. Without sources, there will be no choice but to <b>Delete</b>. Supporters of this article should focus first and foremost on bringing in sources, if any can be found, and letting this discussion know about their progress. If this can be done, a rewrite reflecting a more <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a>, encyclopedic tone that avoids smacking of anything that might appear promotional would be in order as well.

<li>Shira: I have Wikified the article. It is only a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html" title="Wikipedia:Stub">Wikipedia:Stub</a> at this time, and as such all your citations of Wikipedia policies do not apply. Bet Shira is an important Conservative synagogue in Miami and as such it intersects with many other related subjects. If this synagogue can't get an article about itself then I would say <i>no</i> synagogue in Florida, or anywher in the USA would get an article. What makes a synagogue "notable" in the eyes of the world in any case? Size? Age? Membership? Or that they were all burned down in Germany on <i><a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristallnacht.html" title="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a></i>? There are no real fixed criteria here so kindly stop treating this as if we need to expect synagogues to be like "<a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Patrick%27s_Cathedral%2C_New_York_b6ec.html" title="St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York">St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York</a>" to get articles about them, 'cause it aint gonna happen, the Jews are just too small a group. Soon editors will tell us that Jews don't deserve articles on Wikipedia 'cause the paltry <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_population.html" title="Jewish population">Jewish population</a> of 13 million Jews is "not notable" in relation to the world's 6 billion other humans. So I would say you need to watch out before you spout all those "WP"s. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 12:55, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually, I didn't nominate <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micah_Caplan_3fe4.html" title="Micah Caplan">Micah Caplan</a> for deletion; I nominated <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bet_Shira_2289.html" title="Bet Shira">Bet Shira</a> on its own, and <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayrav_83fd.html" title="User:Jayrav">User:Jayrav</a> added Caplan to the AfD (see the edit history). I agree that the two should not have been nominated together. I came across Bet Shira when I was <a href="../../../n/p/p/WP%7ENPP_2bb0.html" title="WP:NPP">newpage patrolling</a>, and, based on Wikipedia policy (<a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> (and the proposed policy <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONG_d5cd.html" title="WP:CONG">WP:CONG</a>) and prior precedent, I felt it didn't merit inclusion in Wikipedia, as there was (at the time) no evidence that it was notable outside of the local area. Judging by the many Delete votes on the AfD, a lot of users agree. Although you've wikified the article, there's still not enough sources to demonstrate notability; the only external links are to the synagogue's own website. If, however, you can demonstrate (through the use of further reliable third-party sources) that the synagogue is influential and/or well-known outside its local area, then I will change my vote. I'm not saying it's automatically not notable, but at the moment there's a lack of sources to prove its notability. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 13:46, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Hi Walton monarchist89: Thank you for your thoughtful reply. You do not seem to understand the nature and workings of synagogues that do not function like churches and thus whatever is written in <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONG_d5cd.html" title="WP:CONG">WP:CONG</a> cannot really apply. It's <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apples_and_oranges.html" title="Apples and oranges">apples and oranges</a>. The Jews are a tiny people relative to the rest of the population, and only a minority attend synagogues today, so usually the synagogue is itself a reflection that Jews are notable in that locale from a religious and cultural perspective. Any synagogue represents the accomplishments of its membership (as well as its local and broader communities) at reaching a variety of notability criteria. This is a discussion that will need greater clarification. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:40, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
