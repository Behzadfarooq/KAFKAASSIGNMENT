<li><b>KEEP</b>: This article is about the evolution of the ranks and insignias as seen in the Star Trek productions from the 1960s to the present. While Star Trek itself is fictional, the insignia worn by the actors is not and has evolved over the past forty years in several television series and over ten motion pictures. This article is well written, referenced, and is not original research. To delete this would mean that all other fiction articles, such as articles about the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a>, the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millenium_Falcon_c708.html" title="Millenium Falcon">Millenium Falcon</a>, and <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phantasy_Star_4a35.html" title="Phantasy Star">Phantasy Star</a> (to name a few) would be up for deletion as well. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 5 July 2005 16:31 (UTC)

<li>There is no Starfleet, and hence no Starfleet ranks. That means they're fictional. Though I don't know who would be deranged enough to interpret this vote as a precedent to remove all other article about fiction, I'd be very interested in getting some names. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> July 5, 2005 16:39 (UTC)

<li>The insignia worn by the actors is real enough. Paramount costume department is paid well enough to make them.<s>On a side note (and I ask this becuase I really don't know not to be smart!) are VFDs supposed to have comments to the votes? Once someone votes Keep or Delete is that it or do people then make comments on the vote to get the person to change their mind?

<li>I don't think reanactment really changes the status of anything that's fictional... As far as the vote goes, it's like most others as far as I know. If you want to change your vote, feel free to do it.

<li><b>Keep</b>, it'll give these people something to do on Saturday nights. No, seriously, as much as this article scares me... and as many totally obscure and non-encyclopedic things that I'm sure the Trekkies could throw at us... the organization of Starfleet does not seem to be one of them. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> July 5, 2005 16:41 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - well written, well sourced article about factual material. Someone could write a dissertation on this. Sure, it's fancruft, but it's an encyclopaedia article about fancruft, not just a synopsis of an episode of a TV series or an article about a single character in a book or movie (see for example <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Riddle_60ba.html" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a>). <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 5 July 2005 17:10 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - it makes its fiction explicit, explains when things come from TV and when they're fan conjecture, is well sourced and referenced. To me, a model of what an article on a fictional topic should be. Now if only we had the same depth of coverage of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>. <a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">My Talk</a> July 5, 2005 17:18 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I would vote for the deletion of an article like this for most fannish pursuits, but Star Trek has had a very real, very tangible impact (often negative, in terms of stifling other efforts) on the business and culture of science fiction in film and television over the span of 30 years. By that benchmark, Star Trek minutae are just as much cultural footnotes as any other <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>-era details. I wouldn't cry if someone merged it into some larger topic and redirected, but I don't think it's necessary. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 5 July 2005 17:21 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I wouldn't have writtne this article, nor am i likely to contribute to it nor to consult it often, although I am fond of startrek. But I see no more problem with this than with any detail about a fictional universe, and less than many. However this article does demonstrate why, IMO most articles about details of fictional univese (such as characters, places, and the like) would benefit from a consistant notation linking them to their primary subjects and in effect taking them out of the main articel namespace. Something like <b>Star Trek -- Rank insignia</b> or <b>Middle Earth -- Cats of Queen Berutheil</b> might be a good standard. If subpages were not so strongly objected to, this might be a goos sue for them. This idea has been briefly discussed over on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fictional_Series_General_5ef2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fictional Series/General">Wikipedia:WikiProject Fictional Series/General</a> but no decision has been made. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 5 July 2005 17:22 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Fancruft, fictional, non-encyclopedic. I don't care how fascinating Star Trek is, none of it is REAL. Do we want 20,000 articles on every character and place name in LOTR? I love both of these made-up worlds, but I want my encyclopedia to stay rooted in this one. All those voting "keep" above should re-read their comments and admit that these type of articles belong on fan sites, not here. -(Unsigned vote by <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">User:DavidH</a> 5Jul05)

<li>You're arguing for the support of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. This is <i>one</i> article on all the ranks and insignia. ONE!

<li>I am underway in adding real world info, i.e. the people that actually created the ranks and the franchise that made the insignia for both the television and movies. When that is added, there will certianly be real world applications. My thanks to <a href="../../../x/i/o/User%7EXiong_2293.html" title="User:Xiong">Xiong</a> for bringing that issue to light.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Star Trek is one of the most well-known franchises in science. <i><b>I can't think of a single other work of fiction</b></i> that has seen 10 movies, 5 television series (700+ epsodes in 28 seasons), and I have-no-clue how many novels. Actually, I'm curious if there is anything close to Star Trek... The Simpsons only has 17 seasons but no movies. Fancruft strikes at the heart of "what is notable?" and my answer has essentially been: whatever someone wants to write about; the more people that would read or write it the more notable it is. Notability is not in the eye of any one person, but only one's <i>assessment</i> of notability. The article in question has <b>OVER 600 EDITS IN 5 MONTHS</b> and I can't think of much more of a slap in the face to the uncountable hours people have spent on this than to delete it. So to explicitly state something like this is non-notable and uninteresting to 45 editors (mind you that's only writers...readers is uncountable) is arrogant beyond measure that it's insulting. (And for the record, I've only made 8 edits to this article.) <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> July 5, 2005 18:58 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I guess I'm not of the opinion that a certain number of edits or editors is a criteria for inclusion (and for a very good reason). So how about staying away from the pure <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">personal stuff</a>, hm? /<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 18:50, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nice straw man. Nevermind that I laid out my definition of notability but attack numbers used to apply my definition to this article: the point is that 45 editors find it notable and, so far, there are only two people here that don't. Clearly, it is not my definition of notability that needs readjustment. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 05:30, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As far as WP:CIVIL goes, saying that your VFD is insulting is not being uncivil. Maybe you need to take a look around and see where the vote lies: aside from your vote, there's only <i>one other delete vote</i>. I still find your VFD insulting and your attitude about me being incivil, also, as arrogant. If you care to continue this then take it to my talk page. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 05:30, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
