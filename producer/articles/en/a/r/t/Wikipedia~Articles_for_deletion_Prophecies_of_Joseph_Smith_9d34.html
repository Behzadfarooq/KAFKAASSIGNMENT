<p>I don't see any way that this article could eventually conform to NPOV. It has about as much potential as a page devoted to examining the Scriptural backgrounds of papal proclamations. Furthermore, by analyzing the claimed prophecies, it would violate the "No original research" policy. Analysis of whether a prophecy is true prophecy or not belongs on sites other than Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/a/d/User%7EKadett_d327.html" title="User:Kadett">Kadett</a> 23:36, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This has already been discussed. The article has undergone major changes as a result. I believe the idea right now is to document the prophesies only, and make no attempt to determine truthfullness, which, as you've suggested, would be inappropriate. I thought this page should go away previously as it could serve only to promote fighting. See the take page for history and details. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 23:54, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Up until recently I had serious reservations about this article, but they have since been resolved.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article is important and can detail a vast amount of research done by various people on this critical topic.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Agree strongly with K. This was how the page was originally organized, but this was opposed by several users. I think the page should have prophecy, evidence for, and evidence against -- this make it useful to see how Smith's prophecies have been interpreted by supporters and critics. Perhaps a neutral editor could be brought on board to help sort these issues out.
<dl>
<dd><b>Response</b>: Absolutely. The article certainly needs work, but I think that it can be worthwhile. NPOV doesn't mean no POVs are allowed; it simply means both (or more) POVs should be included. I have never read any of Smith's prophecy's and have no idea how to work out if they came true. This article could help by explaining both how supporters think it came true and why critics say they didn't. Being new to Smith's teachings, I'd be happy to help in adding different interpretations. --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonrad_West_6f02.html" title="User:Konrad West">K.</a> 00:23, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Provisionial Keep</b>, This article can be informative and a worthwhile article on Wiki. However, it should be limited to a list of prophecies and possibly a very, limited explanation of each prophecy. Readers are quite capable of determining the value of each prophecy without an interpretation from each side or arguement regarding the validity of Joseph Smith's prophecy. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> 16:22, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The article is problematic. Smith was constantly issuing prophecies. A list of all of his prophecies would be a good part of his writing and speeches, much too long to fit in one article. Most of the prophecies listed so far are ones which are considered to have come true, gathered from pro-Mormon sites. Most of the prophecies are as unspecific as Nostradamus's prophecies. Almost anything could match the prophecy. Discussing the accuracy of the prophecy is worthwhile. Where does one go to find out information about <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophecies_of_Joseph_Smith_9c6d.html#Dan_Jones_to_visit_Wales" title="Prophecies of Joseph Smith">Dan Jones</a>? <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophecies_of_Joseph_Smith_9c6d.html#Word_of_Wisdom_related_conspiracies" title="Prophecies of Joseph Smith">Prophecies_of_Joseph_Smith#Word_of_Wisdom_related_conspiracies</a> is similarly vague, but meaningful to modern Mormons. How can a casual viewer determine what these mean without further references? Maybe that is the point of a prophecy, it is general enough that it is probably true. <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> 17:45, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Provisional Delete</b>: The article as it stands at this time has no substantive content. There is no discussion of which of the prophecies have been fulfilled, or partially fulfilled, or failed. If the article previously had such content, then its deletion while a VfD was in process is a serious breach of Wikiquette, resembling, but not exactly, vandalism. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 22:14, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I find a few of the above comments disconcerting. Wikipedia is not a soapbox and it's not a battleground. A religious war has no place in an encyclopedia.

<dd>The difficulty of analyzing prophecies is first identifying the meaning. As you review the current article's history, the two sides are miles apart on what Joseph Smith meant in a prophecy. I do find it interesting that those outside of the LDS church seem so stridently confident that their interpretation is the only legitimate prism through which to review Smith's prophecy. Conversely, those who are followers of Smith believe there is only one prism; the one that makes a prophecy true. I still remain unmoved that readers are not capable of reading individual prophecies and making their own interpretation of what it is meant. An introduction to the prophecy is adequate, but an analysis will only result in constant revert wars as is so evident in this article. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> 22:29, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. Interpreting the Independence temple prophecy in D&amp;C 84 depends on what Joseph Smith meant by "generation." Critics believe he meant within his lifetime. Believers believe <i>generation</i> is synonymous with <i>dispensation</i>. Some context here is necessary to understand the possible interpretations. I say give both and let the reader decide which is correct (or if they want a third alternative). --<a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWhipple_f285.html" title="User:MrWhipple">MrWhipple</a> 23:13, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>An analysis shouldn't be original research or opinion; it should simply state what different groups believe as to how the prophecy came true. That isn't POV, it's presenting facts about what people believe. How will there be edit wars about that? Does anyone disagree on what the LDS think about his prophecies? --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonrad_West_6f02.html" title="User:Konrad West">K.</a> 04:01, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Many of the prophecies do not have official LDS interpretations. This is especially true of prophecies which may not have come true. There definitely is not a monolithic non-LDS viewpoint. However, this should be attempted. Let's try it with one or two prophecies, perhaps in the talk section, and see what it looks like. <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> 13:21, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That sounds good. As long as we stick to "this group believes this, while this other group believes this" then we don't get into POV issues of "this didn't come true/this did come true". --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonrad_West_6f02.html" title="User:Konrad West">K.</a> 13:40, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
