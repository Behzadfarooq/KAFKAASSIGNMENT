<li>In the UK we have an election every 3-5 years; at each election 600-odd seats are contested, every one meeting the old <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> - now, there will be at least <i>three</i> candidates per constituency meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and often more (in Wales you might get Labour, Conservative, Lib-Dem, Plaid Cymru, maybe UKIP and sometimes a credible independent as well). And while the winner tends to stay for several terms, the defeated candidates usually disappear back to the day job and are never heard of again. This is going to result in an avalanche of gushing articles about people who, but for losing one election, would never be considered for a Wikipedia article - do they get dleeted afterwards because they are no longer running for office?

<dd>This discussion should take place on the talk page for BIO, not here. But I'd point out that even if every major-party 2006 U.S. and Candian legislative candidate gets an article, and we throw in every major-party candidate from the 2005 UK election, they would still make up only a tiny percetage of the 1 million plus articles Wikipedia will have by next year. Articles on losing candidates who don't go on to do anything special can just sit there until the candidate dies.</dd>
<dd>It's also worth noting that it's rare that you would get a complete non-notable person as a credible, major-party congressional candidate.

<dd>And for every individual like that, you'll have literally dozens of other articles that will never be expanded beyond "This person was a nominee in such-and-such election, and didn't win. They're now selling insurance in Poughkeepsie." If the person is notable, the article will be created on its own and will survive an AfD. The notion that we must create an article on every person who might, someday, be notable under the proper confluence of circumstance is not a notion that will lead to a quality Wikipedia. → <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extreme_Unction_b4bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extreme Unction">blah</a></sub></font>} 02:19, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Are you saying that there's not enough to be written on most congressional candidates, or that people won't bother? As I pointed out with <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Hackett_1070.html" title="Paul Hackett">Paul Hackett</a>, detailed articles can be written even about "outsider" candidates with little political experience. I would guess that with so many Wikipedia editors interested in politics, we can expect to see full articles on many if not most major-party congressional candidates next year. But for AfD, the key is not whether people want to expand stubs but rather whether there is enough verifyable info out there to do so. With campaign websites, campaign-finance databases, newspaper stories, League of Women Voters guides, etc., there is more than enough available for any major-party candidate. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 05:06, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b>. I don't see any reason not to keep it. And the argument that, because a policy might ALLOW (not DEMAND) the creation, and keeping, of an article for any credible candidate in the offices mentioned above, there would be a huge load of articles is no reason to get rid of an article on a mayor of an important city and who additionally has run for Congress. Yes, the article is tiny at the moment; but who's to say it won't become bigger and have fascinating information and loads of cross-references to all kinds of other interesting Wiki stuff? One could already be writing an article on the Babbitt political family—for apparently this guy's brother was not only governor but also Secretary of the Interior. I don't know whether that's Arizona's interior or at the federal level; but, either way, this could be the start of Wiki pieces well worth keeping. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreslethe_e6c4.html" title="User:Preslethe">President Lethe</a> 21:31, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
