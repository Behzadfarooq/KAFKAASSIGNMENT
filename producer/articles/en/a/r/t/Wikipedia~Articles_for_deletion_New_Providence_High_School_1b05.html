<li><b>Keep</b> (see proposal below) the new stub, but it definately needs major expansion. I admit the stub is very short, and normally I would never create a new stub on a school that small, but I wanted to replace the silly content which was there. From reading a bit, it seems to have some potential. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:36, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Did something change about schools? They're being nominated at a horrific rate. Usually a little effort goes into improving an article before listing on AfD. I see nothing on the talk page for this school which indicates its anything but a stub. I concur that the "intellignet" typist needs practice, but that has nothing to do with the article. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 13:49, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Providence%2C_New_Jersey_c0c6.html" title="New Providence, New Jersey">New Providence, New Jersey</a>. The High School and Middle School have to share facilities. One or two paragraphs on all the schools in one article gives a better idea of education in the area than four separate articles with one paragraph in each that partially repeat each other. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 14:00, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Proposal: I suggest we keep the article, but rename it <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Providence_School_District_dad9.html" title="New Providence School District">New Providence School District</a>. Keep the category, and categories for middle and elementary, thus treating this as a proper school article. Two paras for the high school, 1 for each of of other 3 schools, and one for the board, gives 6 paras, fairly easily. That's a full separate article. Promptly create-the required re-directs before somebody makes more stubs. Anybody searching for one of the schools, will find a school article, about that school. Merging with a borough would mess up categories by merging overly distinct things. Categories are a fundamental navigation tool in wikipedia, and must be meaningfull, but flexible. I see this as a pretty fair middle ground, in between 4/5 stubs and no article fit to be in a school category. Note: my vote stays the same, since my idea does not require an AFD, and with 20/20 hindsight, is how this should have been done instead of an AFD. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 15:13, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A clear example of the misuse of the AfD process. Nominator was aware that the school was possibly verifiable and re-writable. High Schools have a near 100% survival rate of the VfD/AfD process. AfD is <b>not</b> a tool to force the re-write of articles in WP.
