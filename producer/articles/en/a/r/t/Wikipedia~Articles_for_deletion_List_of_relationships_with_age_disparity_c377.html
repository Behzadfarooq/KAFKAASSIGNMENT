<p>I have to admit, this one has me at a little bit of a loss. It appears to violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> by being an indescriminate collection of information, as well as being unencyclopedic and impossible to ever make anything approaching complete thereby being POV in what it includes or leaves out. It is also POV and original research in the sense that the user who created the page created his own definition for what constitutes an age disparity (or at least does not cite a source for this definition). I believe that by nearly any measure this does not belong. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 03:13, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You seem to just hate the concept of lists. Lists <i>aren't</i> encyclopedic and were never meant to be, its just another tool for organizing the encyclopedic entries contained within Wikipedia. We use categories for the same purpose. Lists are almanacical, or almanac-like. Almanacs contains pages of information sorted by one of the variables. Since lists can be sorted by one of the variables they are inherently useful. I rarely use the index or footnotes in any of the books I read, but I don't call for them to be eliminated since they are useful to others. You seem to be confused and think that lists are not allowed in Wikipedia. Please read <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_98bd.html" title="Wikipedia:List">Wikipedia:List</a>. Lists have become so important to Wikipedia that there is now a featured list. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 03:31, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can you explain more why you consider it "indescriminate"? It was written to be very discriminating and the inclusion criteria are listed and clear. Is it that you don't like the topic or are upset because you think that the entries are indescriminate. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 05:44, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your deliberate ignorance annoys me. If I hate lists so much, why have I contributed to several? Your assumption of me basing deletion decisions on likes or dislikes annoys me. I have stated how I believe this list violates several wikipedia policies, and you are violating wikipedia policy by not <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a> that this is in fact my motivation. You are free to disagree with my interpretation of the policies, but you cannot deny I am making a valid argument based on policy. You are being civil, so you are not rising to the level of a personal attack or anything so awful, but you are being impolite nonetheless, and I would appreciate it if you stuck to rational policy arguements rather than making value judgements and lecturing me. Oh, and if you had read <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_98bd.html" title="Wikipedia:List">Wikipedia:List</a>, or more specifically, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a>, you would see that it is explained that the creator of a list on a slightly unusual topic should be prepared to justify it to the community. AfD is merely a way to reach that community. You need to not take the process so personally; I will certainly not if the majority votes to keep. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 03:56, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> No useful information, or navigation potential from the list. It engages in a bit of "guilt by association" (by mixing adult-only relationships with adult/minor relationships). It has great potential for attacks on <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">living people</a>. It has no citations whatsoever, despite the nature of some entries. That seems to be a violation of policy. Here's a dubious example: "<i>Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn, 35 years. She was his stepdaugher and 22 years</i>". Now, to my knowledge, Woody was involved with Soon-Yi's mother (Mia), but was not legally married to Mia, and Soon-Yi was never a step-daughter. If she was his legal step-daughter, he would be guilty of a serious criminal offence. Further, there have been conflicting reports as to whether Soon-Yi's exact age is known. Now, my understanding of facts, may well be totally wrong. I would love to check the sources, to verify the information, but of course, no source is cited. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 06:33, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>This is a list</b>, not a Wikipedia article. It lists the information within Wikipedia articles and sorts the data. It does not need its own external references because it doesn't include anything novel. Its a navagation device, like a table of contents, or an index. Adding sources would be redundant. Did you try clicking on a link as I suggested before? All the references you show, concern articles not lists. So, are you challenging the age of the individuals involved? or are you challenging my math in calculating the age disparity?

<li><b>Keep</b>. I thought it was an interesting subject for an article, and it's not like it's merely a list of name after name without useful information.

<li><b>Keep</b> for much the same reasons as <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_L_Rattigan_f48b.html" title="User:David L Rattigan">David L Rattigan</a>. It does need some work, though. The formatting needs to be standardised. The final category "Less than 10 years" seems a bit pointless. It's open-ended, so presumably a relationship with an age disparity of only 6 months could go there. The smallest disparity currently shown is 6 years, hardly eyebrow-raising. I'd remove the final category, have a minimum disparity of 10 years as a criterion for inclusion, and rename the list "List of relationships with a significant age disparity" or something like that. But to remove the list altogether would be to decrease the sum of human knowledge about interesting things, and I could not possibly support that. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 08:53, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It seems to me that it is in keeping with the purpose of an encyclopaedia to organize information for the readers. The fact that the guidelines for selection are somewhat arbitrary is unavoidable. We run into that all the time when we discriminate between what is notable and what is not, and the criteria used in this article are analogous. Now I do not know whether the purpose of this article is best served by means of an article or by means of a category. But the accusations of "POV" and "OR" do not ring true to me. Would you say the same thing about an article on pornography? <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 11:05, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Yet another list with vague and arbitrary criteria governing what can/should be included in the list. Who determined the cutoff of 10/5? Strictly speaking... one spouse being 2 years older would be an age disparity. Where was it decided that it suddenly becomes encyclopedic once the 10/5 diparity was reached? Why different criteria for men and women? The guidelines are simply too arbitrary and are inherently POV and possibly constitute <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original reseach</a>--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 12:57, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What point of view? Its done using math I learned in grade school, subtract the little number away from the big one. Try it. Are you sure you know what "misogynistic" means? Is it misogynistic to keep seperate male and female lists for all the Olympic records? And finally the numer 10 is no more arbitrary than using 10 in top ten lists...you have to choose some number.
<dl>
<dd>The point of view is that you hold AgeX-AgeY=DifferenceZ&gt;10 to be of some signifiance and something worth noting. As for <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misogyny.html" title="Misogyny">misogyny</a>, it indicates discrimination and prejudice against women, although sexism is perhaps a better word in this context. Regardless, it is completely idiotic to lower the limit for women, simply because they're women. No, your stupid analogy has no bearing on this; separate Olympic records is due to differing physical ability which plays no part whatsoever in age disparity between married couples.

<li><b>Keep</b> The only violation of <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> here is that the cutoff isn't defined, and there are no shortage of ways to solve this. The simplest might be to move the article to "List of relationships <b>by</b> age disparity" or some such thing. Also, it would probably be better to replace the word "relationship" with "romantic relationship" or even "marriage" (my mother and I have a relationship with a 25 year age disparity). If you're still concerned about having a glut of 1-5 year disparities at the bottom of the article, there's nothing that says we can't divide this by the decade, as in Category:Entertainers who died in their 20's, <a href="../../../e/n/t/Category%7EEntertainers_who_died_in_their_30s_b060.html" title="Category:Entertainers who died in their 30s">Category:Entertainers who died in their 30s</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. What list is ever complete? So if a list isn't complete, you remove it? What a nonsensical reason. Concerning the title, yeah, you're technically correct; every single relationship has "age disparity" but I'm sure the authors and readers would be thinking along age disparities <i>which are significant</i>. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">User:Gareth Owen</a>: A name change would remove your reason for voting – your vote is powerfully thought out.

It comes directly from the Wikipedia article linked. If the ages are wrong correct them. My campaign for people to read the article and vote is no different than a "get out the vote" campaign in presidential politics. The dissemination of information is what Wikipedia is all about...right? If I violated a rule somewhere quote it to me.

<dd>This is a bit of devil's advocacy, but why don't you consider a 5-year cut-off to be excessively arbitrary criteria? Why not 4 years, 3 years, or 10 years?

<dd>It's not a magic number. It's picked for the sake of convenience. Alternatively, the article could be changed to List of articles by age disparity, and all marriages included, but it's unlikely that anyone is interested in even a five-year gap.

<li><b>Keep</b> Many of the arguments on this page are long-winded and redundant, so I shall endeavor not to do the same. This article is meant to educate the reader, and also to serve as a collection and congealing of knowledge and information spread among hundreds of other pages. Any argument about usefulness is as POV as anything else. The information included in the article is factual. If you have an issue with the facts, CORRECT THEM. If you don't like the 10/5 issue, make your opinion known, but don't vote for deletion. If every article was deleted from Wikipedia simply because it was in error, or someone disagreed with the design, layout, or information included, Wikipedia would be just another unheard of website.

<li><b>Delete</b>. POV. The explanatory sentence starts out fine with "The older partner is listed first" but "followed by the magnitude of the disparity" smacks of sensationalism. "followed by age difference" would be less *gasp*like in tone. The explanation is effectively forgotten when the entry has "x was older" even though the older partner is listed first. Women are given almost three times the "was older" notation than men. I counted three with men, eight with women. That strikes me of the entertainment magazines trumpeting in surprise that the woman's older.

I find it encyclopedic... my paper Encyclopedia Britannica has lists in it, like a list of all institutions of higher learning in the world; and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. I found this list to be useful and stimulating, just the sort of thing I like to find in Wikipedia. I don't find it indiscriminant at all, except perhaps the 5-10 year portion; there is an obvious unifying theme.<a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnugspout_c970.html" title="User:Snugspout">snug</a> 10:36, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Weak <b>Keep</b>. I too was talk-spammed. As an inclusionist I lean against deletion in most cases, but this article had me really, really tempted- there's a lot wrong with it. The gender disparity in the list should be addressed. The criteria for list inclusion should be tightened seriously. The minimum age disparity should be at least 20 years (a generation). Marriage of minors should be moved to a different list entirely. Sources should be provided. The list should require committed relationships such as marriage for inclusion. That said, the list makes a good reference of examples for an article on the social effects of May-December marriages and the like, so it shouldn't be junked entirely- just MASSIVELY reworked. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedneckgaijin_3655.html" title="User:Redneckgaijin">Redneckgaijin</a> 16:07, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This is a frequently discussed topic in celebrity gossip, at least. The less than ten years section definitely needs to go and I'm not entirely sold on the 10-19 category, either. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 16:43, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable topic. (Also see above.) <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinnyweed_5519.html" title="User:Skinnyweed">Skinnyweed</a> 23:18, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The topic is worthy of note, but the list needs some serious work. A 5 year age difference is hardly notable. Even 10 or 15 years probably isn't enough to justify inclusion on a list, given the sheer number of such relationships. However, a very large age disparity is unusual, and due to the unusualness, is notable. The list needs to be winnowed quite a bit, but the topic itself is worthy of inclution. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoIdeaNick_49e4.html" title="User:NoIdeaNick">NoIdeaNick</a> 04:16, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> on "generic" keep opinions: there is no reason that anyone has to look at an article before making up their minds as to whether it should be deleted. Deletion should arguably be determined by the <i>topic</i> of a page, not by its <i>content</i>; if someone first started up <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Album_Notes_-_Classical_84b2.html" title="Grammy Award for Best Album Notes - Classical">Grammy Award for Best Album Notes - Classical</a> <small>(yes, that was <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">random</a>)</small> with the content "faksighewigu84", it would be reasonable to say "replace with a quick summary and keep" (if it weren't speediable, anyway). Likewise, if someone started ajg399399999 with a brilliant article on [insert topic here], it would be correct to say "merge anything useful and delete" even without having to read the actual content. Whether people have read this article is irrelevant.
<p>Frankly, I don't get what anyone is supposed to say about the specific article altogether. It's basically just what the title says: a list of relationships sorted by age disparity. I find it disturbing that not alluding to this directly puts some people under suspicion of being shills or something.</p>
<p>And finally, I would like to note that it <i>is</i> definitely good to point out that people's opinions were solicited; I don't object to that (which is why I did it for myself). But questioning the legitimacy of those opinions based on the logic that they must address the content of the article rather than its subject is unreasonable. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 19:15, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not important to check the content, and do a bit of research to check what other articles are available... y'know, basic research before commenting (merge is an option, you know). Right-oh. That's certainly an... interesting argument to try. As for you being disturbed, well... I highlighted <i>only</i> those people whose votes were solicited *and* at the same time rather obviously did not put even the slightest effort into their comments. I feel that was a good compromise, since the kind/size of spamming engaged in here is explictly discouraged. I'd also like to note that votes of the kind "Keep, the topic is worthy of note" is not any kind of argument, since there already is an article on the topic of <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships.html" title="Age disparity in sexual relationships">Age disparity in sexual relationships</a> -- and the difference can be/is discussed in context. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 19:41, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a>, by your logic, one could say that "Delete per nom" or "Delete, listcruft" or "Delete, it's gossip" are "no-effort" comments. A reason for delete/keep doesn't have to be a tome. You're on the verge of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick" rel="nofollow">being one of these</a> . ...<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJaguara_dac8.html" title="User:Jaguara">Jaguara</a> Jaguara 21:19, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What are you talking about "tome"? Would you like to try again, after reading back over the comments (as I asked you to do last time) and without the overstatement and attempt at an insult? This AFD was heavily <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>MED to anyone in <a href="../../../i/n/c/Category%7EInclusionist_Wikipedians_bf63.html" title="Category:Inclusionist Wikipedians">Category:Inclusionist Wikipedians</a>. There's absolutely nothing wrong with me pointing out those users who did *all* of the following: responded to the spam, made no effort at commenting on the article beyond a simple generic statement, and did not reveal the fact that they had been requested to come here. I *specifically* (and noted this publicly) did not criticise those users who did not fulfill the above criteria -- and I have a list of users who were spammed, and many of them did comment in this AFD, with no reply from me. But hey, why let things like simple facts get in the way of confusing this issue further? - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 21:48, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Highlighting people who were spammed is valuable. Criticizing them for not putting effort into their comments is not. No, it is not necessarily important to check the content of an article, for the reasons I stated. And yes, "this topic is worthy of note" is a valid argument despite the existence of <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships.html" title="Age disparity in sexual relationships">Age disparity in sexual relationships</a>, because "X" is a different topic from "List of X". —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 21:54, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't "highlight people who were spammed" -- as I explained above, I was more selective. Yes... criticising people who were spammed, didn't reveal it, and not putting the slightest effort into a comment is perfectly correct thing to do... and if it happens again, I will do exactly the same thing. And yes... it is necessary to examine the contents of an article before commenting, again, as I explained above since delete or keep is not the only option. And no, "the topic is of note is not a valid argument" since there already is an article on this topic (which a commenter might know if they'd done more than just look at the title)... and in this case it's not just a crappy list made up of gossip. But apart from that lot, you're absolutely correct. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 22:18, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Simetrical, I said I wasn't going to comment further, but your remarks compelled me to. I agree with your comment completely. I too was messaged by Mr. Norton, and I didn't mention it. I also didn't mention that I was living in Tennessee, that I was a male, or that I was a college student - any of these facts are readily available online. Thank you for your comment - you may have noticed that I accused motor of trolling earlier - while he may not be doing it intentionally, the vast majority of his comments on this page have been inflamatory and, while perhaps not intentionally so, aimed at belittling those he was commenting on. He has been attempting to reduce their comments to worthlessness, all the while behind a thin veneer of caring about the integrity of this page. Anyway, I just wanted to show my support for your statements. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilton_Stanley_31bb.html" title="User:Milton Stanley">Milton</a> 21:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
