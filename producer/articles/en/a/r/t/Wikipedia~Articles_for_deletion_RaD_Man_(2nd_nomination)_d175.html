<li>To say it "survived" VfD is slight simplification. Majority of votes were delete, but no clear consensus was reached, which is not that same as a consensus to keep. Think of it more as a mistrial. This is quite clearly at least partially a vanity page. I also find it slightly unsettling that this is being used as a user page. I'm going to go with <b>delete</b>, but at the very least it has to undergo some cleanup. If this guy clears the notability bar he does it by a hair, and this article should reflect that a bit better, and not make him out to be the digital-age Picasso. Far too many external links; their main pupose seems to be to say "Look! This guy is notable. He's been interviewed alot". -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:23, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, he barely survived the VfD prior, so what if its used as a use page. if <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">KenJen</a> were here, he might use wikipedia's page about him as his user page, but both RaD Man and KenJen, live in the technological world. RaD Man is notable, 'and' here at wikipedia, who cares if they overlap? Also, have you seen his work? He could be considered the ANSI picasso.

<li>By my calculations, October 18, when this was first nominated for deletion, was substantially more than 72 hours ago. As stated on the talk page results were "ambiguous", and I don't think it's a crime to relist a month later in hopes of a less ambiguous result (though whether one can expect such a result is another question entirely). -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:27, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<li>By My Calculations, the FvD tag was removed from the article on the evening of 12 Nov 2004.

<li>Votes were tallied on Oct 26 and the VfD tag was removed by RickK on Nov. 2. If it was restored after that and again removed that is inconsequential.

<li>Comment on comment: While <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> is a <a href="../../../s/e/m/Wikipedia%7ESemi-policy_8a81.html" title="Wikipedia:Semi-policy">Wikipedia:Semi-policy</a>, it still meets it: <i>Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is recognized as exceptional and likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field</i> The President of the louvre's work virtually <i>is</i> the historical record of that field. Likewise, RaD Man's work <i>is</i> the historical record of the field. This is a little bit of a strecth, because the President of the Louvre didn't create the art, but no art history (the field of the president of the louvre) professor (I've known a couple), would claim that the Louvre is unecessary. What about the other suggested criteria?:
<ul>
<li>The professor test, a silly test for the kinds of people like presidents of organizations who don't publish.</li>
<li>Verifiability. The louvre is about documenting the history of art. Their work is the verification. A silly test for the people who create works of history.</li>
<li>Expandability. This is a test of the article and its writers mostly, except to say that it could happen.</li>
<li>100 Year Test. Yes, the president of the louvre article would be very insteresting, I'm interested, if for no other reason than this discussion, the president of the louvre passes this test. (such a thing could happen for Rad man in the future).<a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 11:24, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Auto-Biography, not for the president of the louvre, how did you miss this one?</li>
<li>Informative. Could happen for the president of the louvre, and is for RaD Man if you ask me.</li>

<ul>
<li>I don't have to explain my comment. It's quite clear what I mean. Even if you scrape together enough votes to win a 2/3 majority, you have made no headway on convincing those who were for keeping it that your reasons for wanting it deleted were valid. If the numbers voting are sufficiently large, the 1/3 who oppose a vote form a large enough bloc to stymie <b>any</b> idea of consensus, particularly when they are not members of one faction or another. And while the deletionists are commenting along these lines "Abuse or not, this must go", I think that any pretence that you are aiming for consensus of any kind is ridiculous. It is clear that you are rather hoping to hustle it out by force of numbers. You will keep listing it until you get your majority, claim the vote was consensual and delete the article. You might just as well not bother with the vote and go the whole hog.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 05:51, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: Sorry, <a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a>, but I think your math is a bit off. The final vote in the previous discussion was 13 delete to 10 keep (with up to 2 probable sockpuppets). Assuming only 8 keeps, this article still would have required 16 clear deletes to achieve 2/3 supermajority. Consensus may be achievable through an immediate re-discussion but it is rare. So far, no one has presented new evidence. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></li>

<p>Some people have different ideas over how long you can wait after a VfD before renomination, whether a consensus was reached or not. I would imagine that "one month from the close of nomination" is a bare minimum for acceptable delay (some believe it should be six months), and that any furfther nomination for this page within one month from teh close of this one (i.e. <b>19 December</b>) would definitely be invalid, regardless of whether or not consensus is reached. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 04:40, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Is this what you imagine or is this a rule? Bear in mind the result of the previous vote was <i>not</i> "keep". A clear majority voted delete, and the result was deemed "ambiguous". I would largely agree with you if the previous VfD yielded a consensus to keep, but that is by no means what happened. Now to be clear, if, as you say, one must wait a month from its previous nomination, and this nomination is invalid, then one would not have to wait a month from now to repost, but simply a month from its last "valid" nomination, correct? I don't want a precedent set wherein some article is nominated every few weeks and every time its filled with votes basically saying "this was here a few weeks ago. keep" until the end of time, without any other rationalization. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:20, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Since I get <i>vastly</i> different google results from you when searching "rad man", I am assuming you searched for "radman", which gets alot of hits, but I didn't see any right away that were the person in question. In fact, your search proves that the title "radman" should, if anything, be the title of an entirely different article. As for "rad man", yes I get over 6,000 hits, but that is not necessarily the ultimate test. Google is a generally a good way to attest non-notability, rather than prove notability. Unless something is totally unknown or completely fabricated it should show up on google, but that does not mean that something that shows up on google a certain number of times is notable. Google is obviously weighted in favor of online and computer-related phenomena. It does help to verify something's existence, but exstence is not the issue here. Looking at a few of these early listings of rad man search results I get alot of pages that really don't help, see: <a href="http://www.googlism.com/where_is/r/rad_man/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.googlism.com/where_is/r/rad_man/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> or <a href="http://www.comingsoon.net/forums/member.php?u=8190" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comingsoon.net/forums/member.php?u=8190" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> or <a href="http://www.planetgamecube.com/news.cfm?action=item&amp;id=792" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.planetgamecube.com/news.cfm?action=item&amp;id=792" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. At least pages like this <a href="http://www.icq.com/whitepages/wwp.php?uin=15175140" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icq.com/whitepages/wwp.php?uin=15175140" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> are clearly the right person, but do nothing to establish notability.

<li><i><b>Strong Keep</b></i> borderline <b>abuse</b>. I guess I have to vote again. I find nothing wrong with this page according to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. The article is well written. Interesting content. Multiple contributors. Encyclopedic. NPOV. It would be silly to have the <a href="../../../a/c/i/ACiD_800e.html" title="ACiD">ACiD</a> page link to a user page. The serious conccern seems to be of fame/nobility (non issue? <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity page</a>), but I'll mention a few things anyway. I've heard of the guy before wikipedia. I met him at a conference where he spoke. Got my picture taken with him <a href="http://topaz.cs.byu.edu:8080/RaD.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://topaz.cs.byu.edu:8080/RaD.jpg" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. He's a legend in his field. A notable artist. The president of the digital-age Louvre. What's not notable? The <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demoscene.html" title="Demoscene">demoscene</a>?

<li>All good arguments but you voted above! Perhaps you wouldn't mind shifting your comments up there and refactoring?<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 22:24, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<li>I thought my previous entry was invalidated so I had to revote. In any case, I intended this entry mostly as a nice summary of the other things that I've written, should I "refactor"? <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Incidentally, the previous VfD discussion can be found at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_RaD_Man_317a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/RaD Man">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/RaD Man</a>. Note that <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">User:Rossami</a> determined that consensus to delete had not been reached at 23:28, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC). --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoobergunch_e9e1.html" title="User:Goobergunch">Goobergunch</a> 21:20, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> One of the founders of <a href="../../../a/c/i/ACiD_Productions_2b60.html" title="ACiD Productions">ACiD Productions</a> ANSI artgroup, this in and of itself is notable despite his other achivements <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoachgod_b057.html" title="User:Roachgod">ZaQ</a> 10:21, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Far too early, IMO, to revive a VfD for this article. Previous consensus applies. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 11:30, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<li>Although I agree with the rest of your vote, do note that the article was kept before due to <i>lack</i> of consensus. The majority voted to delete, for some reason. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif"></a><tt><b>~</b><a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif">leif</a></tt> ☺ <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeif_77cb.html" title="User talk:Leif"><sub>HELO</sub></a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, unless of course the purpose of this is to save some disk space on the Wikipedia server. Then by all means, <b>delete.</b> Biographies of worldwide known computer historians are a dime a dozen, and get in the way of information about science fiction shows and listings of Hollywood actors, which the internet desperately needs. --<a href="../../../j/s/c/User%7EJscott_f61d.html" title="User:Jscott">Jscott</a> 08:52, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<li>Keep. Who relisted this? I think it may be appropriate to begin an RFC to at least warn this individual not to do something like this again. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 21:02, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Why is this being deleted? Are you people insane? RaD man is not only notable in his field, but also, along with Jason Scott, who seems to be much maligned in this forum as well, were guests of honor at a rather major annual con I put together here in Cleveland. It is only pure serendipity that I decided to do a random search to see if he was listed today. Come on folks. I had more faith in Wikipedia than this.<a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFroggy_cf09.html" title="User:Froggy">Froggy</a> 21:15, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC).

<li><b>Keep</b>. And don't clog up VfD with reposts.
