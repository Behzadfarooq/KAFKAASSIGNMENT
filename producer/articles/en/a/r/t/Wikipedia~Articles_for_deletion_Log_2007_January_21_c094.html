<p>There is something fishy about this article. It begins with the first claim to notability, the quarterfinals of the 2001 Toyota Tennis Challenge in Athens, Georgia. The only reference that comes close to this is <a href="http://www.redcross-cmd.org/Chapter/tennis.html" class="external text" title="http://www.redcross-cmd.org/Chapter/tennis.html" rel="nofollow">the website of the 2004 event</a>. This event is a small amateur charity event and doesn't even come remotely close to meeting the notability criteria. The article also claims that Sherwood "entered 2002 ranked in the top 100 internationally." I've searched through the <a href="http://stevegtennis.com/02atprank.htm" class="external text" title="http://stevegtennis.com/02atprank.htm" rel="nofollow">ATP rankings for that year</a>, but he doesn't feature in the world's top 1,500 for the entire year. The final event mentioned is the Montana Open. This is a minor college sport event, not a tournament where you'd expect an accomplished professional tennis player. This all reeks of a hoax, of vanity or of non-notability. Either way, <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">Bravado</a></sup> 00:57, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><sub>I don't think that this page belongs in Wikipedia for several reasons. First of all, on its own it lacks the context and additional information necessary to be useful. Here it's just a list from which the reader is left to just draw whatever conclusions they want without regard for what it actually means. Such a list would be far more useful if integrated into an existing article, such as <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a>. However, this list has one other major problem. It draws the IQ's from a number of different sources. Each source almost certainly varies widely with regards to what the sampling methods and IQ tests it uses were, which means that the results of each source can not be compared in this manner without inherent inaccuracy. A list like this does nothing but result in completely erroneous and misleading conclusions and is in fact utterly useless. Comparing the IQ's from different studies in this manner comes very close to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. A new list could be created in the context of the above mentioned article if all the IQs were drawn from one source, but this list as it stands is not at all independently notable, accurate, or verifiable. <a href="../../../d/y/c/User%7EDycedarg_1cf0.html" title="User:Dycedarg"><span style="border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000"><b>Dycedarg</b></span></a> <a href="../../../d/y/c/User_talk%7EDycedarg_ffee.html" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b>ж</b></a> 01:13, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</sub></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Joshdboz arguments, but Keep it, if not Wikipedia will only merge the title of the article and not what the table shows. The content are relevant to all the Race and intelligence series at Wikipedia. Buj and Zeidner is for example new information. It seems that Wikipedia do not like Buj. They have deleted things about him earlier. It seems like "IQ and the wealth of nation" and "Race and intelligence" shall be the only truth inside here. Seems like some like what these articles tells, but there can be other truths???? If "Race by ancestry" should be deleted; Also the other articles about race and intelligence should be deleted. Further...: The "IQ by ancestry" article tells that there is not only one indian race. It is true. In other articles indians seems to be one race. Why shall Indo-Aryans represent Indians in generally and Dravidian people? Many says that the article "IQ by ancestry" is racism. It is not more rasistic than other articles about the subject inside here.SuganthinifromJaffna</li>

I was tempted to say the data should be merged in some way, but as observed above, this is Original Research in that it draws from varying sources with the suggestion of a meaningful relationship between the data. There's nothing here that can reasonably be merged. Only if there was an external source in the form of an article that attempted to meaningfully sythesize this data, could the information be presented fairly. If such a published article or report existed, then it would be possible to take a Neutral-Point-Of-View while presenting reactions to and interpretations of the report.

<li><b>SOLUTION</b> Dycedarg and I have had participated with some other editors in a rigorous debate at <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a>. The outcome is that the list as written is not appropriate for inclusion there for several reasons, and has been removed. However, I will try to salvage the better material and try to develop a more balanced and well resourced chart. The value I see of inclusion at <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a> is to disagregate some of the overly condensed categories presented there, such as lumping all whites, blacks and hispanics into three overly narrow categories (are hispanics a race or speakers of a common language?). Also a chart (modified) allows multiple studies to to be evaluated side by side. Variances in IQ are not simply a result of genetics, but also include environmental factors such as nutrition and education (hard to distiniguish from inherent intellegence) among many others. Like it or not the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a> article has been through rigorous review including two recent AfD processes, and is not likely to go away. If you oppose the validity of the information, it is better to work with the process to improve the presentation of the article toward a NPOV. If you have some ideas on how the chart can be improved please contact me -- some suggestions have been discussed at <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a>. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 04:20, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak <s>Delete</s> Keep</b> at least this article, as it's pure crap not worth keeping, however, no determinant of his notability. Number of articles is not a determinant of the importance of the author, and 11 in the life sciences (what other area should he be publishing in? Einstein published almost exclusively in theoretical physics) could be astounding if they were all major articles, or if he were a young scientist, or if only 2 of them were among the top 10 cited articles in his field. It's not the number, but how well cited the articles are that matters. Even just one, if it's well-cited in the scientist's field, could lead to notability. And, you searched for his wrong in the google, it's not his Dundee Dental Hospital work that is being asserted as notable anyhow. If you search for Einstein's angiosperm research you're not going to find anything. And scientific articles about organisms are keyworded by the <i><a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_name.html" title="Scientific name">scientific name</a></i> of the organism, not the common name, even though in the case of yeasts, the common name may be used. So, only 11 of his articles are in his area is no reason to say he's not notable, scientific articles are keyworded by their organisms, and he's not noted for his recent move to Dendee Dental Hospital, but for the organism he researched and the discoveries he made about it. His article "Mutations which block the binding of calmodulin to Spc110p cause multiple mitotic defects" alone is cited by 20 others, plus, I didn't even look, these are articles on the mitotic spindle, an extraordinarily complex organelle, and one of the last great discoveries, how it works, in the life sciences. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 01:52, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Good point. But this is basically a POV delete, "I don't <i>believe</i> this person passes," "not heavily cited" but cited just fine in its complex area, limited publications outside of his area (huh?), and failure to search properly for the organism he studied (called by scientists by its scientific name, for gosh sake), rather than his current recent job placement (scientists known by what they study AND by their institutes, but only by the former is fine, too). It's basically a small piece of an incredibly important and complex major puzzle in the life sciences--remove his piece, maybe the puzzle falls apart, which makes his research, even if only for the one article, important enough to qualify him. Nice to know, though, its a copyright infringement since it is so crappy. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 02:58, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I haven't precisely assumed bad faith, but I do question your methods for deciding this needs deleted when you've used the words, "appears" and "don't believe," searched for the common name of the organism, rather than its scientific name (for a scientist), and searched for the scientist attached to a newly acquired institutional appointment, rather than for his research on the organism or the important area of his research <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitotic_spindle.html" title="Mitotic spindle">Mitotic spindle</a> and you got the number of works citing his work as wrong, in particular for the one major paper in a major peer-reviewed scientific journal in which he is the lead author.<a href="http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/109/6/1297" class="external autonumber" title="http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/109/6/1297" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></li>
<li><b>Questions</b> Okay, assuming good faith on my part, please just explain your reasoning to me so I understand why this article should be deleted? I would really like to understand what is going on with AfD, and I do think that the criteria for notability for scientists are much higher than for video game minor characters. How did you come up with only 8 citations by others, when Journal of Cell Science links to 20 for a major article? Did you decide his research area was not important, if so how? Why search for the organism by common name for a scientific subject? However, one my bad for me--you at least DID look for this stuff. I'm not wholey sold on the article because it's so crummy and it would be so damn much research for me to get up to speed to rewrite it myself, so that's my POV. But, help me to understand yours. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 03:20, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> and source properly. I couldn't agree with you more, KP, about the possible merit of the article and the proper way of looking for it, but the information as originally presented here didn't justify N and didn't necessarily look as if it would. The only thing that caught my eye was the "senior scientist", which usually implies faculty-equivalent.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, many articles about scientists and other academics are poorly written, and do not clearly present the necessary information for N, so we have to get it together here at AfD and add it. Worse, some people Speedy such articles when they are, as now, clearly worth at least a debate so sources can be found. The arguments presented here are all too common. I have been collecting examples from Speedy and Prod, and putting some of them in the talk page at Notability(academics) and at CSD. For the current collection, see User:DGG:sandbox4speedy1. Some of it is <i>much</i> worse than this.</dd>
<dd>When the proposer gives the search used and the results found, we have a basis for discussion. I congratulate Chovain on doing so. Let's encourage people to do so, and then explain how to do it better. In this case, for example, it might have been clearer to start with PubMed, which is free from many of the ambiguous GScholar counts. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:13, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

With all due respect, I'm afraid people who say that a 20-year old paper cited 50 times is indicative of notability in the field don't really know what they're talking about. I've already argued this many times before on similar AfDs but this is simply due to misunderstanding of how citation works in academic fields. For one thing, you will cite yourself throughout your career. It is likely that any co-author of the paper has continued to work in related areas and has often cited that paper in introducing his own new discoveries. Unless someone can find a credible reference identifying Mr. Stirling as an authority and as someone who has had a considerable impact in his field, we could reconsider. However, Google searches strongly indicate that no such references exist. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 21:45, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not sure if that's in reference to my recent edits, but keep in mind notability for schools can be acheived with multiple, independent, non-trivial coverage. The reference I put in there extremely non-trivial and independent (it doesn't get much better than that one).

<dd>It's more than just being polite. I really think it might qualify as notable, but didn't want to make that decision myself.

<p>Non-notable band. The Music Monitor Network plug isn't as impressive as it seems. They are a marketing company that only deal with small music chains of 2-30 stores.

The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/infotda/press.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/infotda/press.html" rel="nofollow">press page</a> of the official website only lists article from local media publications and a reference to a E! television show called "Nearly Famous".

<dd>Just read the WP:MUSIC that you cited. Many thanks! I still believe that The day after... has reached a certain level as to where they deserve a page. I do believe they meet most of the criteria on those guidelines, although I would need to do some research before editing. Please advise how long I have before the article will be deleted?

<dd>An AfD generally lasts five days. It gives the author(s) time to provide whatever is necessary to bring the article up to code, as it were. As I said, I think this band might be on the cusp of notability, but I don't believe they meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> right now. It doesn't help that all the media links on their official site are for years ago. With nothing recent it makes it seem that their day in the sun has passed.

<li><b>Keep this article</b> Jack Schaap is a leader in the Independant Baptist movement, and although a small movement, it is vocal nonetheless. This article comes up as #2 on google. That is notable NovumTestamentum 03:45, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The major claim to notability seems to be as chancellor of <a href="../../../h/y/l/Hyles-Anderson_College_8c2f.html" title="Hyles-Anderson College">Hyles-Anderson College</a>. We use campus papers of major universities to establish notability. <a href="../../../h/y/l/Hyles-Anderson_College_8c2f.html" title="Hyles-Anderson College">Hyles-Anderson College</a> cannot exactly be said to be major. But nonetheless, if it's conceded that it's notable enough to warrant an article (which isn't being contested), then it seems perhaps the campus newspaper could be used to establish notability of the chancellor. A bit of a stretch, but within notability. There doesn't seem to be evidence of notability other than Hyles-Anderson related media, however. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 04:11, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Nothing I can see in the article to make him stand out beyond any other pastor/vicar/priest/whatever. User:NovumTestamentum says that Schaap "is a leader in the Independant Baptist movement"; now if that was leader <i>of</i> rather <i>in</i> we might have something more important. User:Shirahadasha's comment that he is chancellor of a college needs to be balanced against the statement in the article that this is "an unaccredited bible college".

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I've included several new links that lend notability to the Jack Schaap article, including his and his churches inclusion in a couple of Christian magazines. Last year Schaap and his church enjoyed public visibility in a national church magazine as being among the top 50 churches in the nation. If Wikipedia is going to include film and television *characters* whose sole existence is based on a tv show or movie, then why not a Pastor who is becoming nationally known in mainstream Christian magazines? He's also fairly well-known among certain segments of Baptists, and is a source of controversy among Independent Baptists, and former Independent Baptists who now occupy pulpits in other denominations. Jack Schaap, like it or not, is poised to be a big player nationally speaking. He's already made it into at least two(2) nationally read Christian magazines. As to the comment of "User:Bpmullins says he "appears to be the pastor of an extremely large congregation" but there is no evidence for this. User:Emeraude|Emeraude 15:04, 21 January 2007 (UTC)": They must not have read the two links that I've provided stating that he is the pastor of a very large congregation at the end of the article. I will supply them into the top section as well if this needs to be there also. But Jack Schaap and First Baptist Church of Hammond average well over 20,000 persons in services at their church campus every Sunday. Their auditorium seats at last 7,500; they have around 10,000+ members if memory serves me correctly. As stated before, Schaap is the pastor of one of, if not THE, largest Independent Baptist church in America. As well as a large Independent Baptist Bible College. His church also has two high schools, two elementary schools, etc. Exactly how much "notability" must an individual like this have in order to be considered notable enough for Wikipedia? Most of the characters from Buffy the Vampire Slayer are included in Wikipedia, and their only claim to fame is that of a television show that is no longer making episodes. If television characters can be included, I see no reason to trash this article. I've asserted at least three separate articles from separate magazines and newspapers outside of the college and church which assert some notability to Jack Schaap.IFBScholar 20:14, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Article apparently started as a joke ("Jennifer plays the clarinet") and was later changed and expanded by another user... a bit confused as to how legit this really could be. My theory is that the original user could've been writing an article about themselves, someone else Googled the name and found another person by the very same name, and decided to change the article to fit the bill.

<li>It isn't, however. "short" is not synonymous with "dictionary" and the antonym of "short" is not "encyclopaedia". Dictionary articles can often be long.

On that basis, this article should stay (or thousands of others need to be added to this nomination!!!!) <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 15:11, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is simply untrue. Look at the articles about other ships - say, the US Navy. I spent quite a while perusing what makes a "good" ship article, and even the most elementary have details about the class, deployments, information, and history. All of these are encyclopedic content. Furthermore, per <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a> your argument doesn't hold water - if there are thousands of other articles as totally bereft of content as this one is, I suggest they be <b>deleted</b> too. The fact that there are poor articles out there does not mean we should tolerate more. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 20:12, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No matter if it is traceable ship or not, it is so well known or not, it still forms the part of Indian navy with pride. therefore I think there should not be any problem with any one to give a little space here to a big ship. After all you never know when a ship is in light for some reason or other. Babarab 17:13, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless sourced and expanded, <b>Keep</b> if this is done by this AfD. Virtually every ship in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a> has its own article. Is there a valid reason to treat the Indian Navy differently? If people think the current approach to articles on navy ships is wrong, a wholesale policy review involving deletion of a large number of articles might rectify the issue, but individual inconsistent AfDs don't appear to be the right approach. That said, article supplies no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> and says nothing of substance about this ship, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and some basis for an article needs to be complied with at a minimum. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 18:01, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Again, this this simply not true. Look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Navy_ships%2C_A_5380.html" title="List of United States Navy ships, A">List of United States Navy ships, A</a>. By no means does every single ship have a page. Not even all ships current commissioned have pages, despite the US Navy being one of the most active and important Navies in the world. Furthermore, the ones that <i>do</i> have pages are not one-line stubs with no content - some of them are a little terse, but they include <b>content</b>. This article does not. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 20:12, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I've looked, and cannot find any sources from which to expand this stub into a full article — no books, no news or magazine features, not even any web sites run by enthusiasts. This ship simply isn't documented in depth anywhere. It should not, therefore, have an entire article by itself. A single-fact article is the wrong way to include this single fact in Wikipedia. The right way is to include it in a list or a table, along with other such facts, and we find that it has already been included in this way in <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ships_of_the_Indian_Navy_c685.html" title="Ships of the Indian Navy">Ships of the Indian Navy</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:59, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Notability requirements are the same for comics as for most things: we need multiple, non-trivial sources that make more than a passing mention to the topic in question. The source you cited (publishersweekly.com) may be a good one but it's a long standing precedent in AfD's that being on Amazon.com does not establish notability (since you can find virtually anything on Amazon.com).

<li><b>Delete</b> I can copy the 50 anime articles send 'em to a vanity book publisher and get it on amazon.com as an anime guide book. Being listed on Amazon is not an indication of notability. One of my pet-peeves with anime and manga articles on Wikipedia is that there is virtually no enforcement of notability guideline for titles. As long as it's not published by a doujin group, it seems, a minor one volume manga can make it as an article. It's certainly not the first time manga has been used to present a religious belief. The Aum Cult, famous for the Sarin gas attack in Tokyo used manga to further their views. And it's certainly not the first christian manga (per this <a href="http://www.animenation.net/news/askjohn.php?id=1376" class="external text" title="http://www.animenation.net/news/askjohn.php?id=1376" rel="nofollow">source</a>.)

<li>I don't care where this page ends up, the point is "Serenity" is not <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>, and therefore shouldn't be called manga. Manga, in the western slang sense, means comics from Japan. To call "Serenity" a manga is misleading. Just as comics from Japan are called <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>, comics from China are called <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhua.html" title="Manhua">manhua</a>, comics from Korea are called <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhwa.html" title="Manhwa">manhwa</a>, comics from America (or Canada, or the UK, or Australia etc...) are called <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comics.html" title="Comics">comics</a>, no matter what style they are in.

<ul>
<li>"While accessing the whistle register, Chanté Moore's voice cracked on the phrase "Here We Go", when she covered the Minnie Riperton classic." - this smacks of 2 things, <b>libelous slander</b> about one singer, and <b>obsessive fandom</b> of another. It's also <b>original research</b>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>"vocal cords catch up to their developing larynges, as the vocal adductor muscles struggle to regain their strength at this new speaking voice pitch" is complete hogwash &amp; original research you won't find anywhere else.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"For example, a singer may sing a particular note in the head register softly, but upon trying to increase the volume and pull the note into the chest register" 'pulling' a note into chest from head is actually technically impossible in 99% of the vocal range.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The article has no sources. The article will never have any sources - nobody edits it. It is largely abandoned. It also duplicates another article - <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passaggio.html" title="Passaggio">passaggio</a> which effort should be focused on. I'd nom it for speedy but i've never done that before.

<p>A non-notable band not under a record label. None of the members have articles linking to them, rather to other notable people such as a mayor and the founder of Burton snowboards who just happen to have the same names.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> They certainly seem notable- they have performed with a number of undeniably notable bands. The BBC has a page on them <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/kids_in_glass_houses/" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/kids_in_glass_houses/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and there is a page on them <a href="http://www.drownedinsound.com/bands/9505" class="external text" title="http://www.drownedinsound.com/bands/9505" rel="nofollow">here.</a> The BBC having a page suggests notability to me. Also, their lyrics are posted all over the nasty lyrics websites that populate the malware side of the web. They have released an EP, as shown <a href="http://www.clickmusic.com/articles/2731.html" class="external text" title="http://www.clickmusic.com/articles/2731.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Oh, they performed to over 15000 people according to <a href="http://www.betweenplanets.co.uk/index.php?tag=inflight" class="external text" title="http://www.betweenplanets.co.uk/index.php?tag=inflight" rel="nofollow">this</a> source.

<dd><b>Comment</b> "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works...." <i>King Kong</i> obviously meets that guideline, but would Jimmy?

<li><s><b>Delete</b> The article says he is a football player, but doesn't say what team or league. It says he was a politician, but it does not say any office he held. (unless <i>the riding of Halifax Citadel</i> is an office... forgive me I am American, and not familiar with that wording). It talks about his wife, kids, and brother as much as it talks about him, but none of them are asserted as notable in the article. It talks about his law practice, business, activism, etc, as uncited and without any assertion of notability for any of these things, and without any context for the reader... just a quick factiod on each. we know from this article much more about his wife than we do of him. I do not think that the average person armed <b>only</b> with the information provided by this article would conclude he is notable. Perhaps he <b>is</b> notable, and this article just doesn't mention that. If not delete, major rework recommended.</s> <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 05:56, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Any politician elected to a federal, provincial or state legislature is notable. Any politician who was the <i>leader</i> of his political party in the federal, provincial or state legislature is even <i>less</i> remotely open to debate. <b>Speedy keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:59, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> He is a notable person being a former MLA. As for the person above, he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia for the riding of Halifax Citadel. A riding is the equivalent of an American legislative district, a UK Parliamentary constituency or an Australian legislative Division. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_the_Aspie_548e.html" title="User:David the Aspie">David McNamara</a> 06:27, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> • A former MLA is among the more notable people we could have documented, in the politics category. Also, very weak reason given for the deletion.

<p>OK, well I don't exactly enjoy saying this, but I can see I was wrong on this one. I was unfamiliar with the local terminology, so I did not recognize the notable posts that the rest of the editors above are pointing out. I appreciate you all taking the time to weigh-in on this debate. I request this nomination be closed with result of <b>keep - withdrawn by nominator</b>.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> This article is presently being revised per Wikipedia guidelines. Jujube, you are acting quite unprofessional and your comment is not a valid reason to have this article deleted, hmmm.. "in vain" perhaps? Also, if an article is being considered for deletion, it would be appropriate to include "specific reasons" why it should be deleted and not merely "per nom". As for being labeled "spam and advertising", I can find dozens of other pages written by the author with dozens of self promotion external links. --VWeston 23:28, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Hey JuJube! Yes, as a producer and director of a historical documentary with esteemed reviews from American Journal of History, which also includes indepth interviews from feminist icon Gloria Steinem. You are failing to see that the documentary is about VICTORIA WOODHULL not me. <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Woodhull_5685.html" title="Victoria Woodhull">Victoria Woodhull</a> And as other authors have posted their books, it's equally important to include the only documentary which has been broadcast in the US and Canada and currently distributed to universities should be included.

<li><b>Delete</b> (for now).

<p>A minor radio show which aired for barely three months on a radio station that itself is only <i>just</i> above the notabity waterline; I've flagged this for {{<a href="../../../i/m/p/Template%7EImportance_b9e2.html" title="Template:Importance">importance</a>}} several times now, but anon IPs have repeatedly removed the tag without adding anything to the article to clarify why it should be considered notable enough for Wikipedia. Accordingly, it's now coming to AFD. <b>No vote</b> from me; I leave it to AFD consensus to decide, and would recommend that people keep it watchlisted in case our anon friend starts removing the AFD tag too. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:52, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's nowhere near the waterline; it's deep, deep down because it airs on an Internet radio station (see the <a href="../../../c/h/e/CHEV_%28AM%29_0dd2.html" title="CHEV (AM)">CHEV (AM)</a> article). Immediately this puts it on par with the many non-notable <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoutcast.html" title="Shoutcast">Shoutcast</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live365.html" title="Live365">Live365</a> shows that have few listeners.

<li>I meant the <i>station</i> was only just above the waterline, not the show. Although only on Internet radio <i>now</i>, CHEV <i>was</i> at one time a licensed broadcast operation, and in fact it technically still is if it ever gets around to picking a new AM frequency. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 06:26, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Understandable, but since the show didn't air within CHEV's AM era and for only two months on their Internet station, I feel the same standards that apply to personal internet radio shows apply to this, no matter how well known the station might be. <a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMrschimpf_855c.html" title="User:Mrschimpf">Nate</a> 07:25, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Let me put it this way, so far it's only notable because Apple is taking legal action.

<li>Yes, that is what we are saying, that the <i>legal action</i> is notable. We should cover the topic of the legal action, with some note on the software itself for context, but not a whole article. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 20:59, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Considering it was 12 hours between announcement/release and Apple legal action, it's pretty much impossible to know if the software would have been notable solely in its own right or would have been ignored until Apple tagged it (and no respectable source is going to mention one without the other at this point obviously). That still does not remove the fact that the software is the focus of a number of the articles (titles similar to <i>How to have an iPhone early</i>, etc). I don't want to fill the AfD with back-n-forth, but I just want to make sure it's clear that the criteria are met for the software per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. I agree the legal action is notable and should be introduced to the appropriate article(s)...which would also help de-orphan the article under discussion, too. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 21:08, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When I said "slightly notable," I should have used better language. I should have said that it's notability is tenuous. It barely reaches the level of notability in my opinion, and *only* because of the cease-and-desist from Apple. I also suspect that it's notability will quickly fade in the next few months. That's what I meant (in my mind, at least) when I described it as "slightly notable." I'll make an effort to be more clear in the future. <a href="../../../b/j/_/User%7EBJ_Nemeth_b3f9.html" title="User:BJ Nemeth">BJ Nemeth</a> 15:38, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Let me address the concerns one by one:
<ul>
<li>«&#160;These are simply placeholder articles with no actual information.&#160;» Wrong: the fact that these asteroids have as yet no permanent names *is* information (to quote Einstein, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence).</li>
<li>«&#160;Asteroids 100000 to 140000 could probably stand to all be merged into one article.&#160;» Perhaps, but eventually they will become large enough (see the first few of the list, such as <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meanings_of_asteroid_names_%281-1000%29.html" title="Meanings of asteroid names (1-1000)">Meanings of asteroid names (1-1000)</a>) that they'll need to be split again. Managing such a large list with a varying chunk size would be a major pain.</li>
<li>«&#160;All of this information (for asteroids that actually exist) can be found in the articles on those asteroids.&#160;» It is extremely unlikely (and certainly unnecessary) that *each* asteroid will ever get an article. The overwhelming majority of minor planets are just uninteresting chunks of rock, which don't deserve more than an entry in one or more master lists such as this one. Suggesting that individual articles be created systematically would lead to much more clutter than keeping the current arrangement of lists.</li>
<li>«&#160;A link to the relevant external database would be the correct way to handle this kind of information.&#160;» Bull. The {{<a href="../../../m/p/c/Template%7EMPCit_JPL_4f35.html" title="Template:MPCit JPL">MPCit_JPL</a>}} database is as yet incomplete, with no guarantee of ever including the "citations" preceding the time (roughly, mid-1940s) when the MPC citation procedure was put into place. Furthermore, there is no way to see the meanings together (MPCit_JPL lists only one asteroid at a time). And you never know when it will break (see {{<a href="../../../m/p/c/Template%7EMPCit_MPES_e1e3.html" title="Template:MPCit MPES">MPCit_MPES</a>}} for a current example). The Wiki entries in this list are also usually more complete than the raw citations (links to Wiki content, miscellaneous precisions added, and so forth), not to mention that they've been reworked in order to avoid any copyright issues.</li>
<li>«&#160;Delete the ones that say 'There are as yet no named asteroids in this span of numbers'. They'll be redlinks in <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meanings_of_asteroid_names.html" title="Meanings of asteroid names">Meanings of asteroid names</a>, which won't do any harm.&#160;» Neither would keeping these short articles, so why delete 'em, just to be forced to re-create them when the next batch of namings comes out of the Minor Planet Center? Leaving red links does do harm, because it leaves the reader with a doubt: are these articles missing because there are no names to explain, or because they haven't been written yet?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To summarise, I understand the temptation to collapse the shorter articles into broader-spanned ones, but I must insist on the logistic nightmare this would represent. I suspect none of the 'deleters' that have piped up above have contributed one iota to the enormous amount of on-going work these pages represent. <a href="../../../u/r/h/User%7EUrhixidur_9dbb.html" title="User:Urhixidur">Urhixidur</a> 18:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> The first articles in this series only represent 500 asteroids, it is only after #5000 that they are in groups of a thousand. What I am merely suggesting is that at a certain point, the articles start being group by, say, five or ten thousands. As it stands, even someone interested in the subject will find themselves very frustrated to think they're getting information when they're not. A redlink simply says "sorry, put we don't have any information on this yet", but a bluelink implies that there's information to be had. Empty bluelinks mislead and waste time.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 22:40, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - wikipedia is not paper. If they are meaningful articles to somebody who knows something about the topic, I assume they are verifiable and will be expanded.

<li><b>Keep</b> Urhixidur summed up my view on this matter quite well. The only possible variation I would add to this is the possiblity of adjusting the group sizes and although logistically a pain, readjusting them as more names are accepted and assigned. Note that there is a limit to the number of names per astronomer or group can submit, 2 per month. With some groups discovering 100's of SSSBs in a month, in many cases it is quite possible, many will never recieve names. The lack of name or more importantly when a SSSB recieves its name in comparison to when it was discovered, or if it is ever given a name, will help show the degree of importance that either the group or individual astronomy placed on it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../a/b/y/User%7EAbyssoft_07bf.html" title="User:Abyssoft">Abyssoft</a> 05:54, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><small><b>Delete</b>. Lists like this <i>would</i> be useful and encyclopedic if they had something in them. But for all the articles currently listed the main content as "There are as yet no named asteroids in this span of numbers." In other words, there is nothing here to describe the meaning of. No prejudice whatsoever against recreation once we get at least one named asteroid in the span of numbers so that there is something to put here. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:25, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Urhixidur and DGG.

I also trust <a href="../../../u/r/h/User%7EUrhixidur_9dbb.html" title="User:Urhixidur">Urhixidur</a>'s judgement in this topic area, as he has furnished consistently high quality edits on astronomical and solar system matters, and this framework would probably make <i>his</i> life easier. <a href="../../../g/o/s/User%7EGosgood_e3c8.html" title="User:Gosgood">Gosgood</a> 04:28, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>A proposal</b> - Some good points were raised in this discussion, albeit in cavalier fashion by the "deletist camp". I'm thinking now that we should rework the entire <i>Meanings of asteroid names</i> series in a way similar to what has been done with the <i>List of asteroids</i> itself: parcel the meanings out into blocks of 100 entries in sub-pages, which would in turn be displayed within "holder pages". The difference from the <i>List of asteroids</i> pages lies in their varying size. As has been noted, the early pages are pretty much topped off, whereas the pages at the bottom of the list are very thin indeed. Because of the required flexibility (which must not complicate the logistics, I insist), this will require some preparatory thinking on my part. What I'd like to know, before I expend my grey matter in this way, is whether this seems like the right way to go? <a href="../../../u/r/h/User%7EUrhixidur_9dbb.html" title="User:Urhixidur">Urhixidur</a> 03:43, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What about just merging the information from the <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meanings_of_asteroid_names.html" title="Meanings of asteroid names">Meanings of asteroid names</a> lists into the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_asteroids.html" title="List of asteroids">List of asteroids</a> lists? It seems the original lists of asteroid have room to spare.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 07:26, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Here's why I think such a merge would not work. I've tried to keep the "List of asteroids" as language-neutral as possible: about the only language-sensitive column is the "Location" one, and I've tried to use the local name as far as possible (since they're redirected to the English entries anyway). Such language-neutrality is, obviously, impossible with the "Meanings" explanations. The unstated goal was to make the "List of asteroids" a sort of Wikisource set, or at least something which could be, very nearly, cut and pasted into other-language Wikipedias. Once you understand this perspective, the organisation of the lists (and the heavy use of templates) should make a lot more sense. <a href="../../../u/r/h/User%7EUrhixidur_9dbb.html" title="User:Urhixidur">Urhixidur</a> 22:35, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Contested speedy. <a href="../../../x/-/m/X-Moto_c135.html" title="X-Moto">X-Moto</a> has an article, but that doesn't mean that either that (1) its developer rates an article or (2) that the person really <i>is</i> the main or only developer. The links don't help, being in Swedish. Google <i>does</i> come up with 74 hits for the string "Rasmus Teislev Neckelmann", all related to X-Moto in various languages. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 08:30, 21 January 2007 (UTC)<br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> as nominator. If I miss my guess and X-Moto (whatever that is) is some hugely important thing on the level of World of Warcraft or whatever, then maybe we need to know the parentage and early schooling etc. of its developer; otherwise, not. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 08:30, 21 January 2007 (UTC)<br /></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as user. While I agree that X-moto is not the big box-office success like World of Warcraft, I would like to place the following argument:<br />
1) X-moto has grown to become a very popular game <b>worldwide</b> with forums, download pages and a lot of <i>talk</i> on the internet and in communities. The game functions under most platforms (which WarCraft doesn't) and is by that a truly universal game. Exactly in the wiki spirit.<br />
2) I do not believe that the writer or developer of any intellectual work is unimportant. Considering the implications and in complete accordance with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Stallman_a8be.html" title="Richard Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> and his GNU policy that this site also adheres to; it is therefore natural to have an article about the creator of this game. As for whether or not he is the main developer it would be natural to use the Rasmus Teislev Neckelmann article to discuss that. <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sourceforge.html" title="Sourceforge">Sourceforge</a> seems to be of that opinion: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmoto" class="external text" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmoto" rel="nofollow">X-Moto project</a>.<br />
<b>Summa Summarum</b><br />
If we agree that the X-moto Game has it's place on this website (which we seem to have agreed on), and we also agree that wikipedia is an infinite work with the aim of linking knowledge and filling in the puzzle (like the logo seems to imply); I am confident that we can all agree that ideeed this article about the creator Rasmus Teislev Neckelmann <i>is</i> very much in its place.<br />
P.S: Please note that Swedish and Danish are not the same languages. Easy way for non-Scandinavians to tell the difference is looking for the letter combinations <i>ch</i> and words ending with double consonants, hinting that it is Swedish. Best example being <i>och</i> in Swedish and <i>og</i> in Danish (<i>and</i> in English).

<li><b>Delete</b> Jens, if I am not mistaken, you are his brother. I respect your high opinion about him as a brother, but in a world-perspective, I don't see how a person who is part of the development team of a game that they admit is a clone of another game, should be called notable. I have similar doubts about the notability of the game itself. <a href="../../../j/w/p/User%7EJwpurple_6851.html" title="User:Jwpurple">Wake</a> 03:42, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> You are not mistaken on that Wake. However I hope that that doesn't mean that we will disregard my argument. Obviously I am not the only that thinks that the game is interesting - amongst other because it can go on my UBUNTU Linux computer. As for the thing with the cloning... hmm think I heard that somewhere else.. ahh yes but let Macintosh and Microsoft fight about that&#160;:o). Point taken let's keep nepotism stamped out and see if anyone else will comment on this.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia includes many blogs (it is a Category). How it has been decided that one blog is notable enough and another is not? Please explain. This blog claims to be "the most trafficked, content-rich English-language Russia politics blog in the world". If this is true, this blog is notable, is not it? May be this is not true, and some research on the subject is needed. So, then let us do such research and discuss the matter. I guess Alex may have the following point: "Articles which merely include an external link and a brief description of its contents will also be either cleaned up to adhere to the neutral point of view or deleted." But I just created this stub yesterday, and can not modify anything right now because it was marked for deletion. If you give me a chance, I could try to develop the page and see if it is notable. I do not think it is right policy to delete stubs created a few hours ago, just because the author could not complete the editing. <b>I think that such fast reaction by several editors is actually a proof that this site is notable.</b> I do agree that the content of this blog may be controversial. And I <b>do not</b> support or share Russophobia, so whatever you decide is fine. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 16:19, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Not at all: you can still modify it even though it is marked for deletion! If you think you can make a case, please do so. But I should say that "the most trafficked, content-rich English-language Russia politics blog in the world" means nothing, because the statement is from the blog itself. To mean something it would have to be given by some independent publication. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu-Fool_Danyal_ibn_Amir_al-Makhiri_38e8.html" title="User:Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri">Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri</a> 17:26, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Putting aside the question of football club notablity for a second, lets look at <i>this</i> article. The info box states that they play on the "Grand Old Smith Field", yet the article states they will begin play at the "'Turf City Complex' in Wayne, NJ". "Grand Old Smith Field" gives no google hits, and I found only one 1 hit for a Turf City Complex in Singapore. I found the name of one of the other teams (Corgodayo FC) here <a href="http://www.bracketmaker.com/tmenu.cfm?tid=45276&amp;tclass=NNJSC" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bracketmaker.com/tmenu.cfm?tid=45276&amp;tclass=NNJSC" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> but the other teams seemed to be high schools (like <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bergen_Catholic_High_School_848b.html" title="Bergen Catholic High School">Bergen Catholic High School</a>). This would preclude the "semi-professional" status of the team, since it is unlikely that a high school level team would pay its players. There are other inaccuracies as well, but I think by this point it is clear that this is absolutely unverifiable thereby rendering any notablity debate moot. <b>Strong Delete</b> - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 05:58, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>first of all, grand old smith field is in Saddle Brook, NJ. It is our practice field, because Turf City Complex is an indoor complex in Wayne NJ, there are no home and away games. and i dont know what your talking about, go to Google, type in "Turf City" and its the first link Flaninthefacerh 19:30, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> looking at <a href="http://turfcity.us/index.html" class="external text" title="http://turfcity.us/index.html" rel="nofollow">the Turf City website</a> it is an indoor multi-use public sports centre where, by the look of things, small-sided football matches take place. This would suggest that the team is not in fact "semi professional" but rather an amateur hobby team playing in a local league, and there's no certainly no comparison with <a href="../../../f/c/_/FC_United_of_Manchester_4bdb.html" title="FC United of Manchester">FC United of Manchester</a>, who average somewhere in the region of 3,000 paying spectators to home matches.

<dd>If you were able to direct editors to coverage of your club which fits the above description (has there been any coverage of the team in local newspapers which you could cite, for example?), that would go a long way towards being able to satisfy the notability guidelines. As it is, though, all we know from the article is that Circa Ottimo is a new football team in an un-named league which has yet to actually play a match. There isn't anything currently in the article to indicate that anyone outside the squad itself has ever even heard of the team, and for that reason it fails the notability test as it stands.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Since the guideline is only proposed, I guess it's impossible for you or anyone else to say that a movie is non-notable, isn't it? On what are you basing your assumption that the film is not notable enough? And regarding the "density of cinemas", I can't see how that relates to the proposed guideline, which simply states: <i>The film has been theatrically released nationwide in a country, <b>or</b> into 200 or more commercial theaters</i>. Qerq will be released in all Maltese cinemas, ie. <i>nationwide</i>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus1234_8c08.html" title="User:Marcus1234">Marcus1234</a> 14:26, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> In that case, we fall back on plain old <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, which is a generally accepted guideline and says that a topic should have multiple instances of non-trivial coverage in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> in order to be considered notable. In simple terms, find two different newspaper articles about the movie, add them to the article, and I'd vote keep.

<p>As was mentioned on that talk page of the article, Pendant Productions shows have been broadcast on the BBC and U.S. radio stations. Since those radio stations are notable enough to have their own wiki articles, then Pendant should be notable enough for inclusion on Wikipedia. Pendant is not something isolated to a small corner of the Internet. It has thousands of listeners on the web and more on the radio. Something that is broadcast internationally must be notable.</p>

<p>Give this article one night as it is rounded out by multiple users, and you will see it's not spam. Pendant is not for profit, and its not my website. Its just a very popular source online of audio seriels, with thousands of listeners and subscribers on iTunes.</p>

<dd>This is advertising. Something doesn't have to be for-profit to be spam. Obviously, this is non-profit because they are using intellectual property belonging to others.

<dd>There is more than a little difference between this and NBC. NBC is notable and meets all the criteria for inclusion.

<dd>I'm just curious as to how encyclopaedic pages that link to NBC.com, ABC.com, CBS.com, etc. are any less 'spammy.' All of the websites in place for major TV studios, movie production companies, universities, etc are electronic advertising for entertainment/educational systems that started (and for the most part, remain) independent of the web. Whenever someone clicks on NBC.com, s/he becomes a unique visitor to a site OVERTLY designed for advertising purposes. Pendant Productions may not be a message board like FLAVA was or Voice Acting Alliance is, but they were one of the first collaborative studios to successfully form a 'virtual actors' studio' that mass-produced serialized fictional shows in mp3 format. Profit or non-profit status is ultimately irrelevant because Pendant has set a standard for quality that passes muster with internationally recognized studios. Just because Clurman, Crawford and Strasberg don't appear in the credits doesn't mean that Pendant hasn't been a large influence on narrative podcasting. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolklore_Fanatic_dbe4.html" title="User:Folklore Fanatic">Folklore Fanatic</a> 03:35, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, 'notable' is only in your POV. Did you even BOTHER to check my IP address before calling me a sock puppet? No, of course not. That would be too difficult. If you can't tell the stylistic differences of I spent two hours editing the entry on "Guinevere" last night, then I surfed over to some voice acting pages and did a search for a site I frequent, since I thought it would be included on here like many other art forms and workshops are. This is not my first time at Wikipedia, just the first time I bothered to register. I wanted people to recognize when I spoke. You have not made a compelling argument as to what is or is not notable, and I for one learned a lot about the istory of online voice acting from Wikipedia's in-depth coverage of FLAVA and VAA. This place is supposed to be a repository of information. It's really not the place of spam moderators to decide what does or does not have enough artistic merit to be 'notable.' <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolklore_Fanatic_dbe4.html" title="User:Folklore Fanatic">Folklore Fanatic</a> 16:08, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Define 'recognized media.' If a tv show never makes its way into Time Magazine or the NYT, then it technically doesn't exist? I personally do not recognize the Fox News Channel as 'verifiable' media, but a lot of people disagree with me. Still others no longer subscribe to any form of print media at all because they read all of their news online (having worked at a large media news magazine, I can say this with a certain degree of authoritative knowledge), and now Google mixes in articles from blogs into its news search results in a non-filterable way. Again, how do you define recognized when some people watch You Tube channels more than Dateline NBC? In the podcasting world, Pendant is a longstanding site with dependable broadcasts. Its directors make guest appearances on other radio shows. Its shows are aired on live radio stations. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolklore_Fanatic_dbe4.html" title="User:Folklore Fanatic">Folklore Fanatic</a> 03:49, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Pendant was miss-said as a company. They are a not-for-profit fanbased club community, with a few of their own features as well, that are meant to entertain those who listen. This would not be considered spam if the original writer of the wiki had used the words "fan-based community." All he wanted was to make information about the content easy to find, not advertise.

<p>So how many different references do you need to see that this a valid enty, Mr. Irishguy? Also, you have already allowed another wiki entry, so it is only fitting that you would allow this one.</p>
<p>Pendant not only produces the fan shows, but is producing three original shows: <i>The Kingery</i>, <i>Seminar</i> and <i>This Week In Pendant!</i> while remaining non-profit. In many respects this is very much an active workshop. A Wiki entry strikes me less as a promotional item that an FAQ and summary of what the group does. It's no more spam than an entry for me as a writer (Steven E. McDonald) would be, or an entry for me in my composer guise (David Alexander McDonald.)Wyldemusick 04:30, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What they produce is irrelevant.

<dd>IrishGuy, Forgive the formatting and other errors I might make in procedure, I ask your indulgence since i haven't posted on Wikipedia since the last attempt to gag Trek fan productions. You are talking to many new users here so could you please do them the courtesy of defining your terminology. I am speaking specifically about your insistence that this or that meets "criteria". It is (or was when *I* used to post) common courtesy to link to Wikipedia definitions and protocols, could I ask your indulgence in doing so now?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As regards your idea that it is advertising, I find it novel but ultimately untenable. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising" rel="nofollow">Advertising</a> is "paid communication through a non-personal medium in which the sponsor is identified and the message is controlled." A Wikipedia article is neither paid, non-personal nor controlled. the only reference close to relevance here is "Other non-profit organizations are not typical advertising clients, and rely upon free channels, such as public service announcements." so at best you can say is that this organisation is an atypical advertiser. Please explain your premise more clearly so that we may be illuminated.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Might I cut to the chase and tell you what this is going to hinge on? Notability. It always does. Wikipedians will insist that is up to the users who want to create the new article to show that the subject is notable (a concept that, the last I heard, was still contested as a hard-and-fast guideline - update here, please?). Criteria for notability will be IMDB listing, Google hits and significant mention in mainstream media. I'm not familiar with the alexa ranking mentioned above but from a statistical viewpoint you really should say not popular compared to *what*. Compared to NBC? Compared to Alfred E. Neuman? Please be specific so that we may understand your viewpoint. It would be nice to think that the argument about speedy deletion will not be decided on inaccurate or inappropriate data. Knowing, as i do that you wish this discussion to be fair and balanced also, I am sure you will help us in this.</dd>

<dd>As a reporter on fan productions of some modest standing I can tell you that Pendant Productions and Darker Projects (in part due to their common ancestry) represent seminal groups in the field of fan audio productions and are now leaders in the growing movement of fan production groups that are heading towards Indie production. These groups are even further along the line towards independant production than Star Trek: New Voyages and Star Trek: of Gods and Men - fan productions that have had scads of mainstream media publicity. The difference is simply one of scale and media, the precedent that they might set with their success could easily be seen as an example for video, TV and Movie production.</dd>

<p>IMDB does not list ANY podcast shows that I know of; it's a film/TV-based web site. Now, what is the IMDB of radioplays/podcasting? Dramapod? iTunes? Can there even be only one website that dictates what is and is not 'notable' about any particular art form? That notion seems completely misguided at best and aristocratic and erroneous at worst. The neutral historical representation of pioneers in a specific artistic field appears to be exactly the sort of information that searchers on a modern encyclopedia intend to find. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolklore_Fanatic_dbe4.html" title="User:Folklore Fanatic">Folklore Fanatic</a> 16:24, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is true, sir, I used IMDB as an example from my previous experience with fan films. In this case you have a valid point: what yardstick of excellence can be applied to an audio drama? I had a brief look at the alexa ratings site and sadly Pendant productions does rate poorly against the likes of Google, MSN and Yahoo. Perhaps the mighty Wikipedia site itself might rate a mention against such greats but the average organisations website cited on Wikipedia? I doubt it! Again I ask, pendant rates poorly against what?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As regards the concept of notability as a criteria for inclusion, believe me I've had it out on this subject before. Such is the paradox of Wikipedia (I have to leave for work in 5 minutes so i can't link all this) Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia and can have a virtually limitless numbers of articles yet Wikipedians insist that it should not be clogged up with inconsequential material. It's just one of those mysteries of life that only the very wise (and Wikipedian) can answer.&gt;(-_-)&lt;</dd>

<dd>Kirok, I'm not responding to your comments so much as backing them up.

<dd>The whole idea of notability is fraught with problems. Notability is not an absolute measure - there is no brass rod of notability in Paris that we can measure things against. Notability is a relative term, it is an abstract and like all abstracts (truth, beauty ...) it means different things to different people. To a fan of one of the genres that Pendant et al produce works for (for the same goes for many fan productions), they are significant. Significant to the stage of having fans of fans! To an afiscionado of professional audio dramas they represent a modern phenomena, similar in it's way to all endeavours where "everyman" contributes towards his own entertainment or edification. Dare I point out that Wikipedia is a prime example of the same movement in the field of information technology? Well, yes, I dare. To someone outside these circles they (Pendant) represent a fascet of the said movement, but only to a smaller extent. So small an extent in fact that they would only be found if they were looking for them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Isn't that the purpose of Wikipedia though? To provide information, knowledge, for those who come looking for it. The next time someone comes looking for information on audio dramas are you going to say, "Yeah I remember we had some people who wanted to submit an article about that subject but we decided it wasn't notable so we deleted it." In that case gentlemen, you will have failed Everyman by picking and choosing for him in advance what you decide is notable enough for him. You can, of course tell him to go to a specialist Wiki but that simply marginalises Wikipedia - setting boundaries on something that should have none.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can wax philosphical about it until the cows come home but it is all wasted if some young Everyman, disguised as a would-be Wikipedian, simply repeats doctrine as if it is some protective mantra to keep the problematical articles at bay, the ones that require judgement, that require what used to be called wisdom. I say again, if you expect new users to respect Wikipedia's protocols then the process cannot be slipshod. Define terms, link to Wiki policies, admit when doctrine is not Canonical, merely apochryphal and above all show flexibility where the guidelines allow it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In this case the new users have given evidence that Pendant productions is notable within the fan and Audio drama community the question to ask is - is that notability significant to mainstream society? Considering the frequency with which fan productions and new media arises as a subject in media such as Wired, SlashDot and even the New York Times, i would suggest that fan and indie productions are a movement of vital importance that will be viewed in the future in the same way that we now look back on the rise of fanzines and fan fiction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article just needs some work, that's all - why not ask an admin with experience in Wikifying articles to give advise to these new users? If that fails I would say that a general article on Fan Audio dramas covering pendant et al would be a must. I'd be tempted to contribute meself.</dd>

<p>-- You apparently didn't search hard enough.... they're featured in a wikipedia article about Star Trek Fan productions as well as an article on the BBC Radio website, amongst other popular sites on the internet. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/saturdaylive/2006/11/james_bond_to_the_end.html" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/saturdaylive/2006/11/james_bond_to_the_end.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/saturdaylive/2006/11/james_bond_to_the_end.html</a> -- perhaps wikipedia should put a new standard in place... People who are incapable of utilizing the internet for their research, or have no experience in a given topic, should not have their opinions counted... or even represent the company as a 'moderator'... Makes sense.</p>
<p>There's no evidence that everyone here is a member of Pendant, either. There's no evidence that you aren't from some anti-podcasting movement somewhere in space and time, for example. That entire line of thought is irrelevant and untenable. Furthermore, Under the Criteria for notability for web content, Pendant Audio clearly meets guidelines 1 and 3 as demonstrated by the multiple examples cited here, in the article itself, and on the talk page *multiple times.* <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolklore_Fanatic_dbe4.html" title="User:Folklore Fanatic">Folklore Fanatic</a> 20:55, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to the statement, "there's no evidence that anyone unconnected with the organisation has written about it,":</p>
<p>What evidence is there to see? How can you tell the difference between a Pendant fan and a Pendant creator in the way they post an episode guide or cast list?</p>

Are you trying to say this article is up for deletion as well? How about the Amateur Voice Acting article? How about the Negavision article? How about the article on fandubs? In fact, what about this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icebox_Radio_Theater" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icebox_Radio_Theater" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icebox_Radio_Theater</a>&#160;?? I haven't heard of these guys before, and I've been around the online voice acting community for roughly 10 years. I know people who are in the voice acting industry, and have been for 30 years who are no more aware of them as I am -- I'd also take their opinion over your own given their credentials. Is this what it is going to take? Or is Wikipedia full of power-hungry moderators putting their opinions of what should be considered as information -- if that is the case, then it does defeat the purpose of this entire organisation... ETA: Also, IrishGuy, it is spelled "Pendant Productions"... Google pulls up the following: <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=pendant+productions&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=pendant+productions&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=pendant+productions&amp;meta=</a> .... In fact, you'll also noticed they're refered to in an existing article on Fanbased Star Trek projects... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_fan_productions" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_fan_productions" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_fan_productions</a> ... as well as a reference on the BBC website: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/saturdaylive/2006/11/james_bond_to_the_end.html" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/saturdaylive/2006/11/james_bond_to_the_end.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/saturdaylive/2006/11/james_bond_to_the_end.html</a> ....</p>
<p>Friends a note of moderation here. The purpose of this discussion is to mediate a solution that will make Wikipedia a better and stronger online resource and for those who wish to create this article to see it remain on the site as a good example rather than something that is just tolerated. Wikipedia has a guideline called "assuming good faith" WP:AGF (could someone link that for me? I'm not lazy just very, very rusty) wherby to keep debate civil you should assume "that people who work on the project are trying to help it, not hurt it." Yes, this includes the people who tag things for deletion. There have been some &lt;coughWCMcough&gt; who have taken advantage of this ruling to attempt to cut a swathe ... well, it's water under the bridge now.</p>
<p>The point is that like a gardener needs to prune a plant to make it stronger, Wikipedia needs to be kept clear of inconsequential articles that are put on the site for reasons other than to inform and educate society - vanity, commercial gain etc.</p>
<p>You new Users will be the prime movers in creating the article on Pendant productions (assuming the guillotine does not fall!) and need to take on board the comments here to make the article stronger and better to counter the same problems later. For example Eludium-q36 (I remember that!) says "I see no evidence <i>in the article</i> that the organisation meets these tests. In particular, there's no evidence that anyone unconnected with the organisation has written about it." So place links in the article to address this. Don't wait for a clearance from the establishment, work on the article now.</p>
<p>On the note of "evidence that anyone unconnected with the organisation has written about it." I must shake my head sadly that my fame as an independant reporter of fan productions has not spread to you, Eludium-q36, for I write regular updates about Star Trek: Defiant on Hailing Frequencies Open, the newsletter of Trekunited with a circulation of thousands (check <a href="http://www.trekunited.com/community/" class="external text" title="http://www.trekunited.com/community/" rel="nofollow">the website</a> for details). You see this is where the statistics fall down. Have you Googled or checked Alexa or whatever for the individual show names? Try Star Trek: Defiant for one. Friend, when people talk about Star Trek they don't always mention CBS so googling CBS will not get every Star Trek reference! Goodness, what a sad indictment on the level of logic and maths taught today!</p>
<p>Friends lets work together to get this article online and set up as a good example of Wikipedia encyclopedic writing. Debate about it's notability is rapidly deteriorating (&gt;sigh&lt; as it usually does) into a popularity contest or a count of opinion rather than measurable citation and expert opinion as it should. Actually if 68.148.64.209 (registering a name would aid your credibility friend) has as much experience in the audio drama field as he (damn, there I go assuming it is a he again!) says then i would cite them as expert opnion.</p>
<p>is there any serious opposition to this article going ahead? If so please post so that we may get some closure on this.</p>
<p>In service to the fleet!</p>

<p>This article, ostensibly a chronology of Alan Moore's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen_eb8f.html" title="The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a>, in fact includes vast amounts of information invented by Wikipedia editors and marked as "speculation". It also contains numerous historical events that are assumed without evidence to have occurred in Moore's universe.

<dd>I'm sorry to butt in again after nominating this article for deletion, but I'm afraid that people aren't recognizing what's problematic about this article. The basic issue is that it's <i>not</i> a plot summary of Moore's work; instead, it takes characters that are appear (often in the briefest way) in the comic and imagines what kind of interactions they might have had in Moore's imaginary universe. This is a fun project but completely unencyclopedic. I think editors who say this problem can "easily be corrected" or that it "just needs some slight touches" are completely understating the problems here--it is very difficult and I believe impossible (hence the nomination) to separate the references to Moore's work from the fan fiction. An article that restricted itself--as Wikipedia is required to--to dates that are actually found in Moore's work would be a very short article indeed. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENareek_2a6e.html" title="User:Nareek">Nareek</a> 15:41, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, but fan fiction? Everything in the timeline is directly from the pages of Moore's work, or in the text of The New Traveller's Almanac, and furthermore every entry in the timeline gives what works of literature the events/characters are drawn from and in a large part where they happen in Moore's work (volumes 1-2, NTA, A&amp;SV). Jess Nevins and Jean-Marc Lofficier themselves have contributed to this timeline. Fan fiction? <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhat_Wordsmith_4ad9.html" title="User:Khat Wordsmith">Khat Wordsmith</a> 00:02, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I suppose my concern is that it isn't clear how much is OR and/or if it is largely plot summary. A lot us drawn from <i>The New Traveller’s Almanac</i> and often with information from <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jess_Nevins_bc57.html" title="Jess Nevins">Jess Nevins</a>' books. Taking an example 1789: "(Speculation based on the internal timeline of Scarlet Pimpernel series by Baroness Orczy and The New Traveller’s Almanac by Alan Moore)." This would imply this is speculative guesswork combined with plot summary. As I said on the talk page I think this would probably be better on a fan site and I am concerned that this timeline is either just largely stating the bulk of <i>The New Traveller’s Almanac</i> with original research, especially as no one seems to have produced such a timeline before (it also impinges on my broader concerns about <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canon (fiction)</a> in that often the creators make no real attempt to create a canon and it is largely a product of fan speculation and has no real place in Wikipedia). It may be largely correct and is certainly of interest (at least to me) but is Wikipedia the best place for this? (<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> 17:51, 23 January 2007 (UTC))</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>, I'd love to better understand what the issue is, I don't seem to understand the argument about plot summary and canon. There is a very small amount of speculation and fanfic in the Timeline. It <i>would indeed</i> be easy to clean it up and restrict it to what is explicitly told in Moore's universe and keep out speculation (and I will work on that). The Timeline, without fanfic and speculation, is in fact a chronology (based on Moore's work in the Almanac) of the time between the dismantling of Mina's First League and the events in the upcoming Black Dossier, as well as the travels of Prospero's Group (the first league). If you actually sit down and look at the dates in Moore's work you see it spans from the 1600's to about the 1920's and that doesnt sound like it would constitute a very short article to me unless you're extremely concise.

<li><b>Keep</b> At it's worst it is a bit rambling and shot through with speculation on what Moore only implies in NTA, which, I'll admit, are a bit glaring and need to be ironed out. I think most if not all of this can be filled in properly after BD comes out. As far as to whether this is or is not better suited for a fan page... I defer to other's better versed in the religion of "what does or does not belong on Wikipedia." I for one am for keeping it, though. <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhat_Wordsmith_4ad9.html" title="User:Khat Wordsmith">Khat Wordsmith</a> 00:13, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and Clean up</b> Most of the events referenced state are acompanied by their sources. But you do have a point that some of this is marked within the text itself as "speculation" of one form or another. Either remove speculations or attribute who is doing them.

<li><b>To the Wiktionary with it!</b> Oh dear. So much wrong with that article. Not slang (I've witnessed it used by elderly ladies), not an English cognate (quite the contrary, a purebred old Japanese word, and one that can (and usually does) act like a pure verb), hopelesly misunderstood meaning of the word (mojo? 200 cigarettes? what? It just means something like "popular" or "attractive", no less no more)... I wish we didn't have all these poorly researched articles about notions poorly understood by the respective article writers in the Japanese parts of WP. Of course, if the author of this article had actually researched or had an inkling of what they were talking about, he/she would realise this is not WP material to begin with.

<li>I only realized later that "English cognate word" was a failed attempt at sounding high-brow about the expression "loanword".

<p>Another list of famous people who... The big problem with this article is that it's scope is not clearly defined. Who qualifies as a celebrity, what qualifies as responsibility for death. Do you need to pull the trigger, fail to call the police at the right time, not know CPR, refuse a kidney, where is the line? Beyond the problem with scope, I question the encyclopedic value of this article. This article was just deleted(<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:FBnIbSOEGeoJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famous_people_responsible_for_a_death+http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famous_people_responsible_for_a_death&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:FBnIbSOEGeoJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famous_people_responsible_for_a_death+http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famous_people_responsible_for_a_death&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">google cache</a>) and recreated due to the large amount of unsourced statements that living people were responsible for death.

<li><b>Keep</b>. First "magnet for unverified information" and "violation of BLP waiting to happen" are <i>not</i> useful or valid reasons to delete an article.

<li>That can easily be dealt with via editing.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> This is much better than the already deleted version. I don't think we should delete articles just because they are a magnet for abuse - the answer is to closely monitor the article to make sure it isn't abused.

<li><b>Delete</b> As mentioned above, the critera of being 'resonsible for a death' is too vague to be clearly supported. If a source mentions that someone is not reponsible for a death in a legal context but clearly describes them as the primary actor in the event, does that qualify or disqualify for inclusion? If in an interview a man declares himself responsible for his wife's death because he was out of town of business, or forgot to load their home defense weapon, is that the type of resposibility that is being referenced? The large scope of things that the word 'responsible' describes, which can potentially conflict, is inherently problematic. And that is even apart form any consideration of merit or potential for negative interactions with BLP or POV issues. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 16:42, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Too vague. "Responsibility" (apparently meaning moral responsibility) is not something an encyclopedia can decide. Would a soldier make the list for shooting enemy troops? What about a general who puts the troops on the field in the first place? What about a CEO whose company's factories have poor safety records? This looks like a libel magnet waiting to happen, and with very little encyclopedic value to offset the risk. I could see a "List of convicted murderers" or even "List of court cases involving a death", but not this. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:33, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. 'Famous' is ridiculously subjective; as is 'responsible'. If Madonna has an abortion, does that qualify as being 'responsible' for a 'death'? If Mel Gibson's dad has a stroke and ends up in a coma on life support, does Mel become 'responsible' for the death if he agrees that it's time to pull the plug? Further to that, is the judge who agreed to let <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terri_Schiavo_eb3a.html" title="Terri Schiavo">Terri Schiavo</a>'s feeding tube be removed 'responsible' for her death? How about the family members who made the request? Just the one(s) who removed the tube?

<li><b>Keep</b> - if properly verified and referenced, I see no insurmountable problem with this article.

<li>Adhering to our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policy is only part of the picture. Another large part, ignored by all of the editors above who have asserted that individual entries can be sourced standalone is our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy's bearing upon the list as a whole. The legal systems of the world don't have a single "responsible for death" category. They have gradations, including murder, voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, <a href="../../../v/e/h/Vehicular_homicide.html" title="Vehicular homicide">vehicular homicide</a>, and others. The world outside of Wikipedia does not lump all of these together, and thus Wikipedia should not do so, either, per our policy. Doing so is a novel synthesis of data that does not reflect the world outside of Wikipedia.
<p>And before someone suggests constructing individual lists of famous people who have been convicted of (say) involuntary manslaughter: Even ignoring for now the admonition in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> not to create lists of "famous X", a list of famous people who have committed a particular crime is of little relevance to encyclopaedic discussion of those crimes, and is of no use to readers who have come wanting an encyclopaedia rather than a tabloid newspaper. The important cases as far as readers, who come to an encyclopaedia to learn about involuntary manslaughter, are concerned are not the cases that involve famous people. They are the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmark_case.html" title="Landmark case">landmark cases</a> where the details of the law on involuntary manslaughter have been settled, and where important legal principles were invented or overturned. <i>Those</i>, not lists of cases involving famous people, are the sort of lists that we as editors should be constructing for readers. (Better yet, we shouldn't be constructing mere lists of cases at all, but full discussions of the legal principles and details, citing the cases that were involved.)</p>

<dd>I understand your points, but would it not be better just to have a smaller list of the major/semi-major achievements merged with the Swindon page.

<p>This is a software product with no published independent reviews or anything of the sort. Archive.org is used to back up the article's claims, but the archive only establishes that the website existed in 2000. It cannot possibly establish that <i>no</i> other websites "of its kind" existed prior to 2000. And in any case, the archive does absolutely nothing for the rest of the claims about success and growing markets and other companies products being "clones" of it. When a few <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> statements are removed, the article looks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../t/h/e/The_Logo_Creator_6800.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../t/h/e/The_Logo_Creator_6800.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and it contains no claim to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>.

<dd>"Natalism" is a policy concern of most nations. Please feel free to go through the list of sources I posted below. There is very much more than that, as well. I intend to expand it too, as time-permits me. After <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalism.html" title="Natalism">Natalism</a> survives AfD, the first thing I plan to do is request that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pronatalism.html" title="Pronatalism">Pronatalism</a> - now that I know it even exists - be merged into <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalism.html" title="Natalism">Natalism</a>. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 08:01, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Given the lack of activity in Pro-natalism I don't see any need to go through process, looking at AfD guidance you can reasonably redirect it without debate. In terms of going through the sources below, not all of us are cooling our heels in academia and having full EBSCO access. Whilst I'd love the prospect, I do have to work for a living.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>In any case, if you are going to expand the article to anything other than a poorly referenced dic-def then that's fine. Forgive me if I'm sceptical, there are lots of articles which survive AfD on the basis of <i>keep and improve</i> which never see any development after the fact.</dd>

<p>I, not as the article creator, but the major contributer to a vast majority of the information supplied on the page believe that reasons stated above by Alexbeglin are both valid and indeed very good reasons as to why the article should not be met with deletion. The hour long radio, as well as the upcoming tour, plus the reviews by several magazines and a mention in the NME all qualify this article about The Enigma Project to stay, and not be deleted.

<p>I have followed the progress of The Enigma Project for a considerable length of time now. It is true that at the time of creation, this article did not meet the required criterion. However, as it currently stands the BBC Has articles on their website regarding the band <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2005/06/01/localband_enigmaproject_feature.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2005/06/01/localband_enigmaproject_feature.shtml" rel="nofollow">Enigma Project BBC Article exhibit A</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2006/11/29/enigma_project_christmas_party_feature.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2006/11/29/enigma_project_christmas_party_feature.shtml" rel="nofollow">Enigma Project BBC Article Exhibit B</a>. This thus means the band has at least met the criterion for a verifyable article by a notable company, and hence, the band's notability is confirmed as it has met one of the criterion, which is all that is required according to <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. Furthermore, Itunes (on which The Enigma Project's work can be found) is significantly notable- could this be counted as a label of production? Finally The broadcast 1 hour long on the BBC Berkshire mainstream radio confirms this band's notability. Therefore, I feel that this article no longer qualifies for deletion under Wikipedia's policy, as any artist must only meet ONE of the criterion listed on the link given earlier- as such I would move that this discussion is closed? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowpaladin_f12d.html" title="User:Shadowpaladin">Phil</a> 10:52, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Thirdly, isolated quotes do not constitute non-trivial coverage, full articles do.

<dd>If you would research into the show in question on BBC radio Berkshire you will find that bands are the feature of the show. They are subject to an hour long show being interviewed and even playing live on the shows. They played two songs on the show and interviewed for at least 45 mins. This means an hour long broadcast purley on this band. More information about the show can be found on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/the_session/index.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/the_session/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/the_session/index.shtml</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Regarding <a href="../../../s/w/p/User%7ESwpb_9c6b.html" title="User:Swpb">Swpb</a>'s comment about isolated quotes, the quote from Josaka is infact referenced, and the full article is availible by the link provided at the bottom of the article, or by clicking <a href="http://www.josaka.com/Reviews/2006/The-Enigma-Project-000706.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.josaka.com/Reviews/2006/The-Enigma-Project-000706.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Also the feature article regarding them on the BBC, which can be read by clicking <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2005/06/01/localband_enigmaproject_feature.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2005/06/01/localband_enigmaproject_feature.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Those are two articles from different sources, on top of the other quotes, on top of the hour long radio programme. There surely cannot be any reason to delete the article, as more than one criteria stated in the <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> (which is the orginal reason this page was submitted for deletion) has been met. I therefore cannot understand why this discussion needs to be continued, and if you (Swpb) could explain why it would be much appreciated. (the previous statement is not meant to be read in a sarcastic or patronising way, if that is how it came across, then I apoligise.)--Scuzzmonkey 20:03, 21 January 2007 (UTC) Also even though BBC Berkshire is a "local" radio station, as it is part of the BBC it can be listened to internationally via the internet by clicking <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/berkshire.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/berkshire.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a>. As such, it reaches a far greater amount of people than standard local radio, and as such is notable. The cited articles on the BBC are notable due to the fact the BBC actually had to approach the band and ask if they could feature them on the website, thus proving the BBC must know about the band, and thus they are notable. --Scuzzmonkey 14:33, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Fails every part of WP:MUSIC except the radio broad cast. However their '1hour show' wasn't on BBC radio nationaly it was BBC berkshire local radio only, thus it fails as it wasn't a national broadcast.

<li>I wrote the article. He's well known to people in a certain age group on the East Coast (U.S.). He was, by all accounts, an excellent piano player and showman. He had many singles and one album (perhaps more). He represents a certain type of artist/performer -- i.e., small-time piano player and lounge singer -- notably more successful than most. He composed at least three piano accordion solos: "The Silver Streak Polka," "The Helicopter Polka," and "Whisphering Willows." At least two of them were published c. 1953 by PostScript Music. Chironomia 23 January 2007; updated 24 January 2007</li>

<p>Ok, this nomination might be a little controversial because of the whole <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> debate, but hear me out here. This article simply <i>can't</i> be verified without going to the school's official page, which is vague and spun. The article is far from neutral anyway, and is full with unverifiable facts. It is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">P</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">TO</a> 18:01, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep but Stubify</b> - I absolutely agree with you that the article's current content violates <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (or at least <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, and for the record I think we need some way to restrict the exponential growth of articles on obscure schools (of which a lot have appeared today on <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a>). However, as it stands, thousands of other schools with no claim to notability have their own article; we can't really deny coverage to this one. I say remove all the unverifiable facts (which is most of the article) and reduce to a stub. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 18:20, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>: This needs to be completely rewritten, but I see some notability. Last I checked WP:SCHOOL, nearly winning state was pretty notable. Of course, you can't really cite</li>
</ul>
<p>WP:SCHOOL and expect to be heard seeing as how it's not a policy now. This at least tries to establish notability, if we can get rid of the schoolcruft this will be a good enough article.--<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span></a> 19:48, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Only thing noteable is winning state in 1 sport in 2003. Which is hardly enough to get press coverage or indepedant sources. WP:SCHOOL will continue to be rejected because they shouldn't be letting schools like this in. EVERY school has probably won state for some sport at least once in its histroy, this is expecially true for non-americian schools in other counteries where the states are alot smaller. Nothing is notable about this school at all.--155.144.251.120 21:58, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Hate to beat a dead horse, but high schools really are inherently notable. Why are we bothering to chase these articles on places that are important to communities. Furthermore, these verifiability arguments are needlessly bureaucratic. Why would you assume bad faith on information provided on a high school website? It seems natural that there would be good info available on the school.

<li><b>delete</b> because I do not think high schools are necessarily notable, except to the inmates.

<dd><b>Comment</b> That's my problem with the merge&#160;!votes. These articles can't be reasonably merged because there is just too many plot details to deal with. This is a case where starting over would be the best option. But one must also question the relevance of such high levels of plot detail in an encyclopedia article. That's why <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> actually forbids such "Plot of" articles, instead it states editors should focus on the work's real-world context, achievements, and impact. With all of the plotish articles on <i>One Piece</i>, there is almost not mentions of it as a marketing franchise nor it's impact on Japanese/anime culture. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 04:05, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: A big thing with that is because all of the information on real-world context is either: hard to find, falls under Wikipedia's definition of "original research", is in Japanese, or does not satisfy <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - what's the useful information that should be merged?

<dd>How is it notable that "Django resorta to hypnotizing his men into believing their invincible but that tactic backfires when Luffy is hypnotised as well and procceds to wreak havoc on the Black Cats and their ship before Django puts Luffy to sleep"?

<dd>I never knew that Wikipedia pages had to be the subject of reveiws, only the subject that the page is about. And the pages will be improved if they are kept... the only way to make them worse would be to put them back as dub reviews.

<dd>Yeah, I'm not saying keep or delete because I don't have a definite stance. So are the arcs themselves notable enough to detail every plotline scene-by-scene? At brief glance it looks to me that the arc names are not official and merely fan-made descriptions. What's so bad about brief, concise summaries? That's how official sites would describe episodes anyway, and they're a lot easier to maintain. Practically, what's the use of all this information? Someone might forget a minute detail in an episode and want to confirm it quickly, someone mean can skim the spoilers to paste to spite a friend, but that's it. No one unfamiliar with the show is going to spoil it for themselves, and if you're crazy about this show you're probably going to read dialogue/discussion/interpretation instead of a neutral description. It was argued elsewhere that this belongs in a One Piece specific wiki where fans can add all the trivia they want. <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 03:09, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The notability of this individual is borderline at best; he is a self-proclaimed satanist and vampire who's claim to fame was announcing a bid for the 2006 Minnesota gubernatorial election on Friday <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_13.html" title="January 13">13 January</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. Starting in the beginning of October, the individual himself, Jonathon The Impaler (<a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonathon_The_Impaler_2c98.html" title="User talk:Jonathon The Impaler">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jonathon_The_Impaler_e802.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jonathon The Impaler">contribs</a>), began editting the article and editwarring over the course of several months.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have spent a bit of time upgrading (I hope) since the article was listed here. IMHO, the subject is notable (if not fascinating) in several respects. He's run for president twice and congress at least three times. He is the subject of a documentary shot by independent filmmakers who have stated that the subject will have no input into or control over their film. His story has been reported in major television and print media across the US, including a report on Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update. He has been involved in dozens of lawsuits, some of which have resulted in reported opinions. If the consensus is delete, that's fine, but please review the most recent version. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 22:07, 21 January 2007 (UTC), revised by <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 19:58, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, with a condition that the article be cleaned up.

<p>Wikipedia isn't a guide to trivia. Editors think this is useful (and eliminates list pages on Silent Hill articles), but it's still cruft. Imagine if every popular series had articles to eliminate lists: Wikipedia would be flooded. Also, as per: <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_trivia_sections_in_articles_c909.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles">Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles</a>, this article doesn't need to exist.

<li><b>Keep</b> All game pages have trivia and popular culture. In this case the list is to big for the game page so it is made a seperate article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just because Wikipedia is full of trivia, doesn't make a certain article more notable or not. There is trivia guidelines for a reason: so articles aren't flooded with it. When articles of trivia (and other information) get posted in a new page: that's just moving the problem, not solving it. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 05:49, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Much of it is unsourced original research. The parts that aren't are non-notable trivia. We have guidelines that specifically say we should try to minimize trivia as much as possible with the end goal that no articles will have any trivia. Having an entire article about trivia flies in the face of this. This sort of in-game trivia is unencyclopedic. Also, in reply to Dacium's argument that this list is too big for the game article: that's a sign that the list itself should be trimmed without mercy, not that it should get it's own article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:50, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. While I understand the sentiment behind the move to delete, Silent Hill contains an exhaustive amount of both references to other works and references to other games in the series, and is generally considered to be a milestone in horror gaming. While this page may be an inelegant solution, deleting it out of purist notions of "cleaning up" Wikipedia will only serve to do exactly the opposite, as people will start plugging all these various assorted facts back into the main pages, where they will be harder to fact-check and keep organized. - <a href="../../../t/z/a/User%7ETzaquiel_22c8.html" title="User:Tzaquiel">Tzaquiel</a> 18:15, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The games that are the subject of this article are unique in their referential content. Rob speaks of this happening to other pages, but I maintain that it will not as this situation is unique. I am opposed to this deletion because, while lists and trivia are frowned upon, this article contains interesting information that is hardly able to be conveyed differently. I'm also of the mind that this is not necessarily simply trivia, but references and influences in most cases. Also, I'm working to source a lot of these things, and while Lenin and McCarthy believes that I'm doing it in a strange way, removing this stuff will only make it reappear on the main SH game articles eventually. The article IS being worked on to maybe make it less list-like. --<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThaddius_2203.html" title="User:Thaddius">Thaddius</a> 21:03, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article does not appear to meet notability criteria and has had a notice to this effect since October 2006. Further, it is not written in encyclopedic style as one editor observed on the talk page saying "Wikipedia is not a how-to". I have not been able to find references to this upon search through Google. At best, it should be <b>transwikied</b> to wikibooks or <b>deleted</b> as a non-notable article. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocratesJedi_4545.html" title="User:SocratesJedi">SocratesJedi</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/c/User_talk%7ESocratesJedi_9c57.html" title="User talk:SocratesJedi">Talk</a> 22:25, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Impossible Puzzle was prod'ed (by me) but the tag was removed by an anon (who seems to be the article's creator, <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndependentdependent_b257.html" title="User:Independentdependent">User:Independentdependent</a>), who explains that the purpose of the page is to list the puzzles that are "impossible". Since the point of the page seems to be a dictionary defintion of a commonly understood phrase and to list puzzles with no solutions, this page should be deleted as it exemplifies what <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>, in particular Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. (The puzzle that is so far listed on the page is better described on the puzzle's own page at the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_cottage_problem.html" title="Three cottage problem">three cottage problem</a> which will probably be moved to a better title) --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 22:45, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment/Delete</b>. One, the AFD talk page bot is frightening. I was involved a bit in the removal of blacklisted stuff on this page for like, one day, and I get a comment... Two: Nothing is really verifiable. Besides the obvious lack of sources, which demonstrates lack of notability, most of the stuff on pages like Zorpia or Facebook is likely original research or from a primary source, the website itself. Third: Even if the have 1/10th of that estimated number of members, they have more members than Wikipedia. We wouldn't get our own Wikipedia article. There are 160 thousand editors with more than 10 edits. Size of the population base might need to be taken as a statistic and not a measure of popularity... But yea, just remove the size and it might work. Fourth: The entire article has been changed thanks to User:Zorpia, which is clearly a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">Conflict of interest</a>, and the references are just horrible for the stuff added: 3/4 are within the site itself (primary), and one might just be a press release (Didn't look). <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogical2u_96f0.html" title="User:Logical2u">User:Logical2u</a><sub><a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELogical2u_14f2.html" title="User talk:Logical2u">Talk</a></sub> 23:57, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Mr. Lucas was one of the most influential people involved in the community during the Windows Vista and Windows Codename "Longhorn" development period and I believe that this article should stay.

<li>References, please. If it survives this AFD and no references get added, it will more than likely be renominates a few months later since it still doesn't have refs.

<p>An IP editor, who is also removing valid "article for deletion" templates, restoring copyvio material to articles, and leaving unsigned criticism on my talk page, has removed the "notability" template from this article several times without adding any information about notability to the article. This subject is an "internet novel."

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> I am the author of the article and no pro at Wikipedia - in fact, I have no idea where to respond to this comment. However, I do believe that Wikipedia should be for everyone and include all cat breeds. Here is my case and please excuse me if I am not doing this correctly. The "Bramble" is accepted by the Rare and Exotic Feline Registry <a href="http://www.rareandexoticfelinereg.homestead.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rareandexoticfelinereg.homestead.com/" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. It is a new breed and not an attempt to "self promote". There are several breeders now working with the Bramble. I am not sure that I understand where the "self promote" comes from. I am the founder of the breed and have my name in as such. We have just started working toward TICA inclusion. Shouldn't Wikipedia cover new breeds of cats? I would certainly agree to have my name removed from the article, if that is what is causing the problem, but it seems that the founder of the breed should be included. Just let me know. I am a long term reputable cat breeder and member of TICA (The International Cat Association) in good standing. Please tell me the issue about this article. No cats are even for sale. This is a breed of cat, just like any breed. I can type in Sphynx, Siamese, etc... and get to an article. Again, if it is just the founder of the breed's name, please let me know. It seems that Wikipedia should include articles on cat breeds. There are new breeds and historical breeds that have gone away. If Wikipedia is going to be a source for information, it should be a source for all things. --Garybr 10:26, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Wikipedia does not cover all things. It covers things that are significant enough to be the subject of multiple, reliable sources. In order for the article to be kept, you would need to demonstrate that there are good sources that are independent of your cattery, such as newspaper or magazine stories, that can be used to verify the article. <font face="Trebuchet MS, Trebuchet"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 10:47, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To add to what has already been said, the Bramble article mentions the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengal_%28cat%29.html" title="Bengal (cat)">Bengal</a>. If you look at that page, multiple cat societies are listed with the breed standards for each. The Bramble cannot be found at any of these societies. So far, you and the Rare and Exotic Feline Registry are the only ones who even mention this cat. And the REFR doesn't seem to be a recognized registry in the cat world much like the AKC of the dog world. For one, their web site is hosted at homestead.com and for two, the registration of new breeds seems to only require filling out a nine question form and paying $25. And lastly, the issue with you writing the article is that you can be biased. If someone writes their own autobiography, they're probably going to come off sounding really good and not include any criticism people may have of that person. Since you are the originator of this breed, you are inherently biased. Please see <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> for Wikipedia's policies on autobiographies to help understand why I made this comparison. And please also see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> to understand why Wikipedia must maintain a Neutral Point of View.

<p>Thank you for your reply. I don't have anything else to add. This is a brand new cat breed and will be advancing quickly. I was under the false impression that Wikipedia would want articles such as this. People go to Wikipedia to find sources of information that are unavailable in other locations. Cat breeds advance just like dog breeds do. No breed starts out in AKC. The breed has to be developed and then works toward advancement in TICA and CFA - which are two registries, but not the only ones. Usually, a cat breed starts in one place and then works for inclusion in one of the above registering bodies. The Peterbald, Sphynx, and Bengal all started this way. I am the longest standing breeder of the Peterbald in the U.S. and was integral in the acceptance of that breed by TICA. I will be doing the same with the Bramble.</p>
<p>However, if this is not appropriate, please remove the article. I will now know that Wikipedia is not for new information. No hard feelings - this has been educational. --Garybr 11:57, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also,I am wondering when the Peterbald, Bengal, Sphynx etc. were added to Wikipedia. Were they added only after TICA acceptance? The Bengal and Peterbald are not accepted in CFA yet. Also, when was the Border Collie added? Remember, AKC went a long period of time before accepting that breed. I am not even sure if it is yet accepted, but believe that it finally made it in. This was despite much popularity of the breed for years before that.</p>
<p>The Bramble is, also, included on the Messybeast site. That is at <a href="http://www.messybeast.com/breeds.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.messybeast.com/breeds.htm" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> I do not know if that will make a difference or not, though. Please do what you feel is necessary. --Garybr 11:57, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The dates at which articles have been added to the site can be found by clicking on the "history" tab at the top of the article and going to the earliest date. The articles you asked about were started on the following dates:</dd>

<li>Peterbald - 26 September, 2005</li>
<li>Sphynx - 24 July, 2002</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>And the Border Collie was added on 10 October, 2002. But take into account that Wikipedia is entirely volunteer written so just because something was added on a certain date doesn't mean that it has any significance related to that particular subject. It's just the date that someone noticed that there wasn't an article about an already established and verifiable breed, so they decided to add the article. <tt><a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a></tt>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:39, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Response</b>If you only accept entries on breeds that are accepted by one of the two registering bodies, then please remove my article. All I ask is that you keep this same standard when it applies to other breeds of dogs and cats. There are several other new breeds of domestic animals out there now. I was one of the instrumental people in the development of the Peterbald breed in the United States and getting it accepted to TICA. The Peterbald gained championship status in May of 2006 with TICA. It is not CFA recognized yet. The Bengal is not CFA recognized yet either. I have always used Wikipedia to find out about things that I cannot find otherwise. This changes my view on that. Apparently, there should not be an article on here that is not recognized by certain registering bodies. I am not some person that has put together two cats in my backyard. I am a TICA member in good standing. This breed will go through the same steps as any other new breed. Thank you for your time. <b>Please remove the article.</b> I would rather it be removed than to have that big sign on it stating that it is up for deletion. That makes this breed look like it is not something real and out there. --Garybr 15:00, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This isn't an attack on you or your integrity as a breeder. However, a new breed (which, by the way, I could find no mention of on either of the links you provided) which has not yet stood the test of time doesn't really belong in an encyclopedic website such as this. Ten or twenty years down the road, the breed may no longer exist. On the other hand, it may gain supporters who continue to expand the breed. In that case, at some point down the road, an article may be appropriate. You may find it beneficial to read the policies on what Wikipedia is and isn't as well as the guidelines for contributions. --<a href="../../../h/-/k/User%7EH-ko_a6c5.html" title="User:H-ko">H-ko</a> 00:36, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Gary, this article needs to be deleted for a couple of reasons:</li>
</ul>
<p>(1) We try to avoid "conflict of interest". You seem to be the creator and principal advocate of this breed, so there's an immediate concern that you may be biased in the way you have written this article. As the previous comment notes, this isn't an attack on you or your integrity as a breeder, it's just one of the safeguards we try to work with. (2) The article is weak in the quality of references it provides. Right now there are three references provided: one is to your own site, which gets an automatic disqualification ( "conflict of interest" ), one is to a site which appears to belong to someone who knows you well enough to help your business via a link ( "conflict of interest" again ), and one is to the "Rare and Exotic Feline Registry". The last of these looks superficially more useful, but when I look at the REFR site I find that anyone can register a breed without any independent oversight; it looks to me as if that's what you've done, so the quality of independence of this reference is also suspect. As <a href="../../../h/-/k/User%7EH-ko_a6c5.html" title="User:H-ko">H-ko</a> says above, and as I'd like to strongly emphasise: this is in no way meant to question your integrity and skills. If the breed continues to exist, and takes off, it will certainly attain coverage by Wikipedia. The time for that, though, is not yet. Yes, it's important to share news about new breeds, but Wikipedia is not the place for that. The best thing you can do is continue to develop the Bramble Cat, and seek to advance its cause in professional, hobby and trade publications and websites: if it's as fine a breed as is seems from your website, it will be a great success, and the Wikipedia entry will happen when the time is right ( and, probably, when you've completely forgotten about this discussion ).

<li><b>response</b> I have asked for the article to be deleted. I don't mind if Wikipedia does this, because it is hurting the breed and my name for that big sign to be on top of the article. As for REFR, they are a legitimate registering body for new breeds. The process is not as easy as just paying the $25. There is a genetic committee and process. Again, please delete the article, but PLEASE delete all articles of any cats that do not have TICA or CFA acceptance yet. According to this, they are not a breed yet. Also, remember this for future articles that are written on other topics. Something does not exist on Wikipedia until it is on many other resource lists. I am not angry, even though this appears that I am. I simply wish for the article to be deleted. Do I do this or does someone else? I have seen something that states that the article cannot be blanked. I want the article taken down as quickly as possible. --Garybr 00:57, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It isn't as simple as that. An article written is not the property of the contributor; it belongs to the community as a whole. The process for deletion, as initiated by me, involves putting it up for a vote and then acting on the majority opinion of the community. Since most of the people who have commented on it so far seem to be in favor for its deletion, that is probably what will happen. However, due process still needs to be followed. I don't believe that being put up for deletion really casts a topic in a negative light. There are many valid reasons to delete an article which do not reflect on the subject. However, that is just my personal opinion.--<a href="../../../h/-/k/User%7EH-ko_a6c5.html" title="User:H-ko">H-ko</a> 03:58, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Response</b>Well, I know hundreds of cat breeders, so I could always get them to come on here and give their opinion in favor of keeping the article, but I won't do that. I think this is a pretty silly argument.--Garybr 10:09, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Modified</b> I have changed the article some, since that seems within the rules of Wikipedia. All references to myself have been removed. If that satisfies the experts above, who I am unsure of how much breed development experience they have, the article should remain. If not, I would still prefer that this article be completely deleted - quickly! I am so tired of checking on it daily to see if it is gone yet. Wikipedia has truly disappointed me on this. If this chooses to be a source for information, there is nothing wrong with showing a new breed that is in development. It is a fact, no matter if some believe that it is not. Acceptance of the breed by TICA or CFA do not validate what breeds are in development. What if I wrote an article on the Mexican Hairless cat breed. It is no longer in existence and was never a TICA or CFA breed, but it was still a fact in history. If Wikipedia wants to limit itself to only some facts, that is certainly a choice. Since this is a "user" built source, though, Wikipedia could be so much more. I appreciate the comments above and know that none were meant to be offensive. However, as a respected breeder and shower in the cat fancy, this has been truly humiliating. I will continue to work toward the continued success of this breed and will not be using Wikipedia as a source for any information in the future. It is painfully obvious that this is not the purpose of this site.--Garybr 11:59, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We've told you that the debate lasts for five days. We're not trying to humiliate anyone by keeping it here. There is no cabal that is out to get you or the breed. As for the Mexican hairless breed you mention, if outside, independant sources can verify the existence of the breed, then yes, an article could be written about it. It's the same thing for, let's say, a dinosaur. There aren't any around anymore but those species have been cataloged by scientific journals. And unless you told a number of people about the article, there probably aren't very many people at all who have seen the article or seen the AFD notice on it. It's only linked from four other pages. One is this page, another is the log of all AFDs, and a third is from <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Cats_dfd9.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Cats">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Cats</a> where someone has asked for people who are more familiar with cats to please weigh in on the matter. I, at least, don't doubt that you've bred this cat but simply doing something unique isn't verifiable or possibly even notable. Wikipedia is not a collection of random facts and figures. <tt><a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a></tt>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:26, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>response</b> So, what you are saying is that if the Bramble were to disappear like the Mexican Hairless, before it is recognized by TICA, then an article could be written about it THEN? My point is that a fact is a fact. This breed does exist and it was created by a reputable cat breeder that is known in those circles. Careful planning and years of work went into the creation of this new and exciting breed. The Bramble will be a household name, much like the Siamese or other known breeds in the future. This was no "fly by night" endeavor. It is shocking to me that Wikipedia does not want information such as this to be included. --Garybr 12:50, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the Bramble were to dissappear right now, no, it would still not warrant an article because it hasn't been mentioned by third party independent sources, notable cat breeder organizations (such as this TICA seems to be), or scientific journals. Please see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> and think of that applying for cat breeds. I don't doubt that a lot of time and effort goes into creating a new breed of cat. Think of it this way... An automobile engineer creates a new design for a car. He does this in his spare time, i.e. he's not ordered to do so by the company that he works for. He shows this new car to a number of his colleagues and they all agree that it's a fascinating design and really different. If the engineer were to die and nobody were to pick up his work and carry it on, an article should not be written. At this point, an article shouldn't be made according to Wikipedia's policies because we are not a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a> of information. All encyclopedias, such as Britannica or Wikipedia, are a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>. Now, this engineer gets an article written about the new car by independent third parties such as <i>Car &amp; Driver</i> or <i><a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_Science_c9c1.html" title="Popular Science">Popular Science</a></i> magazines or even industry publications. At this point the existence of the car can be verified by reputable sources which are well known, in this case, not only to auto enthusiasts but also to the general public. Now this tertiary source, Wikipedia, can have an article about the car. So, as it stands now, the Bramble, while it has had a large amount of time and effort devoted to it, has not been reported on by literary sources such as <i><a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat_Fancy_3422.html" title="Cat Fancy">Cat Fancy</a></i> magazine, the TICA (just using that as an example as a recognized reputable source), or scientific journals. Policies that I have thought of and tried to work into this example include <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">No original research</a>, and most specifically, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> with special emphasis on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_publisher_of_original_thought" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">point #2 found here</a>.

</li>
<li><b>Response</b>This now seems like it is less of a policy issue than a personal problem with new cat breeds. If you saw my records, you would know that this is extremely difficult and time consuming process. I do it because I love the cat. As for literary sources, it is nice to know that "Cat Fancy" qualifies as that. Every breed that you see in existence today starts somewhere. The Bramble is a new breed and will be recognized as time goes by. If Wikipedia does not acknowledge a new breed until it is in a magazine, then I wouldn't consider Wikipedia a good source for information. The fact that Wikipedia is able to publish articles that cannot be found in other places, be on the cutting edge, and be open to being fluid, is an advantage - or not, depending on the willingness to do that.--Garybr 15:30, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not a problem with new cat breeds. If I had something against cats, I wouldn't have three of them myself. Nowhere on this site does it say that Wikipedia is on the cutting edge or that it is the place for publishing of new information. Right at the top of the page under the logo it says "Wikipedia The Free Encyclopedia" and as I've pointed out, encyclopedias are tertiary sources. Wikipedia is a good source of information, just as any other encyclopedia, but it is not the place for original publications. This same point has been explained to many people who thought as you do that Wikipedia should accept all information whether it can be cited or not. We've had people try to publish their new theories about philosophical concepts as well. I'm sure they put a great deal of thought into them after having read the articles but they weren't documented anywhere notable, verifiable, etc. Therefore this is not the place for them. Through this whole process I've been trying to explain to you that an article about the Bramble is welcome once the breed has become recognized by third parties and those who deal in this sort of thing. I've tried to explain why the REFR is not thought to be a standards organization that we can base our inclusion criteria on. This is in no way a personal thing against you or against your breed. <tt><a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a></tt>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:26, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>response</b> I feel that a cat breed is much different than a theory. Since I have 3 of them looking up at me right now, it qualifies as a fact - not even a well thought out theory. So, I think that comparison is apples and oranges. It comes down to you not believing that REFR is a qualified source to verify the breed. However, all breeds start in this fashion. Any new breed in the last 30 years has gone through a process such as this. TICA is not the only registering body, although that will be the next step for the breed - and it is a breed. Why not include something that is living and breathing on this planet - especially one that is recognized by a registering body? What made TICA the only source for cat breeds? I am responding to this above what someone else has already stated about TICA - it is no different than REFR - just larger. REFR is a common place for new breeds to be registered. So, to repeat myself, the Bramble IS a breed of cat. It is a breed that exists today. It is just starting out, so it isn't a household name yet. The only choice for Wikipedia is if it wants to include facts that are not household names yet - or stick to only things that everyone already knows.

<li>So find other users that feel as you do. I'm not the only one that's allowed to post my opinion. I'm not even an admin so I can't close the debate and delete the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Certainly, there are problems with the page, but the article feels well-intentioned. It is in no way an autobiography or advertising, and despite the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> I think the author has done a good job of keeping the article fairly unbiased. A recognized cat breed is notable. If some random person decides that their pet cat should be called a new breed, then that 'breed' is not notable. In this case, I feel like trusting that, while this isn't an accepted breed now, it will become one, and will be notable. It seems silly just to postpone the creation of the article until the cat becomes a TICA breed. There are many worse articles on wikipedia. Also, let's not bite the newcomers, and I hope, Garybr, that this doesn't discourage you from writing for wikipedia in the future. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELesnail_3c51.html" title="User:Lesnail">Lesnail</a> 02:57, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>WP:NOT a crystal ball. Your prediction for the future that this will become a breed is irrelevent. I predict it won't become a breed. There, now we're even. However, wikipedia is written on what exists now, not what might exist in the future. As far as I'm concerned, this is someone reproducing with their pet cats and calling it a breed.

<li><b>response</b> Thank you. It is heartening to know that someone, other than my collegues, believe that this is worthy of an entry. It would be easy for me to get other known cat breeders into the discussion, but I have chosen not to do that. I have never had to defend myself like this before. I am very disheartened by this whole episode. My point throughout this has been to please delete the article, if it is not deemed worthy. I will go about my way and know that Wikipedia is not the place to find this type of information. Someone else can write an article on this breed in the future. I have truly enjoyed Wikipedia before this time - thinking that I could find things here that are new and fresh, since it is not a stale source. Apparently, that is not always the case.--Garybr 11:33, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>"<b>Keep</b>" I would love to know what 'makes' a breed. The fact that there are breeders breeding this particular breed of cats should mean something. TICA or CFA is nothing but a club of people. What makes you say they should have the decision to accept or not accept a certain breed but REFR which is another cat association should not have that right? Discrimination comes into play here and I believe that could cause trouble from someone if this type article is deleted. Besides all that, TICA does accept new breeds for registration. They may put experimental on the papers but they do group new breeds together under their breed name, they do accept money to register them and they do give out registration papers with that breed name on them. This article on the Bramble Cat breed has as much right as any other article to be here. If it is deleted, that shows that Wikipedia is not interested in gathering 'all' knowledge but discriminates on whose knowledge. Not a place I will support. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.141.91.86 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.141.91.86_8fd1.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.141.91.86">contribs</a>).</small> (Note the anon commenting here has edits to nothing but this page.)</p>

<dd>Nothing has a "right" to be here without notability, independent sources and a lack of original research. The Bramble cat has none of these.

<li><b>response</b> Thank you for the above comments. It is true that TICA and CFA should not be the only sources to verify. They are groups of people just like REFR.
