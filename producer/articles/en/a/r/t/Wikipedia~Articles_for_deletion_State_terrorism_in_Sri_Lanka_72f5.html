<dl>
<dd>State terrorism is a controversial term (see:State terrorism. Confines and definition), which means violence against civilians perpetrated by a national government or proxy state.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Care should be taken to differentiate state terrorism from acts of violence carried out by government agents which are not specified by government policy. A murder carried out by a policeman, for example, is not considered state terrorism unless the government sanctioned the action.</dd>

<dd>Similarly your edits on LTTE should be looked at in the same light. Were certain controversial incidents comitted by the LTTE or not&#160;? Was it LTTE policy or was it members of the LTTE doing it on their own. You seem to have one set of arguments for sham democracies and another for non-state actors.

<p>The sole incident of proven state terrorism (involving violence against civilians with sanction of the government at the time) is the entry relating to July 1983 riots.This is covered in entry on Sri Lanka in <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">State terrorism</a> page which hyperlinks to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_July_e757.html" title="Black July">Black July</a> page. Sole purpose of this page appears to be to portray Sri Lanka as a terrorist state by creating a huge list of falsities, irrelevancies and distortions(which I have highlighted on the talk page). The POV of the whole page is against Sri Lanka. <a href="../../../r/u/c/User%7ERuchiraw_fe8e.html" title="User:Ruchiraw">Ruchiraw</a> 23:31, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are other proven incidents of state terrorism and ethnic cleansing - namely the chasing of Tamil civillians from Manal Aru (now called Weli Oya by the govt. assisted Sinhala settlers).

<li><s><b>Keep</b> It is true that most of the incidents before 1981 cannot really be called "terrorism". This, however, merely points to renaming the article rather than deleting it.

<dd>Hi Tyronen. What do you propose renaming this article. The hyperlink from <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">state terrorism</a> would need to be reviewed if it is not dealing with state terrorism<a href="../../../r/u/c/User%7ERuchiraw_fe8e.html" title="User:Ruchiraw">Ruchiraw</a> 06:50, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>:::Thinking about it, I propose the article be split into two. The first could be called "Beginnings of ethnic tension in Sri Lanka" and should be linked to from <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_conflict_in_Sri_Lanka_d1b7.html" title="Ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka">Ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka</a> as the main article of its 'Background' section. The second should deal entirely with 1983 and after incidents, and that should stay as is, in the state terrorism section. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyronen_7385.html" title="User:Tyronen">Tyronen</a> 16:37, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<dd>I think the BBC is a reliable source. I think UNESCO is a reliable source. I think WSWS is a reliable source for their own allegations. If you'll read the article and look at how references are used, you'll see that although a few questionable references are used, they're used in appropriate contexts, and other more reliable sources are used in other contexts. Since the facts in the cases are generally disputed, of course you can trapse about saying <i>The allegations of group X are not proven</i> and this is made clear in the article - if you have a problem with the wording, that can be addressed. If you say <i>Every article that contains any disputed or unproven allegation should be deleted</i>, Hume would tell us we need to delete the whole encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> covers pretty well how to deal with these situations, and the article is doing a <i>reasonable</i> job thus far, and is still working towards perfection, which is acceptable for a new article. If you have a problem with a <i>specifc</i> citation bring it up on the talk page, but to suggest that the BBC is not a reputable source is disingenious. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 11:34, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to add to that out of the pro-Tamil sites tamilnation.org does a very good job of citing neutral or third party sources to backup their arguments, with all the articles that I have read there anyway. the only problem I have is that many of the incidents are so old that the reference material cannot be easily obtained, other than by ordering through news archives etc.--<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealstarslayer_f0b8.html" title="User:Realstarslayer">Realstarslayer</a> 17:44, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The page itself should exist, it makes more sense to have a separate page than to have all this crammed in with the general State terrorism page.

<dd>As others have commented I see no problem in renaming the article, either that or creating a stub that covers more general human rights violations and only leave those acts that have been positively deemed 'state terrorism' on this page.--<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealstarslayer_f0b8.html" title="User:Realstarslayer">Realstarslayer</a> 17:38, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> at best it should be renamed such as <b>Notable human rights violations in Sri Lanka</b> just like the notable LTTE attacks article. State terrorism does makes it inflamatory.Kongan 14:18, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> because the content is factually accurate (as far as possible considering the information and media situation in SL) and important. I am under the impression that <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">Raveen</a> has put a lot of work into this article; he tries hard to be impartial; he is always open for criticism and suggestions. It is a good idea to <b>rename</b> the article and to watch the language used very closely in order to avoid POV and yellow press-like phrasing. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrankman_ac87.html" title="User:Krankman">Krankman</a> 17:51, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>Note to users not familiar with the Sri Lankan situation: You have to understand that with all articles touching the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka, you can expect radicals and nationalists from both sides to edit and take part in discussions, talking about WP policies, sources and NPOV, etc., often disguising their actual motivations very cleverly. Don't let yourselves be fooled.</i> <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrankman_ac87.html" title="User:Krankman">Krankman</a> 17:51, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I suggest <b>merging</b> with Terrorist attacks carried out by LTTE under the title "Notable human rights violations in Sri Lanka" (see Kongan's suggestion above), in the process cleaning up (and out) a lot. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrankman_ac87.html" title="User:Krankman">Krankman</a> 13:27, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Notable human rights violation in Sri Lanka</b> versus <b>Notable human rights violations by Sri Lanka</b> are 2 different articles. Let's first keep this article as is then decide on a proper name if need be and based on that name, the resultant article can be left alone or merged with another one.

<dd>Well, I think that by putting those articles together, it would be less likely to be seen as pov because you would have the cruelties commited by <i>both sides</i> on one page; thus no reader would be tempted to think that one side is much worse than the other if he or she only stumbles upon <i>one</i> of the articles. All the facts would be there in one place, and everyone would be able to read and make up their own minds.</dd>
<dd>Of course, we all have to admit that--as <a href="../../../r/u/c/User%7ERuchiraw_fe8e.html" title="User:Ruchiraw">Ruchiraw</a> said--the length and detail of this article (as well as Terrorist attacks carried out by LTTE) are due to a certain amount of pov (or personal involvement in the conflict) in most of the contributors; but I think that is not a problem because the facts are indisputable and no one is to decide what number of victims makes a single killing "encyclopedia-worthy". <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrankman_ac87.html" title="User:Krankman">Krankman</a> 17:59, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see your point too, but unless we come to an understanding of what is a notable human rights violations, what is a war crime, what are state terrorism, what are attempted genocides, what is ethnic cleaning with respect to both the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE, the combined article is going to huge. In my view if we restrict this list to State terrorism by Sri Lanka to mean the government then it requires 2 more entries and we are done, that is the Eastern university massacres in which the military arrested 158 refugees from the University and killed them and the Chemmani mass graves where supposedly 600 disappeared people from Jaffna were buried. Off all listed items here, most can be argued that the perpetrators assumed impunity and inmost cases did enjoy impunity. Per the definition of State terrorism a government can sanction State terrorism through policy or conduct. Granting impunity to perpetrators after perpetrators is pushing the limits of State terrorism. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">RaveenS</a></dd>
