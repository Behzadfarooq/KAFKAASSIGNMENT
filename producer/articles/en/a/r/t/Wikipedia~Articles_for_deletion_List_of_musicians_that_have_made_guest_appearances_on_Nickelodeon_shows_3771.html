<li><b>Keep</b> for now, on the basis that this list was suggested by several voters in the VfD <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> points to.

<ul>
<li>Just for the record, I don't think that a suggestion in a VfD should be accorded the same weight as the survival of a VfD. People will throw out suggestions that they might not even fully support on reflection. I'm a firm due process supporter, but, if voters like this list, it isn't too much to ask that they come here to vote for it, since this is the first time <i>this list</i> has been up for a decision. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 02:41, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. We've kept more pointless (IMHO, of course) lists. This compromise could be useful to people who are fans of both Nick and music, and can grow. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 00:52, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm leaning toward <b>keep</b> as well. While it's not likely to be viewed on its own, it certainly can make a good companion piece to the main Nickelodeon article and can be wikied accordingly. - Lucky 6.9 01:01, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I suggested at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_musicians_that_are_popular_amongst_Nickelodeon_fans_aa97.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of musicians that are popular amongst Nickelodeon fans">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of musicians that are popular amongst Nickelodeon fans</a> that this was a better list to have. We have similar lists, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_celebrities_on_the_Simpsons_641d.html" title="List of celebrities on the Simpsons">List of celebrities on the Simpsons</a>. Nickelodeon is a very prominent cable TV channel, and artists appearing on there usually get a good following from that channel's demographic (and the successful ones usually get started by appearing there, on the Disney Channel, and on similar kids' TV channels). So if we could take this list and expand it to include names from Nick's past history (which goes back to 1979) and the international versions of it, then that would certainly have encyclopedic value. (By the way, thanks to Uncle G for letting me know that this article was up for VfD.) --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 03:08, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not unsympathetic to that argument -- however, since the list has two entries now, how about renaming it List of celebrities who have made a guest appearance on Nickelodeon shows? Why just musicians, when there are only two as of now, and I distinctly recall seeing <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Cosby_9aa1.html" title="Bill Cosby">Bill Cosby</a>, for example, at the first Kid's Choice Awards in 1988? <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 05:39, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good point. I'd support that; it's in keeping with all of the "List of celebrities who have appeared on (some show, channel, or something like that)" lists. When the list gets big enough, it would be good to divide it (within the list, not create new articles) into musicians, actors, and so on. I think it's worth noting that Bill Cosby appeared on a Nickelodeon show. (Though I haven't looked at the related articles very much at all - are hosts of awards shows included on those, or just people who appear on the regular daily or weekly shows?) --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 06:23, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
