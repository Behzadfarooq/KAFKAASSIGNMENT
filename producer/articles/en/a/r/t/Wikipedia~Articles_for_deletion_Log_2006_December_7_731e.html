I made no claim that either a 'kovbasa' or a 'kielbasa' is a brand. A 'kielbasa,' however, in English, is different from generic sausages. It's not a matter of anything being twisted in America because the same is true in Ireland, and Britain, and in non-English speaking countries for that matter. 'Kielbasa,' in English, means a fatty smoked sausage that recalls the sausages that Polish immigrants once made.

<p><font face="Vivaldi">Koreatown is not a recognized or generally accepted neighborhood in Chicago. A stretch of Lawrence Avenue is known for its concentration of businesses that cater to Korean-Americans. As such, the city gave it the honorary street name of Seoul Drive. But the article also mentions the Korean Festival on Bryn Mawr Avenue, which is several blocks north of Lawrence. Some can consider this to be a "Koreatown". There is no definitive or recognized Koreatown in Chicago like there is in <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koreatown%2C_Manhattan_bfbd.html" title="Koreatown, Manhattan">Manhattan</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koreatown%2C_Los_Angeles%2C_California_9df2.html" title="Koreatown, Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>. Also, the content is not correct. Chicago may not have one of the world's largest Korean population outside Korea, if you include <a href="../../../z/a/i/Zainichi_Korean_4640.html" title="Zainichi Korean">Zainichi Koreans</a> in Japan. Besides, the article is supposed to be about a Koreatown, which does not refer to all Koreans scattered about in the large city of Chicago. Also the sentence about Naperville is not true. While (according to the 2000 census) Naperville has 1,141 Korean American residents (scattered about, not concentrated in one or two areas), that's just 0.9% of the population. One can argue with more authority that the northern suburbs has a bigger and more noticeable population, concentration, etc. Glenview, which is smaller, has 1,866 / 4.5% of the population, still not significant enough but more so than the example of Naperville. Besides, inclusion of these trivial nonsignificant tidbits further points to the fact that there really is no Koreatown in Chicago yet. The article should redirect to <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albany_Park%2C_Chicago_4b50.html" title="Albany Park, Chicago">Albany Park, Chicago</a>, which better explains the Korean community in Chicago, because that is the most commonly used and accepted name for the neighborhood a few may call "Koreatown". Though Lawrence Avenue (or Bryn Mawr Avenue to the north) may be a "Koreatown", it's not called <i>Koreatown</i>. The listing under <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koreatown.html" title="Koreatown">Koreatown</a> is sufficient. Someone once listed Arlington Heights, Illinois on a list in the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japantown.html" title="Japantown">Japantown</a> article. The only "Japantown" there is a Japanese shopping center (<a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsuwa_Marketplace_%28Chicago_Store%29_f606.html" title="Mitsuwa Marketplace (Chicago Store)">Mitsuwa Marketplace (Chicago Store)</a>). This is a similar example of mislabelling. Wizmo 00:56, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</font></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: The problems solved by MacGyver are the central aspect of the series and have given rise to pop-culture references and a linguistic expression. The collection of information is not indiscriminate, though it may also not be entirely complete. Sourcing is not a problem as the episodes themselves can be referenced in accordance with WP policy and not be considered OR. I do, however, suggest a cleanup/reformatting so as not to be so similar to an episode list.

<li><font face="Vivaldi"><font size="large"><b>Keep</b> This interesting article is more than plot summaries, as it focusses on the science and technology used in the tricks in each episode. A plot summary would pay more attention to motivations or the fate of the characters, which is prety much ignored in this article. Since they are sourced to the episode, they are not original research per se. If comments and observations about which are plausible or implausible are added and have no source other than the opinion of the editor, those bits of o.r. can be edited out. Some of the plausibility comments are sourced to independent third partiey sources such as Mythbusters, which is acceptable. There is no good reason why hundreds or thousands of other articles about books, plays, movies, TV shows, and video games can describe their content sourced only to the work and this article cannot. The point of the article is not to show that the McGyver character is clever, it is to cover the technology and science.

I'm a bit torn about this myself, being a big fan of the show. However, I'm concerned about the level of detail that the article is diving into. One could almost call it a derivative of the original show, and somewhat of a copyvio. Yes, I know, the chances of us getting sued over something like that is next to none, but not getting caught is no reason to leave the article as it is. I think if we change the list so that it is more of a list of examples, and/or notable problems solved, that would be an improvement. There's no reason to include every single problem solved by MacGyver, as that's a MAJOR part of the show. We shouldn't be working to recap such major elements point for point. We got some really good info here, but there is a problem when you try to include every little detail.

<p><font face="Vivaldi"><font size="large">On the contrary, it was a major topic of discussion among the American Founders, who emphasized the distinction between "militia" and "select militia" as conflicting concepts. Most of the partisan armed groups to which the term is so often applied today would have been considered "select militia" by the Founders, and clear examples of what they did not want for the United States. This would include, by the way, organizations such as the National Guard.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Vivaldi"><font size="large">To be historically and etymologically accurate, we should move much of the content from the "militia" entry to the "select militia" entry, leaving the latter to discuss only the original concept, which is now understood in Switzerland but is being misused almost everywhere else.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Vivaldi"><font size="large">The terms are terms of law, and while we can recognize contemporary departures from original, correct usage, the emphasis should always be on the legal meanings. Consider, for example, the effect of replacing the meanings of constitutional terms like "due process", "jury", "crime", "speech", "press", "probable cause", or "right" with some modern slang usage that has a quite different meaning. We have a responsibility to preserve the meanings of legal terms on which the integrity of government and law depend.</font></font></p>

<li><font face="Vivaldi"><font size="large"><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> What is you guys' problem with this entry existing? Some kind of bandwidth shortage? Why are you eager (and embittered it would seem, based on the tone of the above comments) to delete so many articles? Who are you people who give a crap so dang much, and what puts you in a position of any authority anyway? I quarrel with the motivation and the execution of the new Wikipedia deletion surge. If Wikipedia isn't a suitable place to record and explain these passing pop culture phenomena, then where is? This guy's clip has appeared on several national TV shows, many many many people saw it, his existence is a curiosity of a much higher magnitude than many other subjects who have somehow found their way into the hallowed halls of Wikipedialand. All this lingo of "salt" is nothing if not mean-spirited and elitist. To deny the public the right to write about this (or any subject) -ever-again- reeks of a betrayal of what this thing is supposed to be about - a democratic submission policy about collecting knowledge - in all its pros and cons messy splendor. That a Wikipedia cabal has been deputized to delete and ban the submission of certain subjects (and that anyone would applaud the act) seems to serve little purpose, and certainly not a democratic one.24.199.84.215 10:39, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</font></font>

I've read a bunch of these discussion pages, you folks don't address complaints or dissenting views, you just insult anyone who disagrees - as if these minor league barbs you throw manage to put all questions to rest. Friend - you aren't that clever or funny, sure as heck haven't changed my mind. The basics are still out there, awaiting a reasonable response - A) why do you think you're qualified to censor what info goes up on this thing, and B) even if you were qualified, what's the justification for bothering with this messy ugly process?<br />
<br />
If you want to have a constructive debate, please explain your argument further than stating it as if it were self evident. Beyond that - again - please explain why it's A) become such a priority to delete so much and so speedily, and B) where the checks and balances are in your deletion policy in order to guard against bias. There is a definite slippery slope to worry about here when you're relying on the odd birds who eat, sleep, and breathe Wikipedia to also be the arbiters of notoriety and relevance. Kindly explain why this collection of oddly motivated volunteers make up the ideal group to decide what is or isn't important information to share with the world. Seems pretty shoddy and arbitrary. More importantly of all - if the deletion process is so shoddy and arbitrary, and ripe for abuse and misuse, then wouldn't the drawbacks of instituting the policy outweigh the goals? 24.199.84.215 18:00, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</font></font></li>

My stub describes one of them who was a local axe murderer. Construing it as an attack upon a completely different person is irrational. Secondly, the murder and suicide took place in the 1970s so it's unsurprising that there are few or no internet sources. Newspaper clipping libraries, court records, and coroner's verdicts are the only likely source at present, but I don't have the time to search them at the moment. This is the case with many events from that era.

No implication whatsoever that it is a hoax or attack (I can't see how one could attack a living person by claiming they are a homosexual axe murderer who successfully committed suicide!). But to keep this stub is to invite others to stick in little hoaxes about historical figures. If you have a chance in the future to find the newspaper record of it, the article could be recreated. But Wikipedia is not a memorial, and it is not a police blotter covering every murder. The murder, trial and suicide might have achieved enough notoreity to justify an article, especially in a country less murder prone than some.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:24, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</font></font></li>

Big news concidering we might have one murder every 5-10 years? Anyway, it made it to a few big-name papers (small articles though), however the murderer and the event is non-notable...just like Geoffrey is.

I would disagree with the deletion of the article under this clause as it states <i>"Before deleting again, the admin should ensure that the material is substantially identical and not merely a new article on the same subject."</i> I believe this is to make sure it is only applied to deleted material simply being copied and pasted back into Wikipedia. I never saw the original article, nor was I aware that it had existed, so this would qualify as a new article on the same subject. I can't read the old article as it was deleted, so I can't comment on how similar the content is to this one. Looking at the discussion on the previous article, much of the trouble with the article was that it was considered to be badly written and referenced, and also there were people who wanted it deleted because they believe the plane wouldn't take off. For what it's worth I don't think it would take off either, but it's not a valid reason for asking for the article to be deleted.<a href="../../../d/-/a/User%7ED-Angle_4773.html" title="User:D-Angle">D-Angle</a> 21:17, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</font></font></li>

Numerous physics websites have covered it, and it has been a problem assignment in many college physics courses.

<li><font face="Vivaldi"><font size="large"><b>Weak keep</b>. There's no interesting physics here. If this topic is notable at all, it's only as an example of the tendency of people to express firm convictions about subjects that they don't understand. But I could point you to a dozen debates on Usenet just as long as this one, with just as little meaningful content; I don't see what's so special about this one (unless you count its being mentioned in The Straight Dope). I do think Wikipedia should have an article on this general phenomenon, of which the airplane debate would be a good example. (For some reason I want to call it "false expert syndrome", but that has no Wikipedia article and hardly any Web or Usenet hits, so I'm not sure where I got it from. Oh well, I'm no expert on this subject.) So why the keep? Well, Wikipedia has some surprisingly well-written and educational articles about other stupid debates, like <a href="../../../0/2E/9/0.999....html" title="0.999...">0.999...</a>, and I can imagine this article becoming an equally good excuse to teach some interesting physics.

<li><font face="Vivaldi"><font size="large">I think some of the comments on here are drifting into what I mentioned before, i.e. "I don't think the plane would take off, so delete delete delete." The article already says that the question polarises opinion, and at this rate we will be able to quote this page as a reference for that. The article isn't really about giving a definitive answer, but about the widespread debate over the question. If people want to give their reasons why the plane would take off or not there is a discussion page for the article. As for notability, a quick Google for "airplane conveyor belt" will show it is even more widespread than the references already quoted. If you don't think they are enough then add some more, there are plenty available. I appreciate where people are coming from, as a similar article has been deleted before, but I think differing opinons about the actual answer to the question colour the debate. Looking at the article again though, I think it could do with 2 sections for 'Arguments For' and 'Arguments Against.' There are several other articles on Internet memes on Wikipedia, and this one can cite its notability very well IMHO. <a href="../../../d/-/a/User%7ED-Angle_4773.html" title="User:D-Angle">D-Angle</a> 10:58, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</font></font></li>

<li><i>"This page contains more effort and contribution than the article we're debating."</i> That is exactly why nominating such an article for deletion is a really bad idea. First of all, the article was perhaps not ideally, but <i>sufficiently</i> sourced (just as the article on <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Walker_%28academic%29_153a.html" title="Alan Walker (academic)">Alan Walker (academic)</a> which you prodded). It was sourced with a link to a web page at the <a href="../../../m/c/m/McMaster_University_8276.html" title="McMaster University">McMaster University Library</a>. And finding more sources which verify the information is easy if you bother to look. (There is even an article in Grove on this Alan Walker, but, as has already been demonstrated, you don't need access to Grove to find additional verification.) Secondly, by wasting your own and other people's time and energy on debating this article you are in effect diverting attention from useful tasks, such as expanding this article or finding and discussing those <i>other</i> articles which we <i>do</i> need to get rid off. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Upp◦land</a> 05:06, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The fact that it has already been demonstrated that this person meets verfiability and notability requirements already shows that the article should not and will not be deleted. Just because the article needs work and needs expansion does NOT mean that it should be up for deletion; that's not what AfD is for and it really is nothing more than a disruption in order to make a point, which can get you banned. This looks more and more like a bad faith nomination... --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 18:15, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The AfD debate is not a trial for the nominator. Everytime an AfD debate results in <b>keep</b> it does not imply the nominator should be banned anymore than every unamious result for delete should result in the editor to be banned. Through this process many improvements have been made to the article. Please remember, <a href="../../../v/_/_/Wp%7Ev.html" title="Wp:v">Verifiability</a> supercedes subject notability. If an article is not verifiable, it should be deleted. However, in this case, the article was greatly improved and therefore I now agree that it should be kept. It is, in fact, bad faith to assume a participant in an AfD debate with a viewpoint contrary to your own is not acting in good faith. Deletion is a reality of this project and I hope you will keep an open mind to contrary view points in the future.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 18:09, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Dhartung, I keep repeating myself, you keep making the same assertions. I started the AfD because the article was not well sourced or verifiable. This is a basis for deletion if the subject is notable or not. Once again, I tell you, there is a difference between a notable person and an article about them. You assert the man is notable, now the article proves this to be true. When the process started, I believed it did not. You will also note that the speedy deletion criteria does not apply because the article asserts notability. I never tagged the article with speedy deletion. Prod and AfD are the avenues for editors who believe the asserted notability is not verifiable. I appreciate the debate we've had here, let's not close it on a bad note.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 18:24, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fine, fair enough. Tell me why it is that nominators almost never say, "OK, I'm open-minded, that sounds promising, can you find more sources?" Once in a blue moon, perhaps. Usually they say, "Nope, not good enough, work your butt for this article if you expect it to be saved, I will not be moved by your puny NYT citation." I like to "save" articles from the axe <i>when I can see that they deserve it</i>, but I run into this stonewall attitude all the time. Sometimes I think the thing to do is just ignore the entire frickin' AFD debate and silently improve the article, but I've done that too and "lost" because I didn't add my voice to change the consensus. I would dearly love this to be less adversarial. What are your suggestions? --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 10:13, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>I continue to feel that those who want to delete it should simply add the reviews instead. It should not be necessary to defend such a work as this. The argument that a NYT review alone is not enough is wrong in any case, because it shows an inability to judge the weight of sources. all newspapers and the reviewers are not equal. When its a question of having one review from a very non-notable paper, we'd be justified in asking for another (at least). <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 01:38, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

If given some time I would be able to dig up the necessary sources or request undeletion. The mere fact that I have located independant translations of the newsletter, leads me to believe that the information is truly out there.

That is already in the article but it was an argument successfully used for another AFD in which the only way to verify its notability was via the site of a movie director, before which there was no way to verify the notability of the particular item.

Therefore further verifying its notability as far as in the minds of its intended audience, wrestling fans. To further this point other Columnists in the wrestling community read the reviews as well as post on the site.

<li><b>Comment</b> A quick search for Death Valley Driver puts the review site as the number one item on the list, even above any reference to the wrestling move bearing the same name. According to Alexa <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=deathvalleydriver.com" class="external text" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=deathvalleydriver.com" rel="nofollow">right here</a> It has several thousand page views. I know that google and Alexa tests are not the be all end all but it is comparable to other sites with defined Notability. My main problem with the nomination is that from the time that it was first happened upon to when it was nominated was very quick. Not to mention the request to clarify which statements needed sourcing. As of this posting I am at work and cannot really acess many of the sites that would have the information you are looking for. <a href="../../../n/e/g/User%7ENegroSuave_0441.html" title="User:NegroSuave">NegroSuave</a> 21:52, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The only unique Google hits appear to be the website and this Wikipedia article. Any uniquely named website will show up as the first item on a search.
<ul>
<li>Death Valley Driver is also the name of a wrestling move that has been used in Professional wrestling for well over a decade. It is listed as part of the list of wrestling moves in the encylopedia. As for unique non website hits there are several that are listed as the Review is linked to several sites dedicated to professional wrestling gossip and insider news.

<li>If there are multiple reliable sources that cover this wrestling move non-trivially, then a separate article on it could be created, but that is not what the above article is about. (Also, the sources you mention do not meet that standard.) —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 17:46, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I think due to the nature of the wrestling business it is hard to discern what is fact and what is fiction leading to difficulties in getting verifiable sources. That being said being recognized by the NWA as a source for match reviews and the like, I believe that is about as good as we are going to get. I can attempt to pull up the archive.org of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Storm_c3c4.html" title="Lance Storm">Lance Storm</a>'s website where his column appears. Outside of that seeing as the fanzine would only appear as a wrestling interest item, which is already in and of it self a niche group that doesn't have the mainstream appeal of many other types of entertainment. With my shaky sources I have pulled together an entire grouping of people who are indeed interested in this newsletter and have trusted its opinions. I am not really an editor of this article, I've only done a few reverts here and there since I am not familiar with the actual newsletter and such. All I can offer is google searches. However I do think this AFD is lacking influence from the editors of Pro Wrestling Articles, that have a better grasp of the nuances of the newsletter and could probably speak on it better than I can. <a href="../../../n/e/g/User%7ENegroSuave_0441.html" title="User:NegroSuave">NegroSuave</a> 18:50, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm going to abstain from listing an outright 'keep' or 'delete' for this because I live in Milwaukee and might be a bit too close to the events to be neutral, but there are serious outstanding controversies about the explosion that ensure it's not going to be out of the headlines anytime soon, and it has already cleared WP:N with room to spare given news articles in the Chicago Tribune and Journal-Sentinal at least already, the day after. Furthermore I don't think the article is doomed to stubiness, there remain serious issues outstanding. I also think it's premature to AfD an ongoing event the day after the article was made and the event itself happened on the grounds of article quality and notability, sources will exist, but they may not exist yet the day after a major (literally ground-shaking, I felt the blast more than 20 miles away) event. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 22:46, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> I think this article has merit from an emergency management perspective, especially if information regarding possible mitigation or preparedness steps (possibly controversial discussion) are included. I would change the name to be more specific, perhaps including the Fauk name. It definitely needs to be kept current, though. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParradoxx_b2fe.html" title="User:Parradoxx">Parradoxx</a> 19:23, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I went by the explosion about five minutes after it happened on a coach bus, and I can say with no question that it was the biggest fire I have ever seen. It was enormous. The event made national news and was mentioned several times on Fox News Channel as well as hours and hours on Milwaukee TV. I made an article on the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falk_Corporation_6ec2.html" title="Falk Corporation">Falk Corporation</a> the next day and included some of the info about the fire. The story is still being investigated, it's rather interesting because six of the people said there was no formal evacuation. I might have a picture of the fire, someone on the bus had a digital camera took a picture (I could only manage getting one on my phone). I believe this story is notable enough. Just think about it; a 10,000 gallon propane tank. I guess I'll clean it up a little bit. I just hope I can get that picture.++<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAviper2k7_0275.html" title="User:Aviper2k7"><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">aviper2k7</span></a>++ 21:03, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Because this is totally an equal argument. THOUSANDS of people have been on the price is right, none with disguingishable personalities or even memorable names half the time.

<li><b>Comment</b> TrekMUSE claims to have hosted two interviews with members of the original series' cast (Shatner and Nimoy on both occasions, with DeForest Kelley joining them on one). If this is true, it's clearly notable; not many online games draw that kind of attention from their inspirations. The problem is sourcing. The only source I can find that seems likely, aside from directly contacting an actor's publicist or something along those lines, is <i>Net Trek: Your Guide to Trek Life in Cyberspace</i> by Kelly Maloni, Ben Greenman, Kristin Miller, and Jeff Hearn. Published in '95, which is when those interviews occurred, by Random House. I am ill and unlikely to get to a library to check before this AfD expires, but the ISBN is 0679761861, if anyone would like to try. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 04:31, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

Based on the lack of secondary-source evidence I was able to find (it got some trivial mentions in sources about muds, that's about it), I would tend to <b>delete</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b> - It is very biased and it is a term that an anti lebanese pro syrian writer started, it is very insulting for a lot of lebanese, it promotes sectarianism , very bad decision Wikipedia 14:14, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Considering the source of this definition, I do not think it deserves any attention as it comes from the Alakhbar newspaper. I guess those who know what is the political inclination of Alakhbar will know that it is far from truth. Moreover, regardless of whether Ahmed Fatfat is doing a good job or not, I do not think anyone else in Lebanon is doing a better job!!! That might seem very sad, but if this term is to included in wikipedia then I suggest the inclusion of some other terms like Nasrallatism. A brief definition of Nasrallahtism is as follows: An ideology equivalent to that of the Nazists. A one minded ideology which believes in mere destruction and which gives no regard to human life. An ideology which only works in ignorant societies, and which grows stronger and stronger through the brain-washing of its supporters. An ideology which puts Nasrallah himself on a godly level, whereas in fact he is just such a fascist which wants political power. There is still more to say, but I would leave it to others to add more. Wikipedia please consider my suggestion. Thank you</li>

<li><b>Compromise</b> Would it be an acceptable compromise if the term is kept on Wikipedia, but the reference to politicians removed? it is a fact that the term now exists and has a definition that could be used universally.

<li><b>Delete</b> - While babysitting this article today, I got a chance to really look at it; try again in a few months or a year and have references from then.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> - it is a new concept introduced in a very original way, with real world examples.

Maybe Ahmad Fatfat is doing a great job, maybe not; maybe this neologism is an insightful satire of Fatfat's ideology, maybe it's a sick joke. <i>All that is completely irrelevant to this discussion!</i> The aim of the debate here is to establish whether or not the concept of "Fatfatism" is sufficiently notable and widespread to deserve an article - not to discuss its merits. <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkarioffszky_c8b8.html" title="User:Skarioffszky">Skarioffszky</a> 17:22, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Finally, after decades without a word that describes the political trend and ideology of many arab leaders, "fatfatism" is here to help&#160;:)<br />
I am not going to discuss Ahmad Fatfat. But to answer some earlier comments:<br />
- The term "fatfatism" was not started by an "anti-lebanese pro-syrian writer", but by a Lebanese Professor at Berkley!<br />
- Fatfatism does <b>not</b> insult Lebanese or promote secterianism. Fatfatism is merely a term that described a certain attitude in politics followed by many arab leaders (it neither attacks Lebanese nor certain sects).<br />
- As for the reliability of the Al-Akhbar newspaper, this newspaper only mentioned what As'as Abu Khalil defined as Fatfatism. (Also, the newspaper has proved to be reliable by always providing proofs. Check today's paper for an example - 07/12/06.)<br />
One thing is true, the term is very recent, and not much references are available <i>yet</i>. <b>But</b> the term is spreading like fire! It is widespread now in Lebanon, and mentioned in several news outlets. And it is the only term that describes these specific political traits and ideology. There is a huge need for the term fatfatism, which actually explains why it's spreading quickly&#160;:) --129.215.212.170 18:13, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think Mecu's reading of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> subtly distorts the intended meaning of the guideline. The complete sentence is: "Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_sports.html" title="Amateur sports">amateur sports</a> or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States." I think that the intention of this is to allow athletes who play amateur sports, who nevertheless compete at the highest level, to have articles. Basketball is not, from a <i>notability</i> point of view, a mainly amateur sport in the world today. I would argue that notable contemporary basketball players are the people who play the game professionally, and that's the way the guideline was written. Let Gray play a professional game, and then write the article. If he never goes on to put on an NBA uniform, there needs to be more notability than what is shown here. There are far too many college basketball players to give each one his/her own article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTAL" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 02:52, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think I've distorted anything. I believe you have added additional meaning that isn't in the face of the policy. To say <i>amateur athletes except when there is a professional league</i> isn't in the policy. You are extrapolating meaning and guessing the <i>intended</i> meaning, when it's written plainly that a college athlete in the USA that has played is notable and worthy of an article. I would put some caution on that since some players (ie, offensive linemen) aren't as famous as the other players, but a star center in basketball on the #2 ranked team in the nation certainly is. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=263400221" class="external text" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=263400221" rel="nofollow">This article</a> talks about Gray scoring 15 points in a <i>off</i> night. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 13:41, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think there is room for reasonable people to differ about this, but I think that the Delete votes are all pretty much arguing that he needs to be a pro to have an article, because he plays basketball, which is what I'm arguing. I don't feel like I'm adding any meaning to argue that basketball is not an amateur sport from a notability point of view. I think the standard of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is heavily slanted towards amateurs who compete in non-professional sports and away from amateurs competing in professional ones, and I don't think that's an extrapolation at all. Swimming ain't basketball. That said, I definitely think that this argument that his college record warrants inclusion is a lot stronger than the first argument you made that he is "considered an NBA draft prospect". <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 16:11, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -&#160;:<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew.hartington_fe7f.html" title="User:Matthew.hartington">User: Matthew.hartington</a>I don't accept your definition of Clouds not being 'notable'. If you read the sources I left at the foot of the page, you'd find all the sources and verification you need. A cursory glance at Amazon. com, both in the Uk and the Usa, will show you who Clouds were. If you checked the Clouds website (www.cloudsmusic.com) as I originally suggested, you'd find yet more articles and references, including the 4 page MOJO Magazine article about Clouds/1-2-3 which credited them with 'The Birth of Prog', and in which, David Bowie describles Billy Ritchie as 'an unrecognised genius'. 'The History of Scottish Rock &amp; Pop' is a BBC book (Guinness Publishing) - there seems ample source confirmation of everything said in the article. Unless the criteria is something completely different than I understand it to be, I don't see how the band can be dismissed as 'not notable'.

<li>My "herculean comment" wasn't entirely in jest. Even if this band were notable, which you've done nothing to convince anyone of, the article is not written in a form suitable for inclusion in this encyclopedia, either in terms of the selection of content, the tone, or even the basic formatting which every other article has. — <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamingspinach_395e.html" title="User:Flamingspinach">flamingspinach</a> | <a href="../../../f/l/a/User_talk%7EFlamingspinach_8436.html" title="User talk:Flamingspinach">(talk)</a> 12:13, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're probably right on suitable form etc - I only joined an hour ago, and I haven't taken in enough information to be able to satisfy the criteria you mention, definitely fair comment; but your early assertion about not convincing anyone is a bit more debatable - all the articles and facts are in the public domain, and can be easily verified, especially at the website address I've given. Then again, it could well be that I'm falling down on that part of the formatting too.........sorry for the (hopefully temporary!) mess.."<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew.hartington_fe7f.html" title="User:Matthew.hartington">Matthew.hartington</a> 12:21, 7 December 2006 (UTC)"</li>

<li>yes, but the band formed down the street didn't play at the Albert Hall or the Fillmore, nor did they make albums for 3 major labels. Clouds did. And their peers saw them as notable - Bowie, Dire Straits etc."86.136.14.186 15:53, 13 December 2006 (UTC)"</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - It's true what Debaser said earlier - I basically took the extract straight from the Clouds website, to be honest, I hadn't realised the significance of the encyclopedia. I had been browsing something entirely different, when I ran into two entries for bands called 'Clouds', none of which were the 60's band. The exclusion seemed unfair to me, the two included groups did not have the same impact on music history. I knew about the website because it's run by a friend of mine, and I thought I'd help - chaotically! I could write another article, but you all seem to be doing that very well without my interference! Many thanks - and despite any bias, I DO think the group is well worthy of inclusion - in fact, a properly-factual entry in Wikipedia ensures a better account of REAL history than music tabloid does. I agree about the article name too, but how best to change it? 'CLOUDS' on its own seems not distinctive enough for the particular subject. 'CLOUDS 60's'? Something to differentiate from the other (later) groups who used the same name.

<li><b>Comment</b> and <b>weak delete</b>. First of all, I notice that some, but not all, of the users favoring deletion are Muslims or somehow associated with Islam. (Note: I only mention this here because of the potential for a one-sided POV on the side of the deletion-favorers). That being said, so little has been said on the website, and so little defense of its notability has been done, that perhaps we should mention the website as being among the work of Islam's detractors or critics in the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Islam_00d9.html" title="Criticism of Islam">Criticism of Islam</a> articles for now, and create an article when there is more reason to believe in the site's notability. — <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickyrab_21c2.html" title="User:Rickyrab">Rickyrab</a> | <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickyrab_2fd1.html" title="User talk:Rickyrab">Talk</a> 16:50, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> not much citing of the web site from other sites though if someone can find some stuff I'm happy to help build up the article. That aside - I would protect their right to say what they want so if this site is used as a link in other articles then I would keep the links in place BUT the site itself need not yet have its own wikipedia article. I love how they "seek to demonstrate flaws of Islam using biblical arguments." Oh boy - that cracked me up, talk about the Blind leading the blind. Both the Bible and the Quran are more or less fictional works interweaving allegorically interpreted tales from earlier works with historical events and contemporaneous knowledge.

<p>Unverifiable claims. The fact that this article claims that "Kunjaan" is a well known hindu term, a google search for "kunjan hindu" currently returns 3 hits. Similarly, an amazon or google books search for this term returns 0 books. This leads me to believe that either the author of this article has misspelled the term, or this is some kind of neologism/hoax. Furthermore, the article uses names like "Siddharth Gautam", which is clearly some kind of parody of <a href="../../../s/i/d/Siddh%C4%81rtha_Gautama_1bbb.html" title="Siddhārtha Gautama">Siddhārtha Gautama</a>...

<li>This article is a horrible, jumbled mess with little useful, non-<a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a> content. The topic might be worth keeping with a drastic cleanup, but Christianity encompasses so many very different branches, each with varying degrees of institutionalized practices, that an overarching "Conversion to Christianity" article—that is properly inclusive and sourced—may be a pipe dream. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conversion_to_Judaism_06dd.html" title="Conversion to Judaism">Conversion to Judaism</a>, on the other hand, looks like a decent, well-sourced article; <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conversion_to_Islam_3934.html" title="Conversion to Islam">Conversion to Islam</a> simply redirects to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_conversion.html" title="Religious conversion">Religious conversion</a>; other religions don't appear to have such articles. The best solution, for now, may be a <b>Redirect to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_conversion.html" title="Religious conversion">Religious conversion</a></b> with the hope that a few enterprising editors will use <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conversion_to_Judaism_06dd.html" title="Conversion to Judaism">Conversion to Judaism</a> as a template for the creation of a <i>real</i> article. -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 02:49, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed - <b>redirect</b> to Religious conversion, with the right to recreate a Christian-specific article with no prejudice if they come up with enough well-sourced material. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 12:21, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Seems extremely biased to allow an article on conversion to Judaism but lump together all other religions conversions into one article, even though they have virtually nothing in common. The result would be an article with sections which have no connection to each other. This article was started a few months ago and examination of the development shows gradual expansion and improvement until some POV material was added around the end of last month. There is great commonality in the conversion process to many Christian denominations, with major break between the traditional liturgical ones (Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Episcopal, a few others) and the "evangelical" born-again religions. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:52, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> As in Quack's statement, I've no prejudice against a future recreation of a relevant article...indeed, I think topic has sufficient merit and I would welcome a properly-sourced article. The current article, however, is awful in terms of meeting Wikipedia policies (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, &amp; <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>) and simply lacking in quality prose. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_to_Christianity&amp;oldid=77239269" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_to_Christianity&amp;oldid=77239269" rel="nofollow">September 22 version</a> is the last NPOV version and had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_to_Christianity&amp;diff=77239269&amp;oldid=48986045" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conversion_to_Christianity&amp;diff=77239269&amp;oldid=48986045" rel="nofollow">very few</a> relevant improvements for the 5 months of its existence. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conversion_to_Christianity_5061.html" title="Conversion to Christianity">Conversion to Christianity</a> shouldn't be left as-is, and the last good version is practically empty. Therefore, a redirect to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_conversion.html" title="Religious conversion">Religious conversion</a>, which contains far more balanced, sourced, &amp; relevant information than this article, seems like a good (temporary) measure. Perhaps the editors that frequent Christianity-related pages could be enlisted to work on a proper article (at, say Conversion to Christianity/draft until some semblance of a complete, sourced work is created)? I'll broach the topic on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Talk%7EChristianity_8d07.html" title="Talk:Christianity">Talk:Christianity</a> and see what I can scare up. -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 20:57, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Again, and not necessarily in respect to this entry, most local newspapers and news-station in the UK don't have the online archives that US papers do, and because there are fewer of them to begin with the odds of finding one with the information that you want online are lower too. Equally, UK societies, groups and museums etc tend to be more local and online less than US ones (partly because they don't need to attract tourists etc from so far away). The UK isn't backwards by any means, it's just less online than the US and smaller than the US so US standards are not always appropriate (this counts much more for other countries, which are online far less than the US and UK, or which produce English language sites as an afterthought to their sites in their own languages). <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerfectblue97_ef11.html" title="User:Perfectblue97">perfectblue</a> 18:20, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Computer science guys have versions of this, with lots of different NaN's. I am certain I heard of the thing in grade school, but don't know what name it was given then.

(Just in case its not obvious why Φ is star, refer to Conway's book, wherein division is defined through an axiomatic system for numbers and games, and zero divided by zero is indeterminate, its star. Among other things, you'll find a proof that star is greater than -1 but less than +1 and is incomparable to everything in between. I would prefer that such concepts be treated in terms of the sound, well-developed, commonly accepted axiomatic footing, rather than invented from scratch, on a whim).

<li>Can someone please explain what is wrong with "nullity"? If this is major front page news, maybe it is notable, and maybe it should have an article? I'll admit, I came here because I read the BBC article, which didn't do a good job of explaining nullity, so I came to Wikipedia to find out more, and just found this. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 19:56, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: what’s wrong with nullity is exactly what’s wrong with mainstream news sources dealing with science: they usually hardly know anything about what’s at stake. Until a panel of specialists have peer reviewed the new theory/tool/proof/etc., Wikipedia should not talk about it (we can however talk about the buzz going around it). I understand it’s nice to come to Wikipedia and find an analysis of that “new” tool, but as of now it’s original research. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Hocevar_dccf.html" title="User:Sam Hocevar">Sam Hocevar</a> 20:03, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Unless there are other unlinked sources, this doesn't seem likely to be "major front page news". Although the BBC can carry a lot of weight, the linked article in this case is a minor <i>local</i> news story (in fact it's not even branded as "news", but "people"), and is more about the reactions of the kids at a local school than the shattering importance of the theory. --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcGeddon_9720.html" title="User:McGeddon">McGeddon</a> 20:48, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. The basic problem in my opinion is that it's impossible to write an article about this that is both neutral and no original research. The concept is not discussed in the mathematical literature and I doubt it ever will, which means that we can't offer arguments against the theory, or say that it's basically the same as NaN's (if it is). However, if we have an article we must make it clear that the concept is rejected by mathematicians.<br />
The SPIE Proceedings have minimal review: the <a href="http://electronicimaging.org/call/07/Ei07_call.pdf" class="external text" title="http://electronicimaging.org/call/07/Ei07_call.pdf" rel="nofollow">Call for Papers</a> states "To ensure a high-quality conference, all abstracts and Proceedings manuscripts will be reviewed by the Conference Chair/Editor for technical merit and suitability of content.", which I take to mean that the Chair/Editor may refuse submissions that are obviously unsuitable, but that no rigorous peer review takes places. Furthermore, SPIE is the International Society for Optical Engineering, which is perhaps not the most proper body to review novel mathematical theories.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b>. There seem to be a lot of 'keep' comments based on "we should cover this debate", "this will make it into a peer-reviewed journal", etc... As it stands now, there is no peer-reviewed debate about this subject. In fact, it is highly unlikely that any mathematician will respond to this in a serious manner. At the very most, Notices will write about "Nullity" as an example of mathematical reporting gone horribly wrong. Nullity is not mathematically profound, innovative, interesting, or noteworthy. Some of the claims about "nullity" border on mathematical nonsense. He's simply added a disconnected point to the extended real line, claimed that being able to divide by zero is more important than the topological properties this breaks, made a bizarre argument about why it's a field, and then made some grandiose claims about the importance of this "discovery". As for any serious "division by zero" research, we already have <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_by_zero.html" title="Division by zero">Division by zero</a>.

<dd>This paper introduces perspex algebra which is being developed as a common representation of geometrical knowledge. A perspex can currently be interpreted in one of four ways. First, the algebraic perspex is a generalization of matrices, it provides the most general representation for all of the interpretations of a perspex. The algebraic perspex can be used to describe arbitrary sets of coordinates. The remaining three interpretations of the perspex are all related to square matrices and operate in a Euclidean model of projective space-time, called perspex space. Perspex space differs from the usual Euclidean model of projective space in that it contains the point at nullity. It is argued that the point at nullity is necessary for a consistent account of perspective in top-down vision. Second, the geometric perspex is a simplex in perspex space. It can be used as a primitive building block for shapes, or as a way of recording landmarks on shapes. Third, the transformational perspex describes linear transformations in perspex space that provide the affine and perspective transformations in space-time. It can be used to match a prototype shape to an image, even in so called 'accidental' views where the depth of an object disappears from view, or an object stays in the same place across time. Fourth, the parametric perspex describes the geometric and transformational perspexes in terms of parameters that are related to everyday English descriptions. The parametric perspex can be used to obtain both continuous and categorical perception of objects. The paper ends with a discussion of issues related to using a perspex to describe logic.</dd>

(2) Look, I proved it inconsistent. (3) No, actually it is consistent after all.

<li>The problem is that there are no reliable sources that assert that it is nonsense. <i>Only Daniel Firth</i> has actually tried to address this properly, and xe hasn't finished yet. Most of the discussion is by pseudonymous people, who cannot be traced, writing on web logs, and a lot of that discussion is, moreover, <i>wrong</i>. (One pseudonymous web log posting that I read this morning tried to prove the system faulty by asserting that in the transreals it could be proven that <span class="texhtml">1 = Φ</span>. The proof was flawed, since it involved cancelling <span class="texhtml">0</span> with <span class="texhtml">0 <sup>− 1</sup></span> to yield <span class="texhtml">1</span>, something which the transreal axioms don't allow.) The fact that pseudonymous postings on web logs <i>clearly</i> haven't been fact checked or peer reviewed is why they are unacceptable sources.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'd usually say this is clearly project-namespace material, but one look at mainstream media says Wikipedia is frequently loved... and <i>hated</i>. Wikipedia praising and bashing have been clearly shown to be good hobbies for prominent public figures. And no matter the topic, the negative critique is <i>always</i> louder. The present arrangement is adequate. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 14:14, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> - To <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. The article inherently takes the view of negativity. Praise of Wikipedia is equally troublesome. For every article that has enough information on it, should we just create two separate articles? Good things about the subject and Bad things about the subject? I am in favor of criticism being fully integrated into articles, even preferably not even in its own "Criticisms" section. These "Criticism of..." articles are like roping off a section of the Wikipedia article space where NPOV doesn't apply. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 19:58, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a valid theory about Hypercomputation. The fact that it isn't all that well written about and tested (which is hard to do with super turing computation) doesn't invalidate the theory.

<li><b>Comment</b>. ISI Web of Knowledge reports this paper has been cited zero times. Google scholar reports three citations -- two are from the author. "Perspex machine" doesn't seem to give results on any relevant database (aside from Anderson's stuff). Even the arXiv fails to give results. I also wonder why this paper was published in the <i>biological</i> division of Philosophical Transactions. Seeing as how the paper was published in 1997, there has been ample time to drum up attention.

<dd>This paper introduces perspex algebra which is being developed as a common representation of geometrical knowledge. A perspex can currently be interpreted in one of four ways. First, the algebraic perspex is a generalization of matrices, it provides the most general representation for all of the interpretations of a perspex. The algebraic perspex can be used to describe arbitrary sets of coordinates. The remaining three interpretations of the perspex are all related to square matrices and operate in a Euclidean model of projective space-time, called perspex space. Perspex space differs from the usual Euclidean model of projective space in that it contains the point at nullity. It is argued that the point at nullity is necessary for a consistent account of perspective in top-down vision. Second, the geometric perspex is a simplex in perspex space. It can be used as a primitive building block for shapes, or as a way of recording landmarks on shapes. Third, the transformational perspex describes linear transformations in perspex space that provide the affine and perspective transformations in space-time. It can be used to match a prototype shape to an image, even in so called 'accidental' views where the depth of an object disappears from view, or an object stays in the same place across time. Fourth, the parametric perspex describes the geometric and transformational perspexes in terms of parameters that are related to everyday English descriptions. The parametric perspex can be used to obtain both continuous and categorical perception of objects. The paper ends with a discussion of issues related to using a perspex to describe logic.</dd>

<li><b>Statement</b> I am the James Anderson who developed the perspex machine and transreal arithmetic. I will make a short personal statement and then give some verifiable facts.
<p>Statement: I did not initiate, nor induce anyone to initiate, any article currently on Wikipedia. My talk page shows that I initiated an article to explain more about transreal numbers, but this was deleted because it was deemed to be a neologism. I have no view on whether or not the articles describing me or my research should be kept. I regard that as a matter for the Wikipedia community, which initiated these articles, to decide.</p>
<p>Facts: My B.Sc. is in Experimental Psychology from Sussex University, England, and was awarded in 1980. My Ph.D. is from Reading University, England. The title of my Ph.D., awarded in 1992, is “Canonical Description of the Perspective Transformations.” All of my scientific papers were peer reviewed. Recent controversy sprang from an open day I attended at Highdown School, Berkshire. My talk was reported on BBC Radio Berkshire, BBC South Today (regional TV news), and BBC News 24 (Satellite TV). BBC Radio Berkshire is to allow me to reply to my critics on a radio show. The BBC intends to invite a professional mathematician to assist the radio presenter. I have forwarded to the BBC my papers showing how transreal arithmetic is performed as operations on fractions and axiomatically, as well as how transreal arithmetic extends to analysis. There are more papers on my personal web site that could be used to bolster claims in the various articles relating to me and my work.</p>
<p>The perspex machine and transreal arithmetic has been simulated in software which is available on my personal web site. A version of the perspex machine has been implemented in FPGA. All of these versions implement digital and, therefore, Turing computable approximations to the machine and the arithmetic.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transreal_number.html" title="Transreal number">Transreal number</a> article contains a number of historical inaccuracies and misinterpretations of my work, but is very much better informed than most commentary I have seen. If the article is kept I could contribute corrections to its talk page or direct to the article. Given the controversy this has provoked I am inclined to contribute to the talk page if the article is kept. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_A.D.W._Anderson_1ba3.html" title="User:James A.D.W.

<li><b>Comment</b> to James Anderson. I appreciate your willingness to abide by Wikipedia policy and guidelines in not creating articles about yourself or your work, and suggesting that you will make suggestions on the talk pages. However, I don't see how a publication with over 6000 <i>volumes</i> can be peer-reviewed, nor do I believe that conference proceedings are usually peer-reviewed as to the importance of the subject, but only (at most) as to technical correctness. (Conference proceedings of math conferences, at least the ones <i>I've</i> participated in, are <i>not</i> peer-reviewed, but only copyedited. I'm being generous in assuming they're reviewed for technical correctness.) In other words, if I <i>renamed</i> an obscure mathematical concept, and popularized it in computer science conferences and conference proceedings, I have no doubt the publication would be accepted. I'm not saying you've done that, but it certainly looks as if <i>nullity</i> and <i>transreal</i> are existing mathematical and computational concepts. I'm beginning to think that <i>this</i> article may be a keeper, after cleanup, but I believe we'd need more information, which you might be able to provide. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 15:23, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Reviewing procedures are adapted to the circumstances of each field of scientific enquiry. Mathematics, which is a very mature subject, is notable for its very strong reviewing of journals which are, often, focused on very specific parts of mathematics. Mathematics conferences, by contrast, are well known for the low threshold of reviewing many of them adopt -- as you acknowledge. This suits the mathematics community. Conferences operate as workshops where new ideas can be aired and discussed with peers before too much effort is invested in formal development. Computer Science, by contrast, is a young and rapidly developing area of science. Journals have, traditionally, had lead times that would inhibit technological progress. Computer Science deals with this by having a range of conferences with varying degrees of peer review. The strongest of these, such as the three, blind, reviews used by ECAI, adopt levels of review comparable with the better journals. ECAI has published my work on the perspex machine. The point at issue, I would have thought, is that the perspex machine (and transreal arithmetic) have been subjected to the level of review appropriate to the scientific field, Computer Science, in which they are published.
<p>The work on transreal arithmetic, of which nullity forms a part, has been proved consistent by machine proof. This work was undertaken by an independent researcher at a different university from my own. And the machine proof has been examined at a third university. All agree that transreal arithmetic is consistent and contains real arithmetic as a proper subset.</p>
<p>All of my scientific papers are available in paper form from the relevant copyright libraries and, in many cases, from the electronic databases of the publishing organisations. The papers that are on my web site are only a subset of the papers I have written – specifically, the subset for which I have copyright permission to reproduce. The copyright policies of many journals prevent self publication so the papers that appear on an author’s web site are necessarily skewed. This bias may disappear as electronic publishing takes hold -- but it is a bias that Wikipedians may profitably be aware of.</p>
<p>In my, self-interested, view, my papers have been reviewed to the appropriate standards for my subject area. If you accept this, then the relevant test to apply is whether the material is sufficiently noteworthy, or sufficiently well accepted in society at large, to appear in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Wikepedians are, I am sure, familiar with the concept of flaming. Since the recent publicity surrounding my work I have been flamed in a number of electronic fora. But I have now received a handful of apologies from people after they have read my papers on transreal arithmetic. None of the hundred or so counter-proofs I have seen to my work are valid, except one, which exposed an error in the guarding clause of equation ten in the analysis paper. This error does not affect the validity of any of the material publicised in the media. Indeed, before making the public presentation, I had obtained a second proof of the 0^0 result using the transreal exponential and logarithm: 0^0 = e^(ln 0^0) = e^(0 ln 0) = e^(0 * -infinity) = e^nullity = nullity.) I invite you to consider whether this is consistent with your (informal) view of the exponential function at these extremes, and then reflect on whether it is valuable to have a total and consistent arithmetic. As a computer scientist I can tell you, for example, that a total and consistent arithmetic guarantees that all functions are differentiable, though I, personally, cannot find many of the differentials. But I can, for example, find the first differential of tan(theta) at theta = pi/2 using nothing more than the gradient formula and transreal arithmetic, along with knowledge of which order to compute end points in. Which I can easily obtain by examining the function in the neighbourhood of pi/2. (The gradient is –infinity.) I can also evaluate tan(pi/2) and obtain its unique numerical value at this point. (Nullity.) Thus, my total and consistent arithmetic supplies results where standard mathematics struggles or fails completely. I believe this work has now reached the level of maturity where it can, and should, be published in mathematical journals, and I will take steps to do so.</p>
<p>On the issue of the size of the SPIE conferences, you will note that in a conference the number of peers is equal to the number of conference attendees. Of course, one wants academic peer review of scientific papers, but even here the number of academic peers is quite plausibly a constant factor of the number of attendees. Consider this case: in a conference of one million mathematicians each mathematician reviews three anonymised papers, other than his or her own. Three blind reviews have then been obtained for every mathematician at the conference. And this result would be the same in a conference of one billion or one trillion mathematicians. When it comes to peer review, size does not matter. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_A.D.W._Anderson_1ba3.html" title="User:James A.D.W. Anderson">James A.D.W.

<li>In claims of a mathematical concept, the relevant peer-review is that used in mathematics, which your papers have not been subject to. (And blind randomized peer reviews can fail miserably, even in the field of computer vision, as, if the reviewer does not understand the paper, he cannot say it's wrong.) This article <i>might</i> be allowable provided it makes no reference to mathematical concepts or concepts claimed to be mathematical. If that were the case, I'm not sufficiently familar with the peer-review concept as applied in CS to be sure the article fails Wikipedia requirements.

In any case, the overwhelming majority of the public discussion is by <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">unreliable sources</a> (e.g. people posting on web logs under pseudonyms).</p>
<p>To make a case for treating this like Intelligent Design, you need to cite as many good sources as can be found in <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html#Notes_and_references" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design#Notes_and_references</a>. Intelligent Design even has <i>books</i> that address the subject, you'll notice. You haven't cited any sources at all to demonstrate that your suggestion is workable. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:07, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this pretty much embodies what Wikipedia is not. It's a mere list of statistics, with no source, which has been linked to almost all of the soap opera articles.

<li>STRONG KEEP: Ratings History on the vast majority of pages are terribly vague that one does NOT get an accurate view of how a particular show(s) performed/perform. The Daytime TV ratings page should NOT be deleted. It provides necessary info on shows that are watched by about 30 million DAILY. If and when this page is deleted (which I hope does NOT happen), then the RATINGS HISTORY pages on ALL daytime dramas MUST be edited to give a more accurate &amp; honest view on their ratings performances.

<dd>I think you're missing it. We need to see actual sources from Nielsen Media. Saying Nielsen did it is not enough. How can we verify it if there's nothing for us to match it to?

<li><b>Delete</b>. I noticed this a while ago, and thought to myself that this page was quite unnecessary. Although I suppose that it's nice to have all the ratings on one page, it's not exactly a Wikipedia page. It's also sourceless. The information would be better used on each individual show's page; although it creates more work, it's better and more encyclopedic (and probably cleaner) to have it that way. <a href="../../../s/k/s/User%7ESKS2K6_b393.html" title="User:SKS2K6">SKS2K6</a> 23:18, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

More to the point though, it is a discussion which belongs in a blog or on someone's website, not on Wikipedia.

<li>I can reassure you that editors have contributed to both opposing sections. There is no POV. No anti-Tolkienians here, nor Tolkienian apologists <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPictureuploader_dff5.html" title="User:Pictureuploader">Pictureuploader</a> 09:59, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Either way - the article's existence seems to be irellavent - there are many definative quotes of Tolkien's stance on racism - all of which show that he disagreed with it completely. The only "evidence" is speculation drawn from a book whose author expressly tells people not to take it allegorically. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: Black;">michael</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">Curtis</span> <small style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><sup><a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelrccurtis_4797.html" title="User talk:Michaelrccurtis">talk</a></sup>+ <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Michaelrccurtis_b45c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Michaelrccurtis">contributions</a></sub></small> 12:41, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Entire scope of article is projecting PC hermeneutics on author's intent and alleged beliefs.

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b> - Yeah, so it reads like a research paper tailored for people who know the work. So it needs to have many more sources cited and less biased language. But this article definitely serves a purpose by addressing a very hotly-debated issue in LOTR scholarship. Wikipedia would be incomplete without this article, if you ask me. This is an issue that deserves a wiki about it, and just because the person who started it wasn't some Wikipedia veteran doesn't mean that it's garbage that should be deleted. "Unredeemably POV and unencyclopedic" is a stretch - the organization is shitty but they have sources to back up a good bit of their claims - that source being the book and Tolkien themselves - and if it's unencyclopedic...well, this is a wiki. I'm guessing that a lot of encyclopedia writers are probably off somewhere writing encyclopedias and not worrying about entries for Wikipedia. This is risk associated with user-edited sites. The author provides several quotes directly from the book (both the text and the introductions) and there are also 2 sources listed, and at least that's a start. I urge someone to clean the article up instead of deleting it, because it needs to be here. It's a very valid criticism of Tolkien's work. There also seems to be a line of debate concerning what some see as people "projecting" racism onto this work, and I believe that someone is just in denial. It's hard to think that something you luuuuv could have such unredeemable qualities, but it's the nature of literary scholarship to leave interpretation to readers. That's how people get as much as they do out of writing. Also, I don't believe that a perceived projection of racism is even a valid argument against this article because history works against that. If it was just an issue of "people want(ing) to see racism in Tolkien's writings" then this debate would have ended decades ago. - <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERashaun_4cbf.html" title="User:Rashaun">Rashaun</a> 18:45, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>keep and rewrite.</b> I agree with Rashuan, approximately. This article is about an author important to so many of the WP editors that it is almost central to the WP. The question is real, because linguistic differences and their implied geographic and racial differences were very real to JRT--according to his own account, the work was generated to illustrate the languages. The work by its nature deals with these topics. There are two questions of course, racism as a component of JRT's thought, and racism as shown in LOTR.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So there is a real research question, but this article is no OR.I don't really think of it as a research paper-- it is selection of passages and comments, arranged in no particular order. There is a prevailing POV--the editor is anxious to deny the charge; but the presentation of the evidence is sufficient for the readers to draw their own conclusions.</dd>
<dd>There is a great deal more to be said, and much citable work has been done on the topics alluded to by this rather primitive list. But a compilation is the first step. Certainly the source in LOTR can be cited for each passage--but why? anyone likely to read this article should be able to find them by heart. I would additionally like to see sections on later interpretations of LOTR--there are some parts of the recent film trilogy where I think racism was accentuated more than necessary.</dd>
<dd>So keep it--I would love to have the time to do it properly, but I at least will add a few outside citations if it stays. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 04:05, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - the worst that can be said then about JRRT is that he was a "racist" or "racialist" in the sense that he believed there as such a thing as "race"; but as Jensen on the Tolkien FAQ linked to in the article says, his writings <i>look</i> suspiciously racist but upon <i>closer examination</i>, they're benign. Every charge has a counter-example or refutation because these <i>exist</i>. One can believe in "race" and be against apartheid for its racially-based discrimination, as he was. 125.60.243.84 23:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s><i>abstain</i> (I am the nominator). Perhaps someone can find sources.</s> <b>Delete</b> Having gone through the first 5 pages of Google stuff, I have not been able to find any solid RS. The impressive sounding P2P Foundation appears to be a self-published web site and there is plenty of OR around this across the web. Bauwens appears to be an impressive self-publicist having attached his name to a concept of P2P and being interviewed and quoted on all sorts of NN blogs and the like. Apparently he formed some dot.coms in Belgium at some point, although these appear to be dead and are not named anywhere that I can find. He is an impressive but NN college prof. So on balance and in the absence of any good firm sources, I have changed my opinion to Delete.

<blockquote>
<p>Michel Bauwens has played a major role in the digital revolution of his home country Belgium, where he is known as an internet pioneer. He created two dotcom companies, was (eBusiness) strategic director for the telecommunications company Belgacom, and 'European Manager of Thought Leadership' for the U.S. webconsultancy MarchFIRST. He co-produced the 3-hour TV documentary 'TechnoCalyps: the metaphysics of technology and the end of man', and co-edited two French-language books on the 'Anthropology of Digital Society', and was editor in chief of the Flemish digital magazine Wave. He now lives in Chiang Mai, Thailand, where he created the Foundation for P2P Alternatives (P2PFoundation.net). He taught the Anthropology of Digital Society for postgraduate students at ICHEC/St. Louis in Brussels, Belgium and related courses to Payap University and Chiang Mai University in Thailand. He can be contacted at michelsub2003@yahoo.com</p>

<li><i><b>Rather off-topic comment:</b> I really don't want to bang on about this here but Goethean's comments are not correct. I have no connection with ForrestLane42 and I certainly do not agree with his reasons for deletion above. I am a long-term reader, if not editor of wikipedia and an enthusiastic integralist. My interest here is to improve the quality of Wikipedia's coverage of Integral issues, much of which is currently quite poor. My chosen routes to doing so are by effective application of Wikipedia policy and the like so as to ensure that this area is addressed in an encylopedic manner and then beginning to improve the articles themselves. Much of these are not encyclopedic at the moment. Contrary to Geothean's statement, I support the inclusion of the vast majority of articles in the Integral Thought category, although many of them are not currently well-written. The few that I have proded are clear violations of notability. Anyway, this page is not about me, and I only write this to counter the comments above. I'll respond properly to these attacks elsewhere, if required. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackface_55a1.html" title="User:Backface">Backface</a> 00:02, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Having said that, I am unsure that Goethean has provided any additional reliable for Michel Bauwens. None of the Amazon searchable books make non-trivial references, as far as I can see. Goethean's direction to a video on IMDB that Bauwens is "supposed to have written" (IMDB does not actually credit him) cannot be considered a reliable source. Ex-editorship of a magazine, minor teaching posts, a Foundation which appears to be a self-published web-site, dot.coms that cannot be sourced and a couple of other web-related jobs do not seem to create notability even in aggregate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Google video is posted by a close associate, James Burke, who is also listed on the 'who we are' of the p2pfoundation site. Integral Review is also problematic. Although it is a peer-reviewed, if minor, web journal (2 issues so far), Bauwens is listed as an editor of the first edition.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So after all that, I am still struggling to find any encylopedic, non-trivial, reliable sources for Michel Bauwens. As stated before, I am happy to see it stay if Goethean or others can find some. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackface_55a1.html" title="User:Backface">Backface</a> 00:02, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not at all. My initial take when I saw the article was that it should simply be deleted. Rather than prod or AfD it, I tried to point out that every article needs a references section. All I got in return was abuse. Thus I went ahead and followed my initial instinct. Next time I won't even try to note how the article could be improved.

<li><b>Comment</b> I cited a textbook which discussed it. I personally would prefer it to be included in a seperate article, for example, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormtrooper_effect.html" title="Stormtrooper effect">stormtrooper effect</a> however, it seems to get deleted constantly. I reviewed the history, and it seems as if the inclusion of the topic included more information. Most of which was entirely POV. However, the POV part of the statement--most of which was gibberish--has been deleted. In essence, the article has been cleaned up. In fact, it now contains the same number of cites that the entire storm trooper effect article. Not to mention, the mention of the inverse ninja law which contains no citations, though it is also mentioned in the textbook I cited. Simply doing a google search does not eliminate the fact it meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enotability_75cc.html" title="WP:notability">WP:notability</a> since it is discussed by independent sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> - While probably notable in the small pond of <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-druidism.html" title="Neo-druidism">Neo-druid</a> groups, I don't think this article makes a case for notabilty in terms of a general encyclopedia. Isaac, for instance, as the *founder* of ADF *and* someone who has had a long-term, marked influence on the Neopagan community - in addition to authoring a number of books and being cited by numerous Neopagan and mainstream authors - has verifiable notability. However, there have been a number of other ADF leaders over the years. This article lacks *any* third-party sourcing. Without that verifiability, I really don't think the article as it now stands is up to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards. --<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna">Kathryn NicDhàna</a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a> 01:13, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would support a merge. However, what is kept and added to the ADF article will still need third-party sourcing. What I am concerned with in many of these Neopagan articles is not whether we know and like the people mentioned, but whether the information in the article can be sourced at a level that meets WP standards for inclusion.

<p>Page just seems to be a long and winding ramble. All I can see that'd be salvageable is the opening sentence, which doesn't seem enough for an article. I am also nominating the following related page because it's just a building in Rearcross:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rearcross Hall</li>
</ul>
<p>If the nom fails, I'd recommend pruning everything but the opening sentence of Rearcross, and redirecting Rearcross Hall. <i>--<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 23:20, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Oh my. Both of these pages read like a combination memoires/tourist brochure. But it does appear to be a real place and the article is sprinkled with (unsourced) information amongst the prose.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable. He's a staff member in the computer science department at the University of Reading. (He's not a professor.) Maybe somehow somewhere he's got some interesting research, but it sure doesn't seem like it merits an encyclopedia article just yet. So far he seems just to have a bunch of papers in conference proceedings (which, to clear up some confusion, are not reviewed). His list of publications (at his home page and at the University) doesn't list his dissertation; who knows what he's a doctor of.

<li><b>Comment</b>: He is an "academic staff" member, which seems to be what the department is calling faculty. Conference proceedings are quite common in computer science and are perfectly respectable in some areas; you can't expect to translate your knowledge of credentials from some area of mathematics to a completely different field. Also, as pointed out, making "professor" is actually quite different (and harder) than at an American university; it really is a different kind of position. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 08:27, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><font face="Vivaldi"><font size="large">WP:BIO agrees with me. It draws no line that delineates "local articles that don't count" as you are doing, and rightly so. There's a great deal of <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systemic bias</a> that flows from such a notion. It is your "It's local, so it doesn't count." that people don't agree with. And the answer to your question is "No.", because, unlike you with those 30 seconds of interview, James Anderson has been the subject of several articles all of which comprise more than just a single paragraph. The PNC requires "non-trivial" published works, remember. "It's local." is not a valid rebuttal. The valid rebuttals would be that the published works were not from independent sources (e.g. they are re-hashes of press releases), that they were trivial (i.e. are not in-depth coverage), or that there was in fact no more than one single piece. Until yesterday, there was no more than the one single piece.

<p><font face="Vivaldi"><font size="large">Moreover, your argument about rescuing cats from trees is a straw man. You are ignoring the words "multiple" and "non-trivial" in the PNC.

<ul>
<li><font face="Vivaldi"><font size="large">Sorry, but you're not the arbiter of whether my opinion is wrong and yours is right. And no, I didn't ignore the wording in your PNC. I say "your PNC", because despite your attempt to make it seem like your opinion is policy or a major guideline, it is not. If you are referring to the first bullet of a list in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, then note that also part of the guideline is "People who satisfy at least one of the items below <b>may</b> merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them." (my emphasis) Not to mention that the guideline also states that this is not an exclusionary list, so it's not as if your PNC was not met, the article should be deleted. Insisting that "keep" and "delete" correspond to satisfying or not satisfying PNC is just your opinion; don't pretend otherwise.<br />
"Multiple" obviously means "more than one" and "non-trivial", interpreted by you here as "in-depth", can obviously happen in any human interest story such as the one I mention. So it's not a straw man, but a valid example. For example, please look at <a href="http://www.whnt.com/Global/story.asp?S=5787943" class="external text" title="http://www.whnt.com/Global/story.asp?S=5787943" rel="nofollow">Cat Rescued From Tree</a>] and explain why it is not "in-depth". In terms of "multiple", i.e. more than one, with Anderson, I see two independent sources, the local BBC station and the Reading Evening Post. The only aspect of your arguments so far, that I can see is valid is that here we have more coverage than in the "cat in tree" case. "more coverage" here means one more source. But I would think this is a pretty borderline case. If you're going to say "here we have two sources, whereas you have only one". Then that's a weak argument, in my opinion. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 17:10, 13 December 2006 (UTC)<br />

It is <i>not</i> written "in-universe", and in fact goes to lengths to survey a wide-range of fictional universes. Which "universe", then is it in?

<li><font face="Vivaldi"><font size="large"><b>Comment</b>. Calling something "encyclopedic" or "unencyclopedic" may be useful shorthand when there's no controversy, but doesn't help much when there is. Please be specific about why you think the content of this article fails the criteria for inclusion (<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>). I think the wide range of references (films, television, songs, books) are more than adequate to prove notability in this case. Just because "well-written" is not encyclopedic criteria, it doesn't mean that it shouldn't give pause when considering deletion. Writing an article well takes time and thought. Deletion is rather easier. If articles are more thoughtful than the deletions that efface them, wikipedia loses something. -- <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShunpiker_0ed5.html" title="User:Shunpiker">Shunpiker</a> 19:13, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</font></font>
