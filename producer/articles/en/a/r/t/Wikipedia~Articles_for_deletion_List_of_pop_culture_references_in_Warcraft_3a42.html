<li><b>Keep</b> It is not grounds to delete an aritcle just because it does not have references. You should use <a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">Template:Unreferenced</a> to mark the article as such. It is not impossible to reference such video game material, see <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X_3b16.html" title="Final Fantasy X">Final Fantasy X</a> for a good example how to do so. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 16:47, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's been marked as such for a while. As I said, not only does it not have any references, I doubt that it ever can have proper references. You show me a source that identifies what's a reference to something else in world of warcraft and then we can say that it's not just original research. Final Fantasy X makes zero mention of pop culture references within the game; this is nothing but. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 16:50, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, the FFX article references content from a video game. It might not be "pop culture references" specificially, but the idea is still the same. If you really want to see references, why don't you add them yourself? --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 16:56, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, the idea is not the same. "There is X in a game" can be cited to the game, but "There is X in a game and it is a reference to Y" is not supported by the game unless you do original research. The burden of referencing information is on those who add it to the encyclopedia, not those who question it. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 17:09, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, the ideas are the same. You can reference "X" as per FFX and then reference "Y" as per whatever genre it happens to be in. Most of the list is common knowledge and doesn't need to be referenced. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 17:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Everything needs to be referenced. The criteria for inclusion in wikipedia is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability, not truth</a>. There are a lot of widely believed urban legends that are blatantly false, so common knowledge is no excuse. Deciding what is actually a reference and what's just a coincidence is a judgement call, and making those sorts of calls is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 17:15, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You obviously never wrote a research paper before. You don't have to reference every little detail that is in an article. You only need to reference those that are either questionable or not common knowledge. For example, if I wrote up an aritcle on US Presidents I woulnd't have to reference "George Washington was the first President of the United States of American." If you are going to go around deleting articles sololy based on a lack of references then more then half of the database of Wikipedia will be gone. Just tag an article stating that you wish to see references, or better yet tag the specific points you want cited, but don't go deleting articles just because there is no references that meets your approval. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 17:22, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not a research paper, it's a tertiary source. Even in a research paper you'd need some sources at the end, unless all you're doing is stating your own ideas (which <i>we don't do</i>). If I tagged everything I thought I needed a reference, I'd tag the entire article. Go read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, then read it again, because everything you've said is contradicted by that policy. As it says, unsourced material may be challenged and removed by any editor. I've challenged this article, and now I'm saying it should be removed. Our <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_washington.html#References:_biographies" title="George washington">George Washington</a> article has dozens of sources to refer to for even "common knowledge" claims. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 17:29, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is researched, it is just not original research. "Tertiary source" is just a type of research. I think you need to go back and readh <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. You also took my George Washington example out of context, please reread what I wrote. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 17:33, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not common knowledge if I don't know it. That's why you need to cite a source for verification. Can you cite a source for even one of the references claimed in the article? <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 17:35, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, you are right, it is not common knowledge if you don't know it. The George Washington example I gave you is a classic definition of common knowledge. I'm sorry if you didn't know that before I told you. Again, lack of references is not grounds for a deletion. If you really felt that there should be references then why don't you find the references and add them yourself? It is very clear to me that you just want to see this article deleted and you are trying to come up with any reason to do so, even if it isn't a rational one. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 17:42, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unverifiability is grounds for deletion. I say the article is unverifiable. Someone cites sources and proves me wrong and I'll change my mind. Only wanting to include content that <i>complies with our fundamental policies</i> is hardly irrational. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 17:45, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, largely because it is amusing. It is neither "<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>", in that there is neither "novel narrative" nor "novel historical interpretation" in any of it. It's rather a matter of what people have seen and recognized as allusions in the games: the references are the games themselves, and the cultural references they are alluding to. This isn't the sort of novel interpretation meant by the policy, which was never intended to prevent people from making note of these sort of pretty obvious allusions. Merger to any of the main Warcraft articles is impractical: a compilation of this extent <i>ought</i> to have a separate article. There are other practicalities to consider here: if this article is deleted, the insights this article contains will be inserted in other <i>Warcraft</i> related articles on a semi-random basis. Best to keep this to collect them all in one place and keep them organized. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 17:59, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Wikipedia is not the place to insert your own opinions, experiences, or arguments" Unless you can cite someone else's source that something is a reference, it's just going on your own opinion. As for keeping it out of other articles, if it shouldn't be anywhere else, why should it be here? <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 18:11, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If somebody wrote "And this means the developers at Blizzard really like Napoleon Dynamite and think we should all vote for Pedro" that would be OR that would concern me. This is just something that anybody can observe. Now there may be the rare case where two observations don't agree, but that's another matter. It is also possible there are some good references as this article mentions some of the stuff in the article: <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20050621/ai_n14676204" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20050621/ai_n14676204" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:23, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> 1) "Something anybody can observe" is most certainly <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> (as is "common knowledge" which in most cases the editor means "common knowledge to their demographic in their location", which is horribly systemic biasish). 2) Not everybody has access to the medias in question (WoW requires a subscription, etc) so this isn't something "anybody can observe". The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reference, however, is a start. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 19:10, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think your response about living in a box shows a touch of absurdity in your position. How is a book supposed to convince you that the sun is in the sky? It won't. You'd have to observe it yourself to know. This is a common problem in philosophy. See Plato and the shadows in a cave. For that matter, that you have to have a subscription to WOW isn't a valid objection, as it's still publicly accessible. I can't read a book without going to a store or library that has it, so I don't see a difference with WoW? Sorry, but your reasoning is not at all convincing, but rather detractory. You might convince me with some individual entries, but as a whole, no I can't agree. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:39, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it's absurd, because the point is that wikipedia editors themselves are unreliable as sources of information, but they can point to other sources that prove what they say is true. The trouble with WoW is that these aren't internal to the universe or stated explicitly anywhere, they're all <i>inferences</i> that people make, and those inferences aren't there for anyone to check, someone else has to make the same inference to agree. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 19:43, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, but they are there for anyone to check. You can play WoW and see it for yourself. Or find some movie on Youtube in some cases. In any case, the arguments you used have served only to undermine your position with. Sorry, but I just find it hard to respect you now, you really haven't convinced me that your concern is truly legit. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:07, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Why is it absurd to think some people's knowledge of pop culture is different than that of the typical American's (or insert whatever country here)? Are we supposed to assume people know certain cultural practices in Japan when Japanese anime refer to it, for example? If not, why do we assume the same for this article? <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 19:50, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, the bulk of the references are self-verifying through a simple comparison of the referring work and the work referred to. An example: the cheat "WhoIsJohnGalt" is undeniably a reference to <i><a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlas_Shrugged_7452.html" title="Atlas Shrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a></i>; there is no other plausible explanation. Those that aren't so explicit and obvious (I'm skeptical of the dance moves, and the supposed <i>Jungle Book</i> reference is a stretch) should be sourced or removed. Whether a statement of fact is so obvious that a specific reference is not needed is the kind of common sense editorial judgment we need to make all the time, and the comparison of quote X to quote Y to find that they are identical is not itself original research unless it is not obvious. Would you need a source stating that two biographies about a "Franklin D. Roosevelt" are in fact about the same individual named "Franklin D. Roosevelt" instead of two different people with the same name? Would it be original research to make that determination based on the obvious content of each book? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 18:57, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Any entry that categorically states 'X is a reference to Y' without a citation to back it up is putting down their own opinion and should not be reported as a fact, which is the whole point of Wiki. (Reporting facts I mean.) As an example (and I'm aware this may not be the best example, but oh well.) The Napolean Dynamite reference is based on dance moves. However, Napolean Dynamite himself is aping Jamiroquais dance routine and is indeed dancing to one of his songs, so it would be just as likely that the designer who put the dance in was a fan of Jamiroquai and not Napolean Dynamite. For all we know, without an official statement, the designer has never even SEEN Napolean Dynamite. Without a citation, what we have is just one editors <i>opinion</i> of what the dance is reference to. And it's not just this one entry, I'd say 90% of this article falls under the same description. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 12:29, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> for unencyclopedic fancruft, although certainly enjoyable. The problem here is that it's not really original research or any of the other obvious reasons for deletion. It's simply an extremely long article on what is basically trivia. There's no particular educational or cultural significance to any of this information, but it is probably all accurate. In fact, my guess (without looking at the article history) is that it was once a part of the main <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> article and was spun off by editors who realized it would always be unworkably long and didn't add anything to that article from an out-of-universe perspective.

<li>But these things <i>are</i> cited. But you just seem to dislike that the game itself is the source, as well as the other works mentioned.

<li>They can be sourced for their existence in the game, but not the analysis of them as references. As I said above, you can cite "X is in the story" to the story, but not "X is a reference to Y", because WoW never states that explicitly, so we make original inferences. For example <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ran_%28film%29.html#Themes" title="Ran (film)">Themes in Ran</a> may be obvious to anyone who watches the movie, but we can't just find them ourselves, we need to cite the analysis of others. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 22:26, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Grr... sorry last comment. When we refer to "Popular Culture" for an article, we refer to how the subject impacted it. Not, all popular culture references that are made by the subject. That's considered "indiscriminate collection of information". If WoW had a huge impact on culture, and you could not contain it on the WoW page, then yes a subpage should be made. <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>- Tutmosis</small></a> 20:20, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>By individual entries, I mean each individual entry in this list. For example, above, I found an article that described the Cannonball Run and Big Trouble in Little China refererence. I also don't agree with you that we list only a subject's impact on popular culture with references to it(which is in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> article right now), but also in the cases of certain content, describe the references in it. See many episodes of TV shows for numerous examples (from Robot Chicken to Pokemon and Sailor Moon). I suppose you could divide WOW into individual quests and areas, with sections for this sort of thing there, but I believe that would actually be detrimental to Wikipedia, since it would make it more of a game guide. So, in preference to keeping information, having one article on the MMORPG's pop culture references is my choice. You may also wish to look at the In Popular Culture category. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:50, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> While I do believe this does violate WP:NOR, I understand that many disagree. However, there are several other problems here. Not only is this a rather arbitrary piece of listcruft as well as fancruft, it's an article consisting entirely of trivia. Wikipedia policy is pretty clear that, while trivia isn't outright banned, trivia is highly undesirable and should only be kept in new articles as a way of suggesting things to be converted into prose with the eventual goal of removing trivia from the article. That makes it pretty clear that trivia with it's own article is far worse and totally unnecessary. Are we going to have an article for 'pop culture in...' for every piece of fiction, every game, every movie? I'd certainly hope not. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 23:42, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> per The Way. First, "Karate Kid — One of the bosses in Naxxramas instructs his students to 'Sweep the leg,' a line from the movie." Is that really a reference to Karate Kid - and not any of dozens of other martial arts movies? Fans could debate that ad infinitum - and any obscure trivia that fans could debate ad infinitum is probably not encyclopedic. I'm sure there are some references in here that couldn't be debated - where the reference is crystal clear. But even there I don't think it would be an appropriate article for an encyclopedia, any more than a FAQ/Walkthrough would be. It's practically a list of everything funny that happens in the game, decoded for the culturally illiterate. I'd say delete. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 00:47, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That's certainly not the only thing we're discussing, but it is on the list of things. That an article is about a subject that some would consider trivial, but which is nonetheless notable under the WP standards, is not a reason to delete. However, when an article exists only to provide trivial pieces of information about a subject (notable or not), that is a reason to delete. Think of it this way - there's an article on Monty Python's Holy Grail. There's a <i>lot</i> of trivia that you could list about that movie - if you wanted to include a list of jokes, funny bits that get repeated, etc., you easily could. But you may as well just include the script instead - if the trivia is so trivial and so inclusive that it more or less just restates the movie, then it's just an indiscriminate collection of information. I think this article is pretty much along those lines - so the fact that it's stuffed full of trivia is a reason to delete. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 17:20, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>See, that's where I disagree. A list of every character in WOW would be entirely trivial. A list of every item as well. A list of those who by virtue of their name choice or other characteristic have a unique character that causes people to recognize them as references to another thing is not trivial, even if it was trivia. Perhaps it's just a result of pepole using the same word, but with different meanings. That said, the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail_3131.html" title="Monty Python and the Holy Grail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a> article currently has a section equivalent to this article.

There's also at least a few daughter articles based on characters in the movie. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:43, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually the Holy Grail article's section (while itself completely out of control) is the exact opposite of this - it's a "cultural references <i>to</i> this movie" rather than "cultural references <i>in</i> this movie" section. The former establishes the place of the movie or game in the culture; the latter establishes that the movie or game is...full of references. I see this list as equivalent to the first two things you cite here - except that this is a list of every joke / reference in the game. I don't really think I understand why that wouldn't be trivial, any more than a list of items or characters would be. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 21:05, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The point I was making is that they are equivalent, I recognize that they are sort of mirrors to each other, but the information is of the same nature. Especially since you can also find the same information in the articles about the various TV/games/whatever that mention MPaTHG. (Not always mind you, but I doubt that's a conscious decision as opposed to a quirk of editing). And no, it's not every joke/reference in the game. Just the ones that are pop culture. Think of it like a phone book (Yes, I know Wikipedia is not a phone book). You can have it listed by name. Or by address. Or by Telephone number. This article is effectively then, a reverse look-up directory. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:56, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ok - in fairness I still don't see your point, given that the former provides cultural <i>context</i> for the subject, whereas the latter merely describes the <i>content</i> of it. But I don't think it's important, because I don't think the Monty Python section could stand on its own in any event. Let's assume that you're right, and that this is equivalent to the type of thing in the Monty Python article. Would you include a stand-alone article that was just "List of References in Pop Culture to Monty Python"? As a part of the Python article, they add a little value - but they're not a full article. Similarly, I can see a few of these cited in the WOW article to show that the game is "reference-laden," but don't see it as a full article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 22:18, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>(Reducing indentation for convenience) Yes, I could see such a list being made an article, if it was desirable to reduce the size of the Monty Pyton main-article. Given that it is a movie though, there's only a limited amount that can be said about it though. But that's beside the point, the real idea is that the content itself is not inherently objectionable. Since it's not, it's worth looking at the subject matter, which is the very content-rich World of Warcraft game. WoW isn't a single movie of fixed length, or even a series (and I note, there is a lot of Monty Python content on Wikipedia), but rather a large created environment with a fair amount of content. That means deciding what articles and information aobut it Wikipedia should include are different from any movie. More extensive is likely to be one of them though. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:45, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>My entire point about saying that it should be deleted on grounds of it being "trivial" is unjust. The notion of something being trivial (something that is interesting, but unimportant) is largely opinon. I think that all of the articles in Wikipedia is interesting, but in the larger scheme of things, it is not very important. In fact, encyclopedias are in my opinon simply books that contain tid bits of trivial knowledege the important and non-trivial information is usually contained in the references that they cite. No one at the college level would (or should) every use an encyclopedia as a reference for a paper because of this. The same is true with Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 18:42, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>: On the one hand, it might be <i>possible</i> to write a list called <i>List of possible pop culture references in Warcraft</i> with entries like "After defeating a group of spiders in the wastelands, characters can obtain a sword called <i>Stung</i> "(citation) In <i>The Hobbit</i>, Bilbo Baggins obtains a similar sword, named <i>Sting</i>, which he uses in a battle against spiders.(citation). On the other hand, (1) this article doesn't even approach that sort of neutral, non-OR presentation, and (2) it would be pretty crufty even if it <i>were</i> written correctly, possibly enough to implicate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. On balance, though, I think that most of the information could be included in a non-OR fashion and properly cited, and it seems to have interested readers, so weak keep. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 21:24, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The topic is valid, and a large number of items on the list are valid. I'd want to see a better source for some of these, such as the dance moves, or else see those entries deleted, but many of them require no external verification as they are obvious. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 23:42, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b>; I don't know if this is mentioned or not, but if we state something like <i>"An NPC on the shores of Lake Lorderon is named Nancy Vishas; Nancy Spungen is a deceased girlfriend of former Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious"</i>, does it count as OR? If it does, then delet.
