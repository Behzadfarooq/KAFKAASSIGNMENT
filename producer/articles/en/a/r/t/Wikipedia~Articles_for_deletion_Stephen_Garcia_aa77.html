For one thing Stephen Garcia is a notable high school athelete. He is a quarterback which is a highly important and highly sought after position. He is also ranked very high in all of the football recruiting polls and is ranked the third quarterback in several polls. Fans from all of the mentioned schools also show great interest in Stephen because he will make such an impact on the team he chooses to play for. He is also considering graduation early which will no longer make him a high school athlete and he has scheduled a conference to announce his college decision on Wednesday.</p>

<li><font face="Vivaldi"><font size="large"><b>Comment</b> The user that created the "Delete" comment earlier should obviously do some research before he criticizes the quality of the article. Furthermore, Stephen is looking at some of the top colleges in the nation. Seven out of the ten teams were ranked in the 2006 season, and five of those teams were ranked in the top ten at some point this season. I personally would consider those teams in the top of the country. Stephen Garcia was also looking at Ohio State and Michigan, but Michigan selected another quarterback and Ohio State was not looking for one. Another part of his decision lies in the history of Steve Spurrier and his fine coaching ability. This is signifigant in his career and his future with the team he chooses. There is more value in the early recognition of athletes. This is reflected in many things including the increased value of rookie paraphenelia of high impact athletes. It would give other wikipedians a sense of pride to know that we, as a wikipedia community recognized this fine young athlete before other sources.</font></font></li>

It does not matter because Stephen Garcia will commit to a college football team of notable status on Thursday December 7, 2006, in a conference at Jefferson Senior High School at either 11:00 am or 1:00 pm. After this official announcement your argument that he is not notable will be unjustifiable. The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> states that <b>"Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad are worthy of articles."</b> All of the teams that Stephen Garcia is looking at playing for have multiple notable athletes. <b>Also</b> Stephen Garcia is included in multiple published resources including several newpapers and a few magazines. He also meets the criterion for the "Search Engine Test -- Does a search for the subject produce a large number of distinguishable hits on Google ([1]), Alexa ([2]), Yahoo! ([3] or other well-known Internet search engine?" I am in no way closely related to Stephen Garcia nor have I ever met him. All of the information will almost certainly be verifiable in the future because of the high chance of professional acheivements in football. Especially under coaching from <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Spurrier_9443.html" title="Steve Spurrier">Steve Spurrier</a>. Stephen Garcia even passes the criterion for "Notable Actors and Television Personalities" as he has a rather large fan base. (from South Carolina Gamecock fans). There are several videos of fans who drove hundreds of miles to Tampa, Florida to see him play in a High school game. He also gets signifigant local media attention, having his own section on the "Tampa Bay Online" website, www.TBO.com. This article could also be written into the "perfect article". It's subject (Stephen Garcia) will almost undoubtably be successful and is a very interesting person. He also shares a good deal of information about himself and his family with the public and would likely provide additional information in the future. <b>As you can probably tell by now (or at least tommorrow at 1:00 PM, there is little if no sense in continuing the comments on this page.</b> This page will be valid soon. I will also re-edit this page once Stephen Garcia has signed to make it more accurate in such ways as deleting the section about his college decision and adding a section about his future with his new team.</font></font></li>

To be on the first team for USC, this person would need to be named the starting quarterback. I'm not aware of any coverage indicating that this individual meets this standard. I think that there may be room for allowing articles for particularly noteworthy recruits, but that standard should be particularly high. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 03:03, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</font></font></li>
