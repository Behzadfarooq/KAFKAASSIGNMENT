<dd>that wrecks the flow of interaction and makes the whole thing more difficult to understand, and denys the very thing thats suppossed to happen here; discussion forming consensus, almost time to give up that idea. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 11:01, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>yes and I agree about the POV re adding inaccurate information, except that in my case the information on the added pages (articles) was exact and accurate, a reproduction of existing information, and although available to be altered, it was unlikely at the time. It may appear as something else but thats all it is, appearance, and as long as no-one claims notability, (unlikely) the articles can be deleted by an admin, and I am about to request that right now. People make errors on wiki, and I make errors all over the place, often, especially when using my laptop with pad, as i do for 90+% of my wiki edits. so i am constantly fixing even my own stuff, the problem is those added articles can not be deleted by me, i didnt know the difference between an article and a page before this blew up, i intended to use them and bin them. I have zero interest in web presence of those articles. But i did just expect the original article to be deleted like everything else here, subject to the knife. I learnt that its different, and I have subsequently read most of the applicable policies and discussions. Vanity is not a reason for deletion for instance. I never wanted the article with a J in the middle, I have never used that elsewhere on the web until 3 days ago. I simply couldnt figure out how to create a dis-ambiguation page. The lack of Google presence was used as evidence of non-notabilty. How ironic as its my original real name, but never used in publicity. On the other hand, without the J, my name creams the top of the planets search engines, and has for 5 years or more. People were seeing what they wanted to see, and believing what they wanted to believe, looking in the wrong place, without much fuzzy logic. I really have been published all over the place by many notable institutions, but the slash and burn mental set was fuelled by my older, outmoded techniques... (residual stuff on old web sites). I have since realised that I could correct the apparent lack of page response on google by giving google what it needed to catalogue me both ways. IT ONLY TOOK 3 DAYS!!!! look here: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=Paul+J+Moss&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=Paul+J+Moss&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;q=Paul+J+Moss&amp;btnG=Search&amp;lr=lang_en</a> result: #4 out of 3 Million results and #1,2 and 3 are my own sites now. None of you can ever take that away, it's a direct result of years of hard work, recognized by a secret and highly successful algorythm, that has made google the worlds most awesome search company. It wouldnt have happened if i didnt have the notabilty to build on in the first place. Google has at least 500 Million pages and to be #1 on 3, 6 and often 12 million is, (using my public name) IN ITSELF, A NOTABLE accomplishment. I challenge any one here, without notability, to achieve such a result, with such a popular name as Paul and Moss. Paul brings up 416 Million, Moss brings up 26 Million, and thats English only results. It simply doesnt matter what wiki thinks, (1 Million TOTAL)i watch my logs, the wiki traffic is from a few select visitors, while my traffic from world wide educational institutions, government, science, NASA, the Military, are a thousand time higher. It's simply true and provable that my achievements are reported and cross linked back to me by a range of ever growing organisations. I never ever paid anyone to build a website or promote my sites. I did it all myself. They are not very good, but they perform the function intended, to share. In the end none of that matters, what ACTUALLY MATTERS is that people enjoy the images, and are stimulated to think more, and perhaps give it a go themselves. It is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to photograph a comet and have it reported on NASA SPACEWEATHER DOT COM. Another KIWI did it yesterday. I have done it twice before. I have no knowledge of anyone else from NZ ever having achieved that. We have population 4 million. That is because its a notable feat, and almost impossible, for a long list of boring reasons. The NASA articles still exist, and are available, but thats not the point anymore, the point for me is that wikipedians are often too convoluted in their thinking and application of their POV of the rules, to bother to discuss first and reach consensus as a result. Slash and burn is rife, and i see that that is a natural response to all the vandalism and mess cleaning needed. It's actually EXPECTED, and assumed when the indications create an APPEARANCE of non conformance to the rules, but the rules are mostly INSIDE peoples heads, thats the point of wiki, as i see it, to SHARE the concepts of what the rules could or should be. There are many up sides to this, and some less apparent than others, for instance the vandalism of KIWI articles is now under careful scrutiny and watch by a lot more editors. Another is that I have been drawn into bothering to find out more about this place ticks, yeah 'some kind of experiment is right' but only now, AFTER the fact, having been forced to consider whether i would object to the afd/vfd thingy, and deciding that it was better to have the page deleted in due process. But the people who will decide whether or not that happens are charged with due diligence, and its truly ironic that there can be other more positive outcomes, beyond my control. I believe that the voting should have some kind of diligence as well, but I simply dont know how that can be done. Some of the worlds best brains are on that issue right now.. Finally, for this round, the NEGATIVE cut and trash approach is very prevalent, but flies in the face of the published policies, which is simplistically stated as building by discussion and consensus. Building is a POSITIVE activity, with consultation between designer and end users along the way. My dad was a builder, and his buildings still stand, many hundreds of them and between 40 and 70 years old. That is notable in my opinion. Funny, you will be hard pressed to actually find my POV on my websites... its is a wierd and wonderful world, especially when you live upside down like us down under here, otherwise the bulk of civilisation does, we cant both be walking upright now can we? Most of what happens is a web of relativity, connected and in relation to everything else that happens. It's true of POV here. I dont expect anyone to care much, but i have lots more to say... <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 09:46, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ok so as there has been no objection, why doesnt an admin delete them? thats how i read the rules. why redirect it? that ADDS to the clutter. I did tell you they were holding pages. More recently, I did see the opportunity for doing a bit of tail wagging myself, by nominating them for deletion. But i am going to request an admin to delete them as my next step. The process for nomination is supposed to be to discuss it with on the article talk page first, but there was no such discussion. The process for voting is also supposed to be calm objective discussion and due diligence, but thats hardly the case here. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a></dd>

<dd>""Another person obsessively monitoring his own biography is Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, who has edited it frequently, removing references to a credited "co-founder" of the encyclopedia and <b>obscuring the nature of a pornographic web site he once published</b>.</dd>
<dd>Though some Wikipedia editors believe that it's always wrong to edit subjects in which you are involved, this idea is clearly not shared by Wales. The edit history of his biography reveals that he's made 18 changes with the account Jimbo Wales, most recently on Dec. 2.</dd>
<dd>On <b>seven</b> different occasions, Wales has altered sentences that gave Larry Sanger credit for cofounding Wikipedia. Sanger, a former employee of Wales whose job was eliminated in 2002, led the project as "chief organizer" from its January 2001 launch and gave the site its name. He described himself as Wikipedia's cofounder in a 2004 Kuro5hin article.</dd>
<dd>Wales does not share this view.</dd>
<dd>On Oct. 28, 2005, he changed the text "Wales and Sanger set up Wikipedia" to "Wales set up Wikipedia." He made the change again later that day and repeated it on Nov. 9 and Dec. 1 -- other editors kept putting language back in that credited Sanger.</dd>
<dd>On Dec. 2, Wales revised "Sanger initially came up with the idea to make the encylopedia wiki-based" to "Jeremy Rosenfeld initially came up with the idea to make the encylopedia wiki-based." He also replaced a line crediting Rosenfeld with the idea for the name, changing it to "Sanger coined the name 'wikipedia'." Wales used the editors' talk page of his biography to complain about efforts to credit Sanger with the site's founding:</dd>
<dd>I was there, and I know the history. I set up Wikipedia. I fixed the broad outlines of early policy, and Larry worked under my direct supervision at every stage of the process. The current article, even with my edits, contains considerable incorrect editorialization, it's just that I don't even know where to begin in correcting it.</dd>
<dd>Another sore spot for Wales has been <b>Bomis Babes</b>, a now-closed subscription service of his company's Bomis.Com search portal that <b>offered nude pictures of women.</b> The site, whose cache used to be viewable on Internet Archive, has been described as "softcore pornography," "pornography," or "erotica" by Wikipedia editors.</dd>
<dd><b>Wales changed "Bomis Babes softcore pornography section" to "Bomis Babes adult content section" on Sept. 4</b> and twice removed references to the nature of the site, replacing "Bomis Babes erotica section" with "Bomis Babes blog based on Slashdcode" (Oct. 20) and "Bomis Babes pornography section with a blog based on Slashcode" to "Bomis Babes blog based on Slashcode" (Oct. 28). (Apparently, it's what's on the inside of a web site that counts.)</dd>
<dd>When his Sept. 4 edit was removed, Wales reinstated it later that day and put this comment on the edit: <b>"Please do not change it back without consulting with me personally."</b></dd>
<dd>Commercial depictions of naked women are not pornography, Wales declared on his biography's talk page: ""</dd>
<dd>mmm... so much for leadership.. at least its transparent.. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 17:33, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re the XTRA ip's, I think most of us can figure that out, IP's are only indicative, but slander is slander, and when its tied to an IP and a time stamp, its trackable by the ISP, thats all. Funny though, how MY edits to MY site, are used as 'evidence' of wrong-doing, but yours to a cache are allowable? why did you kill the photos? the PHOTOS are the subject, not the ancient (web time) residual content below the subject. Also you killed the cross links to each individual page that makes that site WORK, for the user, malicious editing of other peoples web pages and reproducing them on un-authourised sites is possible, but not very nice. Again, an army of free volunteers to clean up my pages would be welcome, but somehow I dont think anyone will step forward... much more fun to cut down a tall poppy and wag the tail of the tiger... oh yeah, check the date on that page, its OLD. However, it does illustrate the fact that sub-luminal photos of Auroral activity can be achieved at relatively high geomagnetic lattitude, but thats suddenly boring you to tears.. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 05:30, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>dunno what search engines you are using, or why your results are so disparate with mine, and I would very much like to know, its more important to me than astronomy. I get between 6 and 12 Million pages back from google on <b>Paul Moss</b> and i take out several of the top 10. Scholar? what's that in this day and age. Books? havent they died?

<dd>The truth is that astronomy is and has been for several centuries, the realm of the amateur, and we are proud of what we have delivered to the world. Stratafication of that is pointless and counter-productive to the growing interest and availability of resource in the subject; images are the best vehicle to transport the information to the masses. Every photo has a photographer; photographers names are simply a hook to hang the pics on, most photographers would rather you just look at the photos. Such a feeding frenzy is shameless and debasing all who participate, you could simply look at the amazing images and give it a go yourself. Now heres an idea, if you really care about astronomy, how about joining in the pure act of gifting some of your images to the planet? <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 06:04, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now that the fun is almost over here, where to next? lets go and find more pages to slice and dice? clearly, positivity and ADDING stuff to the web is more valuable than REMOVING, all other things being equal... it occurs to me that the only step left is to delete the article myself, ahead of time, thereby invoking someone to feel that they have to restore it.. to satisfy the rules; how can you discuss an article if it isnt there kind of logic.

My purpose is to create interest and give tools to share what i see, and perhaps to do what i do. My name could be Joe Blogs for all it matters, who cares. I have been exceedingly fortunate to have advice and help from an incredible set of people, both here in NZ and all over the world. I have been un-believably lucky to be in the right place at the right time, or so it seems. The truth is actually that LUCK translates to opportunity and peparedness. I put myself out there, in all kinds of extreme and uncomfortable situations, and I am prepared with the devices to find and capture the effects when they happen. I monitor a large number of information emails and web sites, so that i have some advance notion as to whether its likely or not, and then i simply take a lot more chances than most, to be available IF it does happen. That state of alert and preparedness for extreme periods is looked at as madness by some, tenacity by others, passion by a smaller number, and notable by an even smaller number. The key point is that I have delivered many almost impossible to get images to the entire planet, via many channels, and achieved my objectives. That simple joy of sharing is a very precious and valuable 'commodity' in an increasingly materialistic and superficial society, and can not be removed from my life. The important web pages and images live on, untouched by vandals, and growing in visitors daily. Here is a quick sample from 7 days ago.

My sites are referenced at NASA, for instance.. Just because its a NEW form of notability that you dont understand and dont believe in, doesn't change the onjective information available. 1% of a nation, the achievers, could be another method of specifying inclusion. Having the courage to face this community is in itself either stupid or notable. The google rankings for me as a name are only due to the rankings of the sites about what i do, and thats astronomy sharing, proven by my last universal change, my websites are so important to the world, google trawls at a much higher frequency. Wiki says somewhere known to more than 5000 people, thats occurring every few months to me. There are all kinds of people ranking systems, and it still puzzles me why there are so many vicious surgeons, as opposed to BUILDERS.. why not take an article and BUILD it into what its supposed to be? Article name changes are easy to do, it could be about websites that share astronomy and photographs for free, for instance.. There are a million other articles and quite a few are much ado about nothing, I know i have rescued a few from deletion simply by added sections, images and a bit of info, so the cutters take their knives elsewhere. in the scheme of things its the message not the message bearer that counts. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 03:43, 3 March 2006 (UTC) - - *<small><b>Note</b>: This debate has been included in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletion_sorting_New_Zealand_3ddd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/New Zealand">list of New Zealand-related deletions</a>.</small> <small>-- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 22:07, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</small>" *<small><b>Note</b>: This debate has been included in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletion_sorting_New_Zealand_3ddd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/New Zealand">list of New Zealand-related deletions</a>.</small> <small>-- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 22:07, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</small>" *<b>Keep</b> — please note that the nominator <tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">Bongos</tt> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../b/o/n/User_talk%7EBongos_94a1.html" title="User talk:Bongos">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bongos_817e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bongos">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Bongos_9c9f.html" title="Special:Blockip/Bongos">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>) is a new user with a first contribution to delete this article (and the second to badly modify the Aurora summary page). --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Allen_Simpson_95c6.html" title="User:William Allen Simpson">William Allen Simpson</a> 23:14, 25 February 2006 (UTC) *<b>Keep</b> — please note that the nominator <tt class="userlinks" style="1.3em">Bongos</tt> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../b/o/n/User_talk%7EBongos_94a1.html" title="User talk:Bongos">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bongos_817e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bongos">contribs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">logs</a> <b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Bongos_9c9f.html" title="Special:Blockip/Bongos">block user</a> <b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">block log</a></span>) is a new user with a first contribution to delete this article (and the second to badly modify the Aurora summary page). --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Allen_Simpson_95c6.html" title="User:William Allen Simpson">William Allen Simpson</a> 23:14, 25 February 2006 (UTC) *<b>Delete</b>: Obvious vanity; Nowhere near notable enough for inclusion; Self-created and maintained entry.

Please dont waste any time discussing the apparent point, just kill the pages... lol. The point is to look at the human behaviour behind all this. yeah google cache is very cool, i use it all the time. The wiki page is a RED-HERRING, any of you know what that is? how about a RED FLAG WAVING... everything that you guys contribute to any of these pages is logged daily and increases the effect in another world out there... and its not called wiki. The 'J'in the middle name of the article is the reason why the searchs dont turn much up. It has NEVER been used elsewhere on the web. try the name without the J and you will see what i mean, anyway life continues with or without the page/pages and not much of any importance changes. The simple fact is that most of the people out there need a name to hang stuff on, and thats a VEHICLE, who cares whos name it is, only a sad few. I am intrigued though, to see the knee jerks and shallow research, used as apparent 'facts'. That speaks volumes for how this wiki thing works, and is likely to be its downfall, although I hope a way is found to overcome that. enjoy your frenzy guys.. lightening up an otherwise (very) dull day <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Moss_15cf.html" title="User:Paul Moss">Paul Moss</a> 01:53, 26 February 2006 (UTC) - * <b>Delete</b> — Wouldn't even satisfy the average professor test.

Any <b>label</b> can not, in itself, change the message, and there are very cool pics and help out there to help newcomers experience it all for themselves.. the images are the message, not the photographer. So any statement made by anonymous, faceless, unidentified contributor, is meaningless under the very rules that you claim to operate; it can not be verified, it is a 'sock puppet POV' effectively. It has a likely intent, to add insult to injury. Why would anyone put a plastic sticker on a rotten kiwifruit lying on the ground to say it was wasnt worthy of being called a kiwifruit? its clearly rotten! the sticker isnt biodegradeable and is therefore in bad taste. <b>If you want your vote to count, then you are able to sign in, create a user page, establish identity,</b> but I know you wont do that, you have too much to lose. (we pretty much know who you are, from your real world history) What the maximum you can do to me, help remove an article? Faceless, un-identifiable voting, must belong to the dark ages, and cant possibly have any substantially real relevance to me and my life. But it does serve to indicate the flaws here, and create some thinking about that may be addressed. The debate about the article was a dead duck before it even started, so why bother to continue. Most of the tiny quantity of people that read them can see that.
