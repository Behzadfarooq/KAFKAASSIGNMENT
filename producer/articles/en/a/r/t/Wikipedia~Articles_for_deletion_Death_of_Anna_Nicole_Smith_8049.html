<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Nicole_Smith_1541.html" title="Anna Nicole Smith">Anna Nicole Smith</a>.

<li><b>Keep for a month</b> and then <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Nicole_Smith_1541.html" title="Anna Nicole Smith">Anna Nicole Smith</a>. It is attracting as much editing action as the main ANS article, and by having it separate from the main ANS article, it is keeping both relatively stable. If the Death article is merged in now, it will unbalance the main article by the sheer length of the Death discussion. In a month (or so), things will have calmed down and more may well be known (the autopsy and the CSI story are yet to come). At that time, a shorter Death section could well be added to the main ANS article. <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBellagio99_a908.html" title="User:Bellagio99">Bellagio99</a> 02:31, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge contents back into main article, then <s>delete</s> redirect.</b> A redirect would direct editors looking for the 'death' article back to Smith's biography, where they could make the same edits. And there's nothing so incredibly society-altering about Smith's death that would necessitate the event requiring its own editing. <b>Death of Richard Jeni,</b> for example, would feel just as odd. — <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhedonette_62db.html" title="User:Whedonette">Whedonette</a> <small>(<a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhedonette_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Whedonette">ping</a>)</small> 03:41, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - It's a fairly notable article about the death of a celebrity. I disagree with the idea of merging it since there is way too much infomation for the Anna Nicole Smith article. <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDposse_bcc1.html" title="User:Dposse">dposse</a> 20:27, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Any claims that ANS is not important for an encyclopedia are POV. Her death is important, and I think it makes sense to have the facts available on wikipedia, especially in light of pernicious and pervasive rumours. People will turn to Wikipedia for the facts, so it is inappropriate for it to be removed merely because some editors deem ANS "unencyclopedic" and distasteful.--<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgnaramasi_6d6f.html" title="User:Agnaramasi">Agnaramasi</a> 20:30, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Agnaramasi, I don't think anyone is arguing to delete the article, but whether or not to merge the death article into the main <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Nicole_Smith_1541.html" title="Anna Nicole Smith">Anna Nicole Smith</a> article. (See my comments above). Hmn, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Freed_1f42.html" title="Donald Freed">Donald Freed</a> has written a play called, <i>The Death of Sokrates</i>.

<li><b>Delete and Merge</b>. While she was a celebrity, Anna Nicole's death did not contribute anything to American law, to Bahamian law, to drug testing, or anything that isn't really self-contained. If her death had touched off a larger scale change in the status quo, then I would be for keeping it. I feel a decent amount of what's on this article currently can be condensed successfully; let's merge it back into the ANS article until such a time arises when a) the ANS article becomes too large, b) the information regarding her death becomes more relevant to a larger story. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakazette_79d5.html" title="User:Freakazette">Freakazette</a> 23:43, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and Delete</b> This is not Wiki News. The fact that it is a current event is irrelevant. The creation of a free standing article was premature. Her cause of death has not even been determined, yet. Editors need to be disciplined enough to confine the truly encyclopedic content into the subject's biography. The free-standing article has become a platform for tabloid, non-encyclopedic material. If Anna Nicole was, in fact, murdered and a trial ensues, then a free standing article, akin to the <a href="../../../o/2E/j/O.J._Simpson_murder_case_9e04.html" title="O.J. Simpson murder case">O.J. Simpson murder case</a> would be warranted - not at this juncture. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 06:05, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That the cause of death hasn't been determined is irrelevant. That there has been no murder trial is irrelevant. Notability is assigned to whatever people choose to pay attention to. If she was murdered, and there was a trial, but it received little attention and we therefore had few sources to work from, then it would probably be inappropriate to create a separate article. If all she had done was stub her toe, but people chose to pay an enormous amount of attention to that for some reason, then it would be appropriate to create a separate article for that. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:56, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Our policy is to split out subarticles to enable content expansion, not to delete information so it can all be packed into a single page. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:48, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The key phrase there is "notable information." As Arkyan correctly cites below, massive quotation lists and 911 transcripts do not remotely qualify. No doubt there's a 911 transcript from whomever found Elvis dead (for instance), but we don't need to clutter the article with it. Exactly what about Smith's death <i>is</i> notable? The allegations of suicide or foul play are inappropriate pending official reports, so all that is notable is that she (a) died young, (b) had a post-mortem custody controversy and (c) had a post-mortem burial controversy. All of that could have been handled in two or three paragraphs. Wikipedia is not wastepaper. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 17:44, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I fundamentally agree with <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> in saying that article size alone does not warrant this article, and it's likely a sign that some trimming needs to be done. As an encyclopedia there is no reason to editorialize every minute detail connected to her death. In any case keeping it would justify creating a "Death of" article for every famous person, and that's unecessary duplication. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 16:23, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>That the subject of her death has been covered extensively and is extremely notable is beyond doubt. I'm certainly not questioning whether the article passes inclusion criteria, just the necessity of a standalone article. Granted this is my own opinion, but I think it could do without the massive quotations, transcripts of 911 calls and other extreme detail that to me feels less like informative content and more like fluff. The section about the paternity dispute of the child is something that was only triggered by her death and really isn't a topic that should be covered under it. My point is that, according to my views of what makes for a good article, enough content can be removed from the article without actually hurting the integrity of the information that it could be safely merged back in to the parent article. Feel free to disagree, and whichever way consensus goes I'm happy to abide by. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 17:08, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, at least for now. I don't see the issue. There's a lot of info, probably more to come, it's not all gonna fit on the main page, and the event itself is significant enough to warrant inclusion.

Yes, I'm aware that in the larger scheme of things, it's not that important, but if we only included what was "important", Wikipedia would be a lot smaller.

<p><b>A New Type of Wikipedia Article?</b></p>
<p>Folks, I wonder if we have invented a new type of Wikipedia article with the Death of ANS. On the one hand, the story is more than the daily (or even weekly) WikiNews. On the other hand, as things settle down, the article will eventually be condensed and merged into the main ANS. This suggests that our new invention is a time-delimited article, probably of two months, at which point a call for Merger would almost automatically kick in. With this new type of article, there would be no need for <b>every</b> Wikipedia article to be seen as "permanent" -- whatever that means in the world of Wikis and the Internet. <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBellagio99_a908.html" title="User:Bellagio99">Bellagio99</a> 02:01, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't think we've invented anything new. We have a (rather common) case of editors who seem to feel there's a prize for being the First To Make The Edit conflated both by a lack of judgment as to whether information is timeless or trivial and by the certitude that whatever drum E! Tonight is thumping on any given week Must Be Of Vital Importance. I'm sure many of you have seen that in the fields you follow, recent or immediate news gets as much space in articles as all the previous history of the subject combined. Unfortunately, the only way this syndrome will be corrected is with time. The Wikipedians of five years from now will trim these bloated, superficial articles down. I doubt we'll be allowed to do so. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - it is quite reasonable to have a news story as a separate article while the story remains current. Whenever there is a newsworthy event we get lots of new readers who might stay and start editing. As a separate article it makes it easier to find the information and it stops the main article from being overloaded. When it stops being current then a keep/merge view can be taken. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 04:08, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Nicole_Smith_1541.html" title="Anna Nicole Smith">Anna Nicole Smith</a>. By judicious editing of both this article and the main article, that should be possible. I just submitted an edit which cut the 911 call transcript down to 5 words, and one could even justify cutting it down to zero words. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:41, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No doubt it's <i>possible</i>, but it's not desirable. People who want to read about this stuff will be disappointed by Wikipedia's deliberately restricted coverage. "Oh, yeah, we used to have more information about that, but then we decided our readers don't really need to know it." I don't think that is remotely the spirit of Wikipedia. Having less information on this does not help anyone at all. Being able to cut things down is not a virtue. Being able to write good intros and summaries is a virtue, but not when it means the exclusion of detail. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Part of writing an encyclopedia is summarizing and being selective as to what information is included. Even if we were dealing with an undeniably notable subject -- say, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> -- we wouldn't expect that every aspect of the subject's life that might be mentioned in a biography would show up in the subject's Wikipedia article. And when people include dialogue transcriptions such as:
<dl>
<dd>[911 Responder]: Uh, huh.</dd>
<dd>[Seminole Police Department Official]: If you guys could please...</dd>
<dd>[911 Responder]: Oh, okay.</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> and heavily edit. This is ridiculous - how is the death of Anna Nicole Smith notable outside of the context of Anna Nicole Smith?
