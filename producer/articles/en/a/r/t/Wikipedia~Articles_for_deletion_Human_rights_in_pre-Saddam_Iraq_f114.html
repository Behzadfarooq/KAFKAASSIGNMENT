<li><b>Keep</b> Quite a notable and lengthy subject in British history, I must say I am surprised that this article is so neglected. I have added in a source for what material is there. Some also appears to have placed a tag on the article page saying that the neutrality of the article is disputed, but I find scant comment on the talk page. Seems fairly neutral to me. There is a wealth of material, on the net too, which could really turn this into a quite tremendous article. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7ECloveoil_93d8.html" title="User:Cloveoil">Cloveoil</a> 02:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The nomination makes the case for a merge more than a deletion. As for whether such a merge should be made, I believe a general article on human rights will inevitably focus on current events or Saddam's atrocities. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice"><span style="color:indigo; border:thin solid cyan; background:aliceblue">Groggy Dice</span></a> <span style="border:thin solid gold;"><a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGroggy_Dice_aa9f.html" title="User talk:Groggy Dice">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Groggy_Dice_610a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Groggy Dice">C</a></span> 03:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: (1) mixes history with very recent and fuzzy concept of human rights, (2) the only event mentioned (bombing) is likely part of supression of Kurdish autonomist movement during 1922-25, (3) the <i>whole</i> post-Ottoman Empire history of Iraq is history of uprisings and putches which Brits, when in control, tried to moderate. The article looks as prime example of making propaganda through original research - take a loaded word (human rights, fascism, terrorism, anti-xyz, ...) and mix it together with something author does not like. That the heavily biased media do it is understandable but WP should be based on different principles. (I used the book by Marion Farouk Sluglett &amp; Peter Sluglett, Iraq since 1958 - From Revolution to Dictatorship, 2001, London to get overview of the era). <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 00:35, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The subject is important and sourceable, the only question is whether Wikipedians have the interest and responsibility to treat the subject with the work and care it deserves.</s> It is an important subject because it helps to give some perspective to the more important subject of Saddam Hussein's human rights record and the human rights situation that followed the invasion.

<li><b>Comment</b> I still believe that this article should be the topmost <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Iraq_7c83.html" title="Human rights in Iraq">Human rights in Iraq</a> article, because that article <i>should not</i> be a disambiguation page but an overview. It is not a judgement of the importance of this topic vis-a-vis the other two eras -- I just think those are obvious breakouts from a top-level article. Consider my vote "keep but rename" if you like. -- <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:52, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm very open to a main article instead of a disambiguation page, but I don't have the time to work on it any time soon. A main article could have sections on various ethnic groups and how they've fared in terms of human rights, as well as a chronological overview. But I think the period article "pre-Saddam" has so much meat to it that we shouldn't cut it down to fit into a larger article.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:07, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I didn't see what this was before, but it looks like it is starting to come along. I'd suggest that there is a lot of material for the pre-1920 period for this region as well. When time permits, a navigational template among the different articles would be useful, and ultimately these should be integrated into broader histories of the region. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">A Musing (formerly Sam)</a> 02:43, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per the massive improvement by Noroton (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_rights_in_pre-Saddam_Iraq&amp;diff=117060343&amp;oldid=114490803" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_rights_in_pre-Saddam_Iraq&amp;diff=117060343&amp;oldid=114490803" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). Well done! Any merge should be discussed on the talk page of one of the articles and should include comments from those editors directly involved in editing the articles. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:09, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
