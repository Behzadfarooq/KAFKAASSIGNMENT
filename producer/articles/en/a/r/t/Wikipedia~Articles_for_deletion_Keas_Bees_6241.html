<li><b>Keep</b>. While some of this article might be a bit of a jib, this album is coming out. I'm close friends with Tomas and Sergio and the both told me. Obvioulsy Kearby mid-to-late afternoons isn't coming out in 20010. Tomas said around 2010. So I'd guess 2030 roughly. Everything else is pretty damn true.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- I agree with the above poster, although some details are obviously fake (the cover is, of course, not actually modelled by a dog in a bee costume), Keas Bees is a legitimate album and shouldn't be deleted simply because the editors think it's too bizzare to be true. Streetlight Manifesto has always been a unique band, and a concept album about the lives of bee breeders and treadmill salesmen should come as no surprise to their fans. They also have a history of not announcing their releases except through fan buzz (KNAPBSM, for example), which would be why information on the internet as of yet. However there was quite a buzz at their shows, everyone was really pumped when Tomas announced it here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by IAMED 2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_IAMED_2_91f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/IAMED 2">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— IAMED 2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_IAMED_2_91f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/IAMED 2">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. At a recent BOTAR show Tomas did tell the crowd his grandpa once told him that his last wish was for Tomas to make an album about bee sellers, because he was a bee worker himself, and Tomas agreed. Also Kristina Berh says this is true.Ghostboy you really are making a fool of yourself by question this obviously true article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.65.86.42_f2ed.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.65.86.42">69.65.86.42</a> (talk) 23:13, 17 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Also, as an addendum to those below me (I wrote the one directly below this), you folks say there is no verifiability.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Tomas Kalnoky has only recently started to reveal details about the album, that's why references are lacking on the internet. As if any website would be a credible reference. On tours and interviews he has confirmed these things. I know lots of the people who helped write this article and they definitely know more about Streetlight than any of you ... so take our word for it. Plus, it has cover art. It's real.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. To be honest, the argument has several merits. Tomas has been known to be "eccentric" at times. He also is known for not publishing any information about his albums till right before their release. and the tracklist looks convincing based off the songs available on youtube that have been recorded from many streetlight shows. I have even attended one where i heard them playing "mercy me" The negatives really only seem to indicate that is is disbelief at the eccentricity of the article, and i don't believe that it should be removed based on that alone. It will probably need editing (the whole 20010 peice is obviously a 2010 typo) but perhaps we can leave it with the statement that the validity has been questioned and actually do some investigation instead of just saying how unlikely it is.12.226.120.192 00:19, 19 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— 12.226.120.192 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.226.120.192_5d5f.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.226.120.192">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>Hey, I put this up and forgot to vote.... <b>Delete</b>, still misses <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> by a long shot. The only references that would even remotely pass <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, don't really say much other than vague statements that, well, at some point they'll put out an album, which could be said about a lot of bands. Not enough to do anything but <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">speculate</a>, even the keep vote above says <i>He also is known for not publishing any information about his albums till right before their release</i>, which is patent admission that not enough info is likely to be available for an article. If and when there's something to verify, and new article can be put up under the <i>verifiable</i> name of the album. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 04:54, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect because Tomas told me to</b> There are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, but it would be reasonable for someone to do a search for the album title, so redirect to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streetlight_Manifesto_bc43.html" title="Streetlight Manifesto">Streetlight Manifesto</a>. And because I have Tomas's cellphone number and he said we should definitely redirect. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 10:55, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It is referenced. Also, I have a feeling that Tomas Kalnoky, being his usual self, is trying to keep us second guessing and has probably posted this information on the internet somewhere. Then again I could be completely wrong. <small>— Daniel Kalnoky (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Daniel_Kalnoky_e79a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Daniel Kalnoky">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic. The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added at 06:49, 20 January 2007 (UTC) (UTC).</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streetlight_Manifesto_bc43.html" title="Streetlight Manifesto">Streetlight Manifesto</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>, and this album has not been officially announced, at least, from the information I gather. I do support the attempt to bold redirect, but it appears that the consensus is against that atm. --<a href="../../../a/f/l/User%7EAfluent_Rider_4c56.html" title="User:Afluent Rider">Afluent Rider</a> 10:31, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
