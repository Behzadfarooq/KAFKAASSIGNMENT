<li>I wrote the article as it is. 1. If the issue is change, why then place it immediately for deletion? Here, that kind of reflexive reaction is called <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/deletionism" class="extiw" title="meta:deletionism">deletionism</a>, and its treated as a kind of wiki-social disease. 2. The issue of POV merits an {{npov}} sticker, not a {{delete}} sticker. 3. On particular issues that need to be changed, are you claiming that there is not enough factual material related to criticisms and claims of the Iraq War and its execution? Certainly there's an argument for inclusion in the "main article", but LIC, there is no "main article," and whatever articles there are, are in need of organization. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">==S</a><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">V</a> 23:13, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Of course there's a main article, Steve. You linked to it yourself.

<li>It would also seem that the normal editing of merging articles and moving them to less pov titles is also impaired.

<li><b>This is a comment regarding inappropriate listing:</b> According to the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a> if an "Article is biased or has lots of POV," it falls under "Problems that dont require deletion" (see the table). The remedy listed is "List on Wikipedia:Pages needing attention," and the proper tags to use are {{npov}} or {{POV check}} <i><b>Since the Deletion listing was misapplied</b></i> (and since VFD has always been a hangout for <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/deletionism" class="extiw" title="meta:deletionism">delete-freaks</a> anyway) I will take upon myself the laborious effort of removing the inappropriate tag and replacing it with a proper one. It turn out that I was corrent. As I wrote above: "Here, that kind of reflexive reaction is called <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/deletionism" class="extiw" title="meta:deletionism">deletionism</a>, and its treated as a kind of wiki-social disease. 2. The issue of POV merits an {{npov}} sticker, not a {{delete}} sticker."

<li>The article's <i>current</i> title, "Criticism of the Iraq War", is not inherently POV as the original title "Iraq occupation mistakes" was. However, whether Stevertigo can see it or not, whether he will admit it or not, it was created as a POV fork. "Article is biased or has lots of POV" may not be a reason to delete but "Article is a POV fork" is. Add to this Stevertigo's idea that he is unilaterally entitled to declare the VfD against his article "misapplied" and revert it, and it adds up to a <b>Strong delete</b>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:00, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I might agree with this if someone (anyone) could qualitatively define (and substantiate) for me any practical differences between POV as no reason for vfd (use npov sticker) and a POV fork as reason for "strong delete" of whole article. The term "fork" implies that this material is treated elsewhere in a similiarly complied way. Where? It cant be that hard to provide a link! Does this mean that <a href="../../../w/i/v/Wives_of_Henry_VIII_8558.html" title="Wives of Henry VIII">Wives of Henry VIII</a> should be deleted because it contains redundant info, that can be found accross the related and attached articles?

<dd>Is it your opinion then that "compiling" information from two or more articles together entitles the compiler to create as POV an article as they like, and then that article is actively <i>protected</i> from deletion, because "POV is not a reason to delete" and somehow covering the same ground as more than one article makes it less a duplicate article?

<dd>No sir: It is my view that using the vfd as a means to express a criticism of an article's premise is the <i>cheapest</i> of cop-outs. In case you hadnt noticed, this is a wiki: If the issue is the title - MOVE IT. POV content? - Edit it, FFS! <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">==S</a><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">V</a> 01:44, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>keep</b> edit and expand as currently retitled (<i>Criticism of the Iraq War</i>); the war and subsequent peace was one which triggered massive criticism and debate. Some of it valid, some not, definitely much of which could be interestingly analysed beyond the level which the general article can afford to. If there are non NPOV statements, move them to the talk page rewrite them for balance or make the needed additions.. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozzerati_67af.html" title="User:Mozzerati">Mozzerati</a> 17:00, 2005 Apr 10 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep but revise</b>. This article seems to be highly biased at this point, and facts are weak. How about adding statistics, initial goals and current results, and possibly comments by people involved? The title does not cover potential information that can be added, including other POV's on the Iraq occupation. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123">Sango123</a> 19:56, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> so long as verifiable and revise. For example the criticism of not guarding the main Museum is questionable considering it was used as a base of operations for Saddam loyalists; and most items were safely recovered after an initial lack of cooperation. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 05:51, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Critique only does not allow relevant counter-points to be brought up in each section. If <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_Invasion_of_Iraq_a692.html" title="2003 Invasion of Iraq">2003 Invasion of Iraq</a> is getting too cluttered then you can split that into smaller sections such as Motivations for 2003 invasion of Iraq and how it was carried out. The answer is not making an inherently one-sided article. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 05:00, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a bit of a non-sequitur. Whilst the article currently has pretty much only criticism, you can easily and simply add criticism of criticism, which is the whole point. The level of criticism was strong enough to make it interesting in and of its own. E.g. the article claims that the WMD claim is provenly falsifiable (presumably just because the American weapons inspectors after the war claimed it was false). On the other hand George Bush has recently criticised that by claiming that there were WMD in Iraq and that they had been found, which is a different point of view. Both should be stated along with the case for each. Claiming that an article <b>about</b> criticism is non-NPOV is like claiming that an article about "Motivations for 2003 invasion of Iraq" is non-NPOV. Both can be made NPOV or not. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozzerati_67af.html" title="User:Mozzerati">Mozzerati</a> 06:58, 2005 Apr 21 (UTC)</li>
<li>Gren:"Motivations for the 2003 invasion of Iraq" (LOL) might be an "alternate" way of looking at it, but I think that "motiviations" is MUCH more POV than "criticism," which like Mozzerati says, can still be a well-enough written article. But while "motivations" can include criticism, its basic framework is much more limited in scope. Snide comment: Considering also the inconsistenty and shifts in "motivation" (in rhetoric, anyway) from 2002-2005 maybe the title "ever-changing motivations" would be more accurate.&#160;;) -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">SV</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">t</a>|<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stevertigo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stevertigo&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">add</a> 19:17, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not non-sequitir I don't think. I prefer motivations because the motivations are US policy and US policy is worth reporting. Criticisms stem from US policy, not the reverse. Yes, I know both can contain POV but I think we must keep in mind what is the news and what is in reaction to that. I think the "criticism of the criticism" argument is taking the whole issue backwards. and Stevertigo, your comment might have been snide but it amused me... I do think there is plenty to question about the Bush administrations actions... I am not a staunch Republican trying to keep Wikipedia free of dissent... in fact I dislike most political parties... I just don't like what I see as the implications of such a title. If you want to change my vote to an <b>Apathetic really not going to argue if it's not deleted delete</b> then you may do so. Just know my argument is with the title not with the content so much.
