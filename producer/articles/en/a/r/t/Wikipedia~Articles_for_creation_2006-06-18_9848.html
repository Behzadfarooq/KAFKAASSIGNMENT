<p>Andrei Griazev is a talented up-and-coming figure skater representing Russia. Andrei was born on July 26, 1985, in Perm, Russia. He began skating at the age of four. At the age of 11, he moved from Perm to St. Petersburg, to train with famous coach Alexei Mishin at the Yublieney training center; the same coach who had worked with Olympic champions Alexei Urmanov, Alexei Yagudin, and Evgeney Plushenko.</p>
<p>During his time with professor Mishin, Andrei developed the powerful triple axel he is so known for. After several years with professor Mishin, Andrei placed a disappointing 14th at the Junior World Championships in 2002. After this, the famed coach no longer took personal interest in the boy, having him work with his wife, Tatiana Mishina.</p>
<p>Andrei became frustrated and disappointed, and left Yublieney, going home to Perm and not skating at all for several months. Reportedly, his mother had contact with former training mate Yagudin, who suggested that Andrei come to the U.S. to train with Tatiana Tarasova. Andrei moved to the U.S. to train with the famous coach, and in 2004, became Junior World Champion. That same year, he placed third at Russian senior nationals, and earned his way to European championships and World championships, where he placed 8th and 12th, respectively.</p>
<p>In 2005, Andrei suffered a back injury, having to withdraw from Skate America. He struggled at Cup of Russia, placing 7th, but then earned silver at Russian Nationals. He went again to European championships, placing an impressive 5th, and moved up a place at World championships to 11th.</p>
<p>2006 proved to be a year of highs and lows. As Tarasova had returned to Russia, Andrei did also, training with the great coach and Elena Buianova (nee Vodorezova). He had a very disappointing performance at Skate Canada, placing 9th out of 11 men. The very next week, however, he won the bronze medal at Cup of China, his first senior Grand Prix medal. At that competition, he actually led after the short program, and earned new personal best scores for his short program, long program, and overall total.</p>
<p>What looked like a near certainty to medal at Russian nationals faltered, when Andrei struggled badly in both programs and placed a disappointing 9th. He missed going to European championships and Olympic games. Due to some other skater withdrawals and struggles, Andrei was sent to 2006 Worlds, where he had uninspiring qualifying and short programs, but performed a nearly flawless long program which was one of the high points of the competition.</p>
<p>Andrei returned to Russia in March 2006 to take part in the "Italian Carnival" skating tour produced by Ilia Averbukh.</p>

<p>Bernard Moulden Professor, Vice-Chancellor and President BA, PhD</p>
<p>Email: bernard.moulden@jcu.edu.au</p>
<p>Areas of Expertise: Human, animal, and machine vision.</p>
<p><br />
What attracted you to this field? Three things. First, when I started, in the 60s, literally almost nothing was known about how vision worked, so the field was wide open. Almost any question you could ask was worth asking. Second, and better still, was the never-ending series of strange visual phenomena with which researchers could entertain themselves and, more especially, could entertain their students. It was sometimes quite complex to set up lecture demonstrations, but the results were always worth it. Third, and as I explain a bit more below, it actually attacks one of the four or five most fundamental questions you can ask, namely: what is the nature of space? of time? of matter? of life? and of consciousness?</p>
<p><br />
What advances would you like to see in your field? I am astonished at the advances that have already been made in 40 years. From knowing almost nothing we have progressed to having what is really quite a good idea about how to produce an internal representation of the outside world based upon the patterns of light that reach the eye or the camera. Advances in imaging and computing technology have made it possible to visualise on a screen the locations of maximum brain activity that occur when an observer looks at different types of visual material. But the fundamental question of vision is really nothing less than the fundamental question about the nature of consciousness itself. We now know an awful lot about what activity goes on in the brain when a particular scene is viewed, but we don�t know how to link that activity with a particular state of awareness. The same question could be asked about the brain activity underlying a recalled memory. The fact is, we don�t even know how to pose the question with any precision, and that tells me as an unreconstructed Wittgensteinian that we are still a long way from an answer.</p>
<p><br />
Where did you work before you came to JCU? At the University of Western Australia, as their first Executive Dean of the Faculty of Science; and before that as a professor of Psychology. Before I came to Australia I was professor of Psychology at the University of Reading, and before that I had been at the Universities of Bristol and Durham.</p>
<p><br />
What do you like to see students take away from their studies? A sense of wonder at the comprehensible complexity of the world. They should know enough to understand and take joy from how beautifully complex everything is, and they should have been given the skills to be confident that they can make sense of it all.</p>
<p>They should come away with a clear understanding of the constructed nature of knowledge, so that they are immune to the absolutism of ideologues.</p>
<p>They should be proof against those who would declare a version of the truth to suit their own ends, and should be able to ask: who says? What�s the evidence and how was it gathered?</p>
<p>They should know how to construct new knowledge structures for themselves, whether that is in terms of a personal understanding of the world or whether it is in terms of a business plan for a commercial venture.</p>
<p>I would also like to see them write decent sentences, to demonstrate by the precision of their language some evidence of the precision of the thought processes that underlie it.</p>
<p><br />
Who has been the most significant influence on your career, and why? I guess in terms of the total cumulative impact it would be not a person but a series of people, all those people who did their PhDs with me. It was their constantly-new questioning that kept my approach to the discipline constantly evolving.</p>
<p>In terms of the single most influential individual in my research life, it would have to be David Marr, a young computer scientist who died at a tragically early age, but not before he had completely transformed for me the study of vision. He was unquestionably a genius, and gave the discipline a number of totally new points of view, all within a unified framework. For me his greatest gift was to generalise the problem of vision, to raise it from specific questions of the form "how does a rat discriminate horizontal and vertical gratings?" to the general question: "what information about the structure of the world is available in the pattern of light in the environment?". That makes you ask a whole different set of questions, focussing on the information available and the way it would need to be processed by any visual system, whether human, animal, or machine.</p>
<p><br />
What is the best advice you have been given? "Learn to lose and lump it."</p>
<p><br />
What are your favourite books/authors or other interests? My all-time favourite book is probably Three Men in a Boat, written by Jerome K Jerome in the late 1880s. I have read it so many times that I can recite some passages, but paradoxically it still seems fresh and lovable and funny.</p>
<p>In Perth I was crazy about windsurfing, but the conditions are not quite right here, and anyway - although things are slowly getting a bit better - I have allowed this job to consume me completely for the last three and a half years.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If you weren't doing what you're doing, what would you be doing? Some days stacking shelves in a supermarket looks pretty good to me. But then at the end of every month I try to take stock, and there�s always some progress...and still I can�t think of any job I�d rather be doing, or any place I�d rather be doing it.</p>

<p>Shambala is located on the edge of the Mojave Desert, forty miles northeast of Los Angeles, California in a town called Acton. Shambala is the only wild animal preserve of its kind in the United States. Since 1972, the eighty acre wildlife habitat has provided a haven for endangered exotic big cats. About seventy animals live at Shambala, including African lions, Siberian and Bengal tigers, leopards, servals, mountain lions, bobcats, a lynx, a Florida panther, a snow leopard, and a cheetah. Most of these animals were born in captivity,with many of them being orphans or cast-offs from circuses, zoos and private owners who could no longer care for them. None of them has ever been in the wild. All depend upon humans for their needs. With expert veterinary care, carefully planned diets and constant attention by a dedicated staff of professionals, Shambala provides a dignified life for these precious wild animals. There is no breeding program at the Preserve. They work with organizations such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Fish and Game Departments of numerous states, and various zoos throughout the country. These organizations have asked the Shambala Preserve to care for animals which have been abandoned or are in need of the unique environment provided only by Shambala. Shambala is maintained by the Roar Foundation, established in 1983 as a 501(C)(3) nonprofit, tax-exempt charitable organization under the laws of the State of California. The Preserve is open to the public. Tippi Hedren, is President of the Roar Foundation. She guides the organization's efforts to increase the public's knowledge about wildlife in our world. She also provides guidance and leadership in maintaining the beautiful Shambala Preserve for the wild beings for whom this haven was established.</p>

<p>Louie Ignacio started out early in his career as a director of TV commercials. Most of them low-budgeted with such products as Katol, Orocan and other cheap whatnots.</p>
<p>Eventually he moved to directing music videos. His style which eventually became too cliche include putting so much candles, bedsheets, plastic vines and smoke effects. His originality is questionable and yet he rreally made a name for himself. That explains how closely guarded TV directing field is and how meagre talents lord it over simply by making a few friends inside the networks.</p>

Truman Scholarship Foundation (Truman scholars)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation (Truman scholars)</span></h2>
<p>Created in 1975 by an act of Congress, the Truman Foundation is the official federal memorial to President Harry S. Truman. Its mission is to recognize future "change agents" and to provide them with support in pursuing careers in public service. It selected its first Truman scholars during the 1977 - 1978 academic year. While the details have change over time, applicants are currently required to be full-time juniors at four-year colleges and universities; nominated by the Truman Foundation faculty representative at their institutions; in the upper quartile of their classes; and US citizens or US nationals. They are selected on the basis of scholarship, leadership, and service and commitment to careers in public service. The Foundation defines public service as, "employment in government at any level, uniformed services, public-interest organizations, nongovernmental research and/or educational organizations, public and private schools, and public service-oriented nonprofit organizations such as those whose primary purposes are to help needy or disadvantaged persons or to protect the environment."</p>
<p>Successful applicants receive $30,000 for graduate school ($13,500 for their first year and $13,500 for their last year) and career development opportunities such as participation in Truman Scholarship Leadership Week the summer after their selection, Summer Institute the summer after they graduate from college, the Truman Fellows program, and the Public Service Law School Conference.</p>
<p>Each year, between 600 and 700 students apply to the Foundation for scholarships (more participate on their campuses for one of their institutions' four nominations). Approximately 200 - 230 are selected as finalists; they participate in regional interview panels, which select 70 - 75 Truman scholars annually.</p>
<p>Applications are due to the Foundation in late January, although some institutions have earlier deadlines. The interview panels begin in late February and the new class of Truman scholars is announced in late March.</p>
<p>The current president of the Truman Foundation is Madeleine Albright. The Executive Secretary is Frederick Slabach, who is also the first Truman scholar to lead the Foundation.</p>
<p>Famous Truman scholars include Janet Napolitano, the Governor of Arizona, and George Stephanopoulos.</p>

<p>DriveGLEAM is a freeware disk activity monitor program written for Windows that will show one or more icons in the system notification area (tray) that indicates if a disk is beeing read or writen to. The program is written in C and is designed to use as few system resources as possible. Currently the program is under development and have reached beta stage. DriveGLEAM can also monitor the CPU, RAM and VIRTUAL RAM usage and unlike other alternative programs it can output the result to the parallel port of the PC enabling the possibility to build independent led boards that can show activity for a particular drive or partition. The purpose of DriveGLEAM is to allow individual drives to be monitored by the user without adding a individual LED to each hard drive in the system. DriveGLEAM is quite usefull in large servers or workstations that have many drives and where you want to keep an eye on the activity for each drive. (most motherboards uses a global drive activity LED for all hard drives without separate read/write information)</p>
<p>There are several other alternative programs with simmilar function.</p>

FloatLED (uses code from DriveGLEAM)
SoftLEDs

<p>Emery Gulash (1918-2006) was a noted railroad photographer in the United States. Although his photographic slides have appeared in various national railroad publications, he is best known for his extensive arhive of 16mm motion picture footage of American railroads from about 1950 to 1980. This is notable because during this time period, before the advent of videotape, it was expensive and time consuming for amateurs to document railroad activity with moving pictures. In addition, Gulash used high quality 16mm film as his format. Many of Gulash's films have been edited and released as commercial videotapes and DVDs.</p>

<p>Kokopelli and Company, is a smart and humorous comic strip by cartoonist Larry Gonick, which runs monthly in the popular children's sceince magazine, Muse. The comic strip characters are extremely popular among subscribers to the magazine, and some kids even seem to beleive they are real.</p>
<p>The strip is so popular, that some kids have decided that a film based on a novel version of the comic, would be a good idea.</p>

<p>As for the movie, many ideas have already been submited. It is unknown at this point, wether the people at the Muse Offices, will concend to grant this popular request.</p>
<p>Ideas for the movie, can be submited at: www.musefanpage.com/museblog.</p>
<p>Type: Muse Movie (in search box) and submit your ideas.</p>
<p>The rest of the blog is also worth visiting.</p>

<p>Artistic credibility goes a long way in an industry that all-too-often creates one-hit wonders – and none are more credible or distinctive than Sanctuary Urban’s Papa Reu. Boasting an indelible Hip Hop style that oozes the flavor of his native Tobago, Papa Reu is innovative as artists come. Having instituted a new and completely liberated form of music– Thug Hall – Reu is poised for illimitable success. “Straight off the corner island influenced Hip Hop,” Reu’s adaptation has cultivated itself into a winning tradition, progressing slowly but surely since 8Ball &amp; MJG’s heralded On The Outside Looking In. Unique as his peers want to be, Papa Reu is destined to break a new artform while remaining true to his Island roots.</p>
