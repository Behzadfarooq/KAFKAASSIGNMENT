<li>See <a href="../../../d/i/g/Category%7EDigimon_692b.html" title="Category:Digimon">category:digimon</a> and subcats. You'd have to delete/merge <i>dozens</i> of of these.

<li><b>Weak weak keep</b> in agreement with Punkmorten. I remain of the opinion that WP:DIGI should take their large and thorough project to a separate wiki, and replace their WP content with, say, two or three articles and one list. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of trivia and it's not a game rules guide. Character stats aren't encyclopedic, whether it's Pokemon or Advanced Squad Leader or a Star Wars game. But I don't want to mess up their efforts, just as I don't want <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_NASCAR_2025.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject NASCAR">Wikipedia:WikiProject NASCAR</a> messed up by people who say "they just go around in circles and crash." <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 02:25, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This article really is rather weak, perhaps <a href="../../../d/i/g/WP%7EDIGI_48fe.html" title="WP:DIGI">WP:DIGI</a> can <s><b>merge</b></s> it into something relevant? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 02:33, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I have no idea where it might fit comfortably. Therefore, in the absence of a page to merge with this article, I've changed my vote to <b>delete</b>, as it can be recreated when someone's got the time to build a stand-alone and fully-fleshed-out article. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 22:48, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Currently, <a href="../../../d/i/g/WP%7EDIGI_48fe.html" title="WP:DIGI">WP:DIGI</a> is busying itself mostly with character, anime and game articles. If this article is deleted, several dozens more will have to be (see for exemples, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenkimon.html" title="Kenkimon">Kenkimon</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabumon_X_6a02.html" title="Gabumon X">Gabumon X</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witchmon.html" title="Witchmon">Witchmon</a>). The non-list data (i.e. description and attacks) cannot be readily merged anywhere. The article is already listed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Digimon_7cfb.html" title="List of Digimon">List of Digimon</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Empire_2348.html" title="Metal Empire">Metal Empire</a> (though the latter would be converted to a cat if I had my way, but we don't have the time for it ATM). I think statu quo is preferable at least for the time being, if only because we might have to find back the information anyway if the article is to be recreated based on the Pokemon precedent. <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 16:45, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Here's where I disagree strongly. The Pokemon precident is only there because the articles are on the whole, of high quality. See <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> (almost an FA), for example. There was a policy a while back to merge them but because we took the time and effort to expand them, they weren't deleted. If we hadn't, there'd be no "Pokemon precident" to fall on. if you can't be bothered to write a good stub on a subject, it shouldn't be here in my opinion. --<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Cel</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="green">es</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">tianpower</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">háblame</a></sup> 16:52, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The sheer amount of articles in relation to the number of those willing to work them out prevents us to apply such an emergency remedy. I remain convinced that, given enough time, we actually can do it. <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 17:06, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The point I'm making is that I don't see what good is to become of having it here. Experience shows that redlinks are more inviting for contributors than substubs. Also, if anyone comes across it now, will it help them? No. Better to start afresh when someone gets round to writing something worthwhile. What's already there looks like information that anyone that plays/watches Digimon would know, so nothing's being lost. --<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Cel</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="green">es</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">tianpower</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">háblame</a></sup> 18:38, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Very weak keep</b>. As said before, <a href="../../../d/i/g/WP%7EDIGI_48fe.html" title="WP:DIGI">WP:DIGI</a> has recently become quite active again, and the chances of us finding a solution for this information are high. I have another idea; give some time for us to archive information and find the weak articles. Make this a task for WP:DIGI and allow a lasting plan of action on where to store the information (if it is to be stored on wikipedia at all). As big of a fan of the Digimon series that I am, I know wikipedia is not our own personal fansite, and that a line should be drawn sometimes when it comes to the relevance of information. With Digimon receiving a <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digimon_Savers_803b.html" title="Digimon Savers">new series</a> there is renewed interest in WP:DIGI and more activity. I believe we can get the task done if you leave it in our hands. And perhaps a deadline, if we cannot meet (doing something that is satisfactory with the information), would just mean the articles do get deleted? -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I've seen Digimon articles shorter than this. I am not sure if they are expandable or not because they have not appeared in the anime or anything, or are just part of a list that Bandai released. I don't think all the Digimon have made an appearance in games and/or anime and/or cards and/or other items. However, I would keep it because, like <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> says, lots more of these types of articles exist. It is possible that these articles are just short. <a href="../../../x/4/2/User%7EX42bn6_9d4f.html" title="User:X42bn6"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold;">x42bn6</span></a> <a href="../../../x/4/2/User_talk%7EX42bn6_bd12.html" title="User talk:X42bn6"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt;">Talk</span></a> 01:43, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
