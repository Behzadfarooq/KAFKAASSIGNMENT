<p>A pointless, 38kb-long list on movie clichés. It is biased (who defines what is a cliché and what is not?), unverifiable (how do you verify a cliché?) and is the kind of list that will just keep growing without serving anything inside Wikipedia (it is neither a navigational aid nor a development mechanism, it just exists for its own sake.) <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 22:41, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I suppose I lean towards keeping if this gets a little more verifiability as much of it appears to be true and recognised, but perhaps a better solution is to simply have a separate page for each genre, and have this as an index page with a brief explanation (or merge into <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clich%C3%A9.html" title="Cliché">cliché</a>. Some already do have their own lists (e.g. action). I don't think its a bad idea to have this information in some form. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">Jammo (SM247)</a> 23:24, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And what is the criteria for deciding what goes on the list? Who decides what given recurrence is a cliché? <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 23:29, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Citing well-known movies and well-known parodies is a start. I can't give another solid air-tight reason other than my above to keep, but instinctive synthesis tells me this should be kept in some form. It isn't my job to work out such criteria, but I am sure somebody can do a good job. Difficulty is not a reason to delete. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">Jammo (SM247)</a> 00:42, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not saying it is <i>difficult</i>, I'm saying it's <i>impossible</i>. Let's take a random entry. For instance, under "Disaster movies", one reads: "The first victims of the disaster include a young couple, and usually when they're having sex." Now, how can we verify that it is a cliché? <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clich%C3%A9.html" title="Cliché">The cliché article itself</a> defines it as "a phrase, expression, or idea that has been overused to the point of losing its intended force or novelty, especially when at some time it was considered distinctively forceful or novel." So, in order to prove that this is a cliché, the page should prove that it is an idea that has been overused. How can you prove that? By reviewing all the disaster movies ever made? By making a sample of them? And then how do you make such a sample? Someone else could always argue that this idea has been used a lot of times, but has not been <i>overused</i>. This list is simply not verifiable. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 00:54, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I thought this was already nominated (for the reasons above), and kept, along with all the other lists of clichés.

<li>I didn't find mentioning of an AfD discussion on the talk page, but then again I just read the sections' titles and not everything that was written there. I didn't understand your reasoning for voting keep. Are you voting keep because it is likely to be kept anyway? Could you please clarify me? <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 00:22, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm voting "keep" because the other ones were kept, and this is no worse, so this will be kept, also.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This is an extremly difficult call, we clearly have a well written article that numerous users have edited, and put some serious effort into. However, we also have borderline <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>.

I'm going to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">Ignore some things</a> and say for the overal aesthetic quality of the project and the fact that outside visitors will be visiting this page and will enjoy it, may compell them to join. I also, don't see the article, outrageously failing some guideline or violating one.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, this is just a list of loosely associated topics, very much like a list of aphorisms, though actually less useful. (And when it gets too big—and it will just keep growing as random folks stumble across it—do we split it up into 14 different articles, "List of cliches in action films", "List of cliches in American movies", etc. etc.) —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a> 05:18, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> this page and the other "list of clichés" pages, or else delete. They're not really encyclopedic, but can be interesting reading. If this is kept there should be some sort of restriction, such as listing at least three movies in which the cliché has appeared. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 17:29, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> It just tells people popular clichés in films. Isn't that worth something? --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexie_87b1.html" title="User:Alexie">Alexie</a> 01:38, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> original research, unverifiable POV as to what a cliche is. Given the aphorism there are only (five? ten? 12?) storylines in all of Hollywood, this means the list potentially consists of all movies ever made. I am unimpressed by the argument that worse drek exists on WP, that just says more work has to be done. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 09:36, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> A cliche is something familiar through re-use or reproduction in one genre, or transposed from one genre to another - which means that far from being unverifiable, this list is badly incomplete, and will remain so for the forseeable future. Simply because someone does not understand a visual reference or narrative cliche, does not mean that it is not so - this arguement is the equivalent of sticking one's head in the sand. A list of cliches is invaluable, as apart from identifying repeating memes in fiction, it also helps paint a picture of what is acceptable as internal logic within certain genres of writing/film-making, etcetera. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.92.171.123 (<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.92.171.123.html" title="User talk:84.92.171.123">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.92.171.123_ef86.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.92.171.123">contribs</a>).</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_film_clich%C3%A9s_by_genre&amp;diff=60024901&amp;oldid=59971285" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_film_clich%C3%A9s_by_genre&amp;diff=60024901&amp;oldid=59971285" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - "A cliche is something familiar through re-use or reproduction in one genre, or transposed from one genre to another - which means that far from being unverifiable, this list is badly incomplete, and will remain so for the forseeable future": Of course the list is badly incomplete. By my your own definition, it includes every film ever made, since every film contains elements or plotlines from others. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 01:29, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
