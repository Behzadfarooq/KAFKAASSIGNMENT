<p>Non-notable actress. According to IMDb, appeared in a grand total of 7 productions (5 television shows and 2 television movies) over a 20-year timespan. Speedy-delete was contested on grounds that some of these were "popular national TV shows", however that argument seems weak given that she appeared on <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_d8ea.html" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a> only 4 times in 3 seasons. No information in the article other than her acting credits. No reliable sources cited, so fails the multiple independent coverages required by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValrith_e155.html" title="User:Valrith">Valrith</a> 20:25, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Oakshade, she appeared less than five times in each of those shows mentioned. If Rachel Ambler were merged to either of those someone would take them out for being irrelevant, and if the article wasn't merged it would stay a stub for an indeterminate period of at least a year and quite possibly forever.<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 21:05, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I know that notability is permanent and I argue that it isn't present. She appears in each of the things you just mentioned in only one episode each. Unless you plan to add "multiple independent coverages" by published sources to her article, you are the one who is ignoring WP BIO.<a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 21:33, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not at all. Adhering to the exact WP:BIO guideline quoted above. See WP:BIO - Entertainers. I'll repeat the guideline here (since it's being ignored) "... actors, comedians, opinion makers, and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions." And per your own admission, she's appeared in at least <b>ten</b> episodes of very popular shows. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 23:21, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Delete/Comment</b> This argument has raised its head before and I think <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> needs to be clearer about it - you can't take the sentence "... actors, comedians, opinion makers, and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions." <b>without</b> also including the next one: "Notability can be determined by.... Multiple features in credible magazines and newspapers / A large fan base, fan listing, or "cult" following / A credible independent biography / Wide name recognition / Commercial endorsements of notable products". Otherwise, every actor who has appeared in Coronation Street for ten seconds standing in the background is notable. And Ms.Ambler doesn't appear to hit any of those categories. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 23:32, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Only that Ms. Ambler wasn't in these shows for 10 seconds in the background, but a principal guest performer playing important characters in them.

<li>But <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> <b>isn't ambiguous</b>, just badly phrased - it clearly states what notability factors are suitable. If you take your argument as correct, then <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> also states that ALL "scientists, academics, professors, authors, editors, journalists, filmmakers, photographers, artists, architects, engineers, and other creative professionals" are notable.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Here's the thing, on one hand, I think that's enough appearances to pass WP:BIO if she were a guest star, but she's not. She might be notable if these 7 productions were over a 3 year period, but they are over 20 years. Further, there's no additional information about her, other than the appearances. What makes her notable other than just being on the show? Does she have wide name recognition? I don't think so. It's tough, I feel like this is sort of borderline, but I just cannot go with keep on this one, due to lack of notability, lack of sources, and lack of growth potential beyond stub status. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/l/i/WP%7ECLIMBING_ffc5.html" title="WP:CLIMBING"><small><sup>On Belay!</sup></small></a> 10:30, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The criterion noted by Oakshade is one of a number of indicators that the individual <i>may</i> have achieved notability. The primary notability criterion - and actually the only one that matters - is: has this individual been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial coverage in reliable sources independent of the subject? No evidence is presented that they have. This looks like a generic bit-part player, perfect for IMDB but not for Wikipedia due to lack of secondary sources. 125 unique Googles outside Wikipedia is not a good sign, especially since quite a number (most, I think) are unrelated, Wikipedia is top Google hit, also not a good sign, and only three images on Google image search(!). Merge to a list of minor Enemadale actors if you like. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:30, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
