<li><b>Comment</b> This I see. However, what we'd be looking for is <i>in-depth</i> coverage <i>of the band itself</i>, not just a name drop or "who features them", or something that mentions them in passing but really isn't about them. The article also suffers from a <i>lot</i> of advertising. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 06:22, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> advertising? well that could be discussed and removed without putting the article up for deletion right? You know you could find a thousand band articles on wikipedia that don't have the "in depth coverage" you are looking for sourced either nor should it be required if you have proof that they meet any requirements of notablity. Being featured on a magazine cover and being part of a large festival generally known to be for the top bands of their genre seems to be enough by itself in my opinion to prove that at the very least they are one of the more notable bands within their genres. Just because a band isn't mainstream shouldn't prevent it from retaining notability. When was the last time you heard <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_metal.html" title="Power metal">power metal</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_metal.html" title="Progressive metal">progressive metal</a> on the radio or read an article about them in the newspaper or saw a documentary about a band within that genre on tv? Nonetheless a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_metal.html" title="Christian metal">Christian metal</a> band within that genre? For that matter what about <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html" title="Black metal">black metal</a>? Hardly any bands in that genre are on major labels or recieve any kind of media coverage at all yet there are tons of them on wikipedia? and they should be because somone who is interested in that subject should be entitled to find information about them here, Just like anyone who is interested in reading about a band like Theocracy.--<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 06:43, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The source need not necessarily be a mainstream one! A magazine that does more specialized coverage in this area, or music criticism that focuses specifically on this genre, would work fine. As to the advertising, yes it can be, which is why I mentioned that as a secondary concern-that in itself is not a reason for deletion unless the whole article is a blatant ad, which here is not the case. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 06:48, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It has already been proven that they were the cover story for magazine who does just that which is somewhat hard to properly source since it is not an online article, also these may or may not be considered noteworthy under current policy but there are tons of metal sites that have reviewed this album or interviewed the band. I am not really sure what makes a internet publication noteworthy or not though.--<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 06:54, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I'm not convinced that one cover in a tightly genre-based magazine is enough to pass WP:MUSIC. This entry has been deleted for the same reason once before and I can't really see what's changed since. The creator's attitude doesn't help much either - I went looking for Ghits (found about 15 that weren't myspaces etc) but did find <a href="http://esoterik72.net/esoblog/2005/12/09/wikipedia-is-not-cool-at-all/" class="external text" title="http://esoterik72.net/esoblog/2005/12/09/wikipedia-is-not-cool-at-all/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>.

<li><b>comment</b> Funny that blog you brought up is over 2 years old, I didn't even know about this band then and I don't think I had begun to edit anything on wikipedia nor is my name Christopher and at that point they hadn't appeared on the cover of the magazine nor had they played at ProgPower. What is wrong with my "attitude"? I have been perfectly civil in this discussion and I think it was quite rude of you to refer to me as having one. Also isn't the fact that it is "tightly genre based" kind of the point? They are in a genre that doesn't recieve a lot of mainstream press so of course that is going to be where you would find them if they are notable within that genre, especially when they are feautured on the cover.--<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 08:03, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Apologies if the blog article wasn't you, but your reaction to the tags that were placed on the article today were poor. You wrote "please do not put this tripe on here again", and later "grow up moeron, I don't know what your beef is with this article". No-one likes their work being AfD'd, but without the procedures Wikipedia would sink under the weight of worthless articles. Despite this, having thought about it I'm going to change my vote to Weak Delete - I don't think the band has quite enough to pass WP:MUSIC yet, but it's not far off. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR">EliminatorJR</a> 08:22, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> ...and yes before anyone adds anything I understand that I can be one to, however my main problem is when people just go around quoting policy, posting templates about policy on my talk page without taking the time to really discuss the issue in actual words. Also normaly when I get confrontational it is because I am trying to better the project and rather than studying up on every single policy and treating it as canon and getting rid of everything not perfectly in line with it, I try and edit using <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUse_common_sense_cd4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Use common sense">common sense</a>. Also I realize some of my problems with the user have been with image copyrights, I really don't fully understand this policy and if rather than taging the image and puting a template on my page, Moeron would actually try and communicate with me like an actual person and not a bot it might actually help me understand the policy so I could no longer be violating it. Also it seems a lot of the band articles on wikipedia have images uploaded with similar tags which makes me feel like I am being unfairly singled out.--<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 08:59, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

If that doesn't count for something, then I don't know what does. They're a really new band, and they're rising quickly in the world of Progressive metal. The founder, Matt Smith, started writing the first music in 2002, the first albumw as released in 2003, and by 2006 they were esteemed enough to play in ProgPower USA... They're as relevant if not more relevant to hudnreds of bands on Wikipedia. If you delete the article now, it'll only have to be recreated as they grow much more popular. <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmiralTreyDavid_08ae.html" title="User:AdmiralTreyDavid">AdmiralTreyDavid</a> 19:01, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b>Just because they played at a major festival doesn't make them notable right away, just like every band that plays <a href="../../../o/z/z/Ozzfest.html" title="Ozzfest">Ozzfest</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_City_Limits_3cc4.html" title="Austin City Limits">Austin City Limits</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnaroo.html" title="Bonnaroo">Bonnaroo</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_by_Southwest_8515.html" title="South by Southwest">South by Southwest</a>, ect. shouldn't have it's own page based solely on that. You say "They're a really new band, and they're rising quickly in the world of Progressive metal" and that is a factor. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>; one cover story in this genre is little to go on, as per precedent at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Common_outcomes_b214.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Common outcomes">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Common outcomes</a>. The band is welcome to have a page once they become more notable in their scene with multiple, non-trivial reliable sources, but as it stands now, they are still in the process of getting there. I have no problem with the group having a page like you say once they grow more popular.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> --Athensbum 05:55, 23 February 2007 (UTC) The debut album has been reviewed by dozens of print &amp; online publications, and TWICE by none other than well-known critic Martin Popoff (once in BW&amp;BK and another mag), in addition to the HM cover story. As for copyright issues on the photographs. . . I have taken most of the photos used by the band on the Web site, in the album booklet and so on. Matt and I are both more than happy to grant usage for these images on Wikipedia. I'd be happy to address any questions about the pictures used. Anyway, to the point: following are a list of links to just a handful of positive as well as negative (balance?) reviews and articles about Theocracy.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Moeron you do realize that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> does say <b>"Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted"</b>, I think enough proof of the bands notabiltiy has been established, even if they barely would make it under the policy (which is greatly biased towards commercial music which this band is obviously not). When you put it all into perspective the band is clearly notable enough to be on wikipedia. I don't really see what you are trying to prove here, nor do I see how this is beneficial to the project.--<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 10:05, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hey there! Oh, yeah, I do realize that, but the policy that preceeds <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. "Commerical music" may be biased in your opinion on Wikipedia, but there are many bands that aren't like that that pass notability, such as those that have played <a href="../../../p/r/o/ProgPower_80cc.html" title="ProgPower">ProgPower</a> such as one of my favorite bands, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonata_Arctica_2c3d.html" title="Sonata Arctica">Sonata Arctica</a>. Theocracy just isn't there yet. What, specifically, is the proof here? I have already mentioned above why playing at <a href="../../../p/r/o/ProgPower_80cc.html" title="ProgPower">ProgPower</a> doesn't exclusively make them notable in-and-of itself. As for the magazine, that is one source. There should be multiple sources, as per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Also, please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>; I am not here on a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and never have in my nearly 12,000 edits.

Just because something isn't online doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I am sure it could be properley sourced. Also what about this section in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, <i>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city.</i> It is rather vague isn't it? How many other Christian Power metal bands from that area are there? How many of them are on magazine covers and recieving any type of coverage at all? How many are playing in the largest prog/power festival in the western hemisphere as one user mentioned above?--<a href="../../../e/_/t/User%7EE_tac_b17f.html" title="User:E tac">E tac</a> 22:10, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
