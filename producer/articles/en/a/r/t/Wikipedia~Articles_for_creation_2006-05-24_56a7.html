<p>Register true is a term used in the publishing and printing industry. It refers to the exact vertical alignment of lines in back-to-back pages in a book. For facing pages in a page spread, ie., for the even and odd pages when the book is laid spread out, being register true helps with readability. For pages which are on opposite sides of the same paper sheet, being register true helps with preventing lines from the opposite side showing through between the gaps on the line on the current page. Especially when the paper used is semi transparent.</p>
<p>When formatting books with software aid, the easiest way to ensure being register true is to make sure all vertical spaces, between lines and around headings or figures or tables, is an exact integer multiple of the normal inter-line spacing (also called leading).</p>

An group of scientists are recruted by American Army to try explain this new threat, but are unsuccessfull. Moreover, in late June´s this phenomemon spread to all the world. One to another, the major world's cities are annhilated by powerfull earthquakes and tsunamis, giant epidemies dizimate entires countries and regions. Some animals, like dogs, start killing humans. Volcanos erupted one to another, and tectonic plates increase is speed, increazing the global earthquake, and volcanic crisis. Giant hurricanes spread along the Amazon Rainflorest. Many cultures suffered mutations that turn be lethal to human consumption. Facing this wave of unprecedent natural disasters, scientis try to understand why this happen, but needs to listen an woman anthropogist and a ecologist which not deserve mant attention, even they are recruted by US Army. "Fury" is an amazing book that combine many doomsday events (epidemy, earthquake, volcano, etc) in a single plot, but the main moral font was the Gaya Theory.</p>

<p>Turbo cache is a patented NVIDIA technology for the use in graphics cards. It was mainly introduced to lessen the price of thin notebooks which have greater graphic configurations. NVIDIA TurboCache is available in: the NVIDIA GeForce Go 7300 GPU for PCI Express thin and light notebook PCs, the NVIDIA GeForce 6200 GPU for PCI Express desktop PCs, and the NVIDIA GeForce Go 6200 GPU for PCI Express notebook PCs. Benefits of these GPUs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for up to 128MB and 256MB configurations</li>
<li>Only Microsoft® DirectX™ 9.0c Shader Model 3.0 GPUs in its class lets you play all the latest games*NVIDIA® PureVideo™technology delivers crisp, vibrant video on the PC</li>
</ul>
<p>How Does it Work? The revolutionary TurboCache technology utilizes the additional bandwidth of the PCI Express graphics bus to reach higher levels of graphics performance than traditional video memory solutions,delivering the performance and features you expect from NVIDIA graphics hardware. By allowing the graphics processing unit (GPU) to share the capacity and bandwidth of dedicated video memory and dynamically available system memory, TurboCache turbocharges performance and provides larger total graphics memory.</p>
<p>PRICE EFFECTIVE Through its unique ability to render directly to system memory, TurboCache fundamentally redefines the price/performance of desktop and notebook PC graphics solutions. With the innovative TurboCache technology from NVIDIA, users looking for an affordable desktop or thin and light notebook solution can now experience the latest graphics and video features of the GeForce 6 and 7 Series GPUs, without compromise.</p>

<p>This is a new card game that I made up. There are no sources because I made it up. I will display the rule sheet, i created, below.</p>
<p>Strategens</p>
<p>Objective: Get rid of all your cards before any one else</p>
<p>Players: 2 OR 4 (If there are 4 players, then the first person to have no cards left is the winner. The neckst player to get rid of their cards is second and the last player to get rid of their cards get's third. The person still left in the game loses at life and gets no form of recognition. The game ends after first, second, and third places have been given out. If there are only 2 players then when one person gets rid of their cards the game is over then and their and the person with the cards loses at life as well.</p>
<p>Set Up: 2 players: The deck is divided into red cards and black cards. One player gets the black cards. The other get the red cards. The decks are both shuffled and placed in front of the players.</p>
<p>4 players: The deck is divided into each invidual suit. Each player gets one of the suits. They are placed in front of each player after they have been shuffled.</p>
<p>Gameplay: You draw until you have 5 cards every turn. You must play a card every turn. You can place a maximum of 2 face cards (jack, queen, king, ace), a maximum of 3 common cards (everything else except the joker), or a maximum of one joker every turn. The points are added up. Whoever has more points, gives the cards played and the cards in their hand to the loser of the turn. The cards are placed in the loser's side deck (right next to the main deck. If 4 players are playing then the one with the lowest points gets the cards in everyone else's hands and the cards played on the field.</p>
<p>Strategens: Before you play your cards for the turn, you may place one card on the top or bottom of the deck. Strategens are helpful because it saves a card that you want, for future use.</p>
<p>Ties: If there is a tie that results in no losers for the round then the all the cards in every players hand and the cards that were played for the turn get placed into the middle. Another round is played until there is a loser. The loser gets the cards in the middle and they are placed in the side deck.</p>
<p>2-Faced: If you have 2 face cards with a similar point value, then you my add on to the total of your points played that round by half of the total it would be without the bonus. for example; a queen and a queen results in a 24 without the bonus. But then you add to that total by half and you get 36 points.</p>
<p>Triple Decker: If you have 3 common cards of the same point value, then you add on to the total by a third instead of a half as the 2-Faced section states.</p>
<ul>
<li>At any time you may place less than 3 common cards and less than 2 face cards. You cannot play face cards and common cards together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jokers: Jokers are only for 2 player matches and are optional. They increase the intensity of the game. If you play the joker, then you automatically win the round and your hand and the joker goes to the losers side deck. If jokers tie, follow the rulers states in the Ties Section. There is a black and red joker. Black joker goes in the black deck and the Red joker goes in the red deck.</p>
<p>Rank: The cards state the amount of points they are worth. For face cards, Jack is 11 points, Queen is 12, King is 13, and Ace is 14. A joker defaults to a win for the round. It would be a 15 in theory but its not. You can make the joker a 15 if you think the joker is too cheap. It can still only be played by itself.</p>
<p>Side Deck: The cards you get if you lose are placed here. When your main deck runs out, you shuffle the side deck and if you need to, draw until you have 5 cards.</p>
<p>Not Enough Cards?: If you can't draw up to five than that sucks for you. You do not win. You simply do not have 5 cards.</p>
<p>Winning the Game: In order to win, the turn must be over and you may not have any cards in your deck, side deck, or hand.</p>

<p>The idea that light is some kind of wave motion explains reflection, the change in direction, scattering, the bending or spreading out of waves, interference, and polarization in every detail. There can be little doubt about the wave nature of light and all other electromagnetic radiations. “What did Max Planck discover? He found out that matter absorbed heat and radiated light discontinuously…” (Moring, 149). In 1900, Max Planck, a German physicist found that waves do not tell the whole story. He was trying to explain how a hot object gives off radiation. In this, he found it necessary to assume radiation is sent out in little bundles, or packets, instead of in a steady stream. “To understand the quanta, imagine that you have a candy bar. This candy bar can represent energy at any frequency. You have to follow these two rules: 1. when you cut up the candy bar, it has to be divided into equal pieces with nothing left over. 2. The higher you make the energy or frequency, the fewer chunks you can cut the bar into. Following these rules, if the frequency is made higher, the energy candy bar would have to be cut up into larger pieces. That means fewer chunks are available. This means that the higher frequency waves are not produced in more abundance, because it takes less energy to produce them for any given amount energy. That’s why there are more light waves produced in the lower frequencies.” (Moring, 149-150). Each flash of energy is called Quantum (plural: quanta), and the idea suggested by Planck has now become known as the quantum theory. A single quantum of radiation energy is so small that the energy stream really seems to be steady. For example, even from such a weak source as starlight about 60, 000, 000 quanta enter your eyes each second, and the light looks perfectly steady. The startling quantum idea was accepted at first, but in time scientists found that it explained many other discoveries. It cleared up many questions about spectra that had had no answers before. Einstein was able to use the quantum theory to explain the kind of action that is now used in a photocell—a device for changing light energy into electric energy. Today physicists are forced to think of light as waves for some purposes and as quanta for other purposes. Neither idea by itself is able to explain everything that is observed. Waves explain fully what happens when radiation passes through space or through a material. But the quantum idea must be used to describe how radiation originates and what happens to it when it is absorbed in matter. Light and other kinds of electromagnetic radiation involve some of the most complicated events in nature. So it is no wonder that neither waves nor quanta alone can describe everything that is observed. Nevertheless, scientists hold out the hope that some day they may find a way to combine these two ideas into single theory that will cover everything in this field</p>

<p>Karl Terzaghi's Principle states that all quantifiable changes in stress to a soil [compression, deformation, shear resistance] are a direct result of a change in effective stress. The effective stress [σ'] is related to total stress [σ] and the pore pressure [u] by the relationship;</p>
<p>σ=σ'+u</p>
<p>Total Stress = Effective stress + Pore water pressure</p>
<p><br />
Assumptions of Terzaghi's Principle</p>
<p>1. The soil is homogenous (uniform in composition throughout)</p>
<p>2. The soil is fully saturated (zero air voids due to water content being so high)</p>
<p>3. The solid particles and water are incompressible</p>
<p>4. Compression and flow are one-dimensional (vertical axis being the one of interest)</p>
<p>5. Strains in the soil are relatively small</p>
<p>6. Darcy's Law is valid for all hydraulic gradients</p>
<p>7. The coefficient of permeability and the coefficient of volume compressibility remain constant throughout the process</p>
<p>8. There is a unique relationship, dependant of time, between the void ratio and effective stress</p>

<p>SONET bandwidth is defined in multiples of an OC-1/STS-1, each of which can tranport up to 51.84 Mbps. However, it is frequently desirable to address much smaller portions of bandwidth. To meet this need, sub-STS1 facilities called Virtual Tributaries have been defined. In North America, the VT1.5 is the most common virtual tributary because it can carry 1.728 Mbps; just enough room for a DS1/T1 signal. In Europe, the VT2 (with a data rate of 2.304 Mbps) is used to transport E1s.</p>
<p>What's the application of this technology? Some SONET manufacturers offer products that can switch at the VT1.5 level. Such equipment is able to re-arrange the data payloads so that inbound VT1.5s are placed into a completely different set of outbound STS's than the ones they arrived in. Among other things, this allows the bandwidth usage to be optimized and facilitates a cleaner network design.</p>

<p>VGChat was created in April 2001 as the official forums for the site www.world-of-nintendo.com . It was made by Jesse Smith, who is still the current admin of the site and posts as a member of the same name. The site is based around video game discussion, but the community boards are posted in more often than any other type of board. Also popular are an assortment of "weblogs", miniature boards that veteran members can request and self-moderate.</p>
<p>The site is often noted for it's self-proclaimed "wacko" admin, Jesse Smith. On April 1'st, the admin often does several "pranks" to the site, such as changing the backround to pink and switching around everyone's usernames. The next day, these changes dissapear as mysteriously as they arrived. They have annoyed several members, but seem to be a nostalgia factor for others- another example of the influence of the community.</p>

<p>An ExpressCard is a modular I/O expansion card for laptops and similar portable computing and data procesing devices. Essentially, an ExpressCard is the logical successor to PC Cards (often incorrectly called PCMCIA cards) that have been used in laptops for almost two decades. PC Cards come in two flavors, "16-bit" PC Cards, which are the architectural equivalent of an ISA-standard desktop plug-in card, and "32-bit" PC Cards (also known as "Cardbus" cards) which are the architectural equivalent of a PCI-standard desktop card. Extending this sequence, an "ExpressCard" is the logical and architectural equivalent of a PCI Express card for a portable electronic device such as a laptop.</p>
<p>Physically, an ExpressCard slot in a laptop outwardly resembles a PC Card slot, however ExpressCard slots are not backwards compatible to PC Cards. ExpressCards themselves are the same 5mm thickness as a Type II PC Card, but come in two formats neither of which has the same dimensions as a PC Card. The "ExpressCard/54" format is 54x75mm, however, it has rectangular chunk removed from one corner and thus is not rectangular, but rather has 6 edges. The "ExpressCard/34" form factor is 34x75mm, and looks kind of like a stick of gum (or, from a computer perspective, kind of like the original early Sony "Memory Stick"). Both are clearly recognizable as being different from PC Cards.</p>

<p>Robert W Kearns was the inventor of the Intermittent Windshield Wiper Systems used on most vehicles from 1969 to the present. Dr. Kearns' claim to fame was winning one of the most famous of patent cases where the little guy took down the big guys. He invented and patented the intermittent windshield wiper mechanism for use in light rain or mist and tried to interest the big auto makers in it, but they all rejected his idea. Then when they all afterward installed intermittent wipers on their cars he sued them all for patent infringement and took them all for the big bucks.</p>
<p>Kearns was included in the Forbes 400 2005 Edition, along with Allen Gant Sr. inventor of panty hose (1959), and Ray Tomlinson who invented email and the use of the @ symbol in 1971.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-24_56a7.html" title="Edit section: James Teitelbaum">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">James Teitelbaum</span></h2>
<p>James Teitelbaum was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1967. He has made his mark on virtually all of the arts, studying painting, drawing, and photography in the 1970s and 1980s, and working as a published author, a musician, and a recording engineer through the 1990s and 2000s.</p>
<p>During his unremarkable education, James became interested in music, especially in synthesizers. His purchase of a Korg Poly-800 in 1984 marked the simultaneous beginning of his careers in both music and in sound engineering.</p>
<p>Performing both as a solo artist and as member of several Cleveland-based bands, James became known for his performances and recordings with Evil Clowns, Yahoo Network (a decade before the well-known web giant existed!), and Flat Earth Society (who's chief claim to fame was opening for Front 242 in 1991).</p>
<p>Simultaneously, James had embarked an a career as a professional recording engineer, working in a multimedia facility called Internatioal Visual Communications. His success and skill at recording music lead him to leave Cleveland to persue these skills in a larger city. After a brief stint in Florida, he settled in Chicago.</p>
<p>By 1993, James was employed at the legendary Chicago Trax Recording as an engineer. After engineering several CDs for both major and indie labels, he was asked to join the band Pigface. As a member of the legendary Pigface Team '94 - widely considered to be the strongest of the bands's many, many lineups - James solidified his position in the Chicago music industry.</p>
<p>Performing 44 shows in 45 days in 43 cities with Pigface proved to be grueling, and the reclusive James discovered that the little taste of fame he experienced playing in a band of Pigface's highly visual caliber wasn't something that he enjoyed.</p>
<p>Resolving to focus on engineering over performing, James went back into the recording studio, where he launched his own studio-only musical project, Left Orbit Temple, and continued to engineer records by a variety of artists. It wasn't long before the call to the concert venue was heard once again, however. James ended up on the road - this time as an engeer - with Minstry in 1996, and then with swing revival pioneers Royal Crown Revue, and then, much later, with actor Gary Sinise's band, the Lt. Dan Band. Between these tours, James engineered about 700 shows at Chicago's Park West theatre.</p>
<p>While all of this was transpiring, another calling was percolating in the background. Since childhood, James had been interested in tribal art, and since high school, middle-20th century pop culture had been a source of fascination. These two things, combined with a taste for a good rum drink, inspired James' love for classic American Tiki bars, beginning around 1991.</p>
<p>Throughout all of his concert touring experiences, James had used days off in various cities to explore the lost relics of a once-dominant American pop phenomenon. He launched a web site dedicated to his explorations in 1995, which lead to the book Tiki Road Trip in 2003.</p>
<p>Always a writer, ever since childhood, James followed Tiki Road Trip up with the books Big Stone Head (due for publication in 2007), and Tiki Road Trip II (also listed for 2007), as well as a slew of articles for publications such as Playboy, American Heritage, Road Trip America, Tiki Magazine, and AAA World. James also co-published the legendary sci-fi 'zine Blue Harvest from 1993 to 2000.</p>
<p>As a result of the success of Tiki Road Trip, James also became involved with the planning of some of the Tiki enthusiast festivals that became the rage beginning in about 2000.</p>
<p>As of 2006, James reports that he is involved in teaching music and sound engineering in Chicago, working on new writing projects, touring with Lt Dan Band, making records whenever possible, contemplating new material by Left Orbit Temple, and traveling outside of the US a minimum of once per year</p>

<p><b>Stam1na</b> is <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finnish</a> <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_metal.html" title="Thrash metal">thrash metal</a> band from <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> the band released their first album <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Stam1na_%28album%29.html" title="Stam1na (album)">Stam1na</a></i> by Sakara Records which is founded by the <a href="../../../m/o/k/Mokoma.html" title="Mokoma">Mokoma</a> -band. Before their first offical album was released they released one self published record, many demos and <i>Kadonneet kolme sanaa</i> -single. Bands 2nd offical album <i>Uudet kymmenen käskyä</i> was published 10th of May <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-24_56a7.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Stam1na was formed in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, when the members were in their teens. The founding members of the band are Olkkonen, Velin and Hyyrynen but the core trio named Mr.Kangasmäki as a permanent member of the band in <a href="../../../n/o/v/November.html" title="November">november</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>
<p>Stam1na comes from <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemi.html" title="Lemi">Lemi</a>, a small rural town in the region of Southern Karelia, in eastern <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a>. <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemi.html" title="Lemi">Lemi</a> is one of those small places, where you don't have too many things to distract you from your hobbies if you happen to have one. Therefore Stam1na had nothing but time to rehearse endlessly, and develop their impeccable instrumental skills. Despite of being small and rural, the municipality of <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemi.html" title="Lemi">Lemi</a> has always been very friendly to aspiring musicians by for example offering them rehearsal rooms. None of the Stam1na members live in <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemi.html" title="Lemi">Lemi</a> anymore, but they still rehearse there, and they never fail to remind everyone where it all started.</p>
<p>Stam1na was one of the most anticipated unsigned acts in <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a>. Their demos were praised, and the buzz around their energetic live shows was constantly growing. It just seemed that the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finnish</a> labels weren't able to grasp Stam1na's wild concept of Finnish lyrics morphed together with speed metal riffs, progressive arrangements, and deranged approach to pop-smart melodies.</p>
<p>Eventually Stam1na was picked up by Sakara Records, the label ran by Finnish <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_Metal_163e.html" title="Thrash Metal">Thrash Metal</a> heroes <a href="../../../m/o/k/Mokoma.html" title="Mokoma">Mokoma</a>. Their collaboration started when <a href="../../../m/o/k/Mokoma.html" title="Mokoma">Mokoma</a> saw Stam1na on stage, and asked the youngsters to be the support act on their Finnish tour. Soon Stam1na became the first signing of Sakara, which had previously released only <a href="../../../m/o/k/Mokoma.html" title="Mokoma">Mokoma</a>'s material.</p>
<p>The debut <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stam1na_%28album%29.html" title="Stam1na (album)">Stam1na</a>, was released in <a href="../../../f/e/b/February.html" title="February">February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. The album got nothing but great reviews. The records buyers also appreciated the album and it spent eight weeks on the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finnish</a> album chart, and the recent single "Paha Arkkitehti" entered the charts at number four.</p>
<p>Stam1na has been called "the future of <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finnish.html" title="Finnish">Finnish</a> <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal.html" title="Metal">metal</a>" so many times that the expression is turning into a <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clich%C3%A9.html" title="Cliché">cliché</a>, but luckily not into unfounded one. The band and the album has been elected and awarded for example as the "The Most Fresh Finn Album" (Ylex), "The Most Fresh New Finn Talent" (YleX), "The Heavy Band Of The Year" (<a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumba.html" title="Rumba">Rumba</a> press), "The Finn Newcomer" (both <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumba.html" title="Rumba">Rumba</a> and Soundi readers). The band has also the Emma-award nomination in the category of "The Finn Newcomer". Stam1na won also The Mättö-Femma -award as the best heavy band.</p>
<p>February <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> band recived a call from the studio. It was time to record their next album called Uudet Kymmenen Käskyä. The studio work ended in April and the record was released 10th of <a href="../../../m/a/y/May.html" title="May">May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. Some people doubt that Stam1na could make their 2nd album better than their debut, but the album got great reviews as their first. Band also said that the album was better in all ways than their debut.</p>

<p>It is a true, but little known fact that red wine and stilton are eaten together due to the rather maggot infested nature of the cheese dating back to the eighteenth century. The wine was used as a kind of knock out blow to the maggots who when inebriated would stop wriggling and therefore make the cheese less mobile the those consuming it! Its amazing what you come up with and remember when using the Wikipedia widget on the mac for the first time don't you think?!</p>

<p>Goatchick is the transexual, cross-dressing version of Goatboy, who's story is both disturbing and eye-gougingly good (look it up while you're here). So Goatchick came into existance in a consequential meeting between JF Kennedy and the bullet that killed him. She exploded out of his left testicle and ran off into the sunset before anyone could spot her, and proceeded to knock down a building with her head. She recieved a bad headache for her troubles, and had to pop a few panadol, and then washed it down which a bag full of cannabis, a bottle of moonshine, and ten pills that turned out to be army-grade suicide pills. This proceeded to kill her, but God came down from the sky and threw her at a passer-by, who just happened to be Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln pulled out an AK-47 from under his stove-pipe hat, and proceeded to completely and utterly destroy anything that came into his line of fire, the only time when he took a break being when he reloaded.</p>
<p>Goatchick jumped off of the Eiffel Tower and landed on Abraham Lincolns haed, tore it of, and gave it to Chuck Norris, who then ate it. Chuck Norris said "yum", and then roundhouse-kicked God in the face, and sent him flying across the sea to Afghanistan. God then "tutored" the natives in his religion, and then the Arab/Christians got mad, and blew themselve to the moon and created a colonization up there and lived happily ever after.</p>
<p>Then Godzilla burst out of the ground and said hi to everyone before leaving on an all-expenses paid vacation to Hell. But, as he/she left, they managed to pull up the Eiffel Tower and imapled Goatchick on it and ate her. She died 900 BC. Then she came back to life and the natives ate her alive (like actually ate her, cut her up, cut her heart out, ate, no devoured the bloddy, gory mass that they haad cut up)!</p>

<p>69.228.150.104 03:18, 23 May 2006 (UTC) Christopher “Whatever the Hell his middle name is if he has one” Lee is a human male (although I’m not a 100% sure, he could be female). You may have guessed that Chris Lee (hereinafter referred to as The Player) is Asian. The Player’s Sexual Orientation is not a 100% clear to me. At first I thought he was straight, but then again he’s been getting awful close to Drew lately. My logical conclusion is that Chris is a Bisexual player. The player’s sexuality is fascinating (not i a gay way though, just cause he's sort of a moron). He seems to be obsessed with a certain koala picture. It is said that the picture is sexually suggestive in that it shows a koala “hugging” a tree, the tree being an erect penis. It is rumored that Chris Lee eats salad because the picture of the koala is taped to the bottom of the bowl and that he likes to eat salad so that he can glance at the image. Chris is said to love Justine, but in reality he loves Asian girls in general. It is also said that Chris likes men. Chris Lee is known to engage in excessively gay behavior mostly consisting of screaming stupid ass phrases, potentially making body contact. These phrases include Hello! Hi! Shut up! You're gay! ABCD XYZ! You do that like a geek! In addition to that he laughs at many, many things, especially when people make fun of him. The player also makes many excuses such as, "I wasn't trying!" For now THAT'S IT!</p>

He is a revolutionary in his ideals and has changed the face of entertainment/media/broadcasting with his painstaking efforts to make accessible Non-union talent in a predominately unionized world.

Brigadier was a beautiful police service horse killed in the line of duty by a motorist. For more information on "BRIGADIER'S LAW" visit brigadierslaw.ca</p>
<p>Community Policing and Law Enforcement is one of Dan's primary concerns for the community. Proper police protection for citizens and essential community services for the poor, elderly and the vulnerable, are required to ensure the community is free from predators and violence. Dan Sandor's involvement with the Community Police Liaison Committee at Toronto Police 43 Division, in the heart of Scarborough Ontario, has given him a unique opportunity to witness, first hand, the needs and wants of this community. A believer in building better communities, Dan Sandor is a member of the following community initiatives: "Brigadier's Law" - Protecting Law Enforcement Animals Community Police Liaison Committee with the Toronto Police Service CPTED - Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design Crime Stoppers Annual Plaque Program Toronto Humane Society Born in Montreal Quebec in 1972, Dan Sandor started in the voiceover/broadcasting field at the early age of 13 when he was the original rebel pirate DJ when founded a community radio station from his parents’ home in the west end of Montreal. Subsequent newspaper articles inspired the film Pump up the Volume.</p>
<p>Dan Sandor attended Champlain Regional College to study Creative Arts (Radio &amp; Television Arts and Production) and was the founder of CCTV, Champlain College Television Station, and an active participant in the college media. Through his investigative reporting he broke a police abuse/violence story that was aired on major television networks in Montreal which later received national mainstream media attention. Dan also volunteered for several years as a first responder with an Emergency Rescue Squad and attained the command rank of Lieutenant. He later moved to Toronto in 1993 where he worked as a voice announcer and later as a highway traffic act offence analyst at a provincial Law Firm.</p>

<p>Port-An-Eorna is the Gaelic name for the tiny settlement of Barleyport, situated almsotr midway betweenPlockton and the Kyle of Lochlash, in Ross-shire, Scotland, in the Western Highlands. Port-An-Eorna was once a fishing community near Duirinish, an area of common grazing for sheep and Highland cattle. Now it is a cluster of a few houses on Scottish Trust land, in an area of spectacular natural beauty. Port-An-Eorna is a natural, white sand beach covered at present by seaweed, but soon to be restored by its local residents. It enjoys a wonderful open view across to the Cuillin mountains on the Isle of Skyle, as well as vistas across Loch Carron, to the Applecross Peninsula.

<p>Yes, we don't know what will happen tomorrow, not even next minutes. isn't it? Heavy traffice, food poisioning etc all is a threats for our life. So our life is a risk for those who are depent upon us, our loving one, our parents, spouse and the cutest gift of god, our children. We are responsible for their happier and trouble free life. Therefore, we need to plan to help them, make their life easiesr, even if we are not around. I hope God will be to so cruel, but it may happen. You may not get enough time to secure their life.</p>

<p>Still, you will be wondering how our long life is a threat.</p>
<p>Let me explain-</p>
<p>Suppose, you live as long as 100 years. But you know your earning age will be 50-70 years only.

<p>Tired of all the emo and rubbish that's being played on the TV and radio these days, Rikin Palan was inspired to create a band that made quality music with musicians who actually knew how to play their instruments. Rikin was inspired by the band Children of Bodom, who he didn't really like but thought the band's name had some funny aspects to it. Rikin's favourite bands are Metallica, Megadeth and Guns N' Roses. Rikin hopes with his new band he can bring back thrash metal and to make the true metalheads happy once more. The lineup: Rikin Palan: Rhythm guitarist, singer Ardziv Simonian: Lead guitarist Stefan Siwak: Lead guitarists Brad Smith: Keyboards, backing vocals Chris Lewcyzinski: Bass guitarist George Mcneil: Drummer, faggot</p>

<p><b>Michael Bailey</b> is the Chief Executive Officer of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass_Group_617c.html" title="Compass Group">Compass Group</a>. He will step down the 31st May 2006.</p>
<p>He joined <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass_Group_617c.html" title="Compass Group">Compass Group</a> in 1993 as Group Development Director. Bailey became one of the UK’s highest-paid directors in 2003 when his total remuneration came to £2.62m, more than double the £1.26m given to chairman Sir Francis Mackay who had cut down his working hours.</p>
<p>After three profit warnings in a year and a major corruption scandal with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> procurement, Bailey came under increasing pressure to step down. A financial analyst said of Bailey, "He is now regarded as a genuine liability".</p>
<p>A recent lawsuit by Monaco based catering group ES-KO International, against the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass_Group_617c.html" title="Compass Group">Compass Group</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurest_Support_Services_4e65.html" title="Eurest Support Services">Eurest Support Services</a> (ESS), has questioned whether Michael Bailey was part of the UN procurement contracts scandal, which involved bid-rigging schemes and related illegal conduct of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass_Group_617c.html" title="Compass Group">Compass Group</a>’s subsidiary <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurest_Support_Services_4e65.html" title="Eurest Support Services">Eurest Support Services</a> and its co-conspirators. The lawsuit claims that Bailey was often in New York during the time in question and was closely involved with Compass executive <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_R._Harris_b9a9.html" title="Peter R. Harris">Peter R. Harris</a> in forging the initial business relationship between Compass, ESS and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> through its corrupt officials <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Yakovlev_8917.html" title="Alexander Yakovlev">Alexander Yakovlev</a> and <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Kuznetsov_d06e.html" title="Vladimir Kuznetsov">Vladimir Kuznetsov</a>.</p>
<p>Although the lawsuit does not name Bailey as a defendant, it says it reserves the right to do so if further investigation of the matter finds he had personal knowledge or involvement in any bid-rigging.</p>

<p>Dose of apathy are a Hardcore/metalcore from Caboolture, Brisbane which was made by now rhythm guitarist Chris Walton and drummer Josh Willes. They started jamming punk/pop punk song and covers but decided that they needed a bass player and vocalist to get this band going. They next found Daniel Petley, a up and coming bass player with alot of good ideas. The band was like this for a while but they still needed to find a vocalist. They looked hard but couldnt find anyone that suited what they were looking for. Nothing came until Josh heard Adam Gaudion singing during a school lesson. He had potential so Josh approached him to join. Adam had no musical experience but the boys thought he had potentional to become good. Time passed like this but they found that they were starting to have problems with Adam...He could sing quite well during pracs and rehersals but couldnt bring it to the performances. The last performance the band did with adam as vocalist was the St Columbans College Battle of the Bands. After this,they decided it was time to drop adam and take the band in a new direction. Now they faced a problem they faced in the bands early days...finding a vocalist. After yet another search they were shocked when one day at school,one of their close friends Tom West surprised the boys with his awesome singing voice. So with the audition of Tom, the band started to finally kick off. They were doing mostly cover gig while doing a few originals and found that they were getting a decent crowd response. But the music still wasnt what the band were hoping for so after alot of discussing and searching they decided that Hardcore was the way to go. This proved to be a good move because once they made the change, they found that they were making better music then ever before. But something still wasnt right....the lack of a lead guitarist???this is how Tyler Wely came into the scene. Long time friend of Daniel and one of the best guitarist for his age he was very muched welcomed into the band.</p>

<p><b>Ezio Testa</b> is Chief Executive Officer of <a href="../../../i/h/c/IHC_Services_10d0.html" title="IHC Services">IHC Services</a> which acts as a go-between, or “vendor intermediary” for suppliers to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>. Ezio Testa and IHC Services are involved in a bid rigging corruption scandal for the UK catering giant company, the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass_Group_617c.html" title="Compass Group">Compass Group</a>.</p>
<p>A multi-million dollar contract to provide food to UN peacekeepers was awarded to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurest_Support_Services_4e65.html" title="Eurest Support Services">Eurest Support Services</a> (ESS) a subsidiary of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass_Group_617c.html" title="Compass Group">Compass Group</a>, days after Andy Seiwert a senior executive at ESS received confidential bid information from IHC Services's CEO, Ezio Testa. At the time UN officials estimated the total value of ESS food contracts with the United Nations at $237 million, with renewals and add-ons that could reach $351 million.</p>
<p>Attached to the e-mail were commercially sensitive UN documents that no one outside of highly restricted circles within the UN was supposed to have access to; and that the contracts committee itself would not ponder for five more days.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first document was a draft of the official recommendation by the UN procurement department that a $62 million contract for UN peacekeepers in Liberia be awarded to Eurest Support Services.</li>
<li>The second document was a detailed United Nations evaluation of the technical abilities of 12 different food supply firms to meet UN requirements for feeding separate UN peacekeeping missions.</li>
<li>The third document was a detailed list of the price bids, that three of the five firms had submitted for the UN contract. The document showed that ESS had bested its nearest rival, a food services firm known as Es-Ko, by literally pennies per ration unit, and had also underbid its competitors in virtually every other service category.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such information is considered top-secret by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, and is submitted in a sealed-bid process that UN officials have touted as foolproof. Nonetheless, all this information was clearly available to the business executive who sent the e-mail: Ezio Testa.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass_Group_617c.html" title="Compass Group">Compass Group</a>'s business development executive Andy Siewert, who received Testa's e-mail had a vital interest in it. Siewert was the ESS/Compass executive described by sources close to the UN as having the most frequent day-to-day contact with the scandal-plagued UN procurement department. That contact included frequent meetings with <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Yakovlev_8917.html" title="Alexander Yakovlev">Alexander Yakovlev</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Yakovlev_8917.html" title="Alexander Yakovlev">Alexander Yakovlev</a> pleaded guilty to charges of corruption, wire fraud and money-laundering after his personal ties were exposed to IHC Services. <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Kuznetsov_d06e.html" title="Vladimir Kuznetsov">Vladimir Kuznetsov</a> Head of the UN Committee for Administrative and Budgetary Issues was also arrested and indicted after taking nearly $1 million in bribes from the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass_Group_617c.html" title="Compass Group">Compass Group</a>.</p>
<p>Competitors ES-KO and Supreme Food Services AG have initiated lawsuits claiming violation of the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_5fbe.html" title="Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations</a> (RICO) Act, the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherman_Antitrust_Act_5918.html" title="Sherman Antitrust Act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a> and New York State's Donnelly Act regulating free trade.

<p>The Tomorrow River is a branch of the Waupaca River and is a Native American word which means tomorrow. It was a good trout stream before the mill was constructed but a new day has risen on the river and through hard work of dam removal and restoration it is a great trout stream again. The river has a muck bottom in areas, bolders, trees and shallow sandy areas. You will cross under an old RxR bridge now the Tomorrow River Bike Trail before you reach Cate Park, located in Amherst, Wi The pullout at Cate Park is hard but there is a lot of parking. If you continue south there is a Portage County Park landing on the east edge of the Amherst Pond. From Amherst the river continues south east and flows to the Waupaca River making it part of the Great Lakes Watershed.</p>

<p><b>IHC Services Inc</b> is a vendor intermediary company aiding suppliers win <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> contracts.</p>
<p>IHC was until recently a registered vendor to the UN procurement department, acting both as a contractor selling goods directly to the world body and as a go-between, or vendor intermediary for a number of other suppliers. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurest_Support_Services_4e65.html" title="Eurest Support Services">Eurest Support Services</a> (ESS), a subsidiary of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass_Group_617c.html" title="Compass Group">Compass Group</a>, won a multi-million dollar contract to provide food to UN peacekeepers in Liberia five days after Andy Seiwert a senior executive at ESS, received confidential bid information from IHC Services CEO, <a href="../../../e/z/i/Ezio_Testa_aeb3.html" title="Ezio Testa">Ezio Testa</a>. IHC Services, a second supplier to the United Nations, acted as a consultant to ESS helping it win more than $240m (£140m) worth of contracts since 2000. <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_R._Harris_b9a9.html" title="Peter R. Harris">Peter R. Harris</a>, Andy Seiwert and Doug Kerr, top-ranking executives at ESS, were all dismissed for actions relating to dealings with IHC Services.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_R._Harris_b9a9.html" title="Peter R. Harris">Peter R. Harris</a> was sacked as boss of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass_Group_617c.html" title="Compass Group">Compass Group</a> in the UK, Ireland and Middle East and Africa, for allegedly asking Compass senior management if he could raise money to buy IHC Services. Harris was allegedly told that it would be inappropriate, as it would present a conflict of interest with his role as head of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurest_Support_Services_4e65.html" title="Eurest Support Services">Eurest Support Services</a>. Freshfields and E&amp;Y concluded after their three-month investigation, that Harris then worked with an investment consortium that granted him power of attorney to complete the deal. Mr Harris joined the board of Alliance International Development, the company that took control of IHC Services.</p>
<p>Around the same time, IHC Services twice temporarily employed the son of a UN procurement officer <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Yakovlev_8917.html" title="Alexander Yakovlev">Alexander Yakovlev</a> - who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering in August after receiving money from "foreign companies" seeking to secure contracts with the UN.</p>
<p>IHC’s Chief Executive Officer, <a href="../../../e/z/i/Ezio_Testa_aeb3.html" title="Ezio Testa">Ezio Testa</a>, has denied any wrongdoing. In recent interview, Testa was emphatic that IHC did no business with the scandal-wracked Oil-for-Food program, and was not registered as an Oil-for-Food vendor. International caterer <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compass_Group_617c.html" title="Compass Group">Compass Group</a> has said it is one of a number of US suppliers that has received a subpoena from US authorities investigating millions of dollars of bribery at the United Nations.</p>
<p>There was a private sale of IHC on June 3, 2005, just as the procurement scandal was about to break. It now appears that while doing business with the UN, IHC had links both to <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>’s old sanctions-busting networks, and to a Liechtenstein-based businessman, Engelbert Schreiber, Jr., known among other things for his ties to a figure designated by the UN itself as a financier of <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaeda_fab2.html" title="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a>. IHC itself turns out to have a connection with Saddam’s former networks by way of a shipping company based in Jordan, Petra Navigation Group which advertises itself on its Web site as IHC’s agent in the Middle East, and has also been a registered vendor to the UN since mid-2003.</p>
<p>By 1997, Giandomenico Picco had signed on as an IHC director. He was a veteran of many years on the UN staff, but at that time working in the private sector. Just before leaving the UN, Picco had also led a round of the early negotiations with Saddam Hussein’s regime over setting up the UN Oil-for-Food program in Iraq. Later that same year, Picco left the UN and founded his own private consulting business. His arrival on IHC’s board came at roughly the same time that IHC appears to have first established ties to the UN. On Dec. 22, 1996, according to the UN, the company was registered on the UN Procurement Department’s list of approved vendors. That was the same month that the UN Oil-for-Food program began operation in Iraq. From 1998 until at least February, 2000, Picco went on to serve as chairman of the board of IHC Services.</p>

<p>Kuznetsov was indicted in September 2005. He was charged with laundering money (at least $1m in bribes from foreign companies seeking contracts with the world body). He is said to have laundered this money on behalf of Russian UN Procurement officer <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Yakovlev_8917.html" title="Alexander Yakovlev">Alexander Yakovlev</a>, from UN Procurement contracts (notably Compass Group’s subsidiary <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurest_Support_Services_4e65.html" title="Eurest Support Services">Eurest Support Services</a>) and Oil-for-Food. Vladimir Kuznetsov has also been named in recent lawsuits by Swiss catering group Supreme Foodservice AG, and Monaco-based Es-Ko International, relating to the UN Procurement contracts.</p>
<p>Kuznetsov set up an offshore company, Moxyco, and opened a bank account in its name in the Caribbean island of Antigua. Yakovlev then transferred the funds into that account between 2000 and 2005. After Yakovlev told him of the secret payments, Kuznetsov agreed to take a share of the money rather than turn him in to the authorities. He was arrested by the <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a>, and pleaded not guilty at an arraignment in Manhattan federal court. He was released on a $1.5 million bond and agreement to surrender his travel documents.</p>
<p>Russian authorities paid to have Kuznetsov released from the Manhattan prison; however he must remain under house-arrest during the court proceedings, until at least April 2006, when the next court session will be held. All Kuznetsov’s movements are being monitored by electronic bracelet.</p>

<p>Kuznetsov was elected to a three-year term on the budget advisory committee in January 2003. The prestigious panel’s 15 members, including a representative of the United States, then elected him as its chairman. He has worked in various budget-related positions in the U.N. Secretariat and the Russian Mission since 1980. The chairman is the only member of the ACABQ to draw a UN salary and benefits, and also gets diplomatic immunity. Committee members are not UN employees and do not normally enjoy diplomatic immunity. But the General Assembly granted him immunity because of his chairmanship. This diplomatic immunity was waived however, in August 2006, by the UN.</p>

<p>lexander Yakovlev: In June, Manhattan prosecutors charged UN Procurement officer Yakovlev with having participated in laundering bribes from contractors in exchange for insider information under the food-for-oil program. Yakovlev was released till the date of the verdict on acknowledgement of guilt and agreement to cooperate. Yakovlev gave away certain top-ranked officials of the U.N., including Vladimir Kuznetsov. Yakovlev claims that Kuznetsov helped him to launder the money he received for bribes, for which he paid him a share on condition that he did not report him or the activity.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-24_56a7.html" title="Edit section: Adrian Waller">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Adrian Waller</span></h2>
<p>Adrian Waller has enjoyed a busy career as one of North America's most successful magazine journalists and authors. He earned a living from some 16 published books, nearly 600 articles in North America's best-known magazines including Time and Reader's Digest, and from numerous newspaper columns that appeared in Britain, Canada, and Japan. He was also well known in Canada as an actor, theatre director, and opera tenor, having made two LPs, Adrian Waller Sings and A World of Song<br />
Waller was born in West Wickham, Kent, England, in June 1936, where he held down a series of menial jobs (barman, factory worker, and printing company packer) to earn money for music and drama studies in London, England. By his early 20s he had performed in numerous plays there and was already a sought-after young concert tenor. Soon, however, he succumbed to another passion – writing – and became a reporter on a small newspaper in Sheerness, Kent, singing where he could to earn extra money.<br />
In 1963 Waller settled in Canada as a journalist, working first for the Chronicle-Herald and Mail-Star in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Soon he moved to Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario, to write for such papers as The Hamilton Spectator, The Toronto Telegram, and the Globe &amp; Mail. During this period, he gave many recitals both “live” and on CBC radio, acted in nearly 60 plays, sang with the Canadian Opera Company, and recorded his LPs of popular opera arias and songs. As a theatre director later, he staged nearly 50 productions, and won several best-director awards.<br />
This work continued through the 1970s and much of the 1980s -- while Waller was writing for The Montreal Gazette, Time, and Reader’s Digest, where he became a roving editor (senior writer). As a magazine journalist he covered a wide selection of important topics but won special acclaim for his profiles of literally hundreds of famous people including the great tenors Luciano Pavarotti and Jon Vickers, popular singers Paul Anka, Hank Snow, and Wilf Carter, actors Kate Reid and Donald Sutherland, orchestra conductors Charles Dutoit and Seiji Ozawa, movie director Norman Jewison, bandleader Guy Lombardo, and the renowned portrait photographer Yousuf Karsh.<br />
In the early 90s, when he was in his 50s, Waller earned a Ph.D. in English (a degree awarded cum laude in Iowa, U.S.A.), and taught journalism, non-fiction writing, and theater arts at several Canadian colleges and universities. Between 1991 and 1997 he made 28 trips to Japan where he lectured widely and gave recitals in Tokyo and Yokohama. At one point he painted water colors for an art gallery and appeared on stage as a classical pianist.<br />
When a television interviewer asked him why he had done so many different things with his frenetic life, Dr. Waller replied, “ I have always believed that success is not a line rising diagonally through a man’s life, where he starts as an office boy and struggles all his life to become the president, and has a heart attack on the way, it is a circle. Man is in the middle of that circle and his success is measured by all the things he can develop on its circumference – health, imagination, passion, intuition, and an ability to communicate widely, in different forms, with lots of people.”<br />
An intensely private man , Adrian Waller has become something of a recluse in recent years. He and his wife live in both Montreal, Quebec, and Hallandale Beach, Florida.</p>

Since late 2005, the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allianz.html" title="Allianz">Allianz</a> AG is founding partner of dropping knowledge and will support this project at least until 2007. By linking dropping knowledge to the company’s competences and existing <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporate_Social_Responsibility_7cad.html" title="Corporate Social Responsibility">CSR</a> projects, Allianz will also take dropping knowledge findings as opportunity to initiate new sustainable projects, based on specific issues and learnings from the living library dialogue. <a href="http://knowledge.allianz.com/" class="external free" title="http://knowledge.allianz.com/" rel="nofollow">http://knowledge.allianz.com/</a></p>

<p>In 2003, Schmerberg worked in the United States before and during the Iraq war. Deeply impressed by the emerging peace movement, he decided to support the demand for peace and to realize what he and the other two co-founders had in mind when they first met in New York: to build an innovative platform, bringing together free thinkers and independent speakers from around the world, to create a modern form of peaceful communication and activism, <b>dropping knowledge</b> -- the table of free voices. Ralf Schmerberg lives in Berlin und is worldwide represented by @radical media. He is the CEO of dropping knowledge.</p>

<p>During the last three years, dropping knowledge researched and contacted more than 1,000 inspiring individuals from all over the world (the so called “free voices” and ambassadors for the project), from less known local artists to Nobel laureates. Suggestions for this Free Voices database were made by online visitors on dk website, supporters and an international advisory board.</p>
<p>In September 2006, dropping knowledge will host 112 selected individuals at the Table of Free Voices. With their choice of participants for the Table, the founders of dropping knowledge assume full responsibility for ensuring the diversity – cultural, professional in age and gender and otherwise – of the Table and its relevance to the global public.</p>

<p>Gustav Van Ferike was a genius within his own right! He is seen by many men as the founder of enzyme extraction. With out his dedicated work, to the study of these extraction of enzymes we would have trouble. Many say he was a 'crazy old fool' who stole his work. But this is far from the truth. The modern day extraction on enzymes may differ slightly from the Van Ferike process. But it has given fundamental steps to the process.</p>
<p>The Van Ferike process, is for removing enzymes from within the bacterium cell. Aka Intracellular enzymes. Gustav, or Gussy as he friends called him. Used a method grinding the cell. He found that his enzyme was present, but he needed to purify it. To do this he centrifuged it, and found the enzyme layer.</p>
<p>Although Gussy's work seems simple and silly, his first step, has help lead to form the modern world. He may not have been a famous man, but his process, is commonly talked about</p>
<p>Van Ferike Day: is the 28Th of May</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thepsychotichour.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.thepsychotichour.com/" rel="nofollow">The Psychotic Hour</a>, now a global comedy podcasting sensation, began humbly enough in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>, Quebec in the mid 1980s. Initial radio broadcasts by producer <a href="http://www.alanrhodes.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alanrhodes.com/" rel="nofollow">Alan Rhodes</a> were a pastiche of sound sculptures and sketch comedy, often jarring in their juxtaposition, drawing on such diverse influences and <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dadaism.html" title="Dadaism">Dadaism</a>, musique contrete and <a href="../../../o/r/s/Orson_Welles_8fe7.html" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a>.</p>
<p><br />
They attracted a small but loyal late-night Montreal audience on the far right of the AM dial.</p>
<p><br />
By the 1990s the program was more widely available, having moved to a much hipper home on the FM band. Canadians from coast to coast were afforded a taste of The Psychotic Hour when selected excepts were aired on CBC radio. When the expected fame and riches failed to follow national exposure, the show was put on hiatus.</p>
<p><br />
In late 2004, The Psychotic Hour resumed operations. Eschewing radio for the net-based technology of the 21st Century proved to be a wise decision. The Tph of today continues it's tradition of high production values combined with the worse puns in the Northern Hemisphere. Now more popular than ever, anyone, anywhere can now subject themselves to The Psychotic Hour.</p>
<p><br />
Though many notables have appeared on Tph (including <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sanford_Moore_01a7.html" title="John Sanford Moore">John Sanford Moore</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simone_Denny_1c23.html" title="Simone Denny">Simone Denny</a>), persistent rumours of an upcoming film project have been routinely dismissed as erroneous by staff members.</p>

<p>Dave Nitsche is a conceptual Photographer based in Southern Illinois, USA. His work with common household items to show emotion or ideas has become known around the world.</p>
<p>Photography began for Dave about 4 years ago. He started taking pictures just for fun but it soon became on way of life spending most of his free time creating images. Some simple, some extremely complex but all showing what was going on inside his head.</p>
<p>Dave's images are steeped in traditional photographic means although he shoots mostly digital. Photomanipulation is not something that he uses. Software to him is like a traditional darkroom and he uses it as such. If an image needs more than basic work to it he just reshoots the image. While he is a fan of digital art for him creating the image in camera is as important as the final work itself.</p>
<p>His work has been shown in Galleries and magazines around the globe including the USA, China, Japan, Australia, UK, Spain, Portugal, Romania and Germany.</p>

<p>Discovered in 1876 on the Comoros Islands by famed Dutch Botanist Leonid Van Zwaans, the Pygmy Marmagoose is the only known relative of both the Mongoose and Weasel Family. The discovery was confirmed in 1892 by French Zoologist Emile Orenstein. Since then, the seclusion of the Pygmy Marmagoose has given it little exposure to mainstream attention. It remains among the most obscure of species. The small population has added to this. Numbering in the hundreds, the Comoros Species of Pygmy Marmagoose.</p>
<p>However, the Arctic Frosted Marmagoose survives in greater number due to a recent predator decrease over the course of the last century. Roaming the Yukon Territory, the scavenger family of Marmagoose bears similarities to it's cousins thousands of miles away. The relationship has yet to be explained between these two rare creatures.</p>
<p>Numerous expeditions have taken place both in the Comoros Islands and the Yukon Territory so as to uncover the mysteries between the Pygmy and Arctic Frosted Marmagoose. It's hoped that greater media attention will lend to a furthering of study on these bizzare creatures.</p>

<p>Member of the Georgia Institute of Technology's (Georgia Tech) 2006-07 Men's Basketball team. Will be a redshirt freshman in the Fall of 2006. Stands 6-feet, 8-1/2-inches, DOB: 1985, weighs a "razor-thin" 208 pounds, and plays combo-forward positions. Possesses a great feel for the game. Ridiculously long and skilled. Will be an impact guy, who can step-out, has three-point range, can put the ball on the floor and get to the basket, and is also a versatile defender. Reminicient of Mike Dunleavy, formerly of the Dook University and, now, the Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>A native of the port city of Dakar, Senegal (pop.- 1.5 million) on the west coast of the African continent. Played on that country's national basketball team prior to the 2005 season. Previously ranked as the #3 junior AAU basketball player in all of Africa and ranked as the #7 "NBA potential" list at the "Africa Without Borders" basketball camp. An older brother, named Assane Faye, played forward from 1998 to 2002 (tri-captain) on the varisty basketball team at the University of New Hampshire. Another older half-brother, named Mohamed Niang, was a 6'10" center and played through 2002 on the varsity basketball team at the University of Delaware. At Georgia Tech, started taking classes in the fall of 2005. Majoring in INTA, with a Management minor.</p>
<p>Widely reported by the press in his native, french-speaking Senegal, "...Mohamed (sp) Faye (Rail) est actuellement aux Etats-Unis où il fréquente l'une des plus grandes universités. Il s'adapte et devrait commencer à jouer l'année prochaine...."</p>
<p>Sat out the 2005-06 basketball season, having not received academic clearance to play from the ruling National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Practiced with the team during the 2006 spring semester. Recognized by Head Basketball Coach Paul Hewitt as a named factor in the talents of the new players to be added to the 2006-07 roster, ie. "....plus Mouhammad Faye." What else to expect, asks YahooSports? The mystery still remains on Faye. Just how good will he be in the Georgia Tech rotation? Hewitt has raved about Faye from working with him in practice all season long and spoke highly of the freshman's work ethic, tenacity on defense and overall raw potential. But will his practice antics translate into success in a very talented conference next year? And where will the minutes come from? A lot of unanswered questions still remain on the Faye front. Acknowledged by much-heralded McDonalds High School All-American power forward and incoming Georgia Tech Freshman Thaddeus Young, as one who "can play the game. He will shock a lot of people."</p>
<p>Dubbed "GT's Mystery Man!" Nicknamed "Muha" by teammates. Thought to have x-ray vision, as well as the ability to freeze time. More than lovable Aussie Center Luuuke Schenscher, of GT's 2001-05 MBB teams, who had his own "possee," the idolized Faye has a cult, is a message board cult hero or, moreso, "Faye is The Cult." Fans already realize that for the elusive Muha, "none of us are witnesses."</p>
<p>The evolving "Legend of The Fayebulous," who has yet to be witnessed in any photographs or videos, has begun to grow exponentially "On the Flats" of the GT Campus, within the ATL sporting community, and beyond the farthest reaches of the universe....well, make that of the internet, sans Athens, GA.</p>
<p>Among the recently, most noted Fayebulous Legends are:</p>
<p>1. One time, after saving the world, Mouhammad was late for his team’s final game of the season. He arrived in the nick of time with his team down by 4 with .7 seconds left on the clock. The other team, knowing that their chances of winning had completely disappeared, tried to intentionally foul Faye by raking his eyes rather than let him score two 3-pointers in the time left. It was, however, too late… They fouled him just as Faye hit the full court shot. Still blinded, Faye refused to be taken out of the game and calmly made the two intentional foul shots helping his team win the game. Afterwards, the other team’s coach walked up to him and told Faye that he must have ice in his veins. To which Mouhammad replied, “Nope, sulfuric acid.” Then Faye left to save the world again.</p>
<p>2. Scientists incorrectly believe the hole in ozone was caused by green house gases. It was, in fact, created when Mouhammad broke through the atmosphere the first time he tried to dunk the ball at age 2. He has learned to gauge his hops better and has not broken through since.</p>
<p>3. There was no light until Mouhammad first opened his eyes. Everything was pitch black up until that point.</p>
<p>4. Mouhammad blinks his eyes over 25 million times per second. He has to. If he looks at you for longer than 1/1 millionth of a second, you will vaporize.</p>
<p>5. Death looks over his shoulders to make sure that Mouhammad is not standing there.</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>7. Saturn used to be just rings. Mouhammad thought it looked so much like a basketball hoop that he dunked a planet there. It has been that way ever since. (In case you are wondering, he jumped through the same hole in the ozone that he created when he was 2. It was difficult because it did not exactly line up with the Saturn rings, but Mouhammad felt guilty about the first hole and did not want tot create another one.)</p>
<p>8. A mountain range once tried to pick a fight with Mouhammad. That mountain range was called the Grand Mountain Range. It is now called the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>9. Mouhammad is the reason why the Earth turns on its axis. Before Mouhammad, the Earth just stood there. Mouhammed ran around the earth so fast that he caused it to start its rotation.</p>
<p>10. Faye cannot time travel. He does not have to. Time asks Faye permission to move backwards or forwards.</p>
<p>11. The last person to question Mouhammad’s power was Jimmy Hoffa. Enough said!</p>
<p>12. As an Inter-Continental Ball Mauler, he sets off NORAD everytime he dunks. NORAD had to call Russia to assure them that the US wasn't launching an ICBM from Atlanta, when Faye recently went up for a rebound in a pickup game.</p>
<p>13. Former Yellow Jackets Captain Clarence Moore (aka "C-Mo") is said to have inspired Faye's adopted, and oft-misspelled, first name, "Mouhammad." During a fiery, players-only meeting, C-Mo went into a tyraid over a certain teammate's lack of "help-the-helper" defense. In response, street-smart Will "The Thrill" Bynum sacrastically queried, "Mo, uh, am mad? Right?" Yes, Mo was mad all right...leave it that Bynum never queried Mo again. Any doubters of the Fayebulous must likewise keep silent or suffer his wrath...and never sarcastically query, "Mouhammad, right?"</p>
<p>14. A low-life winky-dinky Wikipedia reviewing peon, named "Kuzaar" (no doubt a kin to Coach Krazy of Puke) had the audacity to "DECLINE" listing this article in "The Free Encyclopedia." "Decline. Article is mostly nonsense, and the last section reads like a series of those loathsome Chuck Norris jokes. Kuzaar 19:46, 17 May 2006 (UTC)" The uproar from the loyal GT masses could be heard almost instanteously: "Declined? No one declines Muha! No one reclines Muha! No One inclines Muha! Basically don't bring any "clines" near Muha if you know what's good for you." Rumors of the impending censure and demise of "The Free Encyclopedia" immediately began circulating across the internet (ie. the Hive, anyway.)</p>
<p>15. He sees the future and sets its course and knows that the applause he will get the first time he jogs to check-in as a GT Yellow Jacket on Cremins Court at Alexander Memorial Coliseum with be unimaginably deafening. He has put the National Guard on notice.</p>
<p>16. It is understood by his followers that Faye doesn't like Country and Western and he doesn't like dead people either.</p>
<p>17. Faye started this. And he will end it.</p>
<p>18. The fate of Kuzaar is a growing concern among the Yellow Jacket fan base. The concensus is that "he is 'toast!'"</p>
<p>19. Kuzaar "made his bed"...Muha will knock him into it. A "universal memory dump" will erase all of Kuzaar from all of time.</p>
<p>20. After being offered the Head BB coaching job at NC State Wednesday, Faye let out a huge roaring laugh, injuring four members of the press and knocking down powerlines throught Northeast Ga. Rolling Blackouts were reported as far away as West Virginia. After his laughter subsided, Faye remarked to the NC State athletic director that "Ha! You would do anything to not have to have the Wolfpack face me on the hardwood, wouldn't you?" He then b -slapped the NC official into unconciousness as a lesson to all who would insult him thusly.</p>
<p>21. People have noticed something strange about all those who have stated that they have actually seen Muha play. No ardent behind-the-scenes followers GT MBB have been able to frown or say anything bad of our "Mystery Man." It's been reported that a cousin of a friend of one fan who heard about someone who saw Muha play can now only talk about basketball. All other sports seem to be irrelevant to him, now.</p>
<p>22. Those who stare directly at him, while making a play, have their heads immediately explode due to the sheer talent. Medical reasearchers at the Emory Medical college are working on special glasses to prevent this messy side effect. As an incentive for increased giving, A-T is making available special glasses with a rapture filter to all A-T members with 500+ points. These fans can gaze on Faye's prowess without fear of cranial eruption. Members with 50 to 500 points will be given hand mirrors with which to observe Faye over their shoulders while sitting backwards in their seats. Under 50 point members and students will be given ear and nose plugs.</p>
<p>23. Aside from long arms, his primary talent is that he can create seams in the space time continuum. This allows him to warp, or translaocate himself from one end of the court to the other in the blink of an eye. Don't be surprised if the averages 40+ fast break points per game and 12-13 blocks. Warping the space time continuum makes the clock irrelevant to the game, thus giving the team the additional benefit of never worrying about running out the clock or running out of time as Faye can "back to the future" a last second shot as many times as necessary to let it go in. We control the time component in the game. This has been attempted once before with great success by a crack team of Behind the Iron Curtain Scientists. Hence the name: The&#160;:"Faye - 72 Russian Olympic Team Effect".</p>
<p>24. Its Muha's ability to control minds that amazes most people and will change the approach to the game. Dickie V. has already named him the only daiper dandy for '06/07, but after seeing Faye this year, he was unable to speak for the rest of the game. ESPN called it a throat problem, but we know the real reason. A cousin of the friend of a fan who once saw Faye said that he has found oil and prices will drop tomorrow.</p>
<p>25. It's been rumored that McDonald's High School All-American PG Jaravis Crittenton has said he is going to redshirt because of Faye's crazy good PG skills. Folks won't even remember who that guy "MJ" guy was.</p>
<p>26. The Carolina, Duke, Wake and Maryland internet boards show that thre is little, if any, realization of the impending Muha season around the ACC. Not one mention of his name at any of those sites. Of course, mentioning of his name can incite terrorist-like violence? They fear to speaketh the name of the demon, lest he appear and reave their very souls from their bodies...Not to mention light them up for triple-doubles..... In the first half.</p>
<p>27. Faye turns the snakes on Medusa's head to stone when they look directly at him.</p>
<p>28. Last week, while visiting the Vatican one loyal GT fan sat down with the Pope to talk about religion. He told the Pope that he was not sure that he believed in God, but that he was scared of Him. The Pope responded by saying, "I believe in God, but the only thing that scares me is Muhammed Faye!" The fan then turned to Kaiser Sose, as his head exploded at the mere mention of Faye's name.</p>
<p>29. Faye played a game of 1:2 against both Superman and Batman, at the same time. The loser had to wear his underwear on the outside of his clothes.</p>
<p>30. In public forums with GT fans, Coach Paul Hewitt has mentioned Faye briefly. All he has said was that he's another new player, he has practiced this past year with the team and he is now eligible to play. CPH said he definitely benefited greatly from the year of practice and will contribute. He did NOT mention his 145 inch vertical jump, his 84% 3-point shooting percentage, or his ability to walk on water. (That's shooting from the opposite 3 point line, of course!)</p>
<p>31. Faye's "Fission Vision" has proved to be a problem for Mouhammad lately. He has recently acquired from Los Alamos a pair of Atomic Diffuser goggles until he learns to blink. Growing up he never blinked and consequentially contributed to the growth of the Sahara near his native land. After vaporizing most of North Georgia's BB goals he was forced to face Florida while dribbling up court in pick up games. This was discontinued, however, when forest fires started raging out of control there recently. Argonne National Laboratory is now working on developing his anti fusion goggles next so when Faye has a cup of coffee in the morning after he has a good night's sleep he doesn't turn the training table into the surface of the sun. Argonne Labs has requested that no one associated with Faye surprise, shock, or present him with any incredible material that may cause a wide-eyed response until these goggles are fully developed. Because of this, Faye is no longer permitted to view BOTD posts on the Hive's Water Cooler.</p>

<p>The Clash of the Titans is a guild in the online game Guild Wars. The Clash of the Titans guild tag is [TITN] they have been around for about 7 months. The leader who started the guild is Pan Musefist. The Titans are big in PvE (person vs. environment), And enjoy helping members accomplish that which needs done.<br />
In Guild Wars: Factions, the Titans joined up with the Blackblade guild [BkBld[, starting a guild alliance. The Blackblades soon gained control of Cavalon and invited new guilds to join this alliance. Having gained enough faction points to hold the captial city of Cavalon, the Blackblades then turned their attention from GvG (guild vs. guild), and began to work the alliance more and more to prevent other alliances like The Crusaders [TC] from gaining control. The Blackblades enforced strict rules, such as not selling items gained from the special area that they held. Ultimately this tactic failed and the Blackblades were forced to let this rule lax. After about 2 weeks [TC] took control of Cavalon. The Blackblades upset with this outcome, turned to the other guilds in the alliance for more help, requesting guilds like the Titans work harder to gain more Faction Points.<br />
Finally fed up with the Blackblades, for not listening to what they had to say, and not being a responsible enough alliance, the Titans left. Looking back at all that they had done for the alliance, the Titans decided that a game is meant to be played and not worked. The Titans have currently started a new alliance made up of guilds wanting to enjoy the game.<br />

<p>Norway's Ram-Zet originally began as a one-man project in 1998 by mastermind Zet in order to bring his own musical visions to life after having played in numerous assorted bands (including an outfit called MFM with former Artch singer Eric Hawk). The first core line-up, with Solem (Bass) and Küth (Drums), banded together prior to the recording session of Ram-Zet's debut album, Pure Therapy (released in September 2000). Combining various elements ranging from the chaotic rage of Black Metal, a great sense for melody to some rather progressive structuring and mechanized rhythms of Industrial music, the band creates a flawless hybrid with an ability to maintain stylistic integrity heightened by genre-bending ingenuity. Also amongst their sonic arsenal, Ram-Zet use and abuse different noises and loops to effectively add an atmosphere to the proceedings. And in an unexpected yet clever twist, the group do not limit themselves by using exclusive, sampled synthesizer material. Instead, they have a graceful violinist in their ranks and utilize a real choir for their recordings! Ram-Zet's new album, Escape, was once again recorded at their personal Space Valley Studio in Norway and later mixed by Mikko Karmila at Finnvox Studios in Finland (Nightwish, Children Of Bodom, Moonspell, etc.) for boosted sound quality. Escape continues Ram-Zet's musically challenging soundscape tradition and turns out to be the band's tightest offering to date (mainly due to the fact that a complete line-up was involved in Escape's writing process). Zet's psychotic vocals are more imposing than ever before while in contrast, Sfinx's and Sareeta's beautiful vocals and the harmonious violins gracefully colour the guitar melodies. In addition, the rhythm-section blasts incredibly juicy rhythmics complemented by the occasional infectious sample-loop. Intricate, unique and with a hint of pure extremity: Ram-Zet!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Current line-up: Zet (Flemming Rammseth) - Vocals, Guitar Sfinx (Miriam Elisabeth Renvåg) - Vocals Sareeta (Ingvild Johannesen) - Vocals, Violin (Ásmegin) Lars - Bass Kuth - Drums (The Kovenant) Magnus Østvang - Keyboards</p>

<p>The [[<b>American Church in Paris</b>]] is the first American church established outside the United States. It started in 1814, when it was officially chartered and the first sanctuary was built in 1857. The present site located on 65 Quai d'Orsay 75007, Paris dates back to 1930. In the beginning, the American Church was an interdenominational <a href="../../../f/e/l/Fellowship.html" title="Fellowship">fellowship</a>, theologically situated in the historic Christian tradition as symbolized by the Apostles' Creed. Throughout its history, it has served not only the expatriate American community, but a wide variety of English-speaking people from different countries and denominational backgrounds who find a hospitable spiritual home and connection that enhances their faith experience while living and working in France. The American church in Paris is indeed a “church of all nations”, that prides itself in the appellation “God’s own United Nations Organisation” with people from over nearly 50 nations and 35 Christian denominations worshiping every Sunday in its Sanctuary. In fact, it is a marvelous experience to receive communion in the Church of Jesus Christ from all nations - residents of Paris, along with visitors, represent many cultures, races, languages, and denominational traditions.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">Church</a> is led in worship by the senior pastor, the associate pastor, the youth pastor and retired a pastor who handles all weddings. The American Church in Paris is indeed blessed with energetic and talented people from diverse backgrounds and Christian faiths who serve on the church council represented by committee of ministries namely: Congregational Nurture, Christian Education, Development, Finance, Membership and Evangelism, Property, Social Concerns,[ <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewardship.html" title="Stewardship">Stewardship</a>] and Worship and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">Music</a>. With a multi-faceted mission and rich in history, the American [Church in Paris] serves as one of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_heritage_sites.html" title="World heritage sites">world heritage sites</a> and community centre, providing space and resources for a variety of community activities and groups. More than 2000 people use its resource and facilities everyday. The building hosts two bilingual nursery schools, a variety of "twelve step" recovery groups, aerobic classes, kung fu, basketball leagues, a free concert series, an "Ad Board" for housing and job opportunities, and many more community-based services are housed in the building under the auspices of our non-profit association, the Franco-American Community Center in Paris.

Davey von Bohlen has been the founder of two big emo bands; Cap'n' Jazz that he formed in 1990 with friends Tim Kinsella, Mike Kinsella, Sam Zurick and Victor Villareal. Davey stayed with Cap'n'Jazz until he got bored; then in 1995, he formed the influential band, The Promise Ring with Jason Gnewikow, Dan Didier, and Scott Schoenbeck. The Promise Ring led by von Bohlen is probably one of the most influential emo bands ever. bands like Dashboard Confessional, Outsmarting Simon, Park, Mae, Copeland and many others claim Davey von Bohlen and The Promise Ring as a major influence. Sadly for emo kids everywhere 2002 was the year that von Bohlen broke up The Promise Ring. Memebers went onto do different things. Dan Didier and Davey von Bohlen teamed up with former Dismemberment Plan bass player, Eric Axelson to form the band Maritime. Maritime released a new cd on april 18,2006. Axelson has left the band to be replaced by Justin Klug</p>

Course, ya know this is just my personal opinion and well, lets just say its from life experience. Ill be, uhh,,... ill be fine with that. Yeah, thats good. Bravo CCC, Bravo. (fyi ccc is chili cheese chipsm just if its a bit confusing its its its its not a rock band its not any type of uhh pop culture you know)(its not the kkks retarded sister, or actually of any genetic predesposition of the kkk at all. Basically its just simply chili cheese chips. Thanks. I really dont want to stress any more how the CCC is simply chili on chips with cheese. Well i guess you could thus call it the CoCwC, but lets be honest with ourselves thats thats just not quick like if this was 1984 thats not newspeak.) oh yaeh and virginia is a biatch today. But thats aside the point. k? good good. Im happy we've reached this verdict of the CCC. Its its a good thing, just go enjoy it. K</p>

<p>Offender was created by Ole U. Lund and Simen Tanggård in the summer of 2001 after a long friendship. Later Sondre B. Ødegaard joined on drums. In 2005 Lars G. Fremmerlid (son of Norwegian Opera singer Magne Fremmerlid) joined on guitar. The band is mostly a punk rock band, but each member loves listening to other kinds of music. And that can be heard on the songs. The first real inspiration, was the american pop-punk group blink 182. But they listen to other artists as Rancid, Transplants, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Descendents, Misfits, Alkaline Trio +++</p>

<p><b>FES (Flexible Enery Solutions Ltd.)</b> is a fictional business used in the Case Study of the Business Strategy module in the OCR Summer 2006 Business Studies examination. The business deals in providing portable energy generators using wind and solar chargers. FES is owned by John Mayall and Mick Taylor. John set up the business and ran it in a rather informal style until Mick insisted that he should incorporate the business. Despite not wanting to deal with the formality of paperwork, John took Mick's advice and FES became an incorporated company in 1989. John is the majority shareholder with 7000 shares, whilst Mick has only 1000 shares.</p>
<p>At present, FES is a rather successful business, despite being small in size, although it is facing some problems. One being that John, seeking to avoid paperwork and formality, chooses to put the happiness of his staff above the success of the business. For this reason, John has set no objectives for FES. The second problem is that John wants to see all the profits of the business going back into the business to be invested in new machines and the like to make life easier for his staff. Mick wants to see some of the profit going into his pocket in the form of a dividend.</p>

<p>Buddy is the dog from the Air Bud movies. He got his start in the movie after Air Bud casting agent, Audrey Salbania found him in a shelter. Before he went to a shelter, A neighbor of Buddy rescued him from his owner after Majic's previous owner had beaten and raped him. After Salbania adopted him, she saw Buddy's exceptional talent for obeying commands and later for bouncing a basketball of his head into a hoop. She then casted Buddy in a movie about a dog who is really good at basketball. The dog then plays on a basketball team with a kid and their team becomes really good. But then he becomes kidnapped by an alcoholic clown. But then the kid rescues Buddy back. This theatrical masterpiece is called Air Bud. Majic then acted in a number of Air Bud sequals including Air Bud: Golden Reciever (about football), Air Bud: World Pup (about soccer), Air Bud: Seventh Inning Fetch (about Baseball), Air Bud: Spikes Back (about volleyball) and Air Buddies ( this film includes all the previous sports combined). Tragically, after Air Buddies was filmed in early 2005, Buddy was diagnosed Asspergers syndrome. They found him dead, sprawled on the ground with kibble all over his body on febuary 21,2005. He was a good dog. The only shame about Buddy's life is that he did not Oscar. If the Oscar doesn't think a dog who is amazingly good at basketball, soccer, baseball and vollyball is worth of an oscar, than who is? Matt Damon? I think not.</p>
<p>P.S. in the upcoming Airbud movie, Buddy is actually supposed to have a speaking part.</p>

Though a small town, the person wanted to put himself, and the town, on the map. Patrick Fears, born of a small immediate family, soon learned that his distant relatives spanned quite far.</p>
<p>Born with a musical talent, Patrick Fears got an education at <b>Dixie Bee Elementary School</b>, and soon moved on to <b>Honey Creek Middle School</b>. He strived to master the facets of music, rhythm and melody; percussion and song. Fascinated by the music of others, he soon enlisted in the musical group Ridiculi, with the already infamous P.L.

<p><b>Outline</b> Mammaw's Revenge is an independent film company based in Warwick, Rhode Island. It was created by Dan Carrara. It once went under the name "Random Acts Of Violence" In which Dan and his friends would attack eachother without notice and film it. Mammaw's Revenge is a common name in Warwick, famous for their controversial in-school and out of school filmings. Which included Justin Maccarone drinking an entire bottle of hotsauce, Josh West drinking a bottle of his own urine, and Dan staging a seizure in a movie theatre.</p>
<p><b>The Early Days</b> Dan Carrara would team with his longtime friend Josh West to film an abundance of movies that had no plot, and modeled those of CKY's and Jackass. The films began to evolve and they released their first real film "Change In Gear"</p>
<p><b>The Dollar Hat Era</b> Dan would team with other friends in order to create what would be known as the Dollar Hat Era, named after hats Dan and his friend Ed purchased at a local store for a dollar. They filmed the "Justin Van Goor Story" A story about their diseased friend, the film was sought to be a hit, but it was never finished.</p>
<p><b>The Inmate Era</b> Noted by many as the most dominant era to date, Dan hired Justin Maccarone, Ryan Holmes, Tom Heston and others to be a part of the newest Mammaw's Revenge revolution. They would go on to film "Paranoid". Although many people starred in the film, few stayed in Mammaw's. Those who stayed went on to grow and blossom in the company. Ryan Holmes' character in Paranoid; "Yagoo" got it's own movie, which is still in production.</p>
<p>During this time, Justin Maccarone moved up the Co-CEO of Mammaw's Revenge.</p>
<p><b>Releases</b> <b>Hearburn</b> The film that told the story of Justin Maccarone's fictional life and "Noose" career. It had interviews with Tom Heston, Dan Carrara, Ryan Holmes and many more. The film is available for purchase on their website.</p>
<p><b>Recently</b> Mammaw's Revenge has been working on improving their website, and have started work on two new films. "Toxic Toast" which is about three friends; who are unique in that one is an honors student, and the other two are failing. The film shows their struggle through their Junior/Senior Year and their summer vacation. They have also began to shoot promo's for a documentary entitled "There and Back Again" which will tell the story of Mammaw's Revenge and it's members throught the eyes of Dan, Justin, Tom, Ryan and more.</p>
<p><b>Trivia</b> -Danny C writes, shoots, and directs almost all of the Mammaw's Revenge films. -Tom Heston was elected Junior Prom King at their high school this year. -Ryan Holmes was once in his own film company, as was Justin Maccarone.</p>

<p>Grudge of The Driven is a local band in new Hartford new york. Their metal overtones with rock, Jazz, and funk undertones makes them a different band but still staying true to metal fashions.</p>
<p>The band was created as swichblade in 2005 and consisted od Rob Smith (guitar) Trevor McCabe (Bass) and Frank Scalise (drums). Although they are currently out a singer they make up for it in musicallity bring interesting melodies with fast and carying rhythm. The band is currently enrolled at new Hartford Highschool and all of them are juniors.</p>
<p>Trevor and Frank had a history of playing in bands before hand. They were both in a band called nightshift (A local band as well, that didn't take off much after they played a school talent show and won best band preformance) with guitarist Nick Madia. with a constant three person band set up Frank an Trevor made a band with Scott Brown and pandemonium was born. They also played at another school Talent show and with scotts raging solos, Trevor's unique bass lines and Franks fast fills and smooth beats they were pretty well liked. They played a local club every couple of weeks at an open mic-night which didn't get them far. After hmble rock beginings Frank and Trevor wanted a different outlet. Trevor knew Rob as an out-of-touch friend from when he recalls as "back in the day" (around 5th and 6th grade). They were looking for a guitarist and Trevor suggested Rob and Frank ultemately agreed. After rough beginings (not practacing due to Rob playing football) they finally got in gear and started making many songs. Their style is ultamately different than everone else's in the area, many are into classic rock or softer sound. They all improved gratly after much time of practacing and playing. They have also played at a local bar and played a battle of the Bands, but to their very different style they were not well precieved and were recognised but not enough to gain true popularity.</p>
<p>PLAYERS</p>
<p>Rob Smith started plying guitar at around 8th grade and got his first guitar (ibenez). With intrests in wide verities of musicians like Rod Stewart to Mudvayne and Metallica. With his fellow musicians in grude of the driven bands like Primus, Metallica, Mudvayne, System of a down, and many more allowed him and the band make a unique blend on all these influences. He currently likes with his mom and little brother at their home near New Hartford.</p>
<p>Frank Scalise has been playing drums for about 3 years. He started heavily in drums when him and Nick Madia (guitarist for night shift) whould jam and make songs. His fist set was a Yamaha 5 piece). Then in 9th grade they hired Trevor McCabe as their bassist. They all got along very well and would play in Nick's basement making songs all the time, even though they had no singer. once the band broke up him and Trevor would hand out and Jam all the time. Eventually they started making little short films by Negro Sause Productions. These comedy films often stared them as most of the characters and would be ocpanied by friends. Once they realized they needed a Band theylooked to local friend Scott Brown. Scott was one of the best guitarists in school on electric guitar and needed a band. So Frank and Trevor both became the backround for that band which was eventually called Pandemonium. Since they didn't have a singer Scott whould have solos just about every verse in a so called song. Although it was good for Scott, Frank ant Trevor felt lessened by Scott. So they quit that band and formed Grudge Of The Driven With Rob Smith. They also formed (on the side) a acustic rock/metal band called the Zebra Negros; which consisted of both of them on guitar and vocals (Frank often sung lead). They recorded all the movies and songs on the computer and many of them can be found in various places on the internet. They also made band videos with Rob and movies with him too.</p>
<p>Trevor McCabe has been playing bass for 5 years or so. He hi known as the best bassist in school, but gets no wide recognition for it. It all started in 6th grade when his sister sugested he take up bass so they could start up a band, always being friendly he agreed. he got his first bass (a five string Squier jazz bass) and he formed a band with his sister and some people she met who needed a singer,guitarist and bassist (Trevor's sister was a Guiatist and Singer). They played the school talent show with her boyfriend (a rapper) and they were too different for the liking of the crowd. The band soon broke up and Trevor concentrated on getting better at playing. His first real influence was Flea from The Red Hot Chilli Peppers which he learned to pop and slap at incredible speeds. After musch practace he was invided to join nightshift. At that poin he was the best player in the group but was also level headed about it. He often used techniques from Jaco Pastorius, Flea and Les Claypool to deliver a melodic rhythm and added an interesting flaver to an already strange but good band. Once that Band broke up he joined up with Frank and Pandemonium and was introduced to a pretty different setting. He overall didn't like it because of "the sytle" he said. Him and Scott would always fight because of creative differences and Scott would always try to give him bass parts. He said "I just felt limited in that band". During this band he excelled at an alarming rate at bass, masting many techniques and become more able to Jam and make songs, rythms and melodies very fast. Towards the end of that band he started geting faster and faster through his studing of Flea and Billy Sheehan. When he finally joined Grudge of The Driven he found an outlet to his many styles and techniques.</p>
<p>Current<br />
The band is still playing together trying to get vocals, lyrics and writing many songs. They are also home recording Demos to give to clubs to try to play anywhere. They still attend school and rob is working at a local pizza shop</p>

<p>Pharmacy Compounding is the art of taking bulk chemical compounds and creating unique dosage forms that are unavailable as manufactured products to meet specific patient needs according to his or her unique medical conditions. Those who practice pharmacy compounding are Compounding Pharmacists, and they undergo additional training to safely and accurately created these dosage forms. Compounding pharmacists address the issue that while 80% of the population can benefit from manufactured products created by Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (Pfizer, Merck, etc), the other 20% cannot achieve their therapeutic goals without having their medications hand-crafted to meet their unique needs.</p>
