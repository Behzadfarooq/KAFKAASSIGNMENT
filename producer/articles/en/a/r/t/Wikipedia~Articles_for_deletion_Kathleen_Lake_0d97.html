<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>: Appears to be a hoax. I know - it's a lake --- but it still appears to be a hoax. Google searches on the lake show nothing. Google searches on most or all of the towns mentioned show nothing. Google searches on the fish hatchery and the book mentioned in the talk page - all show nothing. Two anon's assert its existence though so I brought it here instead of prod. The article mentions a 3-mile long bridge on I-95 and the talk page mentions I-95 mile marker 105. But <a href="http://terraserver.microsoft.com/image.aspx?T=1&amp;S=13&amp;Z=17&amp;X=472&amp;Y=2461&amp;W=1&amp;qs=%7cKenly%7cNC%7c" class="external text" title="http://terraserver.microsoft.com/image.aspx?T=1&amp;S=13&amp;Z=17&amp;X=472&amp;Y=2461&amp;W=1&amp;qs=%7cKenly%7cNC%7c" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.okroads.com/delawarepart2/i95nc.html" class="external text" title="http://www.okroads.com/delawarepart2/i95nc.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> show pictures of Exits 102 (bottom, far left) and 105 (right of center) in N.C. ---- I see no lake and I see no hint of a 3-mile long bridge or a need for one. This lake is supposed to be over 25 square miles which would take up the entire TerraServer page mentined above! I can't imagine the purpose of the hoax or what mix up there could be but I do not see a lake. To make matters more strange, the original anon's IP address is registered to the government of Frederick County, Maryland! Making a hoax about a fictional lake 300 or 400 miles away! —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 03:10, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> this weird, entertaining hoax as non-verifiable. "McBratney", 0 Google hits for town name. Same with Briehl, Shawmut, Shawnville, and Kathleen Lake. Neither lake nor those towns show up on printed AAA road atlas. "North Carolina Experimental Fish Hatchery", 0 Google hits. "Kimberly Kathleen Foster", 0 Google hits.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not even sure what the purpose would be. Is it funny somehow? Does a gov't computer's involvement mean it's somehow more sinister?

<li><b>Delete</b> as hoax. Next. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby1011_3500.html" title="User:Bobby1011">Bobby1011</a> 15:02, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Points of Issue:</b>
<ul>
<li>1. Where is *Brideham Lake* and *Brindle*? Apparently, Brideham Lake is next in line in size after Kathleen. I can't find Brideham Lake anywhere in my NC Atlas and Gazetteer.</li>
<li>2. If Kathleen Lake is home to one of the biggest fishing derbies in the south, why does a Google search on "fishing derby" "Kathleen Lake" return bubkis?</li>
<li>3. Call me crazy, but I don't think *Kimberly* was a fashionable name for a woman who was likely born in the 1830s or 1840s. Does anyone know of any references to Kimberlys from that time period? It seems to me that the name Kimberly is a child of the latter half of the twentieth century, rather than antebellum times!</li>
<li>4. If the Union soldiers beat Kimberly to death as she gave birth, who delivered the baby? This article makes it sound like the baby just popped out on its own and ran off to Raleigh to run for office (which was apparently vacant in 1891!) You beat up a pregnant woman and there's a pretty decent chance you kill the baby along the way.</li>
<li>5. What is a "mosquito density" test? Do they weigh mosquitoes or something? That line sounds Monty Python-esque.</li>
<li>6. A 3-mile bridge span costs way more than $65 million.</li>
<li>7. An artery as important as I-95 would never be allowed to be breached until 2010. If this bridge couldn't support truck traffic, NCDOT would be replacing it as we speak. What, do we flag down trucks in the middle of nowhere and have them exit before crossing the bridge? The Wilson Bridge in DC hasn't even taken that long!</li>
<li>8. If I-95 was built in the 1960s, but the lake was extended in the 1970s, how did they extend the lake? Did they dig under I-95?!</li>
<li>9. These people that are "fishing" in Kathleen Lake...hmm, I guess they live on oceanfront property in West Virginia.</li>
<li>10. This whole thing reminds me of an episode of Family Guy when the other fisherman play a prank on Peter Griffin and tell him to go to some longitude and latitude supposedly in the Atlantic Ocean - but it turns out to be at the middle of a temple where a Jewish kid's having a bar mitzvah. "Yeah, there's some great fishing in the middle of I-95!"
<ul>
<li>It's a fascinating article, and an interesting scavenger hunt, but it doesn't seem to belong here. I'd love to know why the original writer created this article - it seems like it has some significance. Does Ricki Lake have a sister named Kathleen? ~~LynnW</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> hoax. By the way, the LG for NC in 1891 was not named Foster but Holt <a href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/reference/lieutenant_governor_of_north_carolina" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/reference/lieutenant_governor_of_north_carolina" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Sheesh. <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 17:59, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I live near Bethany, North Carolina and have traveled the entire length (180 miles) of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_95.html" title="Interstate 95">I-95</a> in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a> and as far as I can remember, there are no lake crossings of this size. This would be an even bigger crossing than <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_85.html" title="Interstate 85">I-85</a> over <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falls_Lake_b88b.html" title="Falls Lake">Falls Lake</a>, NC, so it would be noticeable to say the least. Now I do believe there is a Kathleen (or Katherine, or something similar) Lake in the neighborhood of I-95, but it is far smaller than 26 square miles, and I believe it's close to <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumberton%2C_North_Carolina_a48c.html" title="Lumberton, North Carolina">Lumberton, North Carolina</a>, which would be about 90 miles south of the purported Kathleen Lake in this article. 67.35.30.80 03:38, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
