Among the articles that acknowledge him as a spoof phenomenon are Spin<a href="http://www.spin.com/features/everybodystalkingabout/2007/01/070124_eveningservice/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spin.com/features/everybodystalkingabout/2007/01/070124_eveningservice/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and The Washington Blade<a href="http://www.washblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=11101" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=11101" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

The political content of this controversy has also attracted the attention of activists such as Heartstrong<a href="http://www.heartstrong.org/HeartStrong/DonnieDaviesHates.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.heartstrong.org/HeartStrong/DonnieDaviesHates.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and a petition has been started online for content removal from free sites<a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/pastor/petition.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.petitiononline.com/pastor/petition.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the topic’s existence as an internet spoof, with evidence of becoming widely known, it exemplifies <a href="../../../v/i/r/Viral_marketing.html" title="Viral marketing">viral marketing</a> but does not constitute spam per <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESpam_8b43.html" title="WP:Spam">WP:Spam</a> as the article itself is not an advertisement. The persona's notability is spread through the use of inflammatory content. The vast majority of the results of a Google search are blogs or forum chats. While they are not reliable sources, they are focal points of web-based interaction, and so a method of guerrilla marketing. As a viral marketing campaign, it is unique because its core communication is reliant on a pivotal point of a religious and political controversy; that is the religious contention that homosexuality is wrong. This is the root of its spread through the blogosphere as well as why the controversy over his actuality is so popular and its gain of cultural so important—particularly for people identifying with a sexually different culture. It is also why it is so culturally significant in its affect.</p>
<p>Advertising campaigns such as <a href="../../../g/e/t/Get_a_Mac_3a47.html" title="Get a Mac">Get a Mac</a> have their own articles regardless of the content being true or false. Guerrilla campaigns such as the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_Boston_Mooninite_Scare_d371.html" title="2007 Boston Mooninite Scare">2007 Boston Mooninite Scare</a> has been covered by Wikipedia and journalists even though coverage acts as more publicity. Personal campaigns popularized by web dissemination are also Wiki articles such as <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonelygirl15.html" title="Lonelygirl15">Lonelygirl15</a>. Wikipedia covers the mentioned topics because of their cultural significance through our measure of notability that is dependent on verification. The notability of Donnie Davies is verified through multiple sources. Those named articles about advertisement pieces do not constitute spam as they are not advertisements, but explanations.</p>
<p>If the article were to follow the guidelines as stipulated by the <a href="../../../a/t/_/WP%7EAT_9deb.html" title="WP:AT">Wiki Amnesia Test</a>, would be about this topic as a controversy and the effect of it as a controversy. Understandably it does not meet the guidelines of a wiki biography, but since that isn't the intention then the point is moot. No different from articles like <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">bigfoot</a> or <a href="../../../u/f/o/UFOs_19a3.html" title="UFOs">UFOs</a>, it does not seek to establish the existence, but explain the growing topic. The only difference is its youth. Yes, the topics of bigfoot and UFOs are well-established and certainly have countless sources that address their cultural significance, but at the speed of which Donnie Davies as a topic is growing, it seems arbitrary to use its short-life as an argument against it.</p>
<p><b>To summarize</b>: the article deserves a place because it has accumulated controversy over a heatedly debated religious and political conflict and utilizes it as an advertising campaign. It is not a biographical article, but an account of a campaign that is garnering cultural significance because it borrows from such a heated topic. It is not spam because the article addresses a variety of issues and does not seek to solely promote the persona. There are also multiple reputable sources that address the above reasons. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquatGoblin_2dbd.html" title="User:SquatGoblin">SquatGoblin</a></p>

<dd>While it may be a hoax or simply a viral marketing campaign is part of a larger picture. The article isn't simply spreading the campaign or hoax but plays a part in assembling what composes it. There are many articles on Wikipedia that cover influential advertising campaigns. This one in particular is poignant because its core vessel for communication is dependent on a controversial religious and political issues (as self-evident by the song title "God Hates Fags"). I'm not sure I understand your difference of opinion. There are reliable sources (sources that have their own Wiki articles as journalists) that address this as a controversy. Please clarify where you need specific facts. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquatGoblin_2dbd.html" title="User:SquatGoblin">SquatGoblin</a> 18:23, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It's almost certainly a hoax, even if that can't be verified. But if it's a notable and verifiable phenomenon (regardless of whether claims of his identity are verifiable), how does this satisfy deletion criteria? Perhaps this is belaboring a point already mentioned, but wikipedia has plenty of articles where the "truth" cannot be determined and which few would suggest deleting (e.g. paranormal phenomena).

<dd>Unlike criticisms of notability of verifiability, which I can't see in light of the references provided, <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> seems it could have some teeth here. I don't think Davies is "established as viral marketing," as it's not yet clear what he's promoting -- there's still lingering controversy over whether he's for real. (Though I agree he's a hoax, I don't think that's an objective conclusion.) But <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> does mention "public relations pieces designed to promote a company or individual," and this could fit the bill. I'm sticking with my keep vote for now, since I feel that Davies has generated enough controversy to warrant an entry despite his intentions, and inclusion seems in keeping with the spirit of the notability policy. But I think the spam consideration warrants discussion. Gerta 17:00, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know. Based on <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESpam_8b43.html" title="WP:Spam">WP:Spam</a>, it sounds like the article itself has to be a piece of advertisement, but this article critiques its method of campaign and its effects. More importantly, it discusses it as a hoax and rather than promote it as a hoax. Does the article read like an advertisement to you? YouTube and Google didn't remove the video for being spam by the way, it was removed by the request of a petition from people offended by the video. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquatGoblin_2dbd.html" title="User:SquatGoblin">SquatGoblin</a> 03:57, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm inclined to agree that <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESpam_8b43.html" title="WP:Spam">WP:Spam</a> seems more concerned with spammy articles rather than articles <i>about</i> spam. So I think the article holds up, but maybe others will chime in here? ... Gerta 06:11, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> FREEDOM OF SPEECH, no real harm done. People should leave it. Controversy is no reason to delete an informative page.

<dd>This isn't about freedom of speech or controversy, it's about the policy for content. I don't think anyone has argued that the controversy surrounding Davies is the problem; in fact, it seems to have contributed to his notability. Gerta 21:19, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- I was wondering who this guy was and what was known about the controversy surrounding him. While there are some stylistic problems with the article at the moment (some seems to be written from blog-insiders for blog-insiders), that can be corrected with a certain amount of editing. Deletion, on the other hand, would just increase the question marks. (I normally "inhabit" the German wikipedia, and came "over here" to check out this article because I figured I would find something at least halfway informative (I had heard about Davies on another German-language website that discusses the ex-gay phenomenon, not Wikipedia). When I saw that it was marked for deletion, I thought that it would be too bad if I had gotten interested next week instead of this week and the article were gone and I wouldn't have been able to find this collection of sources and links to relevant information.--<a href="../../../b/h/u/User%7EBhuck_37fe.html" title="User:Bhuck">Bhuck</a> 07:48, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree the article revolves around blogs at some points, and the fault is entirely my own -- it carried over from my original version of the article. I'll work to clean it up and get the focus back onto the stronger references, and I'll encourage others to do the same on the discussion page. Gerta 15:02, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
