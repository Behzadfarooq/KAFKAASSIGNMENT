Barrelanza has it’s heritage dating back almost 2000 years when St Peter bet Jesus some loaves of bread and fish (and a goblet of Nazareth Draught) that he could not rise from the dead. Down and out on the Friday, St Peter looked home and hosed until Jesus’ superb turn-around on the Sunday.

<dd>Wow, well, I came back to look at this a couple days later, sorry for posting this, I wasn't, at the time, aware that school article's notability was so drastically different from other articles. When this was nominated it was a very small and seemingly non-notable stub. I know now that school articles are seen differently and are somewhat controversial. The idea that I am AFD spamming is a little extreme, I think this is the only school article I have ever submitted, certainly the only one in months. For the people that assumed I was doing this malevolently, I can only assure you that I wasn't. <a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion"><font color="black">cohesion</font></a><font color="#CC0033">★</font><a href="../../../c/o/h/User_talk%7ECohesion_c433.html" title="User talk:Cohesion"><font color="black">talk</font></a> 07:49, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>In defense of those who have reacted strongly against your nomination, it can be difficult to keep track (at a glance) of whether a school on AfD is the result of a multi-nominator or not. Many WP policies and guidelines are so frequently ignored by many people on both sides of this debate and the constant level of acrimony was probably not directed at <b>you</b> specifically. Your nomination also happened to be sandwiched in with some nominations by <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComCat_ab6c.html" title="User:ComCat">User:ComCat</a>, who is a habitual nominator of schools to AFD - likely sparking the confusion.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 08:03, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ahh, that explains a lot. Still, I would like to think this is a forum for getting consensus regarding whether or not an article should stay in wikipedia rather than an article death sentence. I don't always know how people will react when things are nominated, but at the same time I am willing to accept whatever the consensus is. I like, and will retain that view rather than the more cynical view that everything here has nominators that are fighting tooth and nail to have their article deleted. - <a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion"><font color="black">cohesion</font></a><font color="#CC0033">★</font><a href="../../../c/o/h/User_talk%7ECohesion_c433.html" title="User talk:Cohesion"><font color="black">talk</font></a> 08:19, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Your idealism is admirable, unfortunately a number of "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" on the basis of the article being either a stub or "non-notable" have expressed the position that they engage in this process to "keep others honest" and "to see a victory of even one crappy school article deleted".--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:59, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> as neologism.</s> There are Chaldean &amp; Arabic neighborhoods in Detroit; primarily found in the Warrendale area and around 7 Mile west of Woodward. "Chaldean Town" is not a term used by the vast majority of Detroiters and surrouding suburbanites. There are areas of Detroit that are commonly referred to by their ethnic demographic (like Mexican Town), but the "Chaldean Federation of America" link <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> added is the first time I've ever heard "Chaldean Town" term... and I grew up in an area with a large Chaldean population. It appears that the term has been mentioned here: <a href="http://www.cityscapedetroit.org/Detroit_neighborhoods.html#" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cityscapedetroit.org/Detroit_neighborhoods.html#" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, but this could just be a pickup of the CFA press releases and mentions in Wikipedia articles (this term has been entered into the main <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit.html" title="Detroit">Detroit</a> article). I'm going to do a bit more research because this has piqued my interest, but for now I consider this term a neologism that is not in wide usage when compared to other Detroit neighborhood names like Corktown, Poletown, Mexicantown, Indian Village, Springwells, etc.</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b>, term has apparently been picked up and used locally. Apparently Chaldean merchants in the 7 mile area have attempted to create an economic district akin to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greektown%2C_Detroit_6b51.html" title="Greektown, Detroit">Greektown</a>. This has not been overly successful, probably due to their location (Greektown has proximity to downtown Detroit; Chaldean Town does not). Couple this fact with the relative newness of the effort (circa 1999) and this would explain why the term is not in wider usage. However, it has been referenced here: [<a href="http://www.detnews.com/2000/detroit/0008/31/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.detnews.com/2000/detroit/0008/31/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>], [<a href="http://www.freep.com/news/metro/cooper28e_20040928.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freep.com/news/metro/cooper28e_20040928.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>], and [<a href="http://www.anthropology.emory.edu/FACULTY/ANTJH/Chaldeanbook/Chapter%202%20_Background.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.anthropology.emory.edu/FACULTY/ANTJH/Chaldeanbook/Chapter%202%20_Background.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>].

<li>Copyright does indeed apply to advertising copy, but the special speedy criterion does not (see <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> and its talk page). This is because the copyright holders are quilte likely to be only too willing to allow us to use their ad copy, while the copyright speedy is only for cases where we can be pretty near 100% sure no permission will be granted even if we ask nicely. The regular {{<a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopyvio_c034.html" title="Template:Copyvio">copyvio</a>}} tag can be used in such cases, however. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:55, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Seeing the poor quality of this article inspired me to finally make an account to provide information on what I believe is a fairly notable company, as a large scale producer of merchandise for an extremely popular series of novels. If it helps, the search term Clarecraft yields 53,700 results, and at the very least the entire first few pages are all references to the company and not from Wikipedia. There are also a number of Clarecraft products currently available on Ebay. I suspect my vote may be discounted as I'm an extremely new user, but I'll vote <b>keep</b> anyway. If anyone notices any Wikipedia style mistakes in my rewrite, I'd appreciate if you clean them up or let me know. I've also posted on their website's forum asking for some more information about some things I thought might fit in the article which I couldn't find on the web. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolotet_39d2.html" title="User:Polotet">Polotet</a> 02:54, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks, you did a nice job. Unfortunately, I think there's a difficulty with the topic (not your writing). I'm not sure they're that special, given they don't make it, and our now going out of business. One key that's needed for a business, is independent sources that gives verifiable information, and shows interest about the company beyond the company itself. I suspect such sources don't exist. Although, if found, and you add them to the article, that would increase the likely retention. If you have to ask the company directly for information that's a problem, since we can't use unverifiable information. Anyway, I hope you do more rewrites, but on topics more likely to be kept. I'll <b>abstain</b> for now (I really haven't spent adequate time investigating this company, and based my prior vote just on it being an ad). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 03:26, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>As rewritten it has a much more encyclopedic tone, and at least some indications of notability. These are still marginal IMO, but just barely enough for me to switch to a <b>Weak Keep</b>. I note that one of the cited news stories makes a good deal of this having been one of (perhaps the very) last manufatureing establishemnts in the UK.

<dd>P. P. S. I believe it must be familiar to readers of Western novels. The same A9 search shows me that a recent Robert Parker novel, <i>Appaloosa,</i> a James Patterson novel, <i>Roses are Red,</i> and a Tom Clancy novel, <i>Debt of Honor,</i> all mention the phrase, in some cases without much explanation. Clancy just assumes you know what it means: "Some of his people had to be counting coup in a big way, full of themselves in the way of fighter pilots who had done the job and lived to tell the tale." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:50, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I suspect the problem was not that it was a stub but that it was misspelled. If you haven't heard of it and you searched for it as "counting coo" you might get the impression it wasn't important. Although rather to my surprise the misspelling gets <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Counting+coo%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Counting+coo%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">181 Google hits</a> suggesting that <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counting_coo.html" title="Counting coo">Counting coo</a> should be left in place as a redirect. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:09, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The text of the article establishes its <i>importance</i> beyond any shadow of a doubt. An extremely low google count might lead one to believe that it was a hoax or some sort of misinformation, but that's not why it was nominated for deletion. I can't really imagine that there's any basis for this nomination other than Comcat's habit of trying to delete any short article he happens to come across. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 19:45, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think we should do the nominator the courtesy of assuming that the expressed reason for deletion is the real reason for deletion.

<li>Having reviewed my vote, as promised elsewhere, I'm sticking with "keep". In what way could this subject possibly be considered "non-notable?"

<li>I don't understand the context of some of these remarks. The nomination was unnecessarily curt, but valid. It happened to be mistaken, that's all. It's not at <b>all</b> clear to me that the <i>misspelling</i> should be kept. I don't think the misspelled phrase "counting coo" <b>is</b> particularly notable. An AfD nomination is a request for a discussion. If it were reasonable to expect nominators to be infallible, we could just expand the speedy criteria. The article as submitted was badly written, cited no sources, and could easily be mistaken for something that should be deleted. The nominator made a mistake.

<p>who cares: If Emily Evans claims all this stuff about herself then who are we to stop her? I'm sure lots of women have been with the Edge and don't show on Google searches - define noteriety. Who the hell cares who Emily Evans is anyway?</p>
<p><br />
I am a family member, and Nicolla Tesla was my great grandfather. The fact that this person is proclaiming that she invented the Tesla coil is propostorous. I am deeply hurt considering that my grandfather spent his years having his co-scientist stealing his ideas from him, makes me very angry indeed. I want to find this Emily Evans and tell her that she is a liar, and will spend an eternity in burning hell crying for her deeds, and no pharmacology will be there to help dry those tears. I tell you people she lies through her teeth. Despite her vulgar lies I truly liked "It reeks of cat piss in this van." it reminds me when I go apple picking with my family, and my late grandfather would piss in the back seat.</p>
<p>DO NOT DELETE-I can't believe no one has heard of emily evans. Need a pop culture brush up much? Only one of the most influential artists of the last five centuries! Get real wikipedia! [edit] delete</p>
<p>If Derrida was her father and Plath was her mother (making the rash conclusion she is real) couldn't she have made up a more creative name than Evans? Not only is all of this ludicris but it stinks of literary canniballism. In fact, some of those ideas are mine. Dang.</p>
<p>It's about freaking time someone objected to the whole tesla coil lie. Thank you angry serb. Everyone's like, as if she had sex with the Edge. No one's like Wasn't Nicolla Tesla the inventor of the Tesla coil? Hence the name? Gawd. you'd think encyclopedia people would know a little better. And besides. How is sourcing with the net a form of validation? IT'S ALL LIES. And we're all damned without embellishment.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I disagree that notability has been established... Right now I see a college professor, which isn't all that notable. However the claim that his work has been "reviewed" in some major publications might be notable. Could the author elaborate a bit?

However, there is an even split among those who want this kept and those who want this deleted.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I understand that notability should not be established simply on the basis of numbers, however I am convinced the article should be retained. A baby being born is a regular occurence, sure, but Nevic sure got a lot of attention becuase she was the 6,000,000,000th by the UN <a href="http://www.dialogueworks.co.uk/newswise/months/Oct99/jun.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dialogueworks.co.uk/newswise/months/Oct99/jun.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. Furthermore, Alexander should stand, in a sense, is a representative for the several hundreds of men who have lost their lives in Iraq. As the 2,000th soldier to die, he will, in my opinion, serve as a reprensentative for the 1,999 who died before him. It would be cordial to make an article about each of the brave men who died in the War in Iraq, but such is not plausible for an encyclopedia. Thus, a brief mention of Alexander - in my opinion - would give some type of recognition besides that found in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Terrorism_c7b1.html" title="War on Terrorism">War on Terrorism</a> articles, etc. I think that this article should be kept. <a href="../../../v/2E/_/User%7EV._Molotov_fc5c.html" title="User:V.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This was a difficult decision to make. On the one hand, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a memorial, and having the misfortune of being the Nth person to die divisible by 1000 does not automatically make one notable. So while I do not disagree with many of the reasons provided by those who wish to delete this article, I must dissent; this death has been widely covered by the media, <a href="http://news.google.com/" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/" rel="nofollow">news.google.com</a> returns over 1,000 articles which mention this specific person by name. If the media decides to make this person a poster child for all of the other fallen soldiers in Iraq, then this person does become significantly notable, or notable enough that people may look to Wikipedia for additional information about this person. I would liken this to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalee_Holloway_a742.html" title="Natalee Holloway">Natalee Holloway</a> disappearance case; from a distance Natalee Holloway is one of 800,000 children who are reported missing each year, yet she is notable due to the mass news coverage she received. It is too soon to tell if George Alexander will receive the same type of media attention that Holloway did, but nonetheless they are both notable because of the attention they received, thus my vote of support to include this article. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">Hall Monitor</a> 17:59, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<p><br />
Most convertible arbitrage funds are delta/market neutral and are stuck because there is too much money using the same approach. This year a lot of traditional convertible arbitrage funds closed shop causing an implosion in convertible securities pricing. It is for the first time in more than 10 years since conservative delta neutral funds displayed 30% + volatility without any external market events like a surge in interest rates (1994)or the Russinan defaults in 1989. Glencoe is different. It starts off as delta neutral and becomes directional. The CSFB convertible arbitrage index representing well established large funds with a long track record did 19% between oct 2001 and oct 2003. The invesment club experiment did 61% and Glencoe continues the 30% + annualized track record through Dec 2004. It ranked #1 in AbsoluteReturn magazine on an annualized compounded basis through end of Dec 2004.</p>
<p>As a side comment to the previous 2 where does it say that a fund has to have a long track record or be large in order for it to publish information about it on Wikipedia? or maybe the 2 gentlemen above work in sales for competitors? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.70.2.90 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.70.2.90_d5d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.70.2.90">contribs</a>) 14:58, 27 October 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'll start by pointing out that Glencoe previously passed through Afd where it was deleted after a unanimous vote.

<dd>Regarding your question, I suggest you read <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Glencoe seems to fail at every level. It has not received any notable press coverage. It is not a component of any of the leading hedge fund indexes including CSFB/Tremont, Dow Jones Hedge Fund Index [<a href="http://www.djhedgefundindexes.com/pdfs/DJHF_Constit.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.djhedgefundindexes.com/pdfs/DJHF_Constit.pdf" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>] or the S&amp;P Hedge Fund Index [<a href="http://www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/pdf/index/ConstituentFunds.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/pdf/index/ConstituentFunds.pdf" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>]. It does not hold a 20% share of its market, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia does generally preclude advertising and self-promotion as per <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam</a>. It requires notability for inclusion. These were the reasons for the article's deletion in September. Further, your discussion of the fund's strategy, while interesting, hardly seems unique and is largely unverifiable. It therefore qualifies as OR.</dd>

<li>If I weren't wasting my time being forced to vote <b>Keep and rename (per Haeleth)</b> on AFD all the time and having to refresh this page to keep people honest - if those people, for instance, would just accept that there is no consensus on school deletions and stop nominating them, I'm certain I'd have more time to create an article or two. Hey, perhaps those people, instead of fruitlessly voting delete and trolling for new schools to nominate could create the article they so desperatly want schools to be merged into? <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 13:57, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>With respect, you clearly are not aware of the history regarding merging of school articles.

<li>With respect, I am. I will not vote delete on multi-school merges. I will also not vote delete on individual schools. In fact, you will be hard-pressed to find me voting delete on anything but obvious deletes. I believe that a failure to delete an article via contested AFD for what, like 4 months now is fruitless voting, and "trolling for new schools" is trolling in the fishing sense, and not in the under-the-bridge internet sense.

<li>I would be happy to help. I assume the intention is to take a bunch of stubs from a geographic district, create an article "High Schools in x,x,x" and then replace the individual school articles with redirects - for example, where I live now: "High Schools in Brooklyn, New York, USA?" Can I suggest that notable schools with longer articles be shortened and included in stub-format in the list, with a link from their name to their main article?

<li>I've reviewed my vote in more depth, as I promised elsewhere, and this one's staying "keep". The article claims a million hits, nothing to sneeze at, and none of the votes cast so far have provided a basis for the claim that this isn't worth an article. What's the point of just saying "non-notable" over and over again? Or worse, someone saying "non-notable" and then someone else saying "what he said"?

Why not merge it all into one big article, if the stubbiness of the existing ones is a problem? What's the reason for deleting this particular station's article? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:32, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Reflex Reaction,</p>
<p>I have tried to discuss on the talk page because some muslim users were constantly reverting my edits on rajput page. Then I requested the page be protected and also asked these users to provide evidence for there edits. It has been close to a week and they have chosen to not provide any evidence. So what should be assumed in such a circumstance?</p>
<p>The books from which this article is formed are very welll researched books on rajput history written by eminent historians. No one , even on rajput discussion page has provided a single counter evidence to what is written by the following authors.</p>
<p>James Tod did more then 20 years of research when he was living in Rajasthan in 1800's and then published the momentous "Annals and Antiquities of ancient Rajasthan". This is the only book which covers in great detail the history of rajputs. Before him and since him such a comprehensive book has not been published.</p>
<p>Other books I cited were by Professor Dashratha Sharma who took into account quite a few stone writings of various chauhan kings throughout there dominion and also took into account numismatics and the history works written in native Indian languages by the authors of that era. e.g Prithvirajvijay, Hammir MahaKavya etc.</p>
<p>Third book is by an existing professor at Jodhpur university who spent a lot of time researching the Indian works on the life of Hammir and then published has work in English.</p>
<p>These authors are not known to westerners who any way tend to rely more on muslim historians who tend to be very biased towards there kings.</p>
<p>On the rajput discussion page I pointed out how biased muslim historians are even today. MJ Akbar who is a very educated man and a journalist from India published a book recently called "shades of swords" in which he lists the wars of muslim kings but completely glosses over the severe defeats Ghori suffered in Gujarat in 1178 at Kayadara and later at Taraori in Haryana in 1191. And there are many more omissions.</p>
<p>Reason we have so much acrimony because muslims have been fed one version of the history by there historians in which there kings are shown as superhumans and rajput kings were shown as pushovers. Reality is far too different as many historians have pointed out. I presented a complete bibliography which they have managed to delete also. (I am in the process of collecting the publishers etc for these books in the bibliography. I am travelling and am away from my library but I will gather all the info by COB friday).</p>
<p><br />
-Shivraj Singh</p>
<p>PS: User Goethean is an extremely biased hindu hater. Here is an example:</p>
<p>Gothean has been selectively removing hindu responses from the wiki talkpage on rajputs. He is calling himself a moderator but I let the post from raja(who happens to be a muslim), where he talks about insecurity of faith, sit there on the talk page for more then 24 hours. Goethean was nowhere to be found. Then someone called me a moron and Goethean was still on snooze. Finally I responded to raja and then Gothean woke up instantaneously and started deleting stuff. When I ask him to explain this duplicity in behavior he remains silent. See the difff below. Raja is a muslim user who made an assertion on insecurity of faith and then I responded.</p>

<dd>Point well taken Reflex_Reaction. I have created an account. As I have repeatedly stated we should ask Goethean and his friends to provide us documentary evidence for there edits. Since I have already requested them multiple times for this info maybe somebody else asking might have better cooperation from them. The response I have gotten from a user on the other side of this discussion is "Again why should we? Who cares?". I suggested to him this is not an answer and he has been vocal about other things but no citations.

<p>Hi there. I believe that it was you who protected the Rajput article. In the pursuit of resolution of the dispute, I would like to add some text to the article. Unfortunately, it has not been approved by all parties, but nonetheless, here it is:</p>
<p>Some see the Rajput varna as including followers of all four major religions of the sub-continent: Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and Sikhism. Others dispute the claim that non-Hindus can be Rajputs, seeing the Rajput identity as comprised primarily of participation in Hindu religious rites and the Hindu caste system rather than one of ethnic heritage.</p>
<p>This would replace the last sentence of the "Definition" section. Unfortunately, at this point, we don't have citations to back up the attributions. Thanks! — goethean ॐ 18:23, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Rajputana is not my area of expertise, but I know how to find info. I searched my Questia account for recent books on Rajputs and came up with three, with are listed on the talk page for <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajput.html" title="Rajput">Rajput</a>. There were many more. Shivraj is using four books, one of which is an old primary source, two of which are local Indian productions (and possibly <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a>-slanted), and one reputable academic text of limited scope. I know enough about India, and communal violence in India, to know that Shivraj is pushing an extreme Hindu POV. What I've skimmed of the books I found on Questia suggests that Goethean and the other editors are correct in seeing the question in shades of grey, rather than Shivraj's simplistic black-and-white narrative. Identity is not a simple matter, and especially so in India. Please don't let this POV fork stand. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:14, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zora. Richard Saran is from the west so his work is reputable and these other professors are "possibly hindutva slanted"? Have you read these books to arrive at this conclusion or is it a prejudice? I have personally communicated with Richard Saran a few times and he has sent me good amount of material from his personal collection which helped me trace my genealogy back to Rao Sheoji of Marwar. Let us see how Richard did his research (He told me this when I spoke to him). He went to India and translated marwari/dingal manuscripts of rathore kings in a particular time window. Then he got the genealogies of various rajput clans from Manohar Singh Ranawat of Sitamau, who is a direct descendant of Maharana Pratap, and is also a protege of Raghubir Singh the ruler of Sitamau. Raghubir Singh is an eminent historian and wrote the life of Durgadas Rathore which is present in my bibliography. It took Richard and Norman couple of decades to bring there work out i.e painstaking research over a very long period of time.</dd>

<dd>Prof. Dashratha Sharma and Dr LS Rathore researched works like HammirMahaKavya, Prithiviraj Vijaya, PrithvirajRaso and various stone inscriptions in rajasthan and numismatic evidence and after many dedicated years of research published there respective works. To trivialize them as "hindutva.." is bad scholarship.</dd>

<dd>What is astonishing on this wiki is I have provided a complete bibliography from which I formed this article and yet I am the one who is being accused of pushing POV, being a hindutva wadi and anti muslim. When these muslims reverted my edits and I asked them for supporting citations they refuse to provide even a single piece of documented evidence and yet they are not considered POV pushing, or just clueless about rajput history. I asked them 5 precise questions on the rajput talk page and I asked them to provide citations so that we can engage in a logical discussion but I received a blank and nobody is bothered here&#160;?

<p>It has nothing to do with Hindutva.</p>
<p>In the same light, if one were to look at history, with the statement of "pronounced anti-Muslim agenda" then the enitire History of the Jewish people during the holocaust of Worl war 2 can be viewed as a "Pronounced Anti-german, anti-european, anti-christian agenda". To deny what has happened will only further divide and embitter communities.</p>
<p>In this discussion, Shivraj Singh is citing references and making attempts for individuals on this site to see the reality of the situation and the claims being made without foundation. Shivraj is not working with very few books, since a study in any ASouth Asian Studies department will provide you with a huge list of books that narrate the atrocities committed in the subcontinent by the Islamic invasion. Its not about being anti-Islamic, its just about what happened as recorded by Islamic historians who happened to be quite amazing in their prcise accounts of what happened and how they crushed and destroyed the inhabitants of India.</p>
<p>Irfan Husain, a Muslim and a freelance columnist from Pakistan has observed:</p>
<p>”While historical events should be judged in the context of their times, it cannot be denied that even in that bloody period of history, no mercy was shown to the Hindus unfortunate enough to be in the path of either the Arab conquerors of Sindh and south Punjab, or the Central Asians who swept in from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Muslim heroes who figure larger than life in our history books committed some dreadful crimes. Mahmud of Ghazni, Qutb-ud-Din Aibak, Balban, Mohammed bin Qasim, and Sultan Mohammad Tughlak, all have blood-stained hands that the passage of years has not cleansed. Indeed, the presence of Muslim historians on their various campaigns has ensured that the memory of their deeds will live long after they were buried.</p>
<p>Seen through Hindu eyes, the Muslim invasion of their homeland was an unmitigated disaster. Their temples were razed, their idols smashed, their women raped, their men killed or taken slaves. When Mahmud of Ghazni entered Somnath on one of his annual raids, he slaughtered all 50,000 inhabitants. Aibak killed and enslaved hundreds of thousands. The list of horrors is long and painful.</p>
<p>These conquerors justified their deeds by claiming it was their religious duty to smite non-believers. Cloaking themselves in the banner of Islam, they claimed they were fighting for their faith when, in reality, they were indulging in straightforward slaughter and pillage. When these warriors settled in India, they ruled as absolute despots over a cowed Hindu populace. For generations, their descendants took their martial superiority over their subjects for granted. "... And a substantial number of Pakistani Muslims are secretly convinced that they are inherently superior to the Hindus. One irony, of course, is that contrary to their wishful thinking, the vast majority of Muslims in the subcontinent have more Hindu blood in their veins than there is Arab, Afghan, Turkish or Persian blood. Many of the invaders took Hindu wives and concubines."</p>
<p>Reference: Demons from the past - By Ifran Husain - dailytimes.com.pk</p>
<p>Thus from here you can see that this is not about being Anti-Islamic, however denying what has happened, or simply denying th holocaust of the subcontinent will not win people's minds in favour of Islam, instead it will further create an feeling of animosity since in this discussion alone their has been a lot of denial of the truth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Rajput is a strata of the hierarchial system of the Hindus, and for a Muslim to claim to be part of the Hindu Hierarchy clearly violates the beliefs and tenents of Islam, however here we find the convinience of claiming what one wishes to from a Pagan/Kafur faith and yet claiming to be a Muslim, there is an oxymoron.</p>
<p>VS Naipaul, we all know is a Noble Laureate and even he can see what Shivraj Singh is trying to state:</p>
<p>Sir Vidiadhar S. Naipaul (1932 - ) Nobel laureate, He is the author of several books including Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions Among the Converted Peoples, Among the Believers: An Islamic Journey, and India: A Wounded Civilization. He has said: "India was wrecked and looted, not once but repeatedly by invaders with strong religious ideas, with a hatred of the religion of the people they were conquering. People read these accounts but they do not imaginatively understand the effects of conquest by an iconoclastic religion."</p>
<p>"India became the great land for Muslim adventurers and the peasantry bore this on their back, they were enslaved quite literally. It just went on like this from the 11th century onwards."</p>
<p>Vidiadhar Naipaul summed up the situation well. He said, "In art and history books, people write of the Muslims "arriving" in India as though they came on a tourist bus and went away again. The Muslim view of their conquest is a truer one. They speak of the triumph of faith, the destruction of idols and temples, the loot, the casting away of locals as slaves." Reference: Economic Times - <a href="http://www.economictimes.com/today/30poli04.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.economictimes.com/today/30poli04.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.economictimes.com/today/30poli04.htm</a></p>
<p>And even Islamic texts state what happened:</p>
<p>The temple of Somnath, which is not very far from Dwaraka, is dedicated to Lord Siva as Nagnath or Nageshwar Mahadev, and enshrines one of the twelve ‘Jyotirlingas’ which according to the Puranas manifested themselves as columns of light in different parts of the country. The magnificent temple that stands there now is a replica of the original temple. The 13th century Arab source refers to the glories of the temple thus: "Somnath - a celebrated city of India situated on the shore of the sea is washed by its waves. Among the wonders of that place was the temple in which was placed the idol called Somnat. This idol was in the middle of the temple, without anything to support it from below or to suspend it from above. It was held in the highest honour among the Hindus, and whoever beheld it floating in the air was struck with amazement..."</p>
<p>Reference: Sultan Alau’d-Din Khalji (1296-1316), in Tarikh-I-Firuz Shahi</p>
<p>And another article for you by another muslim Rizwan Salim:</p>
<p>" It is clear that India at the time when Muslim invaders turned towards it (8 to 11th century) was the earth's richest region for its wealth in precious and semi-precious stones, gold and silver, religion and culture, and its fine arts and letters. Tenth century Hindustan was also too far advanced than its contemporaries in the East and the West for its achievements in the realms of speculative philosophy and scientific theorizing, mathematics and knowledge of nature's workings. Hindus of the early medieval period were unquestionably superior in more things than the Chinese, the Persians (including the Sassanians), the Romans and the Byzantines of the immediate proceeding centuries. The followers of Siva and Vishnu on this subcontinent had created for themselves a society more mentally evolved-joyous and prosperous too-than had been realized by the Jews, Christians, and Muslim monotheists of the time. Medieval India, until the Islamic invaders destroyed it, was history's most richly imaginative culture and one of the five most advanced civilizations of all times.</p>
<p>Look at the Hindu art that Muslim iconoclasts severely damaged or destroyed. Ancient Hindu sculpture is vigorous and sensual in the highest degree-more fascinating than human figural art created anywhere else on earth. (Only statues created by classical Greek artists are in the same class as Hindu temple sculpture). Ancient Hindu temple architecture is the most awe-inspiring, ornate and spell-binding architectural style found anywhere in the world. (The Gothic art of cathedrals in France is the only other religious architecture that is comparable with the intricate architecture of Hindu temples). No artist of any historical civilization have ever revealed the same genius as ancient Hindustan's artists and artisans.</p>
<p>Their minds filled with venom against the idol-worshippers of Hindustan, the Muslims destroyed a large number of ancient Hindu temples. This is a historical fact, mentioned by Muslim chroniclers and others of the time. A number of temples were merely damaged and remained standing. But a large number - not hundreds but many thousands - of the ancient temples were broken into shreds of cracked stone. In the ancient cities of Varanasi and Mathura, Ujjain and Maheshwar, Jwalamukhi and Dwarka, not one temple survives whole and intact from the ancient times.</p>
<p>It is easy to conclude that virtually every Hindu temple built in the ancient times is a perfect work of art. The evidence of the ferocity with which the Muslim invaders must have struck at the sculptures of gods and goddesses, demons and apsaras, kings and queens, dancers and musicians is frightful. At so many ancient temples of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, for example, shattered portions of stone images still lie scattered in the temple courtyards. Considering the fury used on the idols and sculptures, the stone-breaking axe must have been applied to thousands upon thousands of images of hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>Giving proof of the resentment that men belonging to an inferior civilization feel upon encountering a superior civilization of individuals with a more refined culture, Islamic invaders from Arabia and western Asia broke and burned everything beautiful they came across in Hindustan. So morally degenerate were the Muslim Sultans that, rather than attract Hindu "infidels" to Islam through force of personal example and exhortation, they just built a number of mosques at the sites of torn down temples-and foolishly pretended they had triumphed over the minds and culture of the Hindus. "</p>
<p>" I have seen stones and columns of Hindu temples incorporated into the architecture of several mosques, including the Jama Masjid and Ahmed Shah Masjid in Ahmedabad; the mosque in the Uparkot fort of Junagadh (Gujarat) and in Vidisha (near Bhopal); the Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra right next to the famous dargah in Ajmer-and the currently controversial Bhojshala "mosque" in Dhar (near Indore).</p>
<p>Hindu culture was at its imaginative best and vigorously creative when the severely-allergic-to-images Muslims entered Hindustan. Islamic invaders did not just destroy countless temples and constructions but also suppressed cultural and religious practices; damaged the pristine vigor of Hindu religion, prevented the intensification of Hindu culture, debilitating it permanently, stopped the development of Hindu arts ended the creative impulse in all realms of thought and action, damaged the people's cultural pride, disrupted the transmission of values and wisdom, cultural practices and tradition from one generation to the next; destroyed the proper historical evolution of Hindu kingdoms and society, affected severely the acquisition of knowledge, research and reflection and violated the moral basis of Hindu society. The Hindus suffered immense psychic damage. The Muslims also plundered the wealth of the Hindu kingdoms, impoverished the Hindu populace, and destroyed the prosperity of Hindustan."</p>
<p>" Gaze in wonder at the Kailas Mandir in the Ellora caves and remember that it is carved out of a solid stone hill, an effort that (inscriptions say) took nearly 200 years. This is art as devotion. The temple built by the Rashtrakuta kings (who also built the colossal sculpture in the Elenhanta caves off Mumbai harbour) gives proof of the ancient Hindus' religious fervor.</p>
<p>The descendants of those who built the magnificent temples of Bhojpur and Thanjavur, Konark and Kailas, invented mathematics and brain surgery, created mindbody disciplines (yoga) of astonishing power, and built mighty empires would almost certainly have attained technological superiority over Europe.</p>
<p>It is not just for "political reasons" that Hindus want to build grand temples at the sites of the (wrecked) Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi, and the Mathura idgah. The efforts of religion-intoxicated and politically active Hindus to rebuild the Ram Mandir, the Kashi Vishwanath Mandir, and the Krishna Mandir are just three episodes m a one-thousand year long Hindu struggle to reclaim their culture and religion from alien invaders.</p>
<p>The demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya on 6 December 1992 was just one episode in the millennial struggle of the Hindus to repossess their religion-centered culture and nation. Meanwhile, hundreds of ancient Hindu temples forsaken all over Hindustan await the reawakening of Hindu cultural pride to be repaired or rebuilt and restored to their original, ancient glory.</p>
<p>Reference: What the invaders really did - By Rizwan Salim - hindustantimes.com - December 28, 1997</p>
<p>Thus it is not about anti-Islam, not at all, many muslims know what has happened and they feel bad, thus it brings about a feeling of forgiveness and a chance for understanding, however, it seems, that here it is a complete Anti-Hindu situation with an attempt to subvert and distort the truth. I have yet to see one of my muslim colleagues claim I was anti-Islamic simly because I spoke about the truth and historucal fact.</p>
<p>I hope I have been of some assistance.</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> There is also a "Horace Mann Elementary School" in Broome County, New York. (I think it's the Binghamton or Johnson City or Union-Endicott school district.) I don't see a disambiguation page so one should be added if the NY school gets added. I'm not a "keep" voter on elementary schools without evidence of other significance, so I won't be bold and do it. There are likely many other elementary schools by that name, probably all of them not notable within their category but wonderful to a segment of their local community. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 01:59, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: if we're going to have articles on every single school in the world (which it seems some people are determined to make happen) can we <i>please</i> limit to info to that which will remain consistent for years? No one is going to update a quarter of a million school articles regularly (hell, many of these are AfDed as substubs, are voted to be kept and expanded, and remain sustubs for eternity). Principals come and go (my high school had 3 in the 4 years I was there), exact student enrollments change daily. Information like that should be supplied by external links to the high school's sites (which <i>will</i> be updated). Give an approximate size ("about 200", "over 1000" etc.) and keep the rest to relatively consistent stuff, otherwise, as the articles become dated, we'll have incorrect information, which I think we can all agree is not good for the project. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:16, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a reasonable request. Whenever possible we should be dating when the principal was in office, that way when they do change we can build a historical list of principals who have served at the school, including the years they served. The same goes with enrollment counts, we should either round the numbers off slightly and state that the figures are approximate, or provide a dated source for the information so the reader is aware that these figures may have changed, as they tend to do. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 19:35, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, I don't really see this happening. Most school pages are stubs that will never be significantly expanded. Trying to make the scope of the school inundations greater by adding more pretty insignificant details is just going to increase the half-assed manner in which most of these articles are put together. Trying to have not only the current, but all past principals is going to fail. Utterly. The "best" that is likely to happen is someone will find their old high school and add who the principal was the years they were there, giving us a few names with some approximate dates and many gaps (with much still largely unverified). We have to face up to the fact that school articles by and large <i>aren't</i> going to get the attention they need to keep them up to date. There is plenty about the schools that won't change much over the years, and that is what people should be concentrating on when writing such articles. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:06, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are quite correct. I reviewed all the school articles for the states of Texas and California, and found twelve that were more than a year old. Of those twelve, only two had undergone extensive revision since their create date. Another five showed adequate growth, and were no longer just substubs. The remaining five were pretty much in the same state as they were when first written, with little or no new information added. I expect this trend will continue when the huge number of school articles created in the last six months reaches a year of age. It seems people are keen to create a mass of stubs, but when it comes to adding meat to the bones, their enthusiasm is elsewhere. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:46, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Honestly, I've been thinking this over for quite a while. It was me who put the {{NPOV}}-tag in the first place, then asked some questions on Talk:Kotava and brought up the topic on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Talk%7EConstructed_language_2597.html#Kotava" title="Talk:Constructed language">Talk:Constructed language#Kotava</a>. The language seems to have a small community of users indeed, but consensus says that that alone does not make a conlang notable enough for inclusion. The number of Google hits, on the other hand, speaks out firmly against inclusion. Unfortunately, I didn't get any reply to my remarks about the POV character of the article, nor to my questions about what else would make the language notable. I would probably have abstained if the writer of the article had at least taken the effort to remove the propagandistic elements, but its current contents, in combination with a lack of convincing arguments regarding notability, make it pretty impossible for me to vote otherwise than delete. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 10:14, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>One question is: Why you thinks of plagiarisms is bad? In the post-modernist paradigm it used only for checking for source of information. And information about plagiarisms don't ceased to exist, but in this case it will comfortable to use wikipedia for working with this information. <a href="../../../d/p/a/User%7EDpakoha_906c.html" title="User:Dpakoha">Dpakoha</a> 09:27, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I thinks of plagiarisms is bad because it means "to <b>steal</b> and pass off another's ideas or words as one's own, or to commit literary <b>theft</b>: to present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source" (MW 11th Collegiate, with my emphasis). Accusing someone of theft and stealing when you can't prove it: a bad thing. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 18:15, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The information IS useful. At 350+ episodes, your average user wouldn't know where to BEGIN to search for a specific episode. With thematic divide, they can easily search for a particular episode via the sub-categories. It saves a lot of time for any user, and it is the type of thing many internet users would expect they could use Wikipedia for. Because it makes life much easier. Wikipedia is all about organised information, and this is exactly what this page is. Such a huge topic as 'The Simpsons' really does require this level of organisation, otherwise any other information becomes much less useful. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.93.21.39.html" title="User:195.93.21.39">195.93.21.39</a> 18:03, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Sure it is useful - somehow. Any type of information can be useful to someone (I doubt this article is useful to the average user, though). But is this encyclopedic? It has been pointed out that there are other, better places for this type of fan-info on the web. Sorting out rather unencyclopedic or very specific types of data to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikimedia_projects_6e29.html" title="Category:Wikimedia projects">other wikimedia projects</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWiki_communities_9539.html" title="Category:Wiki communities">other wiki communities</a> has been a generally accepted and successful policy on Wikipedia so far. Letting this article stay will only help to allow other types of extreme "fancruft" to enter Wikipedia - and there is no reason that would detain anyone from saving this article to a more appropriate place on the web. But I am repeating myself....--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZerofoks_be6e.html" title="User:Zerofoks">zerofoks</a> 18:56, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

That they do so can be seen by the fact that almost all can be, and indeed many have been, supplemented or replaced by categories. Some, however, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_commercial_pairs.html" title="List of commercial pairs">List of commercial pairs</a>, seem just pointless.

<dd>That would be against the general policy on catgorisation, and there would be no way to ensure that it was done consistently and it would make a mess of things by pushing some of the subcategories off of the first page where there were more than 200 articles. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 01:43, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>So what would the outcome of a "Delete" vote be? Re-listing each individual article? And would a "Keep" vote in any way preclude listing inividual articles? <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 12:42, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I would expect it to be a strong precedent, no more, no less. If the result were Delete, I would suggest making a template to attach to each list explaining the conversion is happening and what it involves and that when done the article will be deleted. (Conversion being the gradual removal of links from the list as it is confirmed that the article is in the appropriate category.) If anybody felt that a particular list should be an exception (beyond those already identified and possibly additional ones still to be agreed), they could create an individual AfD to try and confirm consensus to that effect. (A note on that should be in the template.) Conversion would take some time so there would be plenty of opportunity for challenging individual cases. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 13:48, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> all, I just found out about this vote. I must say Wikipedia isn't even quite as widespread as it could be. I feel its just too soon to write off this whole area as being bad. my sentiments would be keep it, give it more time. Areas that are growing and contributing something useful- can stay. Things that are going nowhere can be pruned/removed. As more persons come on board to Wikipedia, in time they'll contribute more knowledge on these companies. I have no problem with the proposal of certain bad articles up for delete or stub criteria, esp. if a company article looks totally like nothing more then an advertisement, but I think more companies will be added in the future. My findings are everything that should- be on Wikipedia probably wont be there overnight. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaribDigita_7e23.html" title="User:CaribDigita">CaribDigita</a> 02:57, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As more companies are added, companies merge, etc, these lists have to be updated. Typically (or should I say occasionally), this is done by the person who adds or changes an entry (pick a continental European country and look at the editing history of the list..). The information tends to come from the entries/categories, and is then added to the list (not the other way round). In other words, the lists are a (weak) mirror of the categories. The clean up you suggest will be futile - once all the information is added, it is out of date. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocendoDiscimus_4b33.html" title="User:DocendoDiscimus">DocendoDiscimus</a> 15:03, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Jacqui may have misunderstood what I said. When I said "they can but most of these don't" I was responding to the statement that "lists can sort articles in other ways than just alphabetically". I see no good way to improve these lists with additional sorting that can't be done by (sub)categories. Any such improvement wouldn't be "cleanup" either, it would be structural development.

<dd>That statemment borders on the absurd. Subcategories can only contain names in alphabetical lists with no additional information about the entries. Lists can be sorted in dozens of ways (turnover; location, sector, assets, structure, ownership, profitablity etc etc) and can contain several pieces of information about each item. There are some excellent lists on some other topics. It is a pity that Wikipedia's coverage of companies is one of its weakest areas, but there is plenty of time to improve it. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 19:23, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think you'll find your statement across the border from absurd. You can't possibly have seriously thought through the maintainability implications of doing this widely, much beyond just <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_companies_by_revenue.html" title="List of companies by revenue">List of companies by revenue</a> (which is just revenue, and just top global companies). Imagine List of British companies by turnover, List of British companies by location, List of British companies by sector, List of British companies by assets, List of British comapnies by profitability, List of British companies by employment, List of British companies by location and turnover.... That's a fricken' companies database (which I happen to have some familiarity with). Maintainability of the companies lists is bad enough with just names; how would it be with all that extra information to find and update on an annual or quarterly basis? And why should we keep lists that <i>now</i> do nothing that categories (supplemented with specialised redlink lists) can't because <i>one day</i> they might (pigs might fly) turn into the absurdity of a companies database maintained in wikitext form? If Wikipedia is ever to do something along those lines, it will have to involve templates and probably a software change. Wikipedia should only store detailed up-to-date company data in one place - the company article.

<li>There is no need for any further debate. All you will do is waste a lot of other users' time which could be put to better use. Things like the Afghan list are valuable as a starting point for coverage of countries where Wikipedia is weak.

<ul>
<li>I think that's unwarranted because (a) school deletion is about notability, which is irrelevant here; (b) I was open to persuasion but nothing that anybody has said has convinced me to prefer lists instead of categories for these cases; (c) because lists are harder to maintain they long-term waste far more time than any AfD (d) a 2/3 - 1/3 vote is not a "lost cause" when the keep voting is based, as far as I can see, on no good arguments. For example, "Things like the Afghan list are valuable as a starting point" says absolutely nothing about why lists that can be converted to categories are better than categories, or why lists that duplicate categories should exist. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 19:06, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Because red links can be added to it of course, which is a lot easier than writing stubs, but does encourage others to do more. This is a basic point which has been made on articles for deletion scores of times. You need 70% support for deletion, you are now at 30%, and the early flurry of support was rather freakish as the principle that categories do not replace lists has been confirmed over and over again. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 19:16, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>We already have lists of missing company articles in the form of red links on the existing lists, which are more spedific and can therefore be more precisely categorised so they will be seen by more people with relevant knowledge.

<li>I agree that a single central list doesn't make sense. But do you believe the red links that are currently in the lists are in any way a sign of missing articles? Most red links are put in as linkspam. One of the few ways of having some objectiveness in what constitutes a <i>major company</i> is the inclusion in a <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_market_index.html" title="Stock market index">stock market index</a>.

<ul>
<li>There are many valid red links. If some of the lists need be to cleaned up the appropriate response is to clean them up rather than to delete them. Any company which would surive afd is also a legitimate link, and any links for companies which would not that may exist are hardly taking up a lot of space or causing a major distraction. Not all major companies are listed by any means. There are many multi-billion dollar private and state owned companies, as well as many subsidiaries which merit articles, and indeed plenty of subsidiaries which have them (<a href="../../../a/s/d/ASDA_86af.html" title="ASDA">ASDA</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_Scotland_e5c3.html" title="Bank of Scotland">Bank of Scotland</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbey_%28bank%29.html" title="Abbey (bank)">Abbey</a> are three very large British examples). <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 19:54, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that in theory it sounds like a great plan - someone sees the list, adds companies (or subsidiaries) that are missing, and then later someone else sees there's a company without an entry, so (s)he starts writing it. Unfortunately, that's not how it has been done until now. Please check the histories of the lists, and you'll see that typically few people bother to add anything, unless it's because they've changed another entry. Having lists just because you hope that at one point in future they will actually have any purpose doesn't make sense IMHO. Instead of trying to get the lists to mirror the categories, people should focus their energies on adding company templates etc. - <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocendoDiscimus_4b33.html" title="User:DocendoDiscimus">DocendoDiscimus</a> 20:22, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> While lists are certainly useful, even if there are categories, I find the list of companies too large, spam-targets and almost always incomplete (Note: This is from my own experience as I watch the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Indian_companies_867d.html" title="List of Indian companies">List of Indian companies</a>, which is fairly small.). It would be better to break down the list into smaller and more managable lists. But I am not in favour of and overnight deletion or a blanket policy. If it suits you, use it or if it doesn't, replace it with a better solution. --<a href="../../../p/a/m/User%7EPamri_2da3.html" title="User:Pamri">Pamri</a> <sup>• <a href="../../../p/a/m/User_talk%7EPamri_1a9f.html" title="User talk:Pamri">Talk</a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../p/a/m/User_talk%7EPamri_1a9f.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../p/a/m/User_talk%7EPamri_1a9f.html" rel="nofollow">Reply</a></sup> 17:51, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep All</b> I found the 'article' very useful, although I would also support its replacement with a category containing all the same information. Dont just delete it unless you're prepared to replace it. 88.105.251.6</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The lists by industry/sector may be the most productive ones. For those who don't want to use them, they may just igore them. IMHO, there is no point in having "List of missing company articles" in article namespace.

<li><b>Keep</b>. "Unexpandable", huh? - see if you like my rewrite. Notable in that John, Ringo, and Pete Best all sang lead at different times for the Beatles. The song also has a long blues history which i've only briefly touched on.

<li>I am impressed by your informative expansion of the article from a substub to its current form. I do stand by the AfD nomination, however, because I think the criteria for the inclusion of individual songs in an encyclopedia must involve extraordinary cultural impact (beyond "the Beatles did it").

<li><b>Keep</b> however needs a slight rewrite because the article is supposed to be about the song, and it was a Carl Perkins classic long before the Beatles touched it. I'll do a bit of work on it now.

<li>Wrong. As the bottom of our article on it amply demonstrates, Wicca <i>has</i> been accepted as a religion by the world at large.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is obviously a hoax. For a religion to be worthy of a Wikipedia article, it should be <i>noticed</i> by the world at large, not necessarily accepted in a favorable sense. If the Pope, Billy Graham, and the Dalai Lama started giving sermons about how Mattism was the work of the devil and everyone should steer far away from Mattism, that would be a sign that Mattism was at least notable even if not accepted. But there is no evidence that this religion exists anywhere outside this Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:39, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is a poor article. 1. There is not a single reference (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). 2. Most of the entries violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>; many are neologisms. 3. The title is itself a neologism. It also likely does not accord with WP:MoS (singular preferred). If you remove all the neologisms, you'd have a handful of legitimate entries, such that I'm not convinced of the need for a separate page to list them. Why not list the legit entries in each of the legit "Mc-" articles, under "See also"? That way the readers who're actually interested in these phenomena have a much better chance of finding the legit entries, compared with the situation where they are tucked away on a separate page—under a neologism. The legit entries that I see are <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonaldization_9a31.html" title="McDonaldization">McDonaldization</a>, <a href="../../../m/c/j/McJob_a377.html" title="McJob">McJob</a>, <a href="../../../m/c/w/McWorld_4645.html" title="McWorld">McWorld</a>, <a href="../../../m/c/l/McLibel_case_f5f0.html" title="McLibel case">McLibel case</a>, <a href="../../../m/c/m/McMurder_44f0.html" title="McMurder">McMurder</a>, <a href="../../../m/c/m/McMansion_fa52.html" title="McMansion">McMansion</a>, and probably <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDojo_0c78.html" title="McDojo">McDojo</a>. Someone interested in any of these will likely type in that word and get to the article, where they can be pointed to related phenomena that might interest them.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>- The person who proposed the article for deletion made constructive edits to the page and then proposed it for deletion. Seems a bit strange to me. Regardless the article seems to have valuable content, as far as I understand it describes the process of combining new technologies with traditional understandings of literacy. Author should however consider better linking the article in with other literacy and education articles.Perhaps this article should be marked for cleanup rather than deletion. <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaideRandel_3a7c.html" title="User:AdelaideRandel">AdelaideRandel</a> 02:23, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>- This is not a pseudo-academic fad nor is it a mishmash of postmodernist nonsense. Anyone with a bit of investigative skills and common sense to see it for what it is would realise that the area of multimedia literacy is becoming widely reported on from many sources besides academics alone. Do an online search, the last Google search I did with exact phrase "multimedia literacy" produced 40800 hits (although I did not sit down to read them all). The Federal Government in Australia (and other countries) spends massive amounts of money researching this area annually at some level of use by the population. It has even been included into the school curriculum at the expense of millions of Australian tax payer funded dollars. Yes I agree that some areas cross over and could be linked better, but how about we give Travers a break and let him get on top of it by editing it and addressing this issue. After all the page itself has only recently been created and has so much potential. I would like to add that the IP Address for which this article has been recommended for deletion is a Flinders University IP and the author has not signed his request by having logged in. <s>I wonder is this a student of Travers causing mischief and mayhem at his expense. This is an assumption on my behalf as the first name of Travers appears to have been used in one edit comment on the history page &amp; a university IP address was logged at the time of this entry (see page history @ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php</a>?</s></li>

(time seems to fit then) maybe you shouldn't swipe you student card at the door and make these attacks on a PC that you personally have logged onto, easy enough to trace, lets face it the internet is not as anonymous as you might think. Let us hope Travers lets you get away with this one, but you should be more careful in future. Don't go stuffing it up for the rest of us and get us blocked with your malicious work.</s> 138.217.216.144 01:37, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think enough has been said in this little debate, could an administrator archive this page and remove the AFD, I think it may be a tad supercilious. As a side note if people wish to engage in flame wars or whatever please find a more appropriate forum. I have struckout the sections above that I would regard as inappropriate for inclusion in this section as they add nothing to the debate. <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaideRandel_3a7c.html" title="User:AdelaideRandel">AdelaideRandel</a> 06:37, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

No one said this would be simple, sigh. I agree its rare, and its icky, but it's real, and definately not a neologism. This term itself is not well documented on the 'net, but there is <a href="http://www.medicalgeo.com/Med-Diseases-P---Pn/Paraphilia.html" class="external text" title="http://www.medicalgeo.com/Med-Diseases-P---Pn/Paraphilia.html" rel="nofollow">Paraphalia on MedicalGeo</a> , <a href="http://www.anxietyzone.com/conditions/paraphilia.html" class="external text" title="http://www.anxietyzone.com/conditions/paraphilia.html" rel="nofollow">Paraphilia on AnxietyZone</a>, as well as about a thousand on the more common term Necrobestiality (which should lay to rest your concerns about the reality of the practice itself.) Its sex with dead animals, which is not something that hard to comprehend when you know about necrophilia, sex with dead people, and bestiality, sex with live animals. This is precisely the kind of thing that makes WikiPedia such a valuable resource - what if someone really wanted to know about this, and we'd deleted it because we were hasty or lazy and didn't research it before relegating it incorrectly to "hoax" or "neologism" status? <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a> 15:37, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>As with many locally-grown music movements - it's my contention that although possibly not-yet-notable to many, this article and others like it should be included for the significant number of users to whom this article <i>is</i> notatble. May I also refer you to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_1bae.html#Local_Bands" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Music Notability Discussion</a> -- DesignbyGecko 00:51, 30 October 2005</p>

<li>Absolutely every band in the world, however bad, is notable to at least its members. Many of these bands go through several changes of personnel (and often name) before disappearing without ever having made a mark. Their own assertions of "spearheading" new movements in music are generally unverifiable. Unless and until a band has reached some reasonably verifiable and measurable level of success (e.g. making top 100 in the indie charts) I can't see much point adding them. One of the problems with the deletion policy as-is, though, is that it is inherently vulnerable to those with an agenda (see the never-ending debate re minor schools); it's not that I don't respect the views of inclusionists, but a voting process is about our personal view of how the article measures up to our interpretation of the criteria for inclusion. Minor bands are hard to verify, and minor bands' pages are generally written by fans so will often fail <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> with no hope of balance because only their fans have ever heard of them. I have no idea how to fix this, other than by using something like Wikicities. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 08:36, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't delete</b> It seems to be a question of how closely one should follow one's sources. I started the article to balance what seems an outdated and error-prone point of view in other Wikipedia articles (and to learn how to teach physics), and it has progressed nicely.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As a compromise, I suggest:</dd>
<dd>Suppose we rename <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics.html" title="Interpretation of quantum mechanics">Interpretation of quantum mechanics</a> to History of the interpretation of quantum mechanics, rename this article to "Subtleties of the relation between quantum an classical descriptions of nature", and archive this entire article and re-write it, closer to its text book sources but without plagiarizing?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is good historical material in that other article, but its title, as it is, is misleadingly outdated. Its category would change from physics to history of physics.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Part of the objective for the new article should be to help understand entanglement, if possible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Text book authors work hard to make it believable to people who did not grow up exposed to quantum mechanics, and maybe there is much more of that quality that can be taken without adhering too closely. This would allow this article to be checked paragraph by paragraph against its sources, as people here want, but would still be representative of a modern view.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, I would prefer that this be done incrementally.</dd>
<dd>There are other article with similar outdated classical point of view.</dd>

<li>That is a complicated question. For instance, <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat.html" title="Schrödinger's cat">Schrödinger's cat</a> has a comment by someone else that its point of view is out of date, and a way to avoid the paradox is a relatively recent addition. The interpretation section in <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">Quantum mechanics</a> is from a classical point of view, like <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics.html" title="Interpretation of quantum mechanics">Interpretation of quantum mechanics</a>. That is like discussing electromagnetism from the point of view of geometric optics. I object to the title "Interpretation of quantum mechanics" No-one talks about the "interpretation of wave optics" anymore, as they did near <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christiaan_Huygens_6560.html" title="Christiaan Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a>' time. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_R._Ingham_2670.html" title="User:David R.

<li>I think <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics.html" title="Interpretation of quantum mechanics">Interpretation of quantum mechanics</a> is appropriate given what most readers <i>know</i>, and where they expect to find, and that articles should not be titled to make a a point as you're suggesting.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Several remarks.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) this article appears to be about QM and not classical physics. There is such a thing as the philosophy of classical mechanics, but this article does not appear to actually discuss any of it (Everything I've seen on the philosophy of classical mechanics dealt with the nature of determinism, since solutions to differential equations seem to imply determinism. More recently, that philosophy wanders off to discuss chaotic dynamics. I've never seen it discuss QM). So at a minimum, this article needs to be renamed to philosophical interpretation of quantum mechanics,</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) This article could be named philosophical failures of classical mechanics if it was enlarged to talk about non-quantum issues, e.g. chaos, or the impact of special/general relativity to classical concepts of time and space. or e.g. <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mach_principle.html" title="Mach principle">Mach principle</a>. There's no discussion of the (non-)constancy of constants, (for example, the electric charge varies with distance, or e.g. <a href="../../../a/s/y/Asymptotic_freedom.html" title="Asymptotic freedom">asymptotic freedom</a>) (for example, the speed of light is locally constant, but the amount of time it takes for light to cross a de Sitter universe is something like 3 times the size of the universe, implying that in a certain sense "light slows down" when thought about in a global way, as the universe expands. Locally, the speed of light is just a conversion from time units to space units. Globally it is something quite different.). There's no discussion of mass, where mass comes from, why there's more matter than anti-matter, etc. Why the universe isn't rotating. No discussion of why time is one dimensional but space isn't. No mention of <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaluza-Klein_b6e1.html" title="Kaluza-Klein">Kaluza-Klein</a> theories as alternate conceptions of space and time.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) While it does discuss some of the actual issues the differentiate QM from classical, it is written in an 'original research' style. Its a very unusual presentation of only a small subset of the topics that are usually discussed. I won't vote for deletion, but the article has failings as currently structured. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 14:21, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>In answer to the above 1), I think a better title can be found but it is not "philosophical interpretation of quantum mechanics" or "interpretation of quantum mechanics". The probabilities encountered when using an approximation to a theory belong to the approximation and not to the theory, even if it is an approximation without which one cannot get out of bed. I don't argue with 2) 3). Feel free to change the style of my parts of it. I agree with merging and changing the title to something new. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_R._Ingham_2670.html" title="User:David R. Ingham">David R.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I wonder exactly why the nominator is calling this original research (this is an honest question, not a veiled attack on the nomination)?

<dd>My understanding is that the core of the POV of David R. Ingham, i.e. the core of the article as originally written, pertains to discussions supposedly in Albert Messiah's two volume <b>Quantum Mechanics</b>. Messiah is given as the researcher whose views the article is said to report, but Ingham has not responded to repeated requests to provide the citation. The thought experiment that Messiah supposedly discusses is generally known as Heisenberg's Microscope (Google for many articles that do not support Ingham's account), and it was important in the early development of quantum physics. It pertains to the problems involved in using a photon to measure the position of an electron. Articles and books pertaining to this thought experiment generally provide a diagram. Messiah's book is very well written, and very well indexed. Reading all the materials indexed under "electron" does not uncover the discussion that Ingham claims as the basis for his report. Searching the index for Heisenberg's Microscope provides nothing at all. Scanning the entire book for diagrams related to any experiment in which a photon is bounced off of an electron in an attempt to learn about it also yields no positive results. In the absence of a citation to the assertions that are at the core of the issue, the actual authorship of the assertions appears to rest with Ingham.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the numerous citations, I think I have provided most of them. The several citations I supplied apply only to peripheral issues, to statements of the sort that I would regard almost as common knowledge, and certainly not to the controversial thesis advanced by Ingham. For me, the biggest problem in dealing with this article is that the core article, the material that appears to imply that Greene and other current writers on the subject have it wrong, is extremely unclear. I, for one, cannot help to make it any clearer without a look at the original sources from which this account was derived. Messiah is one source and Ingham's lecture notes from quite some time ago on the account of a university physics professor appear to be the other source -- a source that is quite naturally unavailable. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 02:05, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Measuring electrons with photons is in there in Messiah, at least once. I will look where. I had been thinking that looking at new sources would be more useful than arguing about old ones. He uses this example at least to make the point that if one had classical light to measure with, qm would not stand, because the measuring device would violate the uncertainty principle.

<dd>I think the central issues are that the earlier one accepts qm, the easier it is, from an educational point of view, and that, from an academic point of view, that the most reliable sources for an encyclopedia are usually text books, graduate level in case of dispute—other sources are too hard to sort through and evaluate. (I need advice on how closely they should be followed.) Verbal discussions are good except that arguments about them can't be settled.</dd>
<dd>Accepting these assumptions, the point of view that classical mechanics needs to be described from a quantum point of view and not visa versa will eventually prevail, in some form, whether I persist or not.</dd>
<dd>The next step is to read more recent text books, not to go backward.</dd>
<dd>I do not accept the view that because this is cryptic, to even some physicists, it is inappropriate for the reader who looks this far. One should hear how things really are, in simple words, as soon as possible, even if it takes time to understand. Simplify if you like, but don't write or keep things that are not entirely accurate.</dd>

<dd>I don't know about your proposed titles. I always hate the dismissive attitude of "xyz for Dummies" books, but your idea in essence is not bad. There are a couple of problem in talking about this kind of stuff. (1) The behavior of things on this very small scale is not what we expect to see. If prisoners in cement block cells were found in some small percentage of cases to "evaporate" from their cells and "materialize" outside the prison wall, we would not even consider any possibility other than that trickery was involved. But that's what electrons can do. (2) The way of talking about things that allows us to even begin to make sense out of things can involve complicated mathematics. But it isn't impossible to talk sensibly about what is going on. Greene's <i>Fabric of the Cosmos</i> does an excellent job. I think the ideal Beginners Guide article would describe some of the basic phenomena and perhaps tell people how to do experiments that would show them some of the weird stuff. Now that laser pointers are available for tens of dollars rather than hundreds of dollars, everybody can make his/her own double-slit apparatus. (I just made one a week or so ago with a plastic box, some nails, and some toy plastic railroad tracks. Since I already had the laser pointer, my out of pocket expenses were $2 to buy the plastic items at the local "dollar store."}</dd>
<dd>Many if not most of the physics articles jump in at or near the deep end of the pool, use undefined symbols in mathematical statements of principles, etc. There is no way for, e.g., a high school student with no calculus and nothing more than a general science course in hand to have the foggiest idea of what is going on.</dd>

<dd>The part of that article on measurement is incomprehensible. I have no trouble with Reichenbach, Messiah, Pauli, Greene..., but I have no idea what is being asserted there. I think I have found the part of Messiah's textbook that was given as authority, but it does not even suggest answers to my questions. There may be people here who know what he is talking about because they know the subject so well that undefined terms and terms that are wikified to explanations that do not apply in context of that paragraph will nevertheless be clear to them.

<dd>The "radical" didactic principle is that one should stick to the real facts when simplifying, even if people get less of a feeling of understanding at the time they read it, because unlearning is harder than learning. For a physics article in an encyclopedia, this means avoiding physics from popular sources that can't be justified with references to high level text books. I have illustrated this by an example of an error in <i>Physics Today</i> caused by not following this principle.</dd>

<dd>If the topic can not be explained at all without the use of jargon that is not accessible to reasonably intelligent people then the article needs to be edited to remove the jargon or removed. No one has claimed that we have to use "popular sources" only that the material be sufficiently explained and that it be notable enough to be referenceable. For example, only recently have you even identified the thesis of the article, "Philosophical interpretation of classical physics is a discussion of the spurious content in the classical description." (I think that is the intended thesis - correct me if I misunderstood).</dd>
<dd>The reason I am even spending time on this is because I do think that the idea that I think the article wants to convey is very interesting. I.e. that classical physics was so pervasive in our society and thinking that it influenced other disciplines in unexpected ways. Additionally, because the extrapolations of classical physics were not correct in their predictions QM was developed. Unfortunately, however, the influence of classical physics on other disciplines did not completely disappear when QM was introduced and other disciplines still make assumptions based on classical physics that have since been proven to not properly describe nature.

<p>I think a lot of the article makes a lot of sense. Basically it states that since we still insist on Newtonian mechanics which is flawed at the atomic level to describe experiments and what we measure, a probabilistic description is what we obtain. If we also knew the exact quantum state of our measuring equipment there would be no probabilities. I guess if there is a <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copenhagen_interpretation.html" title="Copenhagen interpretation">Copenhagen interpretation</a>, then this article is also justified as an alternate interpretation and possible way out of the measuring problem. I wouldn't say there is any original research since it is a completely obvious alternative. I would like a better title like .... interpretation of quantum mechanics. Merging with <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics.html" title="Interpretation of quantum mechanics">Interpretation of quantum mechanics</a> is also acceptable. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarSch_3340.html" title="User:MarSch">MarSch</a> 10:51, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A <b>delete</b> would also be acceptable to me, since it seemed more and more like OR on education as the discussion went on. I don't know if it's still appropriate to change my vote, though, so I'm just noting that here. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 15:59, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I could live with keeping the content somewhere, be it a userfy or a merge. I still think that this specifically as it exists now should be deleted. --<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastAStone_9a4a.html" title="User:CastAStone">CastAStone</a> 19:27, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Changed my vote to "userfy." I suspect that the author was trying to say something in the original core of the article that may be worthwhile. If it were put in clear mathematics complemented by clear Engish, then there would be a fair basis for deciding what it means and whether it is at least the point of view on or interpretation of somebody like Bohm.<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 03:41, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And changed it again, assuming that the article is what is left of the original after William M. Conolley's edit. If the original author had a contribution to make, despite his difficulties in communicating, that contribution has been eroded away. Of what is left, there is nothing that should not have been well covered elsewhere. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 20:09, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've just hacked most of it out and replaced it with my own interpretation, which is hopefully the mainstream one, though I'm open to correction. It could do with more by experts. But the basic idea seems sensible and not OR; Karol suggested that these points were made elsewhere: are they? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M.

<dd>I like the style alot better, but it still reads like a "blah-blah" essay to me. In any case, I can't see why we should have a page with such a pretentious title when, for startes, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_physics.html" title="Classical physics">classical physics</a> is almost a stub (see my comment in the voting section also). <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarol_Langner_26da.html" title="User:Karol Langner">Karol</a> 06:38, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't want to argue this too strongly - I don't really care all that much. But I don't think that just because CP is nearly a stub this should go. If CP is a stub then there is an awful lot of other stuff that should go into it before this does, or it will be very unbalanced. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M.

<dd>I agree with Karol, basically. The original article <b>seemed</b> to have something to say about aspects of QM that may fail to get adequate coverage in popularizations like Amir D. Aezel's <i>Entanglement</i>. Now there is nothing that is not already in other QM articles. If there was anything of value hidden in the original article behind the extremely muddy writing, it exists only in the history of the article now. I tried very hard, spending probably 30 hours reading my collection of physics books that goes back to the 60s, trying to get a line onto what he was really trying to communicate. I tried many times in many ways to get Ingham to give citations or clarifications. All of this I did in the hope we would not come to the point where anything of value would be edited away as incomprehensible. That's why I think the original article should be recovered from history and userfied. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 15:27, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've nominated this for deletion because it seems to be nothing more than a copy-paste (potentially translated from French, as its rather awkwardly written) of what is more or less an editorial.

<dd>Removing the tag only increases the article's chances for deletion because the tag directs people who are interested in the subject to the article's AfD entry, where they are likely to vote <i>keep</i>. An AfD tag should never be removed before concensus is reached unless it is obviously vandalism. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalumTelluride_d79e.html" title="User:TantalumTelluride">TantalumTelluride</a> 20:28, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The earlier attempt was not to remove the tag, which does nothing as you point out, but terminate it alltogther (not a valid method).

<dd>For those looking for criteria to decide if a 'mod' is notable, there are some concrete things to look for that may be helpful when forming a opinion: What files have actually been released (e.g. not just a website or news posts), and the nature of actual game content created for it (was it a few lines of code, or a complex 3-D model with textures). It can often be hard to gauge the popularity of older notable mods, but examining content and files really separate out the failed projects, game tweaks, or pretenders from more serious work. More time consuming, but very effective in judging a mod's merits, is to go play it and actually see what amount of content in terms of music, textures, and coding was actually put together.</dd>
<dd>Determining a mods level of achievement can be hard, even for those familiar with modding somtimes. However, checking for content, and not just news posts can provide a useful benchmark for separating out a wildly varying art form. <a href="../../../t/r/9/User%7ETr9ccc_a1ce.html" title="User:Tr9ccc">Tr9ccc</a> 04:06, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nomination. - Bakewell Tart 21:36, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong and Speedy Keep</b> Bakewell Tart and Crusading Composer have a complete and unhealthy fixation with belittling the subject of this page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Bakewell_Tart" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Bakewell_Tart" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Crusading_composer" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Crusading_composer" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> Should such a fixation lead to a page being deleted? Also he's composed for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Evelyn Glennie, written operas with libretti by John Masefield and Richard Adams - shall I go on? Maybe not a household name but he's done enough to be included.</li>
<li><b>Strong and Speedy Keep</b>. They have also been trying to remove all the justified links in other pages so that it appears Steadman only appears in this one article. This is a huge manipulation of Wikipedia - inexperienced and new editors, with a fixation and, it seems, out to make a name for themselves. I wonder if they know the subject of the article in real life and are trying to have a go? It seems somewhat like that. 86.137.230.153 21:43, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong and Speedy Keep</b>. I assert that this nomination was made in bad faith. Bakewell Tart has made only 14 edits, <i>all</i> of which were to the article in question, its talk page, or this AfD. He/she has been involved in an edit war and has at least twice deleted most of the information in the article, and appears to have a POV vendetta against the subject. And for the record, there is no question of the subject's notability; he is a major figure in the UK contemporary composing scene, as well as his academic career, covered in other sources, widely reviewed, etc. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 21:47, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Whoah! I'm not bothered either way. I am not out to get Mr Steadman. In fact, I had thought that I had done a good job in tidying up one of the paragraphs - none of the 'official' editors minded enough to change it. The only edits I have made are regarding 'educationailst' - Mr Steadman's 'official' editors don't seem to know what the word means. As far as I was concerned, the curtailing of the article was sanctioned by Mr Steadman himself as a way of heading off further vandalism. I'm new to this but I am fed up of the way that User:86.137.230.153 keeps on calling me a vandal. I have made what I consider to be fair edits - not vandalism. I have deleted Mr Steadman's name from various lists - there seems to be some kind of confusion - getting your name on as many wikipedia pages as possible isn't evidence of notability - User:86.137.230.153 seems to think that I am trying to make him seem less famous - surely it is this page and this page alone that determines whether he is notable and whether he deserves to be on the lists. Since Mr Steadman himself asked for the article to be deleted, I am sure that my actions won't be unswelcome.</dd>

<p>It seems to me that if the subject has requested deletion then the opinion of someone who claims to have no contact or authority shouldn't override that decision. It seems a bit... unhealthy to me to have someone laying out every detail of your life when you have not asked them to do so. I think that the shortened article was much more appropriate - especially considering that Mr steadman has been receiving hate mail at his home - I'd think that he'd want to reduce the amount of VERY personal information availbale on the internet. I'll admit that I haven't edited anything outside of the articles above - but i'm a bit overwhelmed. I seem to spend a lot of time reading articles and have found nothing else that I feel knowledgable enough to edit. I haven't changed any facts just removed some inconsistencies.Crusading composer 22:41, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Could you explain your knowledge of Steadman and where it comes from? How do you know he has receive "hate mail" at his house? Again this post by Crusading Composer doesn't really ring true, in my opinion. There is something very fishy going on. 86.137.230.153 22:49, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no doubt that Robsteadman is Robert Steadman. He has referred other posters to his website,. He shares the same emailadrress as the website andhHe has downloaded music to those who have asked for it. He has been claiming to be Mr Steadman for many years and has even threatened legal action for libel when his 'easily identifiable' name has been libelled. In all this time, there have been no complaints to the TES administrators that Robsteadman is not Robert Steadman and has stolen his identity.

<li>I have absolutely no clue about the particulars of Steadman's life and whatnot, but it doesn't take a lot of Googling to figure out that the subject merits an article. A look in the edit history of the article in questions leads me to believe that this is a bad-faith nomination, (and frankly, edits to an article about a composer with summaries that refer to "delusions of grandeur", made by someone with the username of "Crusading Composer" don't exactly convince me of NPOV, either). But that's really beside the point; the question here is whether or not this article should exist. Yes, it should. <b>Strong and speedy keep</b>.

I'm pretty sure that I mentioned that I have no particular view either way. I have not been trying to get the article removed. I only wanted the original article to be balanced. I'm OK with the shortened article - I have even helped to improve it. That's hardly the attitude of someone hell bent on destruction, is it? If the article IS retained - which seems likely, then I hope that it has the shorter format. If the longer format is restored, I hope that someone points out to the other editors, that EVERYBODY has the right to add comments and, as long as they are not offensive or untrue, they shouldn't be deleted just because you want an article to only show the subject in glowing terms.Crusading composer 00:07, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps you could answer the above question by 86.137.230.153 as to where your knowledge of Steadman comes from. It seems that your only contribution's to Wikipedia have been to remove information from his article. Yes, of course everyone should be able to contribute to the article, but you yourself just said that info "not offensive or untrue", "shouldn't be deleted". So why, exactly were you favouring the reduction of the article with removal of large chunks of information? Information which I don't think could be in much doubt as to be factually accurate. Providing your additions remain written with a neutral point of view, are factually accurate, and encylopedic, I see no reason why they should be removed. Your removing of large chunks of text with no real justification, however, will not be accepted.

<p><b>Keep</b> - since when is it up to the subject of an article to ask for its deletion? This does strike me as a bad faith nomination - a new editor who has only edited one page on one subject asking fro it to be deleted. Steadman is no major fgiure but, gtom a quick google, has done a number of noteworthy things. 86.136.234.112 07:52, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually, no. I mean, certainly, he's well within his rights to ask for removal of truly personal and private information (home addresses, phone numbers and whatnot), but taking a quick look at the edit history, I haven't seen anything of the sort there. Public information is fair game; as a somewhat prominent public figure, he's in no position to demand the removal of an encyclopedia article about him any more than, say, George W. Bush or Marilyn Manson is. Frankly, the assertion that an encyclopedia article featuring such intimate facts as how many symphonies he has composed or where he works puts him at risk is ridiculous, <i>particularly</i> as just about the same facts can be discovered from Steadman's own website. (And if he's getting threatening letters, it seems to me that anything Wikipedia says is completely beside the point, too, since clearly the culprits already know enough about him.) And finally, if Robert Steadman has a problem with his Wikipedia article, perhaps Robert Steadman or someone who provably represents him can deal with it. Instead of, say, some guy on the internet. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:36, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A request by a subject to have the article about them deleted is not a factor in deciding to retain or delete the article, as I explained on the Talk page, and I believe that fairly reflects Wikipedia policy and practice. It is the identical situation as with the news media; you can't tell <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a> not to write a story about you. And in Steadman's case, it is clearly not the case that he is trying to hide from public note, but that the article about him has been repeated vandalized, in some cases in an actionably defamatory way. And as I explained, the remedy for that is not deletion, but vigilance on the part of editors to revert vandalism promptly. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 00:50, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have googled the man: His name appears on various lists that link back to his website - all of them lists that allow anybody to access them and add links. As for articles created by third parties that are not anonymous - well therer are less than half a dozen and one of them was concerning a burglary. He's hardly famous in any sense of the word. No, i take that back, he's more well known than I am - at least on the internet. I get around a bit - if wee total the number of people who can say "Yes, I know so and so", it might actually be a larger number than those who have heard of Mr Steadman. Maybe? Probably not.? I have got one article on the net about me, but it's more a case of 'notoriety' rather than 'notability' and I wouldn't want a wiki page about it.00:31, 27 October 2005 (UTC) Crusading composer 00:41, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hardly famous in any sense of the word? According to his website, his work has been a subject of a TVS documentary (<i>Music Makers</i>, 1988) and one of his songs was featured for several weeks on BBC One in 1996, and he's been reviewed in The Guardian and the Nottingham Evening Post. Oh, and we don't just need to take his word for it, since as it happens, Google returns a whole bunch of stuff about him, certainly more than "half a dozen" -- for example, this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/derbyshire/3817899.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/derbyshire/3817899.stm" rel="nofollow">article</a> at BBC News about his Anne Frank tribute. That's not superstardom by any means, but certainly it's an indication of some fame and popularity. Either you do not Google very well, or you do so with an agenda.

In fact, if you're accusing him of lying, perhaps you would care to provide some proof of that? This is a guy for whom I easily get a a whole bunch of Google hits that tell me that a) he exists; b) he has indeed composed these works; c) he teaches where he says he teaches; and d) his works have been performed widely enough to meet a reasonable minimum criteria for notability. And yes, I do find it very interesting that you go from defending his privacy and telling sob stories about how he's being sent threatening letters to suddenly implying that he's not even a notable composer and that he's making things up. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 01:23, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have googled again and I find that if you arte looking for the composer instead of the actor, you do get about 10 pages of links. If you ignore multiple entries, references in lists set up by anonymous editors, wikipedia and articles that only link to his own website, there are less than half a dozen real articles and most of them are in his local paper. Yes, his name does appear in a lot of newspaper links, but only because he spends alot of time writing ion - they are just comments by him not about him.Crusading composer 01:13, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm quite capable of differentiating between the cinematographer and the composer, thank you, as well as the Wikipedia mirrors and the messages he has left himself on various message boards. It's also worth noting that as he's not working in pop music and most of the reviews noted on his site are from an era where the internet was not as widespread as it is today, Google's effectivenes as a tool of measurement is greatly lessened. Just the same, I refer you to the BBC News article I linked to above. I don't think this guy is a huge name, but as far as modern classical composers go, he's hardly a nobody. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 01:23, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>You certainly like to twist my words, captain dstain. I'm not accusing Mr Steadman of lying - he is very quick to threaten legal action, so I'm not going there. I merely questioned whether YOU had found evidence to back up these claims. Obviously, you have not. I find no incriguities in my posts. I haven't stated an opinion on mr Steadman's privacy - merely mentioned it and asked if we should respect it. I have my own theory as to why Mr steadman wants this thread pulled, but that's irrelevant. I don't care whether it is pulled or not - anyone can read that above. As to sob stories about hate mail, my personal belief as to whether any was sent is not something I'd like to mention. I merely pointed out that Mr Steadman has claimed to have received some and this may be one reason why Mr Steadman MAY prefer to see this article shortened. The only reason i keep on posting, is that this seems to be a bit one sided. I am presenting an alternative viewpoint. There's nothing personal. I have no hidden agenda. I repeat: I don't care if this page is deleted or not. If it is kept, I hope the short version is adopted and kept to.Crusading composer 02:12, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, sure. You're not accusing him of lying, you just ask if I've found evidence to support the claims on the website. Perhaps there's a reason -- other than implying that they are false claims -- to do so, but you'll forgive me if I can't see what it might be. In any case, thank you for your alternative viewpoint. I think that at this point, you can safely consider it to be rather solidly and comprehensively presented. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 02:24, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Can I also say I am concerned that Crusading composer is so concerned about Steadman and has done so much to adjust his entry and position on Wikipedia and yet claims this is only for a knowledge gleaned from an internet messageboard!

<li><b>Very strong keep</b>. What a lot of fuss! I have just spent 10 minutes reading through all that Crusading Composer and Bakewell Tart have said and done re: this article and can only conclude that this is a bad faith nomination. Steadman has had symphonies performed, been reviewed in The Guardian, had a song featured on BBC Radio One, has written for Evelyn Glennie and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and has worked with the likes of Richard Adams on an opera. Amazing how some question his notability given just that let alone the large number of performances and commissions he seems to attract. I do wonder why two new editors are so concerned about Steadman that all their Wikipedia efforts have been to reduce his entry here and, ultimately, to remove him. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobeaston99_838b.html" title="User:Robeaston99">Robeaston99</a> 08:05, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> as per MCB and Robeaston99's arguments. Nomination was clearly made in bad faith from a user involved exclusively with removing information from this article (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Bakewell_Tart" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Bakewell_Tart" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>). It would also be interesting for an admin to check the IP from where Bakewell Tart and Crusading composer (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Crusading_composer" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Crusading_composer" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>) have been posted. Both are relatively new to Wikipedia, and both have made edits exclusively to articles pertaining to Robert Steadman such that I'm inclined to think they are likely to be the same person. The usernames, too, seem strange, with one making reference to "composer", and the other to "Bakewell" - the town where Steadman lives. For what it's worth, Steadman's website (<a href="http://www.thesteadmans.btinternet.co.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thesteadmans.btinternet.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>) is hosted with BTinternet, so once could possibly guess that the man himself may post from one of BT's numerous IP pools. Anyhow, that's besides the point, since in my opinion Steadman is definitely of sufficient notability to have an article on here. I take issue with the latest (see edit history) changes to the article in trying to drastically reduce the content by those considering him not sufficiently notable. Either he is, and the article contain's as much (factually correct and encyclopedic) info as is contributed, or he's not and it is deleted. As per my post on that <a href="../../../r/o/b/Talk%7ERobert_Steadman_08d2.html" title="Talk:Robert Steadman">talk page</a>, he cannot be deemed notable only enough for a short article. <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 08:14, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

This is a bit unfair. Just because Bakewell tart and I share an interest in Mr Steadman and have posted only on steadman related articles, it doesn't mean we are the same person. exactly the same thing could be said about vhjh and 86.137.230.153. does that mean that the FOUR of us are the same person in some weird schizophrenic debate? No. I'm going to come down on the side of DELETE today. The reason I have changed my mind is that the major contributors to this article are UNWILLING to allow collaboration. There is no point in saying that the article was created by several users - a simple trawl through their contributions reveals that it is merely one BT use for a week, then another, then another. There is no evidence that an early creator returns later on. No, it's just one IP contributing then dissappearing to be replaced by another. Vhjh and the anonymous editors post on each others pages indicating that there is even a link between vhjh and the anonymous users. A suspicious person might believe that there is only ONE editor. Now this isn't really a probl;em except the person (or persons) who created this site have one agenda - that is to promote Mr Steadman. They do not tolerate any unofficial additions. Edits are quickly reverted and followed with threats that the person will be blocked and calling them vandals. This agenda can be most clearly seen in the attempts of vhjh to keep the article permanently protected. They want the page to be preserved as a shrine to Mr Steadman and to prevent ANY othere edits. They have asked for the power to block/unblock when they wish so that only they can make edits. This is totally against the spirit of Wikipedia. It is for this reason that I suggest the article be removed. I don't trust the editors.Crusading composer 09:47, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just out of interest, this page has attracted 12 contributors. Six of those (myself included) only appear on edit lists relating to Steadmanism. Three of them are Steadman contributors so I question their NPOV and one appears only on this page (is that called a meat puppet?).Crusading composer 09:57, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As you well know the problem with anon posts is that with roaming IPs we have no idea whether the poster has posted on lots of other articles or not - so your claim is, at best, irrelevant. I often forget to log in. Perhaps Crusading Composer and Bakewell Tart could tell us where their interest and knowledge of all things Steadman arises? And why you have such a thing about him? There seem to make a lot of assertions about him and yet provide no evidence whilst attacking others for a similar problem. Shameful behaviour, in my opinion and whoever it was who suggested the admin look into these "two" users was correct. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobeaston99_838b.html" title="User:Robeaston99">Robeaston99</a> 10:22, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, it's funny that, you ALWAYS forget to post in on non steadman sites. Pull the other one. I, myself have nothing to hide from admin.Crusading composer 10:47, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You have selective reading skills. I don't have a thing about Mr Steadman. I wanted to make his article more reflective of his ideas and beliefs - information I have gathered by reading his contributions to the TES (yes, he is the same person). My contention isn't with Mr Steadman (who has said that he finds this article embarrassing and would like it deleted), but with the rather fixated steadmanphiles who created this article and are flouting the spirit of Wikipedia by preventing other editors from making changes.Crusading composer 10:47, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting that you criticise others for wanting to do things to the page whilst you have gone out of your way to do as much to extinguish the subject from Wikipedia as possible. I really do not se what links to an internet messageboard achieve - shall we link to every contribution Steadman has made? Why just these ones? Is it for you to grind an axe? I suspect so. And, sorry to have to correct you once more, I didn't say I only forget to sign in on Steadman's pages I rarely remember to sign in when I contribute. I am very concerned about the aggressive tone you are taking and the way you feel that, despite being a new editor, you can buly around other far more experienced editors. I think the best thing is for you to take a step back and consider the ethos of collaboration that Wikipedia is based on. Admin do need to look into your behaviour and that of the "other" user intent on doing damage to this article. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobeaston99_838b.html" title="User:Robeaston99">Robeaston99</a> 11:00, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Robeaston, just how am I being 'aggressive'? I was just surprised that you only ever remember to sign in on Steadman pages - otherwise you always forget. That's a bit odd, why do you think that is? I ask you to retract the allegation of bullying - I haven't bullied anyone. Why do you and the other Steadman contributors sound so alike - 'the admin must look into this'? I think that you'll find that the only 'bullying' and threatening ahs been done by someone claiming to be Mr Steadman himself. The most ironic thing you have said is asking me to consider the ethos of collaboration. Let's go back a few weeks - a couple of people made some harmless edits to this article. They were accused of being vandals. This led to an escalation which has seen this article protected twice. That wasn't me, my edits have been reasonable (I still think it reasonable to remove Mr Steadman's name from 'famous' lists until his notability has been established) but I have still been smeared and threatened. One of my edits HAD been allowed to remain for a week - mainly becuase the previous version didn't make sense, but now the article has been restored to its full glory and I doubt that any further collboration will be allowed - evidenced by the attempts by vjhj to get the article permanently protected with access only allowed to him.Crusading composer 11:23, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you - you have had your say on this matter - over and over. STrange how the only two who have asked for deletion are you and Bakewell Tart. There is something very fishy about your fixation with the subject of this article and it does warrant further investigation. You have yet to explain your interest and knowledge in the subject. And why so agitated? If you are so concerned about proper collaboration you woul see that your attempt to smear Mr. Steadman has failed and, might I suggest, it would be appropriate for you to back down and let others have their say. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobeaston99_838b.html" title="User:Robeaston99">Robeaston99</a> 11:30, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Additionally, once a page is on Wikipedia there is no reason why it should be limited as long as the content is factual - whilst an odd revision could be made I think the article fits that description in the long version.

<li>I propose that this entire thread is moved to the article's discussion page and taken off the VfD, since it appears that a strong consensus exists for closing the VfD with keep. No credible reaosn has been advanced for deleting the article (even if the subject didn't want it here, which is debatable, there is nothing stopping him coming here himself and fixing whatever it is he allegedly does not like). There is reasonable evidence that this nomination is in bad faith, there is no dispute regarding the notability of the subject, the article clearly does not meet any of the criteria for deletion, and what argument there is seems to centre on issues which are, on the face of it, largely unrelated to the subject. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 12:40, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes. This would be an excellent move indeed, and thank you for proposing it, Guy. I think it's blatantly obvious that this was a bad faith nomination, and I do think that Composer is being extremely disingenuous here. (I find it a little disappointing that he seems to honestly think that if he just keeps up the pretense and rambles on and on, he'll get his way, despite the fact that the actual votes on the AfD are overwhelmingly on the side of keeping the article and he has been completely unable to dispute Steadman's notability despite the insinuations that Steadman is, in fact, lying on his website.) We have two votes to delete, from Tart and Composer, and twelve to keep, four of which are tagged as "speedy", and frankly, I believe we'd have more keeps if people weren't so put off by the long rants on the AfD. I guess if you dissemble loud enough, it slows things down, at least... -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 15:16, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>By the way, what happens if it is removed from possible deletion? How long before these two can try to do this again? Or just go back to butchering the page? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobeaston99_838b.html" title="User:Robeaston99">Robeaston99</a> 12:47, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If they try for deletion again this page will come up as the AfD discussion, which will flag up that it has already been considered and rejected. Personally I think they are wasting their time: if they have genuine issues with Steadman, then document them in a factual and NPOV way and they can stay in. Wikipedia does not require hagoigraphy. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 12:56, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Anyway, don't know how things work in the US, but I'm used to clubs only having members who actually play for it, and not the general public, so I'd say 80 members is more or less okay by my standards for this type of club. <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 00:03, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> 80 is a reasonably small number. Traditionally, rugby clubs typically have many more members than actually play. Ranks such as club captain are typically held by playing members, however, executive members such as teh chairman and secretary might not play in competitive games at all. Not to be confused with the structure of professional clubs, of course. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk back</a></small> 02:10, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Applying the Giant Tortoise to different aspects of philosophy is a practical way of illustrating that philosophy, as its principles also cover the desire and objective list theories, as well as Utilitarianism.

<li>Having reviewed my vote, as promised elsewhere, I'm sticking with "keep". No support has been provided in any of these delete votes, just assertions of non-notability.

<li><b>Opinion</b>The election pages in Wikipedia are somewhat bias towards incumbants. We give them biographies and describe them as real people. The challengers are all just names on a list. However, unless he is the leader the incumbant is no more notable, <i>in the context of an election page,</i> than any of the challengers, yet they are still linked to a biography. This guy is listed here: <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_municipal_election%2C_2005.html" title="Vancouver municipal election, 2005">Vancouver municipal election, 2005</a>.

<dd>I would not describe that as a "bias"; they have links because they have articles, based on being notable for either holding public office or for some other reason, not for being the "incumbent candidate". If any challenger was individually worthy of an article for some reason, he/she would have a link as well. The purpose of Wikipedia is not to assure some some sort of mythical concept of "fairness" in which electoral candidates get articles. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 00:56, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>My very small expansion of the article "<i>by adding something other than demographic</i>" already proved you wrong (before you even made the comment). Also, the student, while not famous, and not warranting a separate article yet, is more relevant than a famous person would be, if that famous person got fame well after graduation (as is typical). I'm sure the details that are likely to be added won't be of interest to you, and many others, and that's ok with me; since I feel they will be of interst to a sufficient number. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 14:00, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have really broad definitions of notability as pertains to schools, and the person you added was the alumnus I was referring to. That said, I require more than deographic data and assertion of existence before I'm willing to accept that a school is an encyclopedic topic, and the insertion of a fact that would be minute trivia in <a href="../../../c/o/q/Coquitlam%2C_British_Columbia_a0e3.html" title="Coquitlam, British Columbia">Coquitlam, British Columbia</a> and doesn't seem to have anything to do with the school just isn't enough.

<ul>
<li>What's this thing with demographics you keep bringing up? I actually don't like the demographics excess of school articles, just as I don't like the excess demographics I see in countless swmall township articles. I won't be the person telling you that "3.53% are Asian", just as I wouldn't have told you that of the 13 people in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_North_Dakota_1a09.html" title="Perth, North Dakota">Perth, North Dakota</a> "100.00% White, 0.00% African American", as I find such machine-speak worthless. I realize you don't find the same things I do, to be interesting which is fine. If wikipedia was a democracy, and I a politician, I would do be my best to win every vote I could, by giving people what they want in school articles: long celeb lists; school shootings; Victorian-era construction; sensational head-line scandals, and more. Fortunately, I needn't worry about that, and am hapy this article will be kept without it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 14:40, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Maybe I wasn't clear; if there's nothing to say about a school but raw demographic data, I feel the article should be deleted (or merged, if appropriate) as an <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">unexpandable stub</a>. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 14:48, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>You still fail to explain why <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_North_Dakota_1a09.html" title="Perth, North Dakota">Perth, North Dakota</a> is ok, even though it has the problem you incorrectly claim this school does. Aside from demographics, there's nothing else in the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_North_Dakota_1a09.html" title="Perth, North Dakota">Perth, North Dakota</a>, yet I know you would never think of deleting it.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_North_Dakota_1a09.html" title="Perth, North Dakota">Perth, North Dakota</a> is okay because overwhelming consensus says that demographic-only articles about cities are okay, however small the city. (I'm ambivalent about the subject myself.) You, and many others, want to extend the city precedent to schools. I, and many others, want to extend the precedent for individual people. Reasonable people can (and do) disagree about this, and can attempt to find a middle ground.<br />

<li>Yes, I did notice the datestamps. Notice above I claimed to have proved you wrong "<i>before you even made the comment</i>".

<li><b>Comment</b>: are "tglo" and TheGlobe the same company? The stock symbol is TGLO, but the company appears to do business as <a href="http://www.theglobe.com" class="external text" title="http://www.theglobe.com" rel="nofollow">TheGlobe.com</a> with a principal product called GloPhone, which is a <i>software product</i> for PCs. That is a public company, and has (claimed) 4.8 million customers per their web site. The links in the article, however, are to www.tglo.com, which is just an "under construction" placeholder, and to www.voip-solution.ca, which is a vendor of some VoIP <i>hardware</i> adapter. This is all very curious. If they are the same company, the article should be moved to TheGlobe, which would appear to be notable, pending verification of the 4.8 million customer figure. If not, then this "tglo" is pretty much shown to be nn. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 23:50, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not here to spam as I have good intentions to make clear who tglo is and add proper article content to this wiki. www.tglo.com is down temp., may be due to Hurricane Wilma. TheGlobe.com is GloPhone, VoiceGlo, tglo, Voip-Solution.ca is an authorized reseller. tglo is the stock symbol and TheGlobe.com is the Corp HQ. I hope this helps.

<li>www.tglo.com is back up online, can someone let me know what steps I need to do to edit this article? Do I need to move this to TheGlobe? Thanks</li>

<li>This is the dog they are making that movie about at Warner Bros Movie World. He got kidnapped for two months as a puppy by one of Carl Williamns henchemen. My friend went to a casting call to play one of the thugs that kidnapped him. No luck. but the saga has been splashed across the papers all year. He is twitchy the 'mafia' dog. I definately agree it is a really ugly mutt, but the most notable dog in australia.</li>
<li>I'd heard rumours about the movie thing but nothing concrete. I'm trying to work out due to copyright and stuff if I can put some of the newspaper articles up on the page about Twitchy. I guess it may be a local story for Australia but where does Wiki draw the line?

<li>Damn, that's an <i>ugly</i> dog. But that doesn't make him notable enough for an article.

<li>You guys are judging this animal on its noteworthiness based on its looks. How shallow? Not a single person that has said NN has considered the dog for what it is or may be but used its looks. I would imagine that Wikipedia honoured the notable, not just the pretty. If a movie is being made about this dogs life, and its struggle is a continuing story in the news I would think that makes it Noteable.

<li>He's got a point. Not about him being notable (for every movie that's made, there's ten thousand that you never see, and one hundred thousand that no one ever sees, because it never gets finished) but about y'all short changing the dog for its looks.
