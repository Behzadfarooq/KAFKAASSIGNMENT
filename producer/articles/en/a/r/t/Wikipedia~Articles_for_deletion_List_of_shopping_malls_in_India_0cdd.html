<p>Not sure if this should or shouldn't be deleted, so I figured I'd let the community decide. Looks like an indescriminate list of shopping malls, and, from what I can tell, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockstar915_f516.html" title="User:Rockstar915">Rockstar915</a> 06:26, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Shopping malls are major structures so I don't think <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> exactly applies here. They are especially relevant in parts of the world where not every town with more than 500 people has one. A number of the malls on the list are blue-linked and notable. The main problem is that the articles that have no links need to be sourced. Were it a list of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">living persons</a>, I might argue differently, but in this case I think we should keep and tag the article with {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}. Most of the content seems easily verifiable (I did a google search for 5 randomly-selected malls). If there is a consensus to keep if sourced, I will go through and source any entries that are not blue-linked.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Black Falcon.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> as it seems wrong to single out India, but the articles in it better be sourced soon, because a list of redlinks CAN be deleted. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:32, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think India was singled out particularly. Rather, this probably just happened to be the article that the nominator ran across. Given the developing consensus for keep, I will start going through and sourcing the entries where I can in 2-3 hours.

<li><b>Comment</b> I didn't mean to single out India, I just noticed a bunch of red links, and wanted to bring it to the community. No bad faith here. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockstar915_f516.html" title="User:Rockstar915">Rockstar915</a> 17:11, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> per precendent. I'm no fan of "List of X" articles, and while I don't feel a list of shopping malls in any country belongs in an encyclopedia, we can't delete this but then not the others.

<li><b>Comment</b> Just out of curiosity, aren't lists like this meant for Categories? It seems like any shopping mall in India should be placed in a "Shopping Malls in India" category, rather than having a separate entry for such lists... I guess I agree with everyone that per current Wikipedia regulations, the list should stand. But maybe the topic of categories instead of lists should be discussed?

<li>Categories only work for persons/objects/events that already have WP articles.</li>
<li>Whereas lists can be referenced, categories are more difficult to do (each article must be referenced).</li>
<li>Not everyone finds categories easier-to-use than lists.</li>
<li>Lists can provide additional information about individual entries (which categories cannot).</li>
<li>Per <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>, lists that aid in navigation, are informative, and/or are used for development purposes are allowed.</li>

<ul>
<li>I think categories are useful and should be used in many cases. However, I don't see why they cannot exists side-by-side with lists. In essence, I don't think being a list is itself a reason for deletion <i>unless</i> the list is highly inferior in quality to the category, which requries that it be redundant (all info contained in one is contained in the other), unreferenced, and simply a listing of names without any additional information or any form of subdivision (e.g., by location, time, etc.).

<li><b>Delete</b> per precedent -- <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shopping_malls_in_Malaysia_3636.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shopping malls in Malaysia">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shopping malls in Malaysia</a>. A clear case of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>. Even if the shopping malls are themselves notable, categories suffice in this case. An example of a worthy list would be <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_largest_shopping_malls_in_the_United_States_3c66.html" title="List of largest shopping malls in the United States">List of largest shopping malls in the United States</a> (Before somebody cries bias, let me explain -- I'm from India).

<li>Please see my comment above about the disadvantages of categories: bias toward objects <i>with</i> articles, cannot be referenced, not necessarily more user-friendly, and limited capability to provide additional information. Let's please remember that most articles start out in a poor state.
