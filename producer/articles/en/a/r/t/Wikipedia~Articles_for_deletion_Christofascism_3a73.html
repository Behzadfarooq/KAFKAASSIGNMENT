<p><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">User:LeeHunter</a> made a very wise suggestion on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamofascism_0d82.html" title="Talk:Islamofascism">Talk:Islamofascism</a>. His recommendation was to create a page titled Fascism as epithet, which would describe the use of the term <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> as applied to individuals and groups who do not consider themselves Fascist. This would avoid all of the interminable arguments about which [[<i>X</i>ofascism]] should have an article of its own. It would also help alleviate the concerns over the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> article becoming a POV platform. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 07:32, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I strongly disagree with the proposal. That would equate <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>, which is a real word used by notable people, with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christofascism.html" title="Christofascism">Christofascism</a>, which is not. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 21:04, May 3, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Actually "Christofascism" is a real word used by notable people. See the talk page for a pointer I've provided to real use by a serious theologian. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 02:49, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The difference, to me, is how notable. Ms. Soelle gets about 200 google hits--maybe not bad for a theologian, but nowhere near 1.6 million for <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Sullivan_6a55.html" title="Andrew Sullivan">Andrew Sullivan</a>. There's a clear distinction between the two terms in how often they're used and how prominent the users are. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 02:52, May 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I may have been unclear. I'm not saying that every neologism needs to be mentioned in the Fascism as epithet article, nor that little-used terms must be given the same amount of space in that proposed article as ones that see a lot of use. What I am saying is that the use of the term "Fascism" to describe individuals and groups who are not self-identified Fascists is a very well-known phenomenon, and that it makes more sense to have a single article for the entire phenomenon than to splinter it up (especially when certain splinter articles, like <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>, have become POV springboards to attack the groups in question, rather than to focus on the use of the terms as epithets). "Christofascism" isn't as prominent as "Islamofascism" as a term, but what about other uses of "Fascism" as an epithet? What about terms like "Feminazis" (certainly notable, it was coined and used by <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a>), "Hitlery", and "Bushitler"? People have been comparing their political opponents to fascists ever since the end of the Second World War. I think we should have an article on the use of the term "Fascism" as an epithet, and have this article encompass all latter-day uses of such terminology, with article space allocated in rough proportion to the prominence of each term. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 23:17, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, that makes sense now. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 23:20, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Okay, that does clarify things a bit, but I still must disagree. IMO, each instance of notable "X-fascism" should get its own article. The problems you're describing with <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> are an argument for watching that article closely and editing it boldly. That doesn't mean we should get rid of the article. An article on <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminazi.html" title="Feminazi">Feminazi</a> would make more sense than merging all these disparate articles together, although <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminazi.html" title="Feminazi">feminazi</a> isn't as well-defined as <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 01:37, May 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're a hypocrite. You say "IMO, each instance of "X-fascism" should get its own article." but then you vote delete for a very notable X-fascism term. People have written books and published articles, notable people have used the terms "christofascism" and "christian fascism". <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStancel_c73e.html" title="User:Stancel">Stancel</a> 23:03, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><s>I agree with Firebug, and yet I also agree with Meelar. A bit of each. What I think we need is that if a REAL "-fascism" term (not this one!) comes up it can be merged, along with <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>, into Fascism as (an?) epithet. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 22:13, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</s></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with giving each its own article is that you totally lose the historical context and perhaps the general commentary of people like Orwell re the use of fascism as an epithet. When you see how various groups have used the word to slander their enemies, it is more interesting and enlightening. By the way, the article has been created under the name <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_%28epithet%29.html" title="Fascist (epithet)">Fascist (epithet)</a>. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 15:34, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I, as the original creator of this article, totally support this compromise. Somebody already created this article, it's called <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_%28epithet%29.html" title="Fascist (epithet)">Fascist (epithet)</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStancel_c73e.html" title="User:Stancel">Stancel</a> 23:00, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I regularly visit the left blogosphere and have never seen this term, certainly not in the main posts.

<ul>
<li>Meelar, take a look at the article as I have updated it. I included several citations of the use of the term, as well as the likely origins of the term. (Apparently it was invented by theologian Dorothy Soelle in her book <i>Beyond Mere Obedience</i>). <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 11:45, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>A theologian who gets 178 google hits and the comments thread at Daily Kos is in now way comparable to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Will_49be.html" title="George Will">George Will</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Sullivan_6a55.html" title="Andrew Sullivan">Andrew Sullivan</a>, or <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Review_8dfa.html" title="National Review">National Review</a>.

</li>
<li>It's also worth pointing out that you won't see many major commentators using terms like <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Nigger</a> either, because they are considered to be highly offensive. But we still list them on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 11:46, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I removed the historical sections to make the article more about the "term" itself and not about what the term describes. I realized I should do this after I saw that <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> now only concentrated on the use of the word.

<li><b>Do whatever is done with <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>.</b> Just as that term has been often used in the right blogosphere, I have often heard terms like "Christofascist", "Jesofascist", and "Jeebofascist" in the left blogosphere. If these articles are kept, they should focus on the epithet itself, not be a list of bad things that <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christians</a> have done. After all, the <a href="../../../z/o/g/ZOG_892b.html" title="ZOG">ZOG</a> article isn't a list of bad things Jews have done, nor is <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Nigger</a> a list of bad things black people have done. That's where I think a lot of the problems with the Islamofascism article lies. I can't speculate as to the creator's motive for this article, but it could have been in good faith. This isn't an extremely well-known term, but most people who regularly visit the left blogosphere will have heard it more than once, and a reasonable argument could be made for keeping the article. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 22:33, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I see nothing here to indicate this word is anything other that a term used by extremist opponents of Christianity. If this is true then it no more deserves an article than "commie traitors" should be a redirect to the Democratic party. HOWEVER this is a very young article.
