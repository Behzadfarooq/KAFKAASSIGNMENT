<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> - Look, I know why people want to delete this. The viewpoints these people represent are, in my opinion, fringe, crank, conspiracy theory types of views. And their science is junk in my opinion (and i've done point by point rebuttals of some of their "science papers" before). This article does not exist because it's factually correct history or science. This article exists because it is notable that a large number of people legitimately and truthfully believe the things documented here. That large number of people may be a small fraction of the total population, but it's a real and valid part of our society and history, as much as UFO enthusiasts or Kennedy Assassination Conspiracy enthusiasts, etc. There's nothing wrong with adding more NPOV regarding the verifyable and referenceable accuracy of claims made on the page, but deleting it because we disagree with them is <b>wrong</b>.

<li>The community of Wikipedians have many virtues, among which consistent application of notability guidelines is glaringly absent. The de facto precedent set by the fanboy backwater of the community need not impel us to proliferate articles on this topic. The point is that this group — whose only notable publication so far is a press release calling for more investigation — has given us nothing verifiable to say that can't be said in the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Researchers_questioning_the_official_account_of_9_11_872c.html" title="Researchers questioning the official account of 9/11">Researchers questioning the official account of 9/11</a> article. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 22:43, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We could combine <i>all</i> the 9/11 conspiracy articles into one if we wanted to, but I don't see why. There are variations and particular points of some of these groups, and separate articles seem appropriate; one article adequately and accurately reporting on the diversity of beliefs seems difficult.

<dd><b>Question</b>: Does this group have one identifiable perspective that differs from "question the official account of 9/11"? If so, I may be coming around. The article might be useful as a short description of how these scholars are collected under one banner, and a description of that would be useful as a link from the individual biographies as well as from the generic article. In any case, detailed recountings of their research seem to be more germane to the biographical articles since, as I noted before, they don't seem to have done much as a group besides collect the member's disparate work onto one site. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 01:16, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Perhaps you're thinking of <a href="http://brickwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="brickwiki:Main_Page">Brickwiki</a>? How many different 9/11 skeptic articles do we need? Is every org that has some skeptics in it notable? This one hasn't necessarily estabilished notability yet has it? But the renom seems a little too close in. When thinking about a nom it may be a good idea to check the talk page to see if there's been one before. When this is nomed after a reasonable period, I'd probably vote delete unless more substantive notability was offered.
