<li>OK. I asked another administrator to delete it on G12. Aish has a couple of dozen centers all over the country and overseas - all their directors are local pulpit rabbis, more or less.

<li><b>Reliable sources</b> we could always rename the article to paranormal vs. physics if that would make you feel better? Its all the same, and after all this is a pretty big area of science. Paraphysics has 18,800 hits on google, and here's <a href="http://members.aol.com/jebco1st/Paraphysics/issue1.htm" class="external text" title="http://members.aol.com/jebco1st/Paraphysics/issue1.htm" rel="nofollow">another interesting link</a>.

<li>Changing to <b>abstain</b>. I can't support deletion after the work Uncle G's done, but there still seem to be varying coinages of the word 'paraphysics' (which is, in the end, just someone adding the word 'para' to 'physics') and after reading the article I don't know why I should care about any of them; they all seem to be expounding pseudoscientific justification for varying degrees of New Age nonsense. I can't tell from the article whether any have any more importance than the others, and I'm confident that no-one is going to be able to do a better job of clarifying this than Uncle G, so I don't see this improving. (Though I can see it getting worse as POV-pushers get back to work on the article.) --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 20:27, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. First, reliable sources are everywhere: Amazon, Google, etc. Second, just because you don't believe in something doesn't mean that that subject should not be written about.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This isn't about who believes in what. The 'nonsense' comment in the prod referred, I think, to the content of the article, not to the subject. If I wrote a three line nonsense article about the queen of england, it'd still be nonsense, even if the subject was not. But the point is not that some people believe it's hooey, it's that there have been no reliable sources provided proving notability and verifying the article's statements. As I said above, the top google hit for the subject is an AOL member page. That's not what I call a reliable source. So, as I said, if anyone can make this article meet wikipedia policies before the AFD is up, providing verifiable sources, cleaning up the nonsense and making it something more than a dictionary definition, I'd be willing to reconsider my position. But if it isn't done in five days, it's not likely to happen once the AFD closes, so better to delete it and let whoever comes along next looking to write a <i>real</i> article start fresh than to let this unverifiable glorified link farm stay on wikipedia on the off chance that someone might replace it with a useful article. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 04:01, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm still concerned about accuracy issues if the list were to be transwikied. The list looks like it was copied from Egyptian Arabic/Swadesh list then a few modifications here and there were made.

<li><b>Comment</b> to [[User:Daveydweeb|Daveydweeb]: Is it so hard to <b>assume good faith</b> and not expect our editors to be lying about such a thing? At the very least, you could just take thirty seconds to make a google search before demanding scan, getting which is somewhat more time-consuming. The search I hope no one seriously considers an idea that a lot of people could be coherently writing on forums since 2002 in a plot to to keep this 2006 article in WP. And this is not the first magazine article about this mod, as mentioned below. <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../w/n/p/WP%7EWNP_d2ca.html" title="WP:WNP">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 10:38, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am a developer, but I'd note that Thievery was last mentioned earlier in the year in a retrospective in PC Gamer UK, and <b>several</b> times before that around its release, in various magazines and websites. I have scans but can't upload them here for copyright reasons. It is primarily notable for being the first multiplayer stealth fps (that we know of) and heavily influenced the multiplayer mode in the Splinter Cell series. External links are in the article. This page is also linked to by the <a href="../../../u/n/r/Unreal_Tournament_6d8d.html" title="Unreal Tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> page, Mods section. Also, Black Cat Games is now a commercial developer, currently doing <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_Swarm_a35c.html" title="Alien Swarm">Alien Swarm</a>: Infested over the Steam network - furthermore, a commercial sequel (Nightblade) to Thievery is currently in development. I would conclude that this article needs expansion and a notability section, certainly not a deletion, so a removal of this tag would be appreciated.User:RobToujours

<li><b>Keep</b> In the interests of disclosure, I was a level designer on this mod. I agree with Rob, and though I see a value judgement or two in the text that merit editing, I think the Thievery UT page should remain on Wikipedia. I would also like to add something on this specific debate that is relevant to mods in general. Browsing <a href="../../../m/o/d/Mod_%28computer_gaming%29.html" title="Mod (computer gaming)">Mod_(computer_gaming)</a>, I see plenty of other mods with pages on Wikipedia. I think mods are a very important and culturally significant trend in game development, but talking about them in any kind of "professional" manner is very difficult. They are an online phenomenon, and any intersection with physical media is an adjunct to their existence (such as exposure in print magazines, inclusion on cover discs or Game of the Year editions of the titles they're based on, etc.). In addition to that, the learning and production that goes into a mod is *cultural* practice, rather than *industrial* or *academic* practice. This means there is very little to reference save the mod itself and community websites.User:Nachimir <small>— Nachimir (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nachimir_6ceb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nachimir">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Question</b> Did that PC Zone source pan out? How about the PC Gamer UK, can anyone confirm that one? If it really has gotten the press (and it's more than a passing mention), then I think it's a keep. If it doesn't have that kind of verification, though, I'm not so sure. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 08:56, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Clear Keep</b> - This mod is regularly mentioned on major sites.

<dd>"Check out the October 2002 edition of PC Gamer. On page 116, there is an article about Thievery entitled "The Unlikeliest Mod Ever". It is definitely a positive article describing the mod and also has some comments from the Thief III team. Be sure to check it out!"</dd>

No more and no less notable than a whole lot of party games in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Category%7EParty_games_e6e9.html" title="Category:Party games">Category:Party games</a> or most video/computer games for that matter. I won't say anything about pokemon characters. This game has been in existence for quite a while; I was introduced to it in 1991 or 1992, where it was called asshole darts. I have a special affection for this article, as I used it as the example of how complete Wikipedia is to a friend. If Wikepedia is to continue being a compendium of current popular culture, the article should stay. While there are no sholarly article on it that I know of, there is a large number of references and descriptions to it on the web. "Bum darts" gets 3,250 google hits, "Butt darts" gets 689, and "asshole darts" gets 34, mostly about the game. The article originally referenced a <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Barry_4734.html" title="Dave Barry">Dave Barry</a> blog but this was removed under the dubious assertion (in this case) that blogs are not an appropriate reference. See this diff [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bum_darts&amp;diff=58982828&amp;oldid=58277600" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bum_darts&amp;diff=58982828&amp;oldid=58277600" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>].

<li><b>Keep</b>. A blog by a nationally syndicated columnist is, I believe, an appropriate reference.

<p>Incomprehensible nonsense.

This is basically all the articles on timelines of individual fictional universes crammed into one. How many times is this "chronology" going to list the pre-1945 assassination of Hitler? The obliteration of the universe?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Migrating all of the <i>accurate</i> information over to the main Vista article would promote unbalance; the main article would end up being more about the criticism than the actual OS.

<li><b>Week keep</b> - It has some citations, other major software releases have criticism pages as well.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Surely belongs under the umbrella of the Vista article, do standard articles have entries specifically for the pros and cons of events/object? No; this is because such comments logically fall under the remit of the main article, issues of article length can be dealt with using proper article structuring coupled with a good TOC. 89.100.150.17 00:07, 9 November 2006 (UTC)<small>— 89.100.150.17 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_89.100.150.17_90a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/89.100.150.17">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm kinda ambivalent about this; OTOH, WP isn't a crystal ball, but it has generated significant amounts of controversy.

<li><b>Keep</b> as criticism is NPOV, sourced, and directly relevant to the product - some of it has already resulted in changes to Vista (e.g. licencing &amp; UAC) which would be of historical interest to some. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 13:34, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I agree that MS responses are relevant in this article and to the degree possible they should be added. However this does not invalidate the article or the article subject - it just needs work.

<li><b>Strong, speedy keep</b> until the nomination is broken up; some of these were legitimate splits from a main article, while others are so long that a merge of so much notable info would be ludicrous. I'm asking for a speedy keep because there's no reason to debate dozens of articles at once, especially when they vary greatly in content and quality. Additionally, and unrelated to calling for a "strong, speedy keep", the nominator has never made an edit before, and then decided to nominate 45 articles for deletion at once. I'm trying to assume good faith, but given the circumstances, it's a bit difficult. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 03:41, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Redundant, as we have both a list in the grunge article and in a category for these bands.

<li><b>Delete</b> I think the hoax possibility is definitely there. The references are interesting. As far as I can tell, Harrison T. Meserole didn't write a book called <i>Early American Literature and Culture</i>--one was written about him. Meserole's four-volume survey was called <i>American Literature; Tradition &amp; Innovation</i>. The second reference in the article is even more clearly a little off. Burt Barer wrote a book called <i>The Saint: A Complete History in Print, Radio, Film and Television of Leslie Charteris' Robin Hood of Modern Crime, Simon Templar, 1928-1992</i>. The article references Burt Barer's <i>The Saint: A Complete History of Print, Radio, Film, and Television</i>. Why leave off the rest of the title? The only thing that comes to mind without being able to look at the book is that a work on the character of Simon Templar probably doesn't mention <i>Ghostbusters</i>. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 06:12, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I feel too close to the subject of this AfD to have an unbiased opinion on it, and I don't know what T-theory is (perhaps I should), but the K-server problem is a central topic to online algorithms, is relevant to important practical problems such as cache replacement strategies, and was for several years quite a hot topic in theoretical computer science more generally. It deserves a much less stubby article than what's there now, and I think it is to Larry's credit if he was the one to notice and correct its absence here. I'll take a look at expanding that article into something more informative. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 06:06, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Last time I checked, T-Theory is a branch of mathematics. Shall we each individually propose deletion of every topic that we are unfamiliar with or do not understand? Ridiculous.

Lastly, a quick check in two of my CS textbooks (Data Structures ISBN: 032144146X, and Online Computation ISBN: 0521619467) reveals Larmore in the index.

<li><b>Delete</b>. One reason to do an AfD is to give proponents of the article a chance to make improvements, in a case where the article may have potential but falls short in its current state.

<li><b>Keep</b> Previously the reason for deletion was <i>no references</i>. I updated the site and included requested references.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The current reason for deletion has two arguments.<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1. The article is an autobiography<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. The material presented is not important.<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <i>Eliyak</i>, you referenced this page as an autobiography. By definition, an autobiography is writen by the person who the article is about. Since I wrote this page, it is not an autobiography, it is a biography, which wikipedia allows as long as the person is of importance. Larmore's importance is clearly shown in the references I provided earlier this week.<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Next, we address the importance of the <a href="../../../k/-/s/K-server_problem.html" title="K-server problem">K-server problem</a> and <a href="../../../t/-/t/T-theory.html" title="T-theory">T-theory</a>. If you google: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22t-theory%22+%22mathematics%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22t-theory%22+%22mathematics%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">"t-theory" "mathematics"</a> you'll get 10,000+ pages of relivent information. If you google: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22k-server+problem%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22k-server+problem%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">"k-server problem"</a> you'll get 14,000+ pages of relivent information. Clearly these topics have value. In addition, after I created stubs for each of the topics, others have been adding/modifying the information. Clearly there are others who care about these subjects.<br />
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <i>EdJohnston</i>, thank you for your comments. You mentioned that AfD gives a chance for improving the article. Adding algorithm details should be a wikipedia topic on its own, not covered in the biography of person. Deleting the topic is a bit much. If improvments are needed, you could help improve it (since that is the beauty of wikipedia). Additionally, I'll add some additional information about some of Larmore's algorithms later this week. Hopefully, this will satisfy your request.<br />

<dd><b>Comment</b> Your list of "references" is actually (with the possible exception of the Borodin and El-Yaniv reference, which I don't have access to and can't check) a list of Larmore's publications. These references do not directly support the assertion that Larmore is "known for" his work. Nor do they provide any indication that his work in these (I am willing to stipulate) important areas is itself important or notable. I suppose you could infer importance or notability from the prestige of the journals in which the publications in question appear, but that smacks of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. More helpful references might be things like a survey article on the field in question (one n ot authored by Larmore) that points to Larmore's work as influential, and a biographical article or webpage that provides <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> for the different degrees that are claimed. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllan_McInnes_8402.html" title="User talk:Allan McInnes">talk</a>)</small> 04:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you could please clarify this statement I would appreciate it. The journals listed are notable sources. By the link you provided, this satisfies being non-original research because the papers published come from notable sources. Perhaps the following link will also help with the <i>notability</i> issue. From the Most cited authors in Computer Science - June 2003 (CiteSeer), <a href="http://citeseer.csail.mit.edu/allcited.html" class="external text" title="http://citeseer.csail.mit.edu/allcited.html" rel="nofollow">Larmore is 6641 out of 659481 authors</a>, clearly he is a <i>little</i> better than the average professor (from this measurement he is roughly in the top 1%). <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOravec_9f2b.html" title="User:Oravec">Oravec</a> 23:28, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that we're not concerned with whether or not Larmore's work is original research. What we're concerned with is whether or not the claims <i>about</i> Larmore's work are original research. Making the assertion that Larmore's work is important because it has been published in notable journals can be construed as original research, since you are coming to a conclusion based on the analysis of data, rather than citing someone else's analysis or conclusions. The same goes for analyzing Citeseer data (which isn't all that unbiased to begin with, but that's a separate issue). That's why I encouraged you to dig up a survey article that states that Larmore's work is influential or important - that conclusion would be citable, and not OR. The alternative is to avoid claiming that Larmore's work is important, and to simply state that his work has been published in journals X, Y, and Z (supportable via citations of the articles themselves), and that he is the 6641st most cited author on Citeseer (supportable via reference to the Citeseer page). In neither case would you be inserting your own opinions or analysis. You would simply be presenting verifiable facts, and letting the reader draw their own conclusions. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllan_McInnes_23d1.html" title="User:Allan McInnes">Allan McInnes</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllan_McInnes_8402.html" title="User talk:Allan McInnes">talk</a>)</small> 04:27, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An example paper for the field I'm most familiar with, Huffman coding, is <a href="http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SEQUEN.1997.666911" class="external autonumber" title="http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SEQUEN.1997.666911" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, a survey of code and parse trees. (A free version can be found at <a href="http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jsiam/publication/org/Abrahams.ps.gz" class="external autonumber" title="http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jsiam/publication/org/Abrahams.ps.gz" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>.) It includes, "Currently the best algorithmic approach to Huffman coding under the maximum codeword length constraint is due to Moffat et al. based on the algorithm of Larmore and Hirschberg." So the best practical approach is a modification of one co-introduced by Larmore. Huffman coding under the maximum codeword length constraint is useful for the fastest method of near-optimal lossless coding for known sources. It's hard to say how much that is used in practice, but it doesn't seem too pedestrian to me.... <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 05:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Allan McInnes</i> - Thank you for clarifying your statement for me. I must agree, althrough I think it is common knowledge that he is well-known (in his research areas and then some), there is no real way to measure something unbiasedly (even though citeseer is a 3rd party and you asked for a reference). So I reworded the page to: <i>One of his main research areas is competitive analysis of online algorithms, particularly for the k-server problem.</i> This addresses his research efforts and allows for everyone to maintain their own opinion. Please let me know if all is satisfactory. Thanks, <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOravec_9f2b.html" title="User:Oravec">Oravec</a> 16:19, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> From the Wikipedia <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a>, criteria for biography: "The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field." This is satisfied by the aforementioned fundamental algorithms and references in widely used textbooks in CS. Secondly, under "alternative tests" on the same page, "The professor test -- If the individual is more well known and more published than an average college professor..., they can and should be included." Since Larmore has two PhDs, and an abundance of publications in mathematics as well as CS, and he is referenced in Textbooks - I think it is safe to say that he is more well-known than an "average college prof". He is after all above average in these three areas, which are definitive for professors. <a href="../../../t/p/a/User%7ETparameter_917a.html" title="User:Tparameter">Tparameter</a> 20:42, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> <i>Allan McInnes</i> - I've updated the references on the page as per your request. You also requested references of his degrees. I added the reference of <u>World Directory of Mathematicians</u> for you (which took me a little bit of time). In addition, here is a link to <a href="http://www.egr.unlv.edu/people/csfaculty.html" class="external text" title="http://www.egr.unlv.edu/people/csfaculty.html" rel="nofollow">CS faculty and list of their degrees at UNLV</a>.

<p>The article contains original research, and much of it can be of offensive nature to the person reading. Many sentences start with 'Blacks' or 'whites', and on the talk page, some people find this article outrageous and unencyclopedic. Also, article does not make much sense, a lot of it seems to be POV, and it doesn't have sources for many of the statements. At least a major re-write is in order, if not a deletion. <b><a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECattleGirl_9ae1.html" title="User:CattleGirl"><font color="blue">Cat</font><font color="darkblue">tleG</font><font color="black">irl</font></a></b> <sup><i><a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECattleGirl_3ed2.html" title="User talk:CattleGirl">talk</a> | <font color="green"><a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECattleGirl_Esperanza_1bb2.html" title="User:CattleGirl/Esperanza">e@</a></font></i></sup> 08:29, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There seems to be a trend of people wanting to delete "race-based" articles out of a seeming reluctance to talk about race at all (which is also bad, since Wikipedia is not censored), I'm also going to take a look at some of the sources cited, which happens far too rarely here. The online link provided has nothing talking about body type preferences, it's just a general overview of there seemingly being a race-based "hierarchy" in interracial relationships, one for women and one for men. The Qualitative Report article is more in line with the title of this one, but it only notes body-image problems for women. The BioSci article does not strictly involve "white" women (it involves Arab women, but that is not the whole of "white"). The sex roles journal article is decent in this regard, but I don't think that the article contents are a good summary of the article. Now. I think that this is a poor article, and has way too many weasel words (see how many times the word "researchers" is used in the article), but the Sex roles article notes that most of the studies on attractiveness tend to place the "Anglo American" (their words) viewpoint as the default one and that race and culture do modify these characteristics. So. My opinion is to delete this article, take the references and integrate them into a body type preferences article of some sort (I'm guessing one is already here.) <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 21:13, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In an article which makes controvrsial claims, having a list of uncited references at the end is unacceptable. Use inline cites to footnote claims to pages of the references. I, along with <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Mixalot_ec3a.html" title="Sir Mixalot">Sir Mixalot</a> in "<a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_Got_Back_c311.html" title="Baby Got Back">Baby Got Back</a>," expect that there are some kind of race-based differences in body shape preferences for mates. But the article smacks of OR due to the lack of specific references. If the editors who put in claims know where they found them, then cite the references at the point in the text where they are made. This reads like a poorly written research paper from a freshman college course in sociology.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 03:05, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have recently been doing research on the subject and I find that most of the material in this article is in fact refrenceable. Alot of the information coincides with the information mentioned in the books. However, one major chance needs to be made, that is to rename the article to "Body Image between Cultures" and to diversify to apply to various cultures. I would be willing to work on the article, but it would have to wait at least six weeks simply due to the sheer work load I am facing at the moment. Do not delete the article, wait for revision. I have seen significantly worse articles than this that did not get nearly as much attention. I believe that this is mainly due to the race issue. That is why I suggest renaming the article and broadening the content to apply to other cultures.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.63.176.238 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.63.176.238_1518.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.63.176.238">contribs</a>).</small> <i>(moved from top of page - please make new comments at the bottom and sign with ~~~~.

Lists can be watchlisted to track additions and deletions, but categories cannot.) Note also that while some people may consider the lists for Islam and Christianity to be unmaintainable, the ones for Judaism and Hinduism certainly aren't.

<dd>On consideration I have an alternate proposal. Keep the lists, but we should delete the categories. The lists are dealing with a subject that may require some explanation, but categories can be added without expanation and affect the article. Putting <a href="../../../f/o/r/Category%7EFormer_Muslims_a937.html" title="Category:Former Muslims">Category:Former Muslims</a>, or anyone, can cause unnecessary problems to people that merely being on a list may not. This is because lists, ideally, require sources.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 16:16, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree: the Categories provide an easy way for all the different articles to be linked together. When a person clicks on a category, they can either see others in the same category, or seek more information on the separate Lists page, which will be/should be linked on the Category pages. These are all different ways of displaying information. If a person doesnt belong in a category, they can always debate that and I have observed they have.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 16:32, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think categories are necessarily the best way to keep this information, but I think these articles have another problem other than the category vs. list maintenanbility issue: they're inherently POV and difficult to verify.

<dd>Great, so you're suggesting the Deletion of all categories and lists on Wikipedia which could inherently be POV. People come on Wikipedia and debate their POV and they frequently arrive at conclusions which are based on facts and so we arrive at a NPOV. As far as "List Maintenanbility" is concerned, that is true for ANY page, not just lists. ALL pages have to be maintained. Thats the responsibility of the editors.

<li>I also find it interesting that you stated on my talk page that you "would have voted delete had [I] not been so adventurous (or crossed into the Hinduism line)." I see no reason to show such partiality to any one specific religion; it seems to me that either these lists all belong, or they all don't.

<li>Of course it does, and I suspect that that, rather than the merits of the articles, is what will drive many of the keep votes. Nevertheless.

<li><b>Reply</b> Good point. If you read any of the lists you AFD'd you might see that each of those lists has a section "Fom ISlam", "From Buddhism", "From Christianity", "From Hinduism".

<li><b>Comment</b>: I wonder why only lists for Conversion/Apostasy are being targeted.

<ul>
<li>Because lists of converts/apostates are all related to each other. Lists of people by religion would not be suitable for inclusion in the same AfD in my opinion. Do not take my exclusion of those lists from this AfD as a statement that I feel those lists are or are not important; they simply are not relevant to this AfD as I see it. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 21:04, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it's not the most important issue, but it's been brought up as an issue nonetheless. I know you're delete-crazy Wicket, but removing an entire article and giving the people who <i>will</i> fulfill <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> absolutely nothing to work with is totally counter-productive. The size of Genmay is easily verifiable through big boards. The rest of the material of the article is the structure of the forums and the administration of them -- do you honestly expect such a ridiculous litmus test to be applied that forum subgroups and her administrators be published in a known periodical simply to satisfy all aspects of WP:V? Verifiability is important, but there are limits to it. These are sane, common sense limits. We don't troll every article and question whether paraphrases used the definite or indefinite article, because its nonsense, because things as fluid and vague as that are verifiable in so far as you can check up on them yourself, but pegging down the exactness of it is nigh impossible. Should we exclude who admins the forums because Time magazine has never mentioned them? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfessor_Ninja_469b.html" title="User:Professor Ninja">Professor Ninja</a> 08:30, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>So could deliberately "misunderstanding" the use of the word troll to make it go from the very obvious in-context meaning of trolling in the sense of dragging a net vs. the "how could you possibly think it means that in the context given" meaning of deliberately attempting to incite a flame war.

<ul>
<li>Although I agree it isn't proper to assume bad faith, I think it's also disingenuous and improper to discount someone else's reasoning out of hand like that. Organic expansion is a perfectly legitimate description of what happens to Wiki articles as they are noticed by users with knowledge of the topic over time. We don't have to have this Wikipedia project wrapped up and finished before finals, you know. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 09:10, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>May I ask then what the word "organic" adds to the phrases "organic growth" or "organic expansion"? A good sign of something being a buzzphrase is the presence of irrelevant qualifiers.

<li>Wikipedia is not a directory. Nor is Wikipedia a collection of random information. And as to how to deal with those two issues, what would you propose other than deletion?<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:01, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You make reference to two sections of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, that A) Wikipedia is not a directory, and B) Wikipedia is not a collection of random information. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> defines these terms as follows: A) Wikipedia is not a directory of everything that exists or has existed. Wikipedia articles are not: 1. Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms, or persons (real or fictional). <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 2. Genealogical entries or phonebook entries. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>, and <b>3. Directories, directory entries, TV/Radio Guides, or a resource for conducting business</b> Now this what is raised as an issue, but WP:NOT defines this as <b>For example, an article on a radio station generally should not list upcoming events, current promotions, phone numbers, schedules etc., although mention of major events or promotions may be acceptable.</b> There is just nothing in this clause of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> that seems relevant to making this particular article improper. B) Next we have <b>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</b>, which is defined as 1. Lists of Frequently Asked Questions. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 2. Travel guides. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 3. Memorials. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 4. Instruction manuals. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 5. Internet guides.<b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 6. Textbooks and annotated texts. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>; 7. Plot summaries. <b>NOT APPLICABLE</b>, Again, there is no aspect of this clause of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> that seems applicable in any way to this article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is often thrown out as a justification to delete articles, but I agree completely with <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> that it simply doesn't apply in this case. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 05:35, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As to the first point, this entry is little more than an address easily in the "phonebook entries" category. As to the second point, it should be apparent that the list there is not intended to be exhaustive. In fact, almost daily, articles are deleted per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>'s "random collection" criterion even if they don't fall into exactly one of those categories. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:39, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know what's printed in your phone book, but in mine, phonebook entries look like <b>North View Primary School 123 Main Street 123-456-7890.</b> This article far exceeds what a phonebook entry is, by any reasonable definition of the term. The fact that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>'s "indiscriminate collection" clause is used to mean "anything I think doesn't belong on Wikipedia", and the fact that there are many people who misuse it and get articles deleted, does not make it a valid argument. The examples provided are intended to serve as cardinal prototypes of "indiscriminate collections", and none of them are within miles of this article. How can we meaningfully apply Wikipedia criteria if their clearcut meaning can be changed to mean anything anyone wants it to mean. You don'texcuse bad arguments to keep (e.g. the fact that some similar article was kept doesn't justify retention of this one), why should a bad argument re <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (e.g., other people use it to mean something other than what it says and they delete articles anyway) be acceptable? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 05:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Frequently, information that on its own is random can be placed with other relevant information to create a good article. Deletion is rarely the best thing to do with verifiable information; the ideal solution is to present it in a digestible format in its proper context, so that it is accessible to those who will find it useful. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 07:06, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The article as it stands now does not seem to meet the retention standards set by <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>. However, this is an article that was one of the first created by a brand new user. While it lacks sources (thanks to Kappa and JoshuaZ for taking the time to do some research and make improvements), it does make claims of notability regarding alumni, which I was unable to verify, perhaps as the school is in Singapore. That the article was prod'ed hours barely six hours after the article was created, and then put here on AfD less than 12 hours after that is simply not adequate time to allow a fully formed article to be created. While I have no reason to believe any bad faith was involved, I do not feel that anyways near adequate time was allowed to improve the article or address the prod tag. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 05:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Abandom AfD</b> This is another instance of the Wikipedia <b>delete, delete delight</b> song. A new user should not be welcomed by this song however bad their article is. Yes, OK, raise a concern on the page, tell them how to address the concerns, and if they don't improve then put an AfD, but with such a new article and new use an AfD notice so soon is simply an abuse of process. --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 17:45, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Carlossuarez46 - come on lets keep this in proportion, most schools have many pets, therefore by your own argument if it is arguable to have an article about one's pet then it clearly is acceptable to have it about numerous pets, and their owners! But seriously, almost all schools should be in Wikipedia in some form or other. There are many advantages to WIkipedia to have them in. Very oftent he writers are new users and therefore the AfD is inappropriate and all in all I don't know why there is so much time wasted trying to get them deleted, it only does the reputation of Wikipedia a great deal of harm! --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 19:48, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> "Bad faith" means, nominated for deletion for some ulterior purpose - i.e., not because I believed the article should be deleted per Wiki policy. If you study the whole history you will see that I put a prod on this article as it is a <i>primary</i> school, generally considered not notable in previous AfD debates. I told the creator of the article on their Talk page that I had put the prod in place, explained why, told them how to remove the prod and asked for them to make clear why the school was notable if they removed the prod. The prod was removed without any further edits to the article. I then brought it to AfD and told the creator I had done so. A lot of effort to go to if I just wanted something deleted for a "bad faith" reason, don't you think. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiteUnusual_1e3d.html" title="User:QuiteUnusual">QuiteUnusual</a> 22:23, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have created a new article entitled <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schools_in_Yishun_0ca5.html" title="Schools in Yishun">Schools in Yishun</a> which can be a start toward building an encyclopedic treatment of this and the other weak, directory-style stubs.

To that end, it would be helpful if this article were made into a redirect rather than merely deleted. Very little of the information currently in the article is of encyclopedic interest, other than the fact of its existence. The linked articles, however, do contain some information of general interest regarding Singapore's approach to education. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 22:26, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> as nonsense. When I read to the part when they were accosted by BMG I thought the article had hope but when you hit the controversy section all optimism evaporates. Choice cuts: <i>"The Blind Eagles have openly told the media that they plan to kill the following people- Micheal Jackson, Prince, John Lennon,…. When finding out that most of those people were dead, the trio decided that they had done a good job and deserved a nap"</i>, <i>"listeners realised that 3 songs on the album were noises of farm animals.Depite this, many songs still charted, but never as succesful as their debut album, which has now sold 19x Platinum. The main differences in their new album was… a decrease in the amount of toilet breaks"</i>, and last but not least ludicrous, <i>"the lead guitarist… tragicly died in a bizarre paragliding accident. Scientists believe "The paraglider suddenly turned into a snowball and then vanished into thin air causing venz to freeze then combust and explode"</i>. Tell me this isn't BJAODN material! P.S.

<dd>Yeah, I did read those too. It just doesn't seem right to discount a band based on what those who have never heard them play think of their notoriety. They are a local band, yes, but they deserve the page, if for nothing else besides wikipedia standards, their radio airtime.--168.122.227.8 21:59, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>One quick point about the radio airtime. I went to the link from the article for Long Island's <a href="http://radiox.fm" class="external text" title="http://radiox.fm" rel="nofollow">Radio X</a>, which reviews a lot of bands in their music guide. No mention of the Game Genies. A search on another link, WTBU, found nothing for the Game Genies. The third link is a push--the website's under construction. These external links in the article are asking the reader to take it on faith that these radio stations are playing the Game Genies, instead of verifying in any way the notability of the band. The only external link, besides the band's own myspace link, that purports to verify the <i>existence</i> of the Game Genies is the link to <a href="http://gamemusic4all.com" class="external text" title="http://gamemusic4all.com" rel="nofollow">Game Music 4 All</a>, which allows anyone to submit a band listing and does not appear to verify the information that's given to it. It provides no information about the band except a link back to their myspace page. I did a google search for ("game genies" band) and came back with <i>nothing</i> except myspace hits, and the gamemusic4all.com link, which isn't verified. And a blog about a Canadian band called the Game Genies. And a link to <a href="http://216.250.247.110/teenbandnights.htm" class="external text" title="http://216.250.247.110/teenbandnights.htm" rel="nofollow">The North Shore Youth Council Teen Band Nights</a>.

<dd>In response to the radio airtime arguement, if you actually looked into the Northeastern Radio Station's playlists, you would find that they were played on air. Their Spinitron.com Radio Playlist account verifies this. <a href="http://www.spinitron.com/public/index.php?station=wrbb&amp;month=Oct&amp;year=2006&amp;plid=1875" class="external text" title="http://www.spinitron.com/public/index.php?station=wrbb&amp;month=Oct&amp;year=2006&amp;plid=1875" rel="nofollow">Here</a> and <a href="http://www.spinitron.com/public/index.php?station=wrbb&amp;month=Oct&amp;year=2006&amp;plid=1903" class="external text" title="http://www.spinitron.com/public/index.php?station=wrbb&amp;month=Oct&amp;year=2006&amp;plid=1903" rel="nofollow">Here</a>
<dl>
<dd>I think that it would be worthwhile at this point to say that this deletion discussion is about both the band and the article about the band. It would strengthen the article if these links were included in it; however, the article links to quite a few websites that do not mention the Game Genies at all. On the google search that I did, the Game Genies' show at The North Shore Youth Council (based in <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocky_Point%2C_New_York_5301.html" title="Rocky Point, New York">Rocky Point, New York</a>) Teen Band Night on July 20, 2006 made it to the first page of hits, and was the only outside link that I found about this band, so I mentioned it in this discussion. The spinitron link is several pages deep and I missed it. The point is, the article could have made sure that I didn't miss the spinitron link by including it, not an under-construction website. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 20:08, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That could have been done, but it would seem that the point of the radio station link was to display places the band 'was played rather than showing off the exact time and date. Putting the spotlight on the exact instance in which the music was broadcasted serves as nothing more as an advertisement for the group, which this website is vehemently against, with good reason. The point of an encyclopedia is to provide knowledge or information, not to appease standards through providing extremely specific hyperlinks. On the other hand, I would agree that this discussion has extended far beyond the actual article itself. While I do believe the article could be greatly strengthened, it is not a shamless plug for the group in question, making it difficult to decide on the issue of deletion.</dd>

<p>I Think they should be allowed to keep their atricles spot because they clearly have music in circulation that people might be curious about. They should keep their spot because The Game Genies is a good band and people should hear them! they have the right to an article and you, wikipedia, should allow them to give their fans more information on your so-called free encyclopedia. what damage could it do to add an article on a band, a good band in my opinion. that's my point.</p>

<dl>
<dd>"...the existance of bands dedicated to video game music is surely a sign of.....[the] very End of Times." - That's a very intellegent statement, it must be very tough for you to have to deal with the inferior masses that frequent this site. Obviously you are far above such lowly forms of expression, judging from your classically inspired user name. I suppose if composers such as Wagner and Mozart were being covered it would live up to your expectations, although any sort of original interpretation of such works may be considered blasphemous. Change is indeed a frightening thing, I suppose it would be best if we were all xenophobes. It's one thing for you to dislike a genre of music, but to compare it to the degradation of society is just plain biased. (By the way, I recall learning of similar reactions when rock and roll came about...)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> "Thursday Night Live" "Blind Eagles" gets ZERO results on Google, so it's probably a hoax.

<li><b>Reply</b> To my mind, trouser parts aren't anything new. Also, this isn't really the right place for it, but "Person of gender A playing the role of a person of gender B who wants to be gender A" strikes me as a really wrongheaded casting choice. It brings in an element of successful wish-fullfillment that really shouldn't be there. Would "Boys don't Cry" work with Chad Lowe in the lead role? And on a final note, it seems pretty clear that Alison Garrigan has not yet quit her day job.

<li><b>Reply</b> From the first deletion debate: Notability requirements on Wikipedia are an important way of keeping it from being completely inundated by random information about all 5 billion plus people on the planet, rendering it completely useless. As it is, "How come I can't have an article when they can!" is a constant refrain from every person that can drink a glass of beer really fast or stand on their head or got straight A's once.

<li><b>Delete</b> The prior AFD didn't discuss sourcing specifically, so I don't know if the article then completely lacked sources, had the same ones, had different ones, etc... The current article has as sources a <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Plain_Dealer_4b72.html" title="Cleveland Plain Dealer">Cleveland Plain Dealer</a> article primarily about her, which puts her half way to meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. It has a trivial mention from the same newspaper, which doesn't help. It has a passing mention from www.clevescene.com, which adds nothing. It has an article from the Cleveland Jewish News that contains a sentence about her performance. This also doesn't meet the primary subject portion of the WP:BIO criteria. I believe none of the inline links are to independent reliable sources; the best of them is most likely to an actress provided bio-blurb. So I judge at this time that the article does not demonstrate notability to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:03, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Doesn't appear to be too notable of a certification organisation, and the article sure doesn't claim that, aside that the certifications are "popular" which is a rather weak claim to fame. Google search for <tt>"International Charter" IC9700 -wikipedia</tt> gets me 62 distinct hits, for IC9200 66 distinct hits. With duplicates, both searches go to 800s. Allegations of scam on the article talk page doesn't inspire confidence either.

<li>Oh, please. "If it's International, then it must be important"? Some people guess my nickname comes from "WWW", as in <i>World Wide</i> Web; does that fact alone make me important too? =) Just a hint - Wikipedia works slowly and you can't change deletion policies, or prevailing notability consensus, just by opposing a random deletion. Yeah, we delete stuff aggressively. (Wikipedia is still growing though.) It's <i>irrelevant</i> in this particular case though - we're here to assess whether or not <i>this</i> subject warrants an article or not. Can you explain why this subject is notable? (Note that I'm <i>not</i> busting out one of these newfangled "not verifiable" or "lacks reliable sources" cards, I'm using a bit older "the article has extremely, <i>extremely</i> weak claims to fame and cursory examination says the subject is not notable at all" deletion rationale.)<br />
Deletion situation is at times pretty depressing all right. I'm just questioning why you're anxious to proclaim <i>this</i> article a martyr and an example of jackbooted deletion happiness gone awry. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:58, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable actress. She had "one of the lead roles" on <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palmetto_Pointe_548a.html" title="Palmetto Pointe">Palmetto Pointe</a>, a show that lasted 12 episodes on <a href="../../../i/_/%28/I_%28TV_network%29_35f7.html" title="I (TV network)">I (TV network)</a>. That's not exactly NBC, ABC, etc. According to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048220/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048220/" rel="nofollow">IMDB</a>, the rest of her roles include: "Wardrobe Girl", "Waitress", "Girl in Marsh", one episode of "One Tree Hill", and an unnamed part in a made for TV movie. I don't think any of her parts, not even her lead role, makes her a notable actress. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 13:53, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

And in a two sentence article (one of them a run-on), it manages to seemingly contradict itself. (The relevant Wikiproject doesn't have enough activity or participation currently to meet the standards for forming a Wikiproject, but that is true of a lot of Wikiprojects.) It is used as a major header in the projects {{<a href="../../../o/h/i/Template%7EOhio_Wesleyan_University_99aa.html" title="Template:Ohio Wesleyan University">Ohio Wesleyan University</a>}} template, so that should be adjusted to not include a wikilink.

<li><b>Reply to your comment</b>: I have not said that my Professor article was "wrongly" deleted. It was the first article I had created when I did not know anything about wikipedia. I now understand that it was rightly deleted. See I also have seven publications and working towards more. It does not mean article related to me should be created and all other such people (we are in 1000s). However, if someone do something really extra-ordinary ONLY then an article should be created about him. Only then ones work becomes encyclopaedic. --- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ابراهيم</a> 09:53, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry for the misunderstanding, but in that case I don't think you should have brought that up. It is better to refer to <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a>, which is a quite decent proposed guideline for the notability of academics. As far as I can see, Finlay doesn't really pass the test yet. (And notable academics are at least <i>nominated</i> for deletion quite often around here; we have had a Yale professor and member of the National Academy of Sciences on AFD recently, and I deprodded another NAS member and a Fellow of the Royal Society just a few days ago, just to mention some very recent cases. That an actually notable scientist might have been speedy deleted by mistake is quite believable.) <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 10:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Minor programming language with no verifiable userbase.<br />
While Wikipedia includes articles on a number of other minor programming languages, most of these have some other source of notability -- e.g. <a href="../../../f/_/s/F_Sharp_programming_language_845b.html" title="F Sharp programming language">F Sharp programming language</a> is notable for the Microsoft connection, while <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malbolge.html" title="Malbolge">Malbolge</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/l/Unlambda.html" title="Unlambda">Unlambda</a> are notorious in the programming languages community for their difficulty of use. So far as I can tell, Seed7 has nothing.<br />
The <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> proposal, while not an official policy, is a useful metric for deciding what software should be included. It's worth noting that Seed7 fails it completely; it appears that the only published document about the language is a thesis written by its creator.<br />
Google rankings are a flawed metric, but extremely small numbers of Google results for <i>software</i> is often a useful indicator of non-notability. Seed7 fails here too: "seed7 programming -wikipedia" returns just 120-odd unique results. (Searching without "programming" includes many false positives, and the number of unique results returned is still under 1000.) — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 16:57, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is argued that some of this languages are notable for having a Microsoft connection or being difficult to use. This sounds just strange and is no argument at all (Btw.: Seed7 programs are very portable and run under Unix and Windows without any change. And it is easy to turn Seed7 into a <i>difficult to use</i> language since the language is extendable and the interpreter is <i>booted</i> (see below)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>IMHO Seed7 is notable because it has several features which are not found in other programming languages:
<ul>
<li>The possibility to declare new statements (syntactical and semantically) in the same way as functions are declared (There are also user definable operators with priority and associativity).</li>
<li>Declaration constructs for constant-, variable-, function-, parameter-, and other declarations are described in Seed7 (The user can change existing declaration constructs or invent new ones).</li>
<li>Templates use no special syntax. They are just functions with <i>type</i> parameters or a <i>type</i> result (For example: <i>array</i>, <i>hash</i>, <i>struct</i> and <i>set</i> use a Pascal inspired syntax and semantic. In Seed7 they are not hard coded in the compiler but are templates described in Seed7).</li>
<li>Seed7 is a syntactically and semantically extendable language: Almost all of the Seed7 language (statements, operators, declaration constructs, and more) is defined in Seed7 in an include file (seed7_05.s7i).</li>
<li>The application program contains an include statement and the <i>hi</i> interpreter is <i>booted</i> with the language description when it starts. This way it is possible to define language variants or a totally different language.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Other Seed7 features are not unique but are rare and cannot be found in this combination. <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHans_Bauer_d956.html" title="User:Hans Bauer">Hans Bauer</a> 10:18, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>, no indication of third-party coverage provided, no evidence found that Seed7 has made a significant documented contribution to its field. The details provided by Mr. Bauer are of some limited interest to a few people but none are enough to make the subject encyclopedic. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 17:47, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, in my company we use Seed7 successfully as scripting language (instead of a "write only" scripting language). We do not publish our scripts, therefore you cannot find anything about that in the internet. I think that Seed7 is used by a lot of people as workhorse without telling Google about it. So Seed7 is definitely of interest to much more than just a few people. On the other hand there are "student joke languages" which are designed to be "difficulty of use". Other students write in a homepage about the 20th version of the "Hello, world!" or other "Mickey Mouse" program in this language. Although such languages are not used for "real world programs" you get a lot of Google hits for this languages. In contrast to such languages there are several non trivial applications written in Seed7. What about <a href="../../../d/n/a/Dnafight.html" title="Dnafight">Dnafight</a>, there are also rewrites of <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Panic_8e92.html" title="Apple Panic">Apple Panic</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle_Adventure_36b2.html" title="Castle Adventure">Castle Adventure</a>. You can find several games (Shisen, Memory, Tetris, Startrek, Wizards Castle, Sudoku), simulations (Wator, Game of Life, Eliza), a basic interpreter and more. In total you can find more then 50000 lines of Seed7 code.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>trim</b>. It has a userbase (if small) outside of its author, is the subject of a thesis, and incorporates a few interesting (if not unique) features that haven't yet found their way into the programming mainstream. This meets my minimum inclusion criteria. However, the current article consists mostly out of how-to and example material; this should be almost entirely trimmed away and replaced with a more encyclopedic discussion of the language's salient features, and how they compare to other languages. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiet_Delport_08f7.html" title="User:Piet Delport">Piet Delport</a> 11:42, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

The search for "name programming language" has low counts for all languages in the table. Seed7 fits good in the middle of the hit values of "name programming language".

<li><b>Reminder to those arguing for keep:</b> So far the proponents for keeping this article have presented one, and only one, source for all the information about this programming language - the man Thomas Mertes himself. The Sourceforge site, the thesis - all are his work. By presenting only the self-published work of one person, the article is in blatant violation of our <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a>, which states that "<i>self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely <u>not acceptable</u> as sources.</i>"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If you want this article to be kept, the place for arguing it is <i>not</i> on this page. Go find references to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> totally unrelated to Thomas Merkel who have written about seed7, be they online references or offline. Add these references, if you can find them, into the article. <i>That's</i> the convincing way to argue for its keeping. Not by harping on its "innovativeness", or "user base", or "right to stay" (which, by the way, is a concept as real as <a href="../../../l/u/m/Luminiferous_ether.html" title="Luminiferous ether">luminiferous ether</a> is). After adding references we'll see you back here.</dd>
<dd>In the event there are no references to be found, do not expect the article to be kept; even so, do take to heart that deletion does not preclude the later writing of an article on seed7 <i>with sufficient references</i>. If Wikipedia were around in 1991, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> would not have deserved an article back then. <a href="../../../k/a/v/User%7EKavadi_carrier_b65d.html" title="User:Kavadi carrier">Kavadi carrier</a> 12:58, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The verifiability policy also states: "Self-published material may be acceptable when produced by a well-known, professional researcher <b>in a relevant field</b>"</dd>
<dd>And: "Material from self-published sources, and other published sources of dubious reliability, may be used as sources in articles about themselves [...]"</dd>
<dd>In other words, for the purpose of verifiability, Mertes's self-published works about Seed7 are eligible sources.</dd>
<dd>This is independent of Mertes's theses, which are peer-reviewed and <i>not</i> self-published, thus definitely qualifying as <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>. (I don't know where you get the idea that sources have to be somehow "totally unrelated" to Thomas Mertes; this is simply not true.)</dd>
<dd>In other words, there is no question about Seed7's verifiability, only about its <i>notability</i>, which is what's being argued above. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiet_Delport_08f7.html" title="User:Piet Delport">Piet Delport</a> 16:06, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, but you have omitted the fact that this article is still based upon only one source. Hence this article fails the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability guideline</a> which states, "In order to have a verifiable article, a topic must be notable enough that it will be described by <i>multiple</i> independent reliable sources". At best, this deserves only a mention in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_programming_languages.html" title="List of programming languages">list of programming languages</a> and definitely not its own article. <a href="../../../k/a/v/User%7EKavadi_carrier_b65d.html" title="User:Kavadi carrier">Kavadi carrier</a> 16:18, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The "right to stay" mentioned by several other persons should IMHO be replaced by "fairness" and "equal rights" as in: Equal rights for the programming languages listed by Mr. Bauer and Seed7.</dd>
<dd>To the "one source of information" discussion: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> says at the top: "However, it is not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception". The <a href="http://seed7.sourceforge.net" class="external text" title="http://seed7.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">homepage of Seed7</a> is not "someone's website". It is a homepage at <a href="../../../s/o/u/SourceForge_73c7.html" title="SourceForge">SourceForge</a> which contains 100% <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a> content. That the Seed7 homepage is just written by Mr. Mertes is speculation. At least the <a href="../../../d/n/a/Dnafight.html" title="Dnafight">Dnafight</a> program mentions two other persons as copyright holder. Another argument against the "one source" idea: A thesis is a scientific work, which is subject of a review by experts in the field. Scientific publications are considered to be the most reliable source. And finally: The Seed7 wikipedia article does not make disputed claims, it just contains several programming examples. -- <a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlass_Tomato_73a5.html" title="User:Glass Tomato">Glass Tomato</a> 20:52, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>A thesis may be a scientific work and a reliable source - nowhere have I said anything to the contrary - but at the end of the day it is still a single person's work. Peer review doesn't add anything to that work but prunes it of errors.</li>
<li>Your appeal to the "not set in stone" clause of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> rings hollow - no assertion has been made that seed7 is anything more than a homebrew programming language with a small group of fans, and hence there appears to be no case to treat it as an exception to the notability guidelines. To argue that seed7 is notable "because I use it" or "because my company uses it" is a fallacy - I use my laptop computer, but that doesn't mean it deserves an article.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd><s>Lastly, I agree that the seed7 article doesn't make disputed claims, but only gives examples. That is true - so true that the article is largely a copy-and-paste from different pages on the Sourceforge site. Since Mr Mertes has not posted any copyright notice on his site, we could assume that he still owns copyright on his writing by default, which means any copy-and-pasting from his site onto Wikipedia constitutes copyright infringement. I could slap a {{<a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopyvio_c034.html" title="Template:Copyvio">copyvio</a>}} tag on the article right now and have an administrator delete it automatically within seven days, but I have been so amused by the weak arguments for keeping the article that I'd love to hear more.&#160;:-)</s>

<dd>Kavadi, your insinuation is unfounded, and not altogether intellectually honest.</dd>
<dd>Firstly, i came to this discussion because the article is on my watchlist, not because of Zron's solicitation. Secondly, there is nothing underhanded about the solicitation, given that it was quite explicitly in response to my previously-expressed dissent toward deleting this article, predating this AfD discussion. This was a simple act of courtesy, not of vote-stacking: you should know this. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiet_Delport_08f7.html" title="User:Piet Delport">Piet Delport</a> 12:47, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I know that Seed7 is not accused, but nevertheless I would like to put a final statement here.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Since 1989 I developed the programming language HAL as private project in my spare time. HAL was based on the ideas of my diploma thesis and dissertation.</li>
<li>In the year 2005 I renamed HAL to Seed7 and released it under the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_General_Public_License_c529.html" title="GNU General Public License">GPL</a>.</li>
<li>Seed7 is a stable product, which can be used at any time. The Seed7 package consists of approx. 70000 <a href="../../../s/o/u/Source_lines_of_code.html" title="Source lines of code">lines</a> in C (interpreter and runtime library), approx. 50000 lines Seed7 example programs, approx. 10000 lines Seed7 libraries and approx. 100 pages documentation.</li>
<li>Since January 2006 there is a homepage for Seed7 under <a href="http://seed7.sourceforge.net" class="external free" title="http://seed7.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">http://seed7.sourceforge.net</a></li>
<li>As mentioned by someone else there are approximately 100 downloads each month.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Since I wrote the interpreter, the example programs and the documentation, almost everything that is written about Seed7 must be based on my work. This way it is unavoidable that similarities will be found in any derived work. All my work is <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a> and can be used by anybody for free. An open source project founded by several persons would never hear the "one person" argument.</dd>
<dd>As you can probably guess, a lot of time and effort went into the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a> project Seed7. Everybody is invited to help Seed7 and other open source projects. I think there should generally be more focus on positive things which build something up instead of negative things which destroy something. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Mertes_9630.html" title="User:Thomas Mertes">Thomas Mertes</a> 09:46, 11 November 2006 (UTC) <small><small>— <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Mertes_9630.html" title="User:Thomas Mertes">Thomas Mertes</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/o/User_talk%7EThomas_Mertes_9f82.html" title="User talk:Thomas Mertes">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thomas_Mertes_b1e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thomas Mertes">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small> User has 6 edits. <a href="../../../k/a/v/User%7EKavadi_carrier_b65d.html" title="User:Kavadi carrier">Kavadi carrier</a> 10:00, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<li>
<ul>
<li>So you are not denying that the sole purpose of this article is to generate publicity for the work of one person - you? <a href="../../../k/a/v/User%7EKavadi_carrier_b65d.html" title="User:Kavadi carrier">Kavadi carrier</a> 09:59, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your conclusion is complete nonsense. As mentioned before, Seed7 gets around 100 downloads each month. Btw.: I have made "just a few edits" in wikipedia because I have a life (family, 3 children) and spend my spare time for something positive instead of spending my whole life in wikipedia deletion discussions. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Mertes_9630.html" title="User:Thomas Mertes">Thomas Mertes</a> 12:07, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The author of this article proposes a contraption that cannot work as intended because its aerodynamic drag is prohibitive. To overcome the drag thousands of powerful jet engines would be needed.

<li>I agree with the suggestion that this should be deleted. The authors are apparently using Wikipedia as a place to publish a paper on their proposed concept and advocate it to the public. They should use a more appropriate venue, most preferably one of the research journals in the field of aerospace engineering, to publish original ideas. The question of whether it would work is not primary here-- for that discussion, though, they could put up a page elsewhere and discuss it there. If the article is published in a more appropriate page, it would be reasonable to put up a short Wikipedia article linking to it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffrey.landis_c70b.html" title="User:Geoffrey.landis">Geoffrey.landis</a> 15:33, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's only a few sentences about a minor character on <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugrats.html" title="Rugrats">Rugrats</a>. The information for Drew Pickles is already on the <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugrats.html" title="Rugrats">Rugrats</a> page anyway, so why should there be an article with the same information? This page was originally a vandalism page if you check the history. Aparently some group called the "Barney Bunch" makes fun of this character, such as calling him a homosexual, and involves him in al sorts of juvenile homosexual humor. I wont mention those just for the sake of decency, but if you want to know more, check the history. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDietLimeCola_5161.html" title="User:DietLimeCola">DietLimeCola</a> 19:17, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The article is an attempt to mis-use Wikipedia as a soapbox to promote a set of 6 interrelated protologisms. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_7923.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a soapbox">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a> and the entire article is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.

<li><b>delete</b>I couldn't find any quotes, any references to any articles and I didn't notice any links. I've never heard of the term, it took me a second read even to work out why there was a need for such a term. Moreover, even if the term existed, the article only gives one view - there must be at least some people who think that it is impossible to have equality between those in a normal sexual relatinship and those in an abnormal sexual relationship - however if all these concerns on the article were addressed I'd probably vote to keep. --17:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A couple of Wiki notes:</dd>
<dd>1. Presenting "both sides to every debate" is not really how <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> works. Lots of debates have only one notable and academically reputable side.</dd>
<dd>2. An article on a notable subject from a biased perspective is not a good candidate for deletion.</dd>
<dd>just sayin'. Of course as the nominator I agree that the article should be deleted. But your vote implied misunderstandings of the NPOV policy and of the deletion process.</dd>

<li><b>merge</b>-- Google shows some scattered references, so with some citations the term could be included under <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexism.html" title="Heterosexism">heterosexism</a>, along with discussion of "heterosexism" vs. "homophobia."</li>

<li>Hello, this is Alec Roberts, and despite you all thinking I don't exist, I do, although I have never played at Deportivo Wanka, I have trained with them for a few weeks while I was over in Peru on a trip to enhance my Spanish with college. I am now back training with Aberystwyth Town FC, although I am currently playing local league football with Padarn United. I obviously set this page up myself, as I would be privileged to be on a site such as this, and I notice in the history one of my so called 'mates' has been joking around saying I died. Well I haven't, I'm here, alive and well. Alec Robs 19:35, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Mr Roberts, assuming you are who you claim to be, our article about you still has to be written based on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>—in other words, not based as much on what you or your friends say about you, as on the words of unrelated people who have been interested enough about you to have written about you before the article was started. A simple search with Google indicates there are no pages that mention your training at either Aberystwyth Town or Padern, and hence the article will be deleted if it remains in its current <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> form, barring the addition of aforementioned reliable sources.

<li>This compiler is officially MS supported for PHP running under .NET <cite>The primary goal of the project, released under Microsoft Shared Source Permissive License, is to enable full functionality of existing PHP scripts on .Net without any modification, Microsoft said.</cite> This software is notable under <b>The software is among the core products of a notable software developer or vendor.</b><a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETulkolahten_ac82.html" title="User:Tulkolahten">Tulkolahten</a> 12:06, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Having MS's support does not make it part of their core software. In fact, it is intended to be integrated into MS Visual Studio. At that point it will be a part of their core software.

<li><b>Keep</b> Part of the discussion on <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> talks about how languages tend to be much more notable then other types of software, and by extension, I believe this would include compilers, especially if they are being actively developed for highly used langages like PHP and MSIL. If this project leads to later compiler and language developments, I believe it is very noteworthy, purely from a research and development standpoint, rather than from a 'highly used' standpoint. If development stops and it loses the interest of research bodies and leads to no later developments, then at that time it should be deleted. I'm very glad I found this article on the wikipedia, since I actively develop in both languages. - TimTillotson 16:25 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
