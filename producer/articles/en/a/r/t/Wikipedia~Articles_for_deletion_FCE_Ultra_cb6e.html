<li>I guess it's just where our editing philosophies differ. I see an article like iNES (NES emulator) and think: "This is a poor article. How can I make it better?" While I'm guessing that you would see an article like that and think: "This is a poor article. It doesn't belong here." So your complaint of it being just an ad could be solved by working with the article a little bit to make it not be an ad. - <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperlex_32b0.html" title="User:Superlex">Lex</a> 18:00, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> you know, considering that there are over a half a dozen NES emulators in the catergory, the same for SNES, Sega Genesis, N64, there might be a need for a higher-level discussion of this first.

<li><b>Response</b> Here's your reason Cyberskull: Per WP:V, "If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic." It also fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> on 'a subject needs to be of sufficient importance that there are multiple reliable secondary sources, independent of the subject, on which we can base a verifiably neutral article without straying into original research.'<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 09:58, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And I assert WP:V is a cleanup criterion first, and a deletion criterion next, only to be applied when there's absolutely no question there's no reliable sources out there and even the program itself was written and documented by an unreliable madman. Barring damning proof to the contrary, the project itself qualifies as a source for the program's features. My sources, below, say FCE Ultra has demonstrable notability. Therefore, the whole thing doesn't preclude a stub that says basic information about the program. Because if you're unwilling to consider the subject a reliable source for <i>certain kinds</i> of assertions, you're in <i>gobloads</i> of hot water with <i>bazillions</i> of articles. In that case, we might as well wipe the Wikipedia database and start rebuilding it with a brave new policy "every character must have a source, or else". --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 18:24, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If you feel it's insignifcant, make an AfD discussion. I don't judge articles in relation to other ones, I judge the article on it's own worthiness.

<li>&#160;::long blank stare:: And interpreting one's purely hypothetical <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> argument as an exhortation to delete articles is also not very productive. Okay, let's recap my argument: "The subject fulfills criteria set forth by <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> by being 'included in a major operating system distribution such as Debian, Fedora Core or FreeBSD, and the maintainer of the distribution is independent from the software developer'."

<li>Yeah, #8593 is awesome. So do you have any sources we can use to actually write a verifiable article on it? <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 18:00, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Because law-book-throwing is the lowest form of comedy and everyone's having jolly good time reading this in, oh, 10 years, I'd like to remind that you forgot this bit: "Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence".

<li>*sigh* "Non-exceptional claims do not require exceptional evidence." As in "If the website says the software runs on Linux, and you can easily take the source code and compile it on Linux, finding a peer-reviewed professor to tell you that it runs on Linux is a tad bit overkill." And no, I absolutely was <i>not</i> thinking of sarcasm, because discussions like this prove <i>that</i> maxim absolutely wrong. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 18:51, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm beginning to think we might have our wires crossed here. The issue was that there is no evidence to support any claim that this should have an srticle, no download numbers, no reviews (admittedly they are hard to find for emulators) no interviews etc. Only links to the site, forum and another site that seems to be an official one. I certainly wasn't questioning anything to do with the actual details of the emulator. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 18:56, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, wires-crossitude is apparent, so let's all calm down. My apologies for everyone involved, it's been rough lately. Outdenting a bit, see below. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 21:16, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Even though this seems to have settled a bit, I wanted to interject a something that might be enlightening to those who are sitting on the sidelines. (It's a bit of an expansion of what wwwwolf is getting at below, too.) There are two different measures that care about sources: <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">notability</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. Interestingly, they treat sources in different, but overlapping ways. When notability is caring about sources, it wants multiple, non-trivial, independent sources. This is different from verifiability's requirements, which are they they are reliable and support the assertion in question. What's interesting is that a source that satisfies V can be one that doesn't satisfy NN (say, if it's reliable but trivial), and one that satisfies NN can be one that doesn't satisfy V (say, if it's major, independent, there are more than one, but it's contains nothing useful to the encyclopedia).
<p>In this case, sources are irrelevant to notability because of the "included in a major distribution such as Debian" clause of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Thus, the fact that the website of FCE Ultra is not independent isn't an issue, since only NN cares about independence in this way. (Aside, V cares about independence, but for reasons unrelated to this discussion.) What results is a situation where a source can be both "bad" and "good" in an AfD, depending on what outstanding issues need to be satisfied. Specifically, a source can be useless to establish notability, but can be relevant to establish verifiability. It can be the case that no independent, multiple, non-trivial sources exist on a subject but the subject passes some other notability criteria, at which point these otherwise "inadequate" sources actually are enough to prevent an article's deletion on grounds of "unverifiability", because they make the subject verifiable.</p>
<p>I hope this has been interesting (and accurate? let me know otherwise), despite it being a long tangent. I've tripped over this subtle difference myself in the past. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 22:23, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Let me recap: Deletion nomination questions the notability of the software. <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> says inclusion is warranted if it's included in a (e.g.) Linux distro, and is (NB.) among the most popular packages. Debian popcon, which is an external source <i>specifically</i> listed as an example of a tool for gauging package popularity in WP:SOFTWARE, <i>confirms</i> this. Therefore, notability per WP:SOFTWARE is not in question, <i>and</i> it's confirmed by an independent source. So what <i>exactly</i> is the problem with this? Inclusion in Debian and its apparent popularity there is <i>solely</i> enough to mark the software as notable enough in my opinion. You don't <i>need</i> anything else. Reviews, interviews, etc. are <i>extra</i>. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 21:16, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, based on that, I will agree that this achieves notability. How do you go about withdrawing one of these AfDs? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 21:25, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You could put &lt;del&gt;...&lt;/del&gt; around the nomination at the top and state you're withdrawing the nomination. Regrettably, since this debate is not at the moment unanimous, I'm not sure if I can <i>close</i> this AfD as it stands - I don't have that much experience about closing AfDs yet - but I'll see the policies and at worst I can close it normally when we're closer to the deadline. =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 21:47, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
