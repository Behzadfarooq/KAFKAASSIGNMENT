<p>This is a procedural relist of an article whose second afd was closed as it had been created by a banned user (<a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criterion 'G5' of our criteria for speedy deletion</a>). A decent proportion of the 'delete' opinions wern't by socks of the banned user and so I think it's worth a relist.</p>
<p>As there are so many views etc on there, I've temporarily restored the deleted AFD at User:Robdurbar/Wikipedia:Articles for deletion - Rec.sport.pro-wrestling (second nomination). That should allow users to refer to arguments or views expressed there. I'll delete that once this AFD is over.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The issue is one of notability. There is a usenet newsgroup about almost every subject, so Individual usenet newsgroups can't be regarded as notable unless there is something exceptional about them. <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.folklore.urban.html" title="Alt.folklore.urban">Alt.folklore.urban</a> is a good example of a notable newsgroup; the dozens of alt.fan.* groups are a good example of why not all newsgroups are notable. In this case, does the article make a case for the notability of rec.sport.pro-wrestling independent of the notability of pro-wrestling? No, I'm afraid it doesn't. It is not exceptionally old, nor particularly high-traffic. Being quoted as a source for fan opinion makes it just that: a source, not an article of its own. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 18:29, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>here look at this link: <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/rec.sport.pro-wrestling/about?hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/rec.sport.pro-wrestling/about?hl=en" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> It has been around since 1990....how is that, in your words, NOT old?

<dd>I do find that it is neither exceptionally old nor high traffic. It was created in 1990. Usenet started in 1979, and many of the old "big 7" hierarchy groups date from the late 1980s. The number of posts is not exceptional. The group uk.politics.misc has approximately the same number of posts per month at the moment. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 20:26, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So what you are saying is because the group wasn't created in 1979 at the BIRTH of usenet then, in your opinion, its not old. So 17 years for a usenet group is not old. Ok...right. Well I am sorry, and I do respect your right to an opinion mind you, but that totally smacks of Internet elitism to me. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">TruthCrusader</a> 22:49, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh dear, perhaps my meaning wasn't exactly clear. I'm considering whether this particular newsgroup can claim notability on grounds of age. It turns out to be 17 years old, which is no "spring chicken", but it's not an exceptional age for a big-7 usenet group (the great renaming happened in 1987). <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 23:22, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is questionable whether or not faqs.org counts as an independent source. The question is what are there criteria for inclusion? This isn't discussed here, and since the rule is "when in doubt, don't delete", I'll evaluate the faq as one source for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> purposes, even though my personal opinion is that it probably really isn't independent. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 22:57, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the above two votes by this Perkoff individual (more than likely another Chad sock) need to be discounted AND removed from this page as they are offensive. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">TruthCrusader</a> 12:23, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
