<p>This article has the sort of procedural history that makes me want to crawl in bed and hug my teddy bear. Suffice it to say, it has been deleted at AfD, kept at AfD, and sent to DRV in the interim for reasons of sockpuppeting, vote soliciting and other improprieties several times. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_October_18&amp;diff=83219784&amp;oldid=83188636" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_October_18&amp;diff=83219784&amp;oldid=83188636" rel="nofollow">The most recent DRV consensus</a> results in this relisting. I'd suggest everyone consider the article anew, without reference to any previous discussion. This debate will be semiprotected to prevent IP spamming; in addition, because of prior complaints of "vote soliciting" on every side, notifying other Wikipedians en masse of this relisting is strongly discouraged. I'm sure most interested folks have the article watch-listed by now, so extra notification, besides the AfD template on the article, shouldn't be needed. Let's try to get a final resolution here, if at all possible. This is a procedural nomination, so I <b>abstain</b>. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 15:39, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Let me point out that I like indie bands, before I start, so this isn't an anti-indie vote or anything. But I've looked this over several times, and these guys don't meet the necessary mark. Badlydrawnjeff mentions the media mentions; an analysis of the four mentions in the article would indicate that one is a mention in a calendar listing, another is a blog with a passing reference to the band in an article about a local club, and a third requires registration, so I've no idea what it is. The article in College Times is about the only potentially solid reference to the band that I can track down, and I waded through several pages of Google listings as well. To me, that suggests they fail on the multiple, non-trivial mentions. And a look over <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> indicates that they miss the mark on all suggested guidelines. I'm sorry, but that all adds up to a delete, with absolutely no problem allowing a recreation down the road if they meet the guidelines. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 16:14, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I used to edit a weekly newspaper. We used to list about a dozen or so events every week as a calendar, including neat little writeups about the bands. They looked exactly like the New Times mention. It's a <i>calendar listing</i>, not an article. The AP (which, for anyone who doesn't mouse over the link, does not stand for "Associated Press") mention is a part of a band list, and is not an article. The HeartattaCk piece looks like an editorial of some sort to me, and mentions the band name once, waaaaaay down at the bottom; is the whole thing about AJJ? I can't honestly tell. And I'll give you the AZ Republic article - but it still fails multiple, non-trivial coverage. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 02:54, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. As per my previous point-by-point explaination from <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a>, repeated below:
<ul>
<li>Has not had a charted hit on any national music chart.</li>
<li>Has not been certified gold in any major country.</li>
<li>Has not gone on an international concert tour. Has performed in other states in the US, but does not qualify as a full national tour.</li>
<li>Has not released two albums, hasn't released any albums on a major or indie label. They are releasing a split EP on a relatively small indie label, but this is far cry from the two albums.</li>
<li>No reliable cited sources. There is a minor mention in a <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_New_Times_0639.html" title="Phoenix New Times">Phoenix New Times</a>, a local paper, but this is not a major article. The AZNightBuzz link is a blog, therefore not reputatable. The eCollegeTimes has only 50 unique hits on Google, not reputable. The State Press is a bigger article, but is only a small college paper and part of a news page . Does not hit "Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media". No national press whatsoever</li>
<li>No major members from other bands</li>
<li>Not a notable style for a city or a local scene of a city. If it were, they would have received more verifiable press mentions.</li>
<li>Has not won or been placed a major music award. Won one "Best of Phoenix" award from a local paper, and was nominated for another. These are nowhere near "major".</li>
<li>Not performed performed music for a work of media that is notable, or been on radio</li>
<li>172 hits on Google, 126 listeners on last.fm. Does not pass either as notable. Also isn't mentioned on AllMusicGuide.</li>

<dd>If you're talking about that Heartattack thing wouldn't call a small music 'zine national. If you're on about the Alternative Press mention, it wasn't a non-trivial mention. I copied/pasted that a while back. The facts are that the press at best misses the _intention_ behind multiple non-trivial reliable sources, if it hits it at all. Either way, I'm happy to cite <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> - I believe even if it does meet <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>, something I contest, it's against the spirit of the thing and that's what matters more than getting into petty particulars.

<li>I have done so, and found your argument wanting. I've also reviewed the four sources provided in the article; one doesn't exist, one has a whopping two paragraphs about the band, and one requires people to log in before accessing the site. The other links you've provided elsewhere only show that the group has toured in various cities, a claim that (a) wasn't being denied and (b) doesn't exactly validate the article as per WP:MUSIC. Sorry, but my vote remains the same. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 16:28, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I went to the New Times site and was able to get to the article. I have reprinted the text on the Talk page for your perusal. As for the ASU site, it wasn't a login required site when I originally cited the article, but it is representative of a printed material. I'm sorry if you don't want to take the time to check the sources, but that kind of discounts your comments about them not being reliable, since you're not taking the time to really look. I, on the other hand, have taken plenty of time to find these sources and cite them accurately within the article, as to verify all assertions of notability. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 19:43, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>*sigh* I never said that the ASU source was unreliable; I merely said that, of the four sources in the article, one required you to log in. That's all.

You've yet to prove to anyone's satisfaction but your own that the band is notable; the majority of the links provided have only shown that they have toured, which in and of itself is not a particularly notable accomplishment. The few articles you have provided that actually <i>do</i> cover the band either do so in passing or are non-notable in and of themselves. If I may make a suggestion, the spread-out nature of this AfD is also making it almost impossible to follow; I would suggest consolidating <b>all</b> of the sources that you've provided onto the talk page, where we can quickly and easily see them all; I'll be willing to admit that perhaps a noteworthy and reliable source has been lost in the mess of all this, and consolidation might fix that. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 14:40, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

I'm not persuaded that the series of gigs in the south and West of the USA counts as a "national tour", and their presence in listings doesn't count for me as non-trivial coverage. The other articles are all local (to their state of Arizona), and most time out or require registration to read, so I can't rate them. Not appearing on allmusic.com doesn't help their case, and nor does the paucity of ghits.

<li>It's a well established /guideline/ for establishing notability, something that is key to Wikipedia. However, it's not policy - indeed, you can cite reasons outside WP:MUSIC. It's just that /a lot/ of people use WP:MUSIC for establishing notability, and if you don't reach it you're likely to get a lot of delete votes as it's a fairly reliable catch-all even if it's not perfect. That said, you're right - it can work both ways and someone is perfectly entitled to vote Keep despite a band not reaching WP:MUSIC. -<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 20:43, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Notability here is borderline. I can understand and respect those wishing to delete, but if the <i>spirit</i> of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is to weed out little brats with MySpace pages and not to marginalize indy music then I feel we are being overzealous. Still, they should meet the <i>letter</i> of at least one of the criteria, here is my read at this time:
<ol>
<li>Their <i>tours</i> <u>fail</u> as they have yet to travel the entire US...though a similar region in any "medium-sized" country would be "national".</li>
<li>Their <i>albums</i> <u>fail</u> because they are not on a label...though they are part of a collective and are reported to soon have a release on a significant label (the last bit being unsubstatiated).</li>
<li><i>"Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media...(university newspapers are usually fine)"</i> This one I think they <u>may pass</u> based on the <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/ent/music/articles/0922withtheband0922.html" class="external text" title="http://www.azcentral.com/ent/music/articles/0922withtheband0922.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> in the <i><a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Republic_46b7.html" title="Arizona Republic">Arizona Republic</a></i> and the <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/bestof/award.php?oid=oid:197034&amp;section=oid:34824&amp;year=2006" class="external text" title="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/bestof/award.php?oid=oid:197034&amp;section=oid:34824&amp;year=2006" rel="nofollow">award</a> in the <i><a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_New_Times_0639.html" title="Phoenix New Times">Phoenix New Times</a></i>.

<li><i>All other criteria</i>, they <u>clearly fail</u> at this time. Thus I would suggest we pass them based on # 3 alone. This may seem very generous.

<li><b>Comment:</b> You're welcome. I'm not sure what the criteria may be for "compelling" press coverage, but the author has included more than three cites to sources that are verifiable secondary sources (several having paper and online avialability).

<li><b>Delete</b> per WP:MUSIC. As for reliable sources, I really don't see one. The ASU article is expressly out per WP:MUSIC: "Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...)." The AZ Night Buzz is a blog. And the College Times? Definitely not something I would consider reliable. The article in the Phoenix New Times is not displaying for me, so I am unable to judge the content of the article itself, but the publication as a whole is a local paper for a large city, but it is still not a far reaching paper, leaving its value rather limited as well. Even if these articles were considered to be reliable sources, the next question is, would this band meet WP:MUSIC? They have not gone on a national tour. They have toured a portion of the U.S. They don't have two or more albums on a major label, no major music competition, no major award, they aren't getting radio time, and they don't have any independently notable members. As for "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city...", I see nothing to support that argument, even with the sources given. So with or without the sources given, I believe this band does not meet WP:MUSIC and should be deleted. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelnuneb_b3c1.html" title="User:Maelnuneb">Maelnuneb</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/e/User_talk%7EMaelnuneb_aa13.html" title="User talk:Maelnuneb">Talk</a>) 18:50, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
