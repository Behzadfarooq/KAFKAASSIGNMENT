<li><b>Delete.</b> Ongoing revert wars, Quinn is pissed, and no one should have to put up with this as a private person, regardless of public background. Sorry I got involved, but another student couldn't figure out how to do this page, so they IMed me. EW-Warrior 20:09, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> What is Quinn having to put up with? I see nothing objectionable on any of the edits, there is nothing demeaning nor can any of the material be construed as an attack. I'm very curious.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 00:57, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Answer</b> It's bad enough the guy has to deal with IB teenagers on his ass all day long, does he really need a revert war? Yes, he is beloved by students (past and present), but the man didn't ask for this, doesn't want it, and has even taken down his own site -- davidquinn.com -- because his fool students don't want to allow him a life outside of the classroom (jumping all over his old message board, at least one DOS attack). Ringess, I don't understand your take in all of this. I think you are a little obsessed with reverting, judging from the history here. Olympic Flame 07:08, 23 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Answer to Answer</b> Please read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Wikipedia's guidelines to citing sources</a>, then we can talk further. BTW, you did not answer my question. Again I ask, what is so objectionable about the material on the article as it stood when I was editing it. Basically, there is nothing in the article that is not <b>readily available</b> on the internet. <s>Believe me, I agree that the article should be deleted. Not for your reasons though. As I said, previous editors are claiming that the material they added is <b>copyright</b>. Keeping a spirit of good faith and respect for other people's opinions, I believe that on those grounds alone, it's reasonable to delete the article. As no <b>copyright</b> material, whatsoever, belongs on Wikipedia. Just let it go.</s> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 08:02, 26 February 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 07:18, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> <s>Quinn is notable enough as an actor to warrant inclusion in Encyclopedia. And edit wars are not enough to justify deletion. The problem seems to be that some of the original contributors to the article, did not understand Wikipedia's policies and made edits in good faith with material that they claim should not be edited by anyone but themselves, noting that Quinn himself does not wish the material edited. This is tantamount to claiming <b>copyrights</b> for the material included. Not understanding that no material on Wikipedia can be copyrighted and not familiar with Wikipedia's guidelines for nominating articles for deletion, they then took it upon themselves to try to preserve their material by automatically reverting any changes made. They did not understand that a better solution is exactly what we are doing here, discussing whether or not the material as is, should remain on Wikipedia. If the article does not survive, then the copyrighted material is safe, and if someone feels he is notable enough to warrant an article, they can always recreate with fresh non-copyrighted material.If it survives, well I think we all ought to sit down and have a cup of tea, to decide how best to write the article so that it does not use copyrighted material, yet remains an Encyclopedic article.</s> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 00:38, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete.</b> Revert wars are no fun, especially when non-Quinn students like to mess with it after having been inspired by idiotic Quinn students. The discussion page now contains a bunch of undesirable, offensive content generated from the wars, and because <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> refuses to remove most of it, the entire article along with the discussion should be gone. Mr. Quinn can always create his own website, or I can help him create one (that obviously cannot be edited by the public). --67.183.56.51 02:53, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You make my point exactly (except the part where you classify fellow editors as idiotic). Wikipedia should never contain copyrightable material in any form. To say that no one should be allowed to edit an article, is the same as claiming copyright. As far as I can tell, looking at the article, it contains no obvious copyrighted material, with most of the material easily available from verifiable sources. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 04:09, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Please delete this article. Or at least clear the discussion page because it's a mess. Since "business partners and/or reporters actually LOOK at this site," Quinn wouldn't like it if they actually see a discussion page full of battling words. Unfortunately, <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> stubbornly doesn't want to clear the discussion page because talk pages "provide interesting perspectives." --<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregoryKnapp_fc97.html" title="User:GregoryKnapp">GregoryKnapp</a> 00:24, 23 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> Yes I am stubborn. I archived the material. One of the pillars of wikipedia is respect for each other and differing opinions. We should be very careful about what we say on talk pages and not just say whatever we want and then later try to hide our messes. Archiving is an accepted method for keeping discussion pages readable and is preferrable to simply deleting. Also the readability of an article's discussion page or lack thereof, is not sufficient grounds for deleting the article itself (if it were there would be a whole lot of articles in trouble).<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 16:36, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> If you still find the content questionable, then why not delete it? How can you really trust anyone, even from the original source?

<ul>
<li>It seems to me, that the point you bring up about privacy and reputation is one of the big reasons why the Wikipedia community places great emphasis on citing credible reliable sources. An encyclopedia should contain no information that isn't already in the public domain. Also, by respecting copyrights, disallowing original research, and establishing standards for notability and maintaining neutral points of view; the community further ensures that no one is slandered or libeled. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 08:00, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

I have added nothing that is pov and have made no attacks. One of the users of your ip address requested that I document any change I made, I did. I will continue to listen and respond with respect to any request you make. When I am wrong, I will apologize. I will not delete any more material on my talk page. I have requested more than once, help from fellow users. I have not, nor will I ever, make personal comments about anyone who disagrees with my edits. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 02:36, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it somewhat important to note here that a number of contributors are claiming to know what Mr. Quinn thinks about the article. Yet no one has provided a source for his thoughts, and no one has stepped forward claiming to be him and expressin those thoughts. I think it would create a dangerous precedent if Wikipedia allowed people claiming to represent a person (who don't provide a verifiable source), to determine the fate of an article, based solely on their claims. But then again, I'm just a fellow editor, not even an admin, and it's important to understand that I in no way represent the MediaWiki foundation. The opinions I express are mine, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Board of Directors or their representatives. I only know, that if I were notable enough to warrant an article, I would not want someone else claiming they know me, to determine the fate of my article. Ce la vie. I'm just a little guy with a big TV. Furthermore, this comment was not intended as an attack on any user but more of an observation about the verifiability of conversations that not everyone is privy to.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 08:16, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Had a "multi-year stint as the host of <a href="../../../3/-/2/3-2-1_Contact_7744.html" title="3-2-1 Contact">3-2-1 Contact</a>" - so he was one of the lead characters of a very notable 1980s educational TV program. Also nominated for an Emmy, and is a Peabody Award-winner. Clearly notable and encyclopedic, and meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 09:24, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>DELETE - Nuthouse</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> the article as it is now, check and source facts and improve as necessary. If there are any revisions in the history which provide too many personal details, please point them out so that they can be deleted. The info that is presented now hardly goes beyond matters of public record, like the name, awards, public appearances and academic career. The legal threats are therefore entirely hollow, and I very much doubt that the actual David Quinn has made them. I'm assuming some of his students are running a little prank on him and us here. It would probably be better if they come clean before we contact Mr. Quinn and the techies at their uni to find out what's behind this. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 19:27, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>; seems to be reasonably notable for his TV career, and has had enough of a public life that he can't just go and say "No, I'm just a private person now" and withdraw everything public. His legal threats are ridiculous and we shouldn't cave in to them. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 20:13, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>; I came here fairly randomly. There seems no reason why this article should not exist just because the subject of the article wants it deleted. To make legal threats against Wikipedia editors apparently shows that this man has too much money and time himself (despite his comments about others), but he has been a public figure, and he doesn't have any rights over people writing about him unless they legally libel him. Remove anything that might be libellous, and he hasn't got a leg to stand on, no matter how good his law firm. In fact, it would now be dangerous to remove this article as it might set a precedent, and we might have people like David Irving and even Osama Bin Laden (OK, I'm not entirely serious) complaining about being listed and threatening legal action. He makes a lot of noise, of course, but it seems to be hot air, and as long as Wikipedia are happy to retain this article, it should remain. He has publically admitted that at least one version of the article is essentially correct, and that in itself would prevent legal action. Personally I don't have any interest in this entry, and I won't be watching this talkpage, but for Wikipedia to continue to exist in the form that it does, it should resist pointless bullying.

<dd>Sorry, Thomas, but I think you've got it wrong. The version of the article that should stay is the bio that relates to the acting career (and frankly I don't think that THAT is even worthy). This isn't about a rich guy or about time: It is about a right to privacy. Just because one part of someone's life conforms to certain aspects of WP:BIO, doesn't give anyone the right about every other aspect. --<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.160.17.29.html" title="User:67.160.17.29">67.160.17.29</a> 00:46, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But some of the stuff you <i>deleted</i> was pertaining to your acting career, like the link to your IMDB entry. And none of it seemed to particularly relate to your private life; it was all reporting on publicly-known things like an award you received. The most "private" thing there was mentioning what school you currently teach at; I wouldn't object if that were removed if you think it violates your privacy (by getting lots of screaming fans to mob the school looking for you?), but it's already published on other sites, as linked in the article. I'm sure your great lawyers will advise you that you have no valid basis for any sort of complaint. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 01:12, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Quinn made me see the light today, and I want to apologize to him for harming the WIKIPEDIA community by trying to change his bio and for being an idiotic pest/jerk. I think that this bio represents him correctly. NOW, all that said, I agree with NoSeptember and WAS4.250: I don't think its about whether Quinn is happy with it that matters. I think that a whole bunch of people have jumped on the bandwagon of "he can't tell us what to do!" without looking at the actual issue: I don't think that Quinn's important enough for this entry. I can't seem to find other entries for people who were famous for a little while 20 years ago.

<ul>
<li><b>DELETE: YOU ASKED, I'M ANSWERING</b> I have been involved with online communities since 1991, and I deeply respect the premise of wikipedia. That said, I have to question why so many strangers (Ringess, FCYTravis, RedGlobe, Trey, OlympicFlame) would care at all about my biography or this entry. I would hope that there is a more valuable use of your lives than the endless reverting of this entry (or the many hours some of you appear to have spent researching and documenting elements of my life). Here's a shout-out to Ringess: You have too much time on your hands.</li>
</ul>
<p>I returned from a brief trip to California this morning (BTW, the Image Awards are a lot of fun, and I urge you all to donate to the NAACP). I came back to school to get some paperwork done and found more than a few emails in my box. Most are from students, but at least one is from a resourceful wikipedian who very simply searched the Edmonds School District website for our directory, then sent me an email, directing me to this page. Anyone who wishes to email me may, of course, do this as well. You can even get my phone number from the directory and call and leave me a message. I'm happy to verify myself.</p>
<p>That said, I really could (mostly) care less about what you all are doing here. I didn't create this entry, I think that it is a complete waste of space, and I find the behavior of some of you to be completely anti-intellectual and downright childish. I don't suppose that anyone had my privacy rights in mind when they created the first Quinn entry, but now that I'm here, I think you should all just stop it. I'm voting for a delete, mostly because I think that you should all spend more time reading and seeing theatre.</p>
<p>The protected version of my entry is mostly correct, but I still fail to see why an entry for me exists in the first place. I am a private citizen, albeit one who once had a career on television and who has a career as an entrepreneur. My life is private, which is why davidquinn.com doesn't exist anymore. The biographical information that is found on my corporate sites exists for a simple reason: it answers basic questions for investors and media folks. If I wasn't required to put it up, I wouldn't have it up. My life is primarily dedicated to education. Anyone who has read my bio knows why: I made a promise to someone, and I'm keeping my side of the bargain.</p>
<p>If you want to continue to waste parts of your life on me or this entry, I cannot stop you. But rather than continue this wiki-farce, I urge you to delete this meaningless entry and concentrate your time and karmic energy making the world a better place to live in. Rather than spend all night reverting my bio, why don't you spend all night sending emails to political figures so they hear your voice? Or to relatives, so that they know that they are loved? Or how about just get in your car and go volunteer at a soup kitchen or an AIDS charity? I'm sure that you all have favorite causes. They need your help. Go.</p>

<li>Yes, this is EXACTLY why Ringess has been making sure only information verified is on the article, and nothing "self-verified" by the anonymous IP trying to raise havoc. I do not agree that the article should be deleted, you fall within the guidelines to have an article. We are doing our hardest to only have truthful information.
