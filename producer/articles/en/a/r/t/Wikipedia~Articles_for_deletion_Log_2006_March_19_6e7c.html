<p>I loved this show dearly, having watched every episode aired on the SciFi Channel in the U.S. I even have autographed pictures of two major cast members, Patricia Zentilli and Eva Habermann. In spite of all this, I must say that this article is unencyclopedic fancruft and listcruft and needs to go. I can't think of a single reason to save it, and the existing systemic bias towards science fiction fandom means that we should hold articles on science fiction topics to a very high standard. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<li><i><b>Keep</b></i>. I can't think of a single reason why we should eliminate a list of verifiable episodes from an important TV show.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am going to do the work on the episode guide, as I'm watching the series currently. I can see both sides of the argument. I've looked at the Southpark guide, which is extensive and bulky, but a different form to Star Trek. The problem I've got is that not a lot needs to be said about some episodes of Lexx... yet people talk extensively about other crappy shows. I have no idea how to judge this, as Wiki is expanding rapidly, and soon avi files will end up in here as well. We're obviously devoting more space to Buffy than Shakespeare.

<li><s>Thanks for the comment. This is really infuriating. This is a clear and blatant case of abusing Wikipedia for commercial gain. It's OK when people link to Wikipedia articles as a neutral, objective reference, but a company writing an advertisement on Wikipedia and then linking to it from its own website makes me angry. They already have a website, they can write anything they want there, and advertise themselves as much as they want. What's stopping them from putting the article text <b>on their own bloody website</b>? Or haven't they yet figured out how to make links point at the same website? Are they simply trying to show that they can PWN!

<li><b>Delete</b> The title itself is POV and does not exist in the medical literature or a Lexis/Nexis search of major newspapers. The article history shows it was unsourced POV until it was stubbed a few hours before being nominated. The <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_implant.html" title="Breast implant">breast implant</a> article is pretty short and would probably benefit from an account of the claims, lawsuits, and current evidence (properly sourced). However there is no content worth merging in any past version of Silicone holocaust (unsourced POV) and the title should not be kept as a redirect since it pushes a POV. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 03:09, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete,</b> as not verifiable. Any doctor will tell you that it's impossible to diagnose the dead. Last I checked, Wikipedia wasn't in the business of creating poster children for the autism rights movement. This may be a fine subject for a human interest story in a newspaper or magazine, but it's out of place in an encyclopedia because it is, as its title says, only "speculation." It may be educated speculation on the part of some of the doctors cited, but it's still speculation. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: It is true that Wikipedia does not allow speculation. However, this article is not speculative, it reports the speculation that has been done <i>outside Wikipedia</i>. Someone once suggested that if Wired Magazine said in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> that <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> might have <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger_syndrome.html" title="Asperger syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, then it would be acceptable for someone to write, "In 1999, Wired Magazine speculated that Bill Gates might have Asperger's." Similarly, it should be encyclopediatic to say "<a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_Grandin_cd94.html" title="Temple Grandin">Temple Grandin</a>, PhD. and Arthur Caplan, PhD. speculated that Bill Gates might have traits of Asperger's", since Grandin and Caplan did indeed speculate this, as referenced in the article. I think there are dubious entries like <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>. That is why I tagged it as needing citations. Although it is against Wikipedia's policies to write a controversial claim in Wikipedia, it is not against Wikipedia's policies to write that a certain person or group supports a controversial claim. Similarly, the situation about whether or not <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>, etc. are on the autistic spectrum is a controversial issue (and the speculation about Einstein appears to come up quite a bit in the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_community.html" title="Autistic community">autistic community</a>) so it should be NPOV to state which people think Einstein and Newton are autistic and which people think they are not autistic. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 19:01, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> Why is this in any way better than adding the speculation to the notable person's biography? I can see that medical conditions of famous <i>individuals</i> are a proper filed of historic study (did Napoleon have severe piles, thus arriving at Waterloo shorter of sleep than Wellington, and less mobile?) but I can't see tha that is assisted by the historian having a list of people with piles, running his finger down it and picking out Napoleon to consider biographising.

<li><b>Keep,</b> but remove the large amount of dubious and badly-sourced material in it, and in future apply <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> punctiliously and <i>promptly</i> move unsourced items to the Talk page. There's nothing wrong with reporting well-sourced opinions, and there is some point in localizing this material in a single article than rather than having individual discussions biographies. But. This is a page where the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy needs to be applied punctiliously. I notice that a number of seemingly sourced items have pretty unsatisfactory sources; for example, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Turing_37ec.html" title="Alan Turing">Alan Turing</a> is referenced to a page on a <i>medium</i>-credible website—it's about "sexual health" and the source is an RN with an autistic child, who in turn, cites "Tony Attwood 2000" but does not actually give a reference. Attwood in turn is quoted rather vaguely as saying "Examples of possible 'Asperger's Achievers' are Albert Einstein, Thomas Jefferson, Mozart, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Glenn Gould and Alan Turing ... such illustrious individuals could be valuable heroes to children with Asperger's Syndrome." I don't think that's good enough, <b>particularly</b> since the statement suggests Attwood is motivated by a wish to provide "heroes" to children with Asperger's, rather than a desire for encyclopedic accuracy. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:44, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - as long as Wikipedia is not doing the speculating, it's all right.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: This page is not about Wikipedia or Wikipedians making speculations, but about scientific speculations. This is an acceptable Wiki subject, as it seems to be a genuine area of scientific interest.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article does no speculation. There are many scientists who believe some people in the past have been autistic and the article is about their speculation(which is pretty well known and could be considered quite important) and not the editor's speculations. This article could be useful and as long as everything is cited would not detract from the quality of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 03:33, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I notice some people are saying that even if the speculation is documented speculation from experts it should still be deleted. By this logic, articles on evolution, quantum physics, or religion should be removed as well since not everybody agrees on their truths and being unprovable, they are speculations. Encyclopedias do, however, include articles on science, religion, history, and many other subjects that rely on speculation. As long as the speculation into the possibly autistic nature of historical individuals is well documented speculation from experts and not editors, the fact that this type of speculation exists should be included in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 03:49, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>However likely it may be that evolution is correct(and personally I believe it is), it is still speculation about something that happened millions of years ago.

<p>Not sure which "google" you searched, but I found quite a lot on google.com. I know the alt.fan.adamallard news group has been around for at least 10 years because it was one of the first to be found way back in the archie and veronica days. I don't know much about the "musician" part but I did find something on purevolume.com/adamallard.</p>
<p>I know about him from a technology perspective since that I my field. He was one of the first people to use Java in a large-scale public site... he created the original Pepsi.com in all-Java in 1995. I also know the Plenium company because of the Wired article that Chris Oakes wrote in 1997 about their company and the netdesk thingy.</p>
<p>Just clicking around on other people in wikipedia, its easy for me to find many other people in the main collection that appear to have done much less.</p>
<p><br />
Strong whiff of vanity about this. Googling doesn't unearth much evidence of his notability as a musician or "technologist", and I'm not at all clear what our notability standards for the "visionaries" is. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 05:53, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Oh... heh... sorry. Don't know about how the hits work, just that there's been a lot of talk about it lately among greek comic fans, and it is (as you can see from the website itself) a serious, non-profit endeavour. Other than that, It's been added to comixpedia (by someone nicknamed Nifboy), so even if it's deleted here, that will do I guess...</li>

<li>Do not delete. The article could use more sourcing, including to the articles by the originator of the term, the avatar Prokofy Neva. The hypothesis is not a conspiracy, and in fact is documented here by the author in argumentation concerning media coverage, outsourcing of contract to Wells Fargo, etc. An important element of the history of the Metaverse, and a household vernacular term for the immediate community, Linden Lab, which includes the term in messages of the day, and those analysing the virtual world.</li>
<li><b>Keep/Modify</b> or <b>Merge</b>. Though it may have initially been cruft, its quickly taken on a life of its own in some of the more common vernacular within Second Life, and could be merged into that entry. Alternatively, it could be properly expanded upon to include its possible application among any gaming group (I know of some non-computer games for example which could fit the bill; I'm sure that it could apply to other MMOs or other formats). --TSK 02:15 EDT, 21 Mar '06</li>

<li><b>Commentaire</b> As the article submitter I'd rather leave this nom alone, but let me just say this: AfD stands for "Articles for deletion", not "Articles for merging and redirecting". Merge proposals are to use the {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergefrom_0c79.html" title="Template:Mergefrom">mergefrom</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergeto_cea0.html" title="Template:Mergeto">mergeto</a>}} tags -- one of the reasons why is to invite discussion <u>on the destination article</u>, presumably among those who have a slight idea what the two topics are about.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also, if the "merge and redirect" nomination wins, what is the closing admin to do? Add the merge tags? Execute the merge? Do we want the closing admin to create <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Anatomy_of_the_Body_of_God_c7ac.html" title="Talk:The Anatomy of the Body of God">Talk:The Anatomy of the Body of God</a> and recustomise {{<a href="../../../o/l/d/Template%7EOldafdfull_87e8.html" title="Template:Oldafdfull">oldafdfull</a>}} to "This article was nominated for merging and redirecting on 19 March 2006. The result of the discussion was "merge and redirect"."??</dd>

<li>Upon closer examination, I stand corrected. The tone the article had just suggested it to me. Still, having references is not itself reason to keep it.

<li><b>Keep</b>, don't merge. The article needs to be improved and expanded with other research, but I am confident the normal Wikipedia process will take care of that.

Anybody can file a patent application. This is not recognized as exceptional and this does not make the applicant notable, even if the invention described in the application is unusual. (This may be reconsidered if the patent is granted or if wide publicity is made in the literature about this type of applications for whatever reason). A report in one blog is not enough to make it notable. <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdcolins_06ae.html" title="User:Edcolins">Edcolins</a> 12:42, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I would suggest to <b>keep</b> this article. Im not related whatsoever with mr. Knight but I found the articile very useful.

<dd>I dunno, "naked yoga" into "yoga" makes more sense than merging this into "party". I mean, we wouldn't merge "nudist movement" into "movement" or "naked gun" into "gun" - a naked party is pretty different from a regular party, and has its own purpose. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<dd>I can see your point, but on this particular topic I would disagree as naked party seems to be a variant of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Party.html" title="Party">party</a>. It sounds like a themed party, just like toga party. Are you making a case that a naked party is more distinct from other variants such as "office party" or "dance party"? Its just a dress code just like a toga party or themed dance parties. If I think of something radically distressing, like a suicide party (does it even exist?) or something weird, it would not really fit in to the same general function of having a party, and I thus could see it being kept separate from "party".
<dl>
<dd>I was mostly kidding with the gun/movement analogies, but in seriousness, I think <a href="../../../t/o/g/Toga_party.html" title="Toga party">toga party</a> is worthy of its own article, like "naked party", whereas office parties, dance parties, and birthday parties are more traditional, simple "parties". My standard would basically be this: if a friend simply told you they were "going to a party", would you reasonably assume that they might be going to a naked party? I, for one, might assume that they were talking about an office party or a dance party or a birthday party (depending on the context) - moreover, I'd assume that, were they going to a toga party or a naked party or a costume party (costume parties have their own article at <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masquerade_ball.html" title="Masquerade ball">masquerade ball</a>), they would specify such. I'd be open to well-written and susbstantial articles on "office party" or "dance party", of course, but until then, they seem to fit more comfortably and completely within the standard meaning of, simply, "party". <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<p><b>Delete</b>. Please delete this page, because it had been a victim of vandalism many times in recent days.

<li><b>Comment</b> — I'm not convinced that they are non-notable. Some reviews indicate they have a growing fan base and are one of the better known new bands (in their genre) within the region.

<p>I'm not convinced that the award he has received is sufficiently important to be noteworthy - just about every research area has awards somewhere or other, so winning an award that possibly nobody outside the industry will have heard of isn't a conclusive claim to notability to me.

<dd>I prefer not to enter flame wars, but here I must react on behalf of my good name&#160;:-) I do not "keep reverting the double naming of locations in the article": a) I reverted the article only once; b) I wasn't the first to revert: the first revert was done by <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a>, I just reinforced the revert when <a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EIlir_pz_c0a5.html" title="User:Ilir pz">User:Ilir pz</a> reverted back to his version which I find bordering with vandalism; c) I didn't revert the double naming, what I did can be seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C5%A0ar_mountain&amp;diff=44541376&amp;oldid=44421119" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C5%A0ar_mountain&amp;diff=44541376&amp;oldid=44421119" rel="nofollow">here</a> and I will again point out that I consider removing a name of a country from the article with no prior discussion an act of vandalism.

<p>List is entirely speculative as the title and the introduction blatantly say.

<li><b>Strongly Delete</b>. This article is nothing more than a way to imply notible figures in history were infected with STDs. When information is factually verifiable, write such an article. Otherwise we could speculate anyone died of syphilis and associate their name with such defamation.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see a bunch of references and medical conditions of famous figures, Napoleon being an example that springs to mind, are frequently discussed by serious historians (see Hayden's book on historical syphilis <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465028810/002-8956940-2924812?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465028810/002-8956940-2924812?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>). Often, there is a fair bit of evidence, which combined with modern techniques (DNA testing), goes well beyond simple speculation. While this list needs more footnoting, there is no reason to remove it. Also, to state that speculation has no place on wikipedia is a bit of a joke given that we have hundreds of articles on conspiracy theories or other oddities such as <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Sightings_82ba.html" title="Elvis Sightings">Elvis Sightings</a>.

Taking a random selection, I find direct discussions or speculation of possible syphilitic infection in our bios of <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenin.html" title="Lenin">Lenin</a>, <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idi_Amin_4bbc.html" title="Idi Amin">Idi Amin</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Gogh_78b2.html" title="Van Gogh">Van Gogh</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Capone_36a3.html" title="Al Capone">Al Capone</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Hughes_c1be.html" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Joplin_b29a.html" title="Scott Joplin">Scott Joplin</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Allan_Poe_4636.html" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> , to name just a few.

Are people really suggesting that we eliminate discussion of syphilis as a possible explanation of the irrational behavior of a Van Gogh or Idi Amin, even when major historians openly discuss the historical evidence in biographies and other scholarly works? Are people really arguing that we eliminate any discussion of medical conditions unless medical records have been released into the public domain?

<li>In each of those articles, there are editors familiar with the subject, who will actively challenge any bogus information. However, bio editors are generally unaware of a person being on a list like this. Lists like this often have editors who like to add as many people as possible, and get little scrutiny. You would help your cause if you explained what the minimum criteria for the list is. Is any published rumor sufficient (how about tabloids)? Also, we do have to consider Wikipedia's history with lists like this. They simply aren't maintained properly, and people will inevitable add inappropriate names (hard to stop, if you don't define what's inappropriate). Only lists with absolutely clear criteria can be maintained properly. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 00:08, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Yes, I see your point, but those seem fairly unconvincing arguments for deletion and relate more to editing problems than the underlying validity of the concept. They also join with what I said above about the list requiring more footnotes, which is how we have dealt with the problem on numerous other lists. However, to a very great extent this list was compiled directly from the bio pages. Your issue with the tabloids is not very applicable in this context, because tabloids do not pick up these types of stories unless someone has just published a book or released new evidence- and even then the coverage would be marginal because Edgar Allen Poe is not Paris Hilton. It seems that you are more concerned with some ill defined risk factor a la Siegenthaler. Considering that everyone on this list is dead, most for a very long time, I think the risk is lessened. I also think that the list at present is fairly well maintained. It is relatively short, despite having been spun out from <a href="../../../s/y/p/Syphilis.html" title="Syphilis">Syphilis</a> almost two years ago, and while there are a few names I would question, I don't see it spinning out of control in the near future. In my view, it needs a minor rethink and direct sourcing of every component (rather than the general references at present) not deletion.-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:35, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I should not have said "tabloid". I should have said "tabloid level" writers. The only *true* expert opinion of the article is "<i>Hayden was not competent to make the judgments that she tried to make.</i>" Every name on the list (except Hitler) relies on discredited source (I admit more sources are easily available for some). As you say, the article's been around a long time. So, I doubt this will be fixed soon. I think we both agree proper detailed citations are appropriate. But, where we disagree, is I think they are needed when such information is added, and may be removed when it lacks it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:35, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>:Calling Hayden a "tabloid level" writer is way, way too harsh. An enormous amount of research went into her book, the reviews were largely positive and she is a university lecturer on the topic. She has been criticized because she is not a medical Dr, but that by no means makes her a discredited source. Very few historians working on the history of medecine are Doctors. In any case, you should note that many of the bio articles either lack sources or do not source information on medical conditions. However, I don't believe it would be particularly difficult to add references for many of the names on the list without relying on Hayden at all. Despite what most people think, lists often end up far more bulletproof in terms of verification than the standard bio or other articles. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:06, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If she got good reviews, from experts, those should have been in article's "Background" section. Better yet, an article should have been made on her and/or the book. In fact such an article would be quite interesting, and could even name of few of the more famous cases (that others have said similiar things on). Such a bio article would be quite useful, as a NPOV discussion of her approach (citing favorable and unfavorable reviews). It would actually be more useful than this list article. Also, you're quite right that many bio articles put medical problems of people without references. The solution is to remove the unsourced information. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:42, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't let me stop you from starting new articles. An article on Hayden would be good, but the list is not about Hayden and she did not invent scholarship in this area. Also if you think that the solution is to remove unsourced information, there are thousands of articles on major figures that you can start blanking. I would suggest, though, that you begin with the unreferenced tag. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:59, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I see your point here, but this show is unique to this station. 11 o'clock news is not. The comparison isn't really appropiate.

<li>My point is that there's no aricle on things like KDKA-TV's 11 o'clock news (which WOULD be a unique to the same station). Many individual programs on individual local stations aren't independently notable. An article on the "genre" or phenomena of shows of a given type might be valuable or the page on the station might include some examples of content. In this context, I think the 11 o'clock news article is good in that it is general. Perhaps an article on local quiz shows? --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 18:24, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"""DO NOT DELETE""" Personally I can see why this article comes off as non-notable and vain puffery but at the same time since it is indeed art we are talking about many notable artists engage in vain puffery and in many ways it is part of their art. Furthermore I do not believe this article should be deleted since it is true in nature and interesting...at least to some. I do not believe Wikipedia is the kind of website which allows articles to be deleted simply because some people don’t like the way it is written. The issues at hand are not ones of validity or inappropriate content, simply that someone decided they do not like the article.

<p>I just so happened to stumble across this article accidentally and, having never seen an entry marked for deletion decided to speak my piece. While you may call this “vain puffery” I pose this question to you. Who has a life pathetic enough to waste time ripping down an aspiring artist? In all seriousness, I believe it would be highly beneficial if you walked outside, experienced the beauty away from your computer screen and then (dare I say?) have physical contact with another being. While I do chide, I am serious in saying that this young Andrei does seem to have the keen eye needed for successful life photography. You, being a person who embracing electronic information can surely understand the need for promotion and how the Internet can be a useful tool in aiding a career of any sort. I’m sure you have your uses for the web as well, such as uploading pictures of the children you molest or masturbating to bestiality movies. I’m sorry to be so coarse, however why have you taken it upon yourself to attempt to stifle the next generation of American artist? I see you as a vile being, not worthy of critiquing anything except for the child porn, which I am almost certain you produce. Good day sir, I have nothing more to say to someone with such a scatological psyche. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by JFreshman (<a href="../../../j/f/r/User_talk%7EJFreshman_52fc.html" title="User talk:JFreshman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JFreshman_8e3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/JFreshman">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

Well I think this isn’t a discussion as much as a charade, a smoke and dagger case against an innocent man. Yes a man, who simply wants to show his artistic side, is it so hard to accept, does it hurt you to see this Man have even the tiniest amount of happiness? What is so horrible about your life that you must constantly attack outwards at others in order to make yourself look and feel better? This is not China no matter how much you might want it to be. Google does not limit the searches of these free people of the United States of America. If you want to oppress personal expression, freedom of speech, and creativity than perhaps you should consider moving to China, they are quite proficient at that. I for one plan on staying right here in the good ol’ US of A where freedom reigns no matter how many countries we have to bomb to keep it that way.

Keep it! you can't just get rid of something because you think it's "not-notable." as an encyclopedia you are supposed to be nutral and to label something like that is obviously giving it a bias. this article should be kept, and who do you think you are to decide whether or not something is notable anyway? <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Beatrixcastle (<a href="../../../b/e/a/User_talk%7EBeatrixcastle_b974.html" title="User talk:Beatrixcastle">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beatrixcastle_54ce.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beatrixcastle">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I just went thru and identified some unsigned posts and commented on users without significant contribution histories.

<li>Three years old, does carry an audience on the net, and I haven't heard any grounds for deletion that appear reasonable other than the per nom which I assume has to do with the policy. The newest post on Newgrounds is a social commentary that I find pretty good, similar to the battle between "Cyanide and Happiness" with "Top Web Comics".

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>Comment</b>. To justify my deletion vote I just want to say that even if it will become notable it doesn't mean it is now. Joseph Blanchette aka Legendary Frog had his entry removed despite being several times more famous than "Fred the monkey". My comment is, the creator of Fred the monkey has started a campaign to make sure his entry doesn't get deleted, through a flash movie submitted to newgrounds.com and probably elsewehere as well where he tells people to go to Wikipedia and "tell them to shut their stupid faces" (and a clickable link that leads to the Fred the Monkey entry). This surely explains the many recent unsigned "Keep" votes. I am appaled by the creator of "fred the monkey"'s lack of understanding for what wikipedia stands for (it's an encyclopedia and not a showcase for up and coming artists) and I think this move makes it much harder to hold a fair vote, which I think in the end will only weigh FOR the deletion of this article. Here's the animation on Newgrounds: <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/302151" class="external text" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/302151" rel="nofollow">Fred the notable monkey</a><a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 11:44, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yet another <b>Comment</b>: There is not only a single (1) google hit on "fredthemonkey.com", search for any page name and you'll only get one result. From there you click "Find web pages that contain the term "fredthemonkey.com"". This gives 243 hits (note, by looking on the first page of results I get the impression that many of them are created by the maker himself). This does however, in my opionion, doesn't change anything. I'd vote "delete" if it had 10 000 hits. In fact, my own flash game "Shotgun Orc" comes up with 30,000-65,000 hits on google (currently 65,000), but I wouldn't dream of suggesting an entry to be made for it and if somebody did make one I would definately nominate it for deletion myself. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 12:12, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I feel that this precedent should be challenged, as it is a product of simple anti-mall cultural bias. Large malls are more notable than most museums documented on Wikipedia - I don't particularly love them, but malls are very notable local institutions and centers of commerce. Simple distaste for the subject, and a view that different instances of the subject are a bit samey...does not suffice as a criterion for deletion when the subject is of clear note. The massive size of many individual malls makes them features in the lives of millions or hundreds of thousands of people and clearly notable. Anyone who has a similar opinion of this precedent (i.e. that it excludes notable institutions from the encyclopedia due to cultural bias), let's begin opposing it here. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Encyclopedias are reference books that deal with all fields of knowledge (the word comes from the Greek words <i>enkyklios paideia,</i> meaning general or well-rounded education). Since Wikipedia doesn't have very many size constraints, we can include a lot of stuff. Also, I'm not sure it's worth destroying someone else's work and alienating that person--who could be a contributor to other articles as well--over an issue as uncertain as notability. Something increadibly notable to a physicist may be non-notable to a chemist, for example.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 21:07, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> the recent spate of mall AfD's is an example of an anti-mall cultural bias, as are any anti-mall precedents in deletion policy. I strongly feel that Wikipedia is being kept from covering many massive, notable, quasi-permanent commercial institutions (many of which are important features in the lives of hundreds of thousands or even millions of people - entire communities!) simply because of cultural bias. I am not a huge mall-lover myself, but most large malls are more notable than many of the small museums that wikipedia covers, and are treated differently mainly because they are seen as distasteful or dislikeable. Wikipedia should not censor or delete an entire category of information (we already cover a number of malls), information that is relevant and important to an electronic encyclopedia, simply because some people find that subject a bit crass. Covering individual malls is not comparable to, say, covering individual Wal-Mart stores (which should not be done), because each mall is different. The layout, location, and composition of a mall is important geographic and cultural information. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<li><b>Comment</b> Bobby, if you want to propose a standard for what malls should be kept, we might listen. Note that I take slight issue with the comparison to wallmart, many malls have roughly the same level of notability (especially compared to a wallmart in a small town). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 22:37, 20 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd agree that Wal-Marts often have the same notability as a smallish-medium mall, but having articles on individual Wal-Marts would be hard, given how they're all so alike. Malls may superficially seem to be alike but they often have different store compositions based on the size and affluence of the community, and they also sometimes have interesting quirks in architecture and layout. A provisional proposal for a notability standard might run along the lines of: 1.) Must be of sufficient size and stability (relative to the surrounding community) to be a major and central commercial institution in a given geographical area, 2.) Must have 20+ stores (a somewhat arbitrary number; we can obviously work on that), 3.) Must have some possibility for documenting the composition of the mall, in terms of constituent stores (as this is the heart of the usefulness of an article), 4.) Must have the possibility for some description of the layout, architecture, and type of the mall. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<li><b>Keep</b>. All malls should have articles here because they are the local landmarks of our times, often replacing <a href="../../../m/a/i/Main_Street_ce07.html" title="Main Street">Main Street</a> or <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_square.html" title="Town square">town square</a>.

Too many people love to talk, read or write about them for us to play silly games and try to exclude them.

<li><b>Keep it</b> Obviously, I'm guessing from your lack of responses, that you are stumped. Here's something else that I think I'll just throw in your face...Notice that I made another paragraph that was titled "see also". If I was really trying to promote this cartoon, explain to me why I would include links in the artical about OTHER cartoons. Hmmm???<b>wilmat09</b></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The author admits this was his own creation and if this was a notable cartoon Google or Yahoo would turn up SOME trace of it or where it was published. This does not meet the guidelines for importance even if the author feels it does. If the website is under construction and this was a NOTABLE cartoon, it would have turned up a trace of it regardless of website status as Google and Yahoo bots find pages over a period of time, not right away. This is self promotion and is not the place for this. Showtime203 03:36, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>speedy delete and userfy</b>. I'm not sure if it was a mistaken userpage because the article title doesn't match the username exactly, but I couldn't find much of a claim to notability here. Author claims to be a founder of some Pagan traditions but didn't explain their importance, and admitted in a few places that her groups had memberships of only about 6 to 25 people. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">The Republic Restored</a></small> 10:41, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> This seems a strong delete, I'm afraid. There is another Karl Schröder, also a musician (cellist, d. 1935), to whom most of the websites are devoted.

<p>The first paragraph says it all: "a relatively new term" found on "web pages including blogs, chat forums and other informational resources". I.e., a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a> that was even invented on a web forum <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christ-Psychosis&amp;oldid=42886705" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christ-Psychosis&amp;oldid=42886705" rel="nofollow">(see this old version)</a> and is also <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unsourced</a>. It seems to me that a controversial notion such as pathologising religion would need a lot more mainstream and professional usage, and sources, before becoming encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 23:09, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. 1. 'No activity' is not on itself ground for deletion; at best it can be a counter-counterpoint when deletion is proposed on quality grounds, and there is a keep vote because it could be improved; even in such a case it's still just about the weakest of arguments. 2. There isn't even a lack of activity; last edit was 2 1/2 months ago. Last major edit (including a real edit war) 5 months ago. That's not by any stretch long for a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../a/n/c/Special%7EAncientpages_6b0b.html" title="Special:Ancientpages">Special:Ancientpages</a> gives the articles longest not edited (including minor edits); the 1000 pages with least activity have not been edited for over 1 1/2 years.

<li><b>Keep</b> What type of notability should I provide? It is a small following and if you were to actually play the game, it would make sense. It has been played as a CRUD alternative especially for people who do not wish to engage in drunk shoving. It has a loyal following among the people that play it. It obviously lacks the attention of games like CRUD or baseball, but that doesn't make it any less of a game in my opinion. If a google search is the only measure you're judging this on, then why not just google evevrything you want to know about instead of wikipedianing? If you want me to get other people who have played the game to edit the article or something to prove that I didn't waste hours of my time writing some nonsense, I can do that. I feel like just because something isn't well known or still a new version of an older game, that doesn't mean it is useless. Bounce Two is a basketball game that a lot of people play that google doesn't list, yet you all have probably heard of it and played it. I spent time on this game and this article and I'd hate to see it deleted just because it's so new.</li>

<p>This is a legit article about a legit game. I spent many of my boyhood hours engaging in this good, wholesome activity. Fun for everyone! Maybe instead of complaining and trying to get it deleted, you all should try playing it and stop being negative nancies.</p>
<p><br />
This is a great game. You should at least try playing before you discount it. A fantastic way to have fun indoors with a larger group of people than a normal game of pool can handle. Keep 03:09, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's been played by students at Dartmouth College for a few years now. Not sure how it got from NY to NH, but it did. It's important to have standardized rules for a game that's spreading, and to know a bit about its origins.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This game was extremely fun, and still is, and I have taught it to a few people at the University of Richmond. It was competed in very intensely in Hamilton, all throughout higfh school, and resulted in, among other things, broken windows and ripped pants. This article really made me want to play it again.</li>

Also the existence of other non-notable articles should not act as precedent for the inclusion of this one. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></small> 21:41, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> All student a cappella groups have constantly fluctuating membership. After all, they're composed of students, who graduate and leave the school. This hasn't been seen as grounds for deletion for any of the other collegiate a cappella groups' entries, so I see how this could fairly be grounds for deletion in this case either. Granted, some cleanup is necessary, but deletion seems harsh.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the group has won national recognition. The ICCAs is one of the two biggest a cappella contests in the country (the other being BOCA). Winning recognition in this contest is a significant accomplishment, especially for so young a group. The group is also notable in that it has performed in many states, and with many of the nation's best a cappella groups. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Annelisep (<a href="../../../a/n/n/User_talk%7EAnnelisep_00b0.html" title="User talk:Annelisep">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Annelisep_b787.html" title="Special:Contributions/Annelisep">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
