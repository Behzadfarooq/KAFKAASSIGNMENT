<li><b>Weak keep</b> but needs improvement. This is not actually POV, it does handle both sides, but it's a pretty rough article overall. The controversy is non-trivial and there are reasonable critics of the vehicle's concept, execution, and mission, even though there's a very noisy unreasonable claque as well. My major concern with deletion is how this would fit back into the culture, as it were, of the main Stryker article. Is the split intended to create a ghetto for criticism? Would edit warring over merging this info back into the main article be disruptive? --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 19:59, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>It was edit warring and various non-notable entries that causes the POV fork. For example the old wheeled vs tracked debate has nothing to do with the Stryker and has no place in the main article, but in a POV fork there are less editors to look over the content. This isn't FAS or military equipment forum about 50% of the content (of both sides) would be have to be dropped to be encylopedic. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 23:17, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't understand what the problem with a look at the pros and cons of the issue within context of the design are. This has become a matter of serious debate within the US Armed Forces and has become a prime example of similar debates that are currently being engaged in around the world. The Stryker contorversy is more formal because of congressional reports, mass media coverage, and various official responses from the military. It needs to be discussed in more depth than was allowable under an encyclopedic entry dedicated to the vehicle, which is why I created the SVC page in the first place. It was detracting from the Stryker page and had turned it into an edit war over this devisive issue. Delete the SVC article and you'll watch the Stryker article degenerate right back into this. There needs to be a dumping ground for this, and it shouldn't be on the Stryker page. -- <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatguy96_05dc.html" title="User:Thatguy96">Thatguy96</a> 20:32, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very weak keep</b> I don't think it has very serious POV problems, but it need some serious tightning up. When that is done, I suspect it will be down to a length where it could safely be merged back into the main.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Not so much a fork as Just Too Much to leave in the main article.

<li><b>Keep</b> While born of the Stryker article, this page has grown to take on its own life. Since the US Army's top brass, the GAO, the US Congress, and the soldiers actually using this vehicle have all thoroughly reviewed it, liked it, and its still being bought and used, then there should not be as much controversy. However, there will always be those who disagree, but their detailed arguements should not be listed in the main article. Second, many other vehicles' performance capabilities (including the M2 Bradley, the M113, and the C130 <i>aircraft</i>) are being discussed in this article, and that should not appear in an encyclopedic article on the Stryker. Third, the Stryker is not the only military vehicle whose controversy has spun off into its own life. For example, the problems in the launching of the M2 Bradley eventually became an HBO movie.--Vstr 13:39, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would venture to say its because there is a serious debate about the benefits of a Stryker type system in the field. The V-22 represents a universally accepted capability enhancement. The major issue with the V-22 was whether it was worth dumping so much into it if they couldn't get it to work. Now that they essentially have, people are glad to see it start being deployed more or less on the whole. -- <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatguy96_05dc.html" title="User:Thatguy96">Thatguy96</a> 21:07, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep or merge back with the original Stryker article</b> It's funny that because there was <b>so many</b> criticisms of the Stryker vehicle on the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stryker.html" title="Stryker">Stryker</a> article, the criticisms had to be moved to it's own article. Then once it gets moved to it's own artice it becomes a POV issue (something that wasn't so much of an issue when it was part of the Stryker article because both sides were represented.) So some people don't want the criticisms at the Stryker article, and don't want it on it's own article either. Could it be that there are people who just don't want these criticisms being published? They are valid criticisms nonetheless. So far I'm seeing 7-2 Keep. -- 24.118.89.238 4 Sept, 2006</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notable and well-referenced article describing the debate surrounding the adoption of the vehicle and the advantages and disadvantages of it. Hrimfaxi 11:03, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> As an Iraq war veteran, I can attest that these criticisms <b>are</b> valid. Although I was never on a Stryker, I did play OPFOR against the 172d infantry (who uses strykers) at a <a href="../../../j/r/t/JRTC_1d4c.html" title="JRTC">JRTC</a> rotation, and I know from experience that these things are a total waste of money. Can't shoot on the move, large blind spots, no RPG protection, no off road capability, and it's too heavey to be carried by a C-130 (which was its original purpose). I'm new to Wikipedia, so I'm going to leave the editing to someone more experienced. As you can tell, I'm pretty biased here. But I'm only biased here because my fellow soldiers are dying because of this piece of shit. Who even put this up for deletion? Is silencing criticism "supporting the troops"?
