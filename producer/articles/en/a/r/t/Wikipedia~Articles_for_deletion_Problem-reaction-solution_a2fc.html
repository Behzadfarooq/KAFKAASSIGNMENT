<p>The result was <b>DELETED</b>. This title is a neologism being pushed by a source that doesn't come close to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>, with extremely tenative links to writers who are already on the fringe (most of which seem to be of the form "David Icke once linked to the site that coined this term").

<p>This AFD does not preclude a differently-titled article, sourced to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, about the sociopolitical concept of creating a problem in order to justify "solving" that problem (such as fabricating a war to declare martial law). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Blâ™Ÿck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:03, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. While this term may be relatively new, this is not a new concept. The article is about a power play that has been attempted throughout history, with only a few notable successes. In grade 11 economics, my class discussed similar strategies for macroeconomics, but I havent been able to find a more common term for the concept; if there is an exiting politics article for the same, I wouldnt mind if this article should be merged into another. Personally I think that this page would be a good list of possibly unverifiable attempts of any government to attempt this type of thing. The article currently focuses on current, more questionable attempts, but that can be corrected by expanding the list into earlier centuries, and by including more failures to balance the POV. IMO this doesn't classify as original research in entirety: the term isnt coined by the contributor; for most of the examples, there is external opinion that this strategy was employed (of course it is un-cited in many cases but that doesnt mean it was original research); while it may be a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologisms</a>, it is worth including in Wikipedia as a record of either peoples perceptions or reality -- a rename or merge would solve this aspect of the problem. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">Jayvdb</a> 14:34, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. An article about such a controversial subject area should <i>report</i> opinions but not <i>adopt</i> them. This article meets that test. Furthermore, it attributes the opinions to the people who hold them, and provides verifiable sources for the assertion that they hold those opinions. Keep the article, but make sure that links to this article don't start sprouting all over the place (e.g., in <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichstag_Fire_34a3.html" title="Reichstag Fire">Reichstag Fire</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_of_Tonkin_Incident_a0b8.html" title="Gulf of Tonkin Incident">Gulf of Tonkin Incident</a>, and other alleged examples). Merger into <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_blog.html" title="Political blog">Political blog</a> would be inappropriate because that article can't accommodate this level of detail about all the different subjects that are discussed on political blogs. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 16:16, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> Claims of orignial research, non-verifiability and unrelibale sources are <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLLOCKS_9aa6.html" title="WP:BOLLOCKS">complete bollocks</a>, everything is stated as the <b>beliefs of individuals</b>, everything is <b>sourced to those individuals</b> and nothing is OR.

<dd>Reliable sources for non-mainstream topics exist all the time. For example, one can easily find articles in the New York Times that discuss creationism. One can find a few articles that mention the 9/11 conspiracy theories and full articles discussing the claim that the previous US presidential election was rigged. David Ickes himself has been reported in multiple major newspapers. However, this term has not made it into the mainstream enough for such sources to exist. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:30, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Badgering each and every repsonse here will do you no favours.

We're not here to mirror somebody elses views and website.

<dd>I am expecting a real arguement, and are not content accepting empty unspecified references to some wikipolicy. "Regardless of the source the article is nonsense anyway"? Then why does it get 38000 google hits? Oh, you mean you dont like the consept? No problem, you dont need to, we have articles on both <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">Atheism</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deism.html" title="Deism">Deism</a>, and im sure you regard one of them as "nonsense". There <b>are</b> multiple good sources. This is a <b>minority</b> consept, you expect to have New Your Times as references for a minority consept? That is ridiculuous, then we could just as well delete most of the wikipedia non-mainstream articles. We do not need a single mainstream reference to represent the views of a minority, and that is a fact. As for your quotestions, they are editorial in nature, ask them on the talk page and we can work it out. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 18:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> ... unless you need the space for more relevant articles. This <i>is</i> a concept which is out there and a page detailing it <i>does</i> give an overview of the concept. Simply because the concept fails to hold to <i>any</i> Popperian sensibility, does not mean that people will not need to be briefed on the concept. It is better defined here, where neutral and contrary people can get to it and make comment on it, than leaving it for people to read a bunch of conspiracy theorists when all they may want is the gist of the concept. It works the same way that it might be more helpful for people to get a rundown of the <i>Elders of Zion</i> than to read the thing. There is a large difference between the representation of a concept and claiming it is factual. <i>Elders</i> is not reputed to be factual, nor for that matter is considered well-researched or any of those other criteria people are claiming this needs to have. And yet, I would bet you have it here. Not because it is <i>factual</i> but because you are detailing the thing itself: a book or concept. As long as the article doesn't look like Icke and Jones could have written it, it really shouldn't be a problem. Otherwise I echo Sertrel and a couple others. Spoon!!</li>

<dd>Another one just spaming links and hoping some will pass. Wikipedia NOR does not stop any other representations of minority views, and there are only opinions stated in the article, an all the sources are used to show who holds the opinions. There is <b>still</b> no one that has explained with a <b>good arguement</b> why RS is relevant to quoting a <b>opinion</b> from the opinion holder. Is there anyone <i>doubting</i> that the people quoted hold those opinions? No? Then i gues there is no unreliablity in the sources. As simple as that.

It is not a neologism if it was used PROMINENTLY in a University in 1999, and is growingly used now in 2006.

Afd's is not the way to correct content disputes. You just cited it being used in 1998 by somebody else than Icke, this totaly demolishes the neology claim.

<li><b>Keep</b> as notable conspiracy terminology, found in conspiracy sources. If anyone hasn't noticed, the term conspiracy theory is being used in the media more and more every day, the NYTimes, Chicago Tribune, CSPAN, on every right-winger soap box trying to trash them, etc. While many may want to make CTs go away, they are instead growing more popular by the second, and like it or not, Alex Jones is also growing in popularity by the instant. The question one may ask is why. But if we are denied the info to do proper research about who they are and what they are saying and why, at places like wikipedia, we won't be making the CTs go away, we just will understand them less. I don't agree with anything from Icke and don't especially adore Jones, but there is a massive gravitating towards CTs for a reason. Is it because the public knows they are being lied to, as the Pentagon just showed us? Or is something else going on.

If <a href="../../../e/d/o/User%7EEdogy_ea37.html" title="User:Edogy">Edogy</a> wants to give us his 50 cents on the matter (although not stated very neutrally, he brings up a valid point, that of possible bad faith in the nomination), he should not be reacted upon like this. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li><b>Comment</b> I take exception to the accusation (or pondering aloud, or whatever) of the nomination being in bad faith. Both previous times the article was kept because there was <b>no consensus</b>, because the discussions were absolutely inundated with sockpuppets and/or "single purpose accounts". It is <i>not</i> as if the Wikipedia community unanimously decided to keep it. The bottom line is that the article is of circumspect validity, and <i>that</i> is why I nominated it. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 20:40, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And <b>I</b> take exception to the continual attempts to discredit those who want to keep it. Reinoutr is quite right, this isn't a vote, and everyone is entitled to a say. As you know, where there is no consensus we keep articles. If you have a problem with that, I suggest you raise it at the relevant policy page. Oh, and "circumspect" doesn't mean what you seem to think it means<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/04/04.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/04/04.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 20:46, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not trying to discredit anyone here: remember that, in my nomination, I stated clearly that this isn't a vote. I was merely pointing out that this isn't a bad faith nomination, and that previous AfDs didn't have "keep" results, but "no consensus", rather. I have no problem with that either: I was merely clarifying my own motivations, which I am entitled to do, am I not?</dd>
<dd>And "circumspect" means <i>exactly</i> what I think it means, thankyouverymuch (said Humpty Dumpty to Alice). Maybe "dictionary.com" doesn't think so, but I just looked it up in a <i>real</i> dictionary (you know, with pages?), and am satisfied that I used it correctly. Please be more circumspect when attempting to correct people, and look up the term "<a href="../../../t/r/a/Transferred_epithet.html" title="Transferred epithet">transferred epithet</a>" (and if you look carefully enough, you might find a very small case of <a href="../../../z/e/u/Zeugma.html" title="Zeugma">zeugma</a> back there somewhere: life's too short to use language plainly, don't you think?)&#160;: P</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, Striver has been very busy arguing with every "delete vote" - not that I blame him (on the contrary), but let's not start employing double standards, shall we? <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 21:23, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I <i>never</i> stated that I felt the nomination was in bad faith and that certainly is not my opinion. I stated that Edogy made a valid argument in a discussion and that it therefore is not fair to treat him as a sockpuppet just because he has only few edits. And yes, I also feel that Striver is overdoing it with regard to commenting on <i>every</i> delete vote. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.
