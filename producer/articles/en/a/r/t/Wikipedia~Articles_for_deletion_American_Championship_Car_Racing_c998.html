<p>From what I can tell, this article is about whichever open-wheel racing series was most popular at the time in the US (note that there has never been anything called "American Championship Car Racing"). Organizing this information like this is borderline <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. It could be split or merged into about a half-dozen different articles, but it would be better to just delete it so people can concentrate on contributing to the articles on the individual series. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 16:23, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Rename</b> to something like History of Open Wheel Racing in the U.S., unless something like that already exists. The strife between the series is very notable, and it would be nice to have the transistions between series in one place. Plus, the article is a very good start and could be improved. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogicaldisaster_a8d3.html" title="User:Logicaldisaster">Logicaldisaster</a> 23:58, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - but rename and expand per Logicaldisaster. We do need a Wikipedia article about the very convoluted and contentious internecine warfare that has dogged big-time open-wheel racing in America since the 1970s. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 02:10, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Typically, we give a reason why or at least say "per" whoever we agree with. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 13:55, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - This article is the page for generic information about Championship Car racing and the place to link to when not wanting to link to one specific series. Without this, text in articles would be more unwieldy as multiple links and over-explanation would need to be added to them. Closer reading of the article will show that is not about the "racing series (that) was most popular at the time", but rather the evolution as <a href="../../../a/a/a/AAA_e1fa.html" title="AAA">AAA</a> was the sanctioning body from 1909-1955, followed by <a href="../../../u/s/a/USAC_8a8d.html" title="USAC">USAC</a> 1956-1978, battle/evolution to <a href="../../../c/a/r/CART_0ea7.html" title="CART">CART</a> in 1979-1980 and then the famous <a href="../../../i/r/l/IRL_9d17.html" title="IRL">IRL</a> split in 1996. A driver who raced across these transitions would need additional article text. You should note that &gt;100 drivers link to this page through a redirect of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Championship_Car_857f.html" title="Championship Car">Championship Car</a>. If a rename is necessary, I suggest that the redirect be reversed, but I feel that this should not be done here, but rather via a poll on the article talk page. BTW, "Open Wheel" is not appropriate, as that topic is too generic, including F1, sprint car and midget car as well. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G_856f.html" title="User:Brian G">Brian G</a> 03:29, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only source I can find that calls it "Championship Car" is <a href="http://www.rumbledrome.com" class="external text" title="http://www.rumbledrome.com" rel="nofollow">rumbledrome.com</a>, which in fact calls it "American Championship Car Racing" exactly (same author?). Most of the other results are referring to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champ_Car_ed74.html" title="Champ Car">Champ Car</a>. Are there other, more reliable sources for this term that I am missing? <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 04:43, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep and possible Rename</b>. The article spans the gap between the different sanctioning bodies that sanctioned a "breed" of cars called Champ cars or Indy cars. The article name isn't very good. I go with Brian G's suggestion of "Championship Car racing", or with the rename to the redirected "Championship Car". --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil">Royalbroil</a> 04:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> For over 70 years the series was/were referred to as "Championship Car" and I wouldn't be opposed to a rename to that. Anyone familiar with the subject would agree that no article on an individual series could adequately describe the history of this series and race lineage. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Economaki_644a.html" title="Chris Economaki">Chris Economaki</a> still refers to open wheel racing as "Championship Car". -<a href="../../../d/r/d/User%7EDrdisque_8d32.html" title="User:Drdisque">Drdisque</a> 06:03, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. There needs to be a central article that people who aren't aware of the convoluted history of the top level of American single seater racing can go to - articles on CART, IRL and the rest should be daughter articles from here. I also support the proposal that there should be <i>consideration</i> of a rename, but I don't have sufficient background in US racing to help much in deciding what it should be. Ideally this article should be called whatever it is that Joe or Joanne Public is most likely to type in when searching for 'the top single seater series in the US'. I've got a nasty feeling that would be 'Indycar' however, which takes us right back into the IRL/CART split. Maybe each daughter article could have a brief explanation at the top: "This article covers the history of the Indy Racing League (or whatever). The overall history of top level single seater racing in the US is given at (Insert name here)". <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 30 July</li>

<dd>So why don't you think it should go to <a href="../../../i/n/d/IndyCar_c755.html" title="IndyCar">IndyCar</a>? That actually seems like a pretty good idea to me. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 12:36, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Both <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champ_Car_ed74.html" title="Champ Car">Champ Car</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/IndyCar_c755.html" title="IndyCar">IndyCar</a> are now more specifically used to refer to the <b>Champ Car World Series</b> (formerly CART) and <b>Indy Racing League</b> respectively. In fact, the IndyCar is now owned by the IRL. I believe that <b>Championship Car</b> is the proper term to use for a generic reference. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G_856f.html" title="User:Brian G">Brian G</a> 13:55, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
