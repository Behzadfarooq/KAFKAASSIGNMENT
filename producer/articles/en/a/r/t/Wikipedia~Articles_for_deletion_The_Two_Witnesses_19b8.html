<p>Tagged for speedy as empty but is not. I would say this is excessive treatment of a single mention in a single verse of the Bible. "The two witnesses" is not a widely discussed topic, I think. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:56, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. A Google search of "two witnesses revelation 11' yields over 1.5 million results. The "two witnesses" are the subject of much discussion amongst the "<a href="../../../e/n/d/End_times.html" title="End times">End times</a>" movement. The article as it stands could use a substantial rewrite, but it is a valid topic. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Mob_Rules_da6c.html" title="User:The Mob Rules">The Mob Rules</a> 14:27, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - seems reasonable. Article really needs improvement though. Virtually any significant character or concept from the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> is probably notable (with the possible exception of names that appear solely in <i>begats</i>). Compare to other minor mythological characters like <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charybdis.html" title="Charybdis">Charybdis</a>. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 14:50, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The two witnesses are important characters in prophecy and should have a separate article, they also occur in fiction as well as in Revelation. True the article needs quite a bit more work. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraeme_Bartlett_d267.html" title="User:Graeme Bartlett">Graeme Bartlett</a> (<a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraeme_Bartlett_2d61.html" title="User talk:Graeme Bartlett">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Graeme_Bartlett_556b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Graeme Bartlett">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm one of the researchers of the article - I'm an educator/administrator in the public high schools here in California - also, I maintain several web sites which deal with eschatological issues (small traffic, around 15,000 hits per day or 1,000 visitors per day) - Now, what I have done here is to elicit some input on the topic - a topic that is exceedingly significant in the scheme of eschatological-biblical subject matter (It will NOT be a waste of time and interest . . . the exposure of this topic will be staggering - you wait and see.) I intend to bring scores of authors, theologians, etc. into the arena. Not only will it involve Christians of all stripes - but the nation of Israel and those of Jewish ancestry - the "theological history" of this topic is staggering! Therefore, I, along with a number of others will input into the topic - and, I am pleasantly surprised that no one, up to this juncture, has dared to enter into this most significant eschatological topic: THE TWO WITNESSES - who they are (from a wide-variety of propositions) and why, when, and where they will accomplish their witness. Bear with me - by the time this is completed, it will have geo-political ramifications of immense priority - and it will be fair and balanced in its presentation (viz., objective). Thank you for your indulgence - I/we hope to have all the material integrated into the topic within the week. The "Two Witness Crew" (all 10 of us!).... and, incidentally, it is not completely unreferenced as one critic amongst us all alledges - grant it, it's exceedingly brief - but those of you "in the know" realize we've got an elephant by the tail! Let's be reasonable - why do you think there are over 1.5 Google responses on this topic - is not that sufficient? I think so. Frankly - if the "Left Behind Series" can sell upwards of 65 million copies - and, now the video games - there is an immense interest here! This topic was presented by me at a joint Christian-Jewish seminar as a "paper" and was originally accepted in several theological journals. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.129.87.139_e9e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.129.87.139">71.129.87.139</a> (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.129.87.139.html" title="User talk:71.129.87.139">talk</a>) 04:17, 9 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> They are certainly important figures in a massive religion. However, if all that's written about them is this one nebulous paragraph then I fail to see how an entire article could be written about them without a bunch of speculative nonsense and lists of "people who know what it means." <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 04:25, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Given that the article appears to be being rewritten on a daily basis, I <b>suggest</b> that any AfD discussion be postponed for 7 days, to give the author an opportunity to have reviewed a coherent and complete-as-possible version. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 12:16, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep without prejudice</b> per User:Simoncursitor and rename to The two witnesses or Two witnesses of Revelation. This is a major topic in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_eschatology.html" title="Christian eschatology">Christian eschatology</a>. I'm sitting here googling in stunned disbelief that there isn't already an article on this topic under a different name.

<li><b>Keep</b> I realize that the "enthusiasm level" of this article will increase with time, along with efforts to alter the research presentation prior to its completion "within the week" which we have promised, prior to commencing on the project. The nature of Wikipedia in a project of this nature needs a bit of patience - and, since we are somewhat new to this, we appreciate the help - especially on designing appropriate links that are less "sightly" (perhaps "down below" would be better - help:}) - we've included another section on the religio-politico ramifications of the Two Witnesses - Note: We've capitalized the topic purposefully for effect; however, in our opinion, to not do so would "diminish" the topic. thanks for everyone's patience!
