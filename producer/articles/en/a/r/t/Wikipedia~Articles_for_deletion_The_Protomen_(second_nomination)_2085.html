<li><b>Keep</b>. To say that the Protomen have gone unnoticed by a large portion of society is an extremely ignorant statement, one which I believe would be awful for a longtime user of Wikipedia to say. As this place has been created to provide the masses with information about everything that can be documented, would it not be proper to include even the most unknown bands that exist? The Protomen, however, are by far well-known, especially when compared to the three-piece group down the street that broke up after a gig. The aforementioned publication, Nintendo Power, has been in print since 1988, and has millions of subscribers. Many start-up bands who happen to receive some attention in professional music-oriented magazines usually do not receive as much press. Furthermore, the website GameSpot.com has linked to the Protomen's website, a small piece of advertising provided by a community which receives hundreds of thousands of hits on a daily basis. As if that weren't enough, nuklearpower.com has a similarly high number of unique hits every day, and they, too, have mentioned the Protomen. On one occasion, the sheer amount of traffic that the site endured put it under, yet it was not run on a home-based server with very little bandwith; it is, in fact, hosted by a professional hosting company. Also, the band has sold out of several pressings of their albums already, which is more than some artists manage even if they are licensed by a significant label. On top of that, they have sold their albums to people all around the world, ranging from places like Japan to Sweden. Though they have not toured internationally, they have in fact toured in several different states. Therefore, I conclude that they are not in fact a simple "garage band" and do not deserve to be labeled as such, nor should their Wikipedia article be deleted. --RazMasters 11:56, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would agree against the requirement of needing more magazine articles under their belt. Wiki states that multiple features are needed, but does not specify a number. Two should by all rights count as multiple. Additionally, in regards to tours: the band has traveled to other states for shows, most recently to Clarksville, Indiana. As for a wider fan base, fans have traveled from literally all over the country (I happen to be from Arizona myself) to be present at their performances. The band has shipped many copies of its album overseas. Even if one might consider them to be a 'garage band', then one would have to conclude that they even more notable for being a garage band that fits these criteria.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am strongly against the deletion of this article. Two different charges have been leveled against it: That the band is not noteable enough, and that the article is a repost of a previously deleted article. First off, The Protomen are notable. As stated in the article, the band has had articles published about them in Nintendo Power, Mix Magazine, and other various publications. The concept behind the band is unique, and their popularity is growing rapidly, especially for such an independent, underground production. The main avenue for gaining new fans is the internet, and as such, they have been linked to from popular internet sites. Most importantly, they have many devoted fans and are gaining more every day. Secondly, this article is certainly not merely a repost of a previously deleted article. It is newly written. Even if it were a repost, it has been modified enough since its creation so as to disqualify this charge. This article should not be deleted; please reconsider. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimzor_c57c.html" title="User:Timzor">Timzor</a> 06:18, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>As it happens, I have used Wikipedia for a while. However, I mostly confined myself to reading and making anonymous edits. It was only recently that I decided to create an account for myself, and since then have mostly been concentrating on making this article suitable for wikipedia. I'm not entirely sure what the point of your note is, seeing as how we're worried about an article, not me. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimzor_c57c.html" title="User:Timzor">Timzor</a> 06:18, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: The number of edits you have is relavent to a certain point. A user that votes in Afd but has less than about 20 edits is often a sockpuppet of another user that is being used to fake consensus.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. As if my former entry on this page were not enough, as people are stating that the band does not meet the criteria mentioned in the linked-to article, here's what they do meet: 1. "Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...)." 2. "Has been the subject of a half hour or hour broadcast on a national radio network." (They have been played on true radio stations, not simply internet stations, although they were independents.) 3. "Has credit for writing or co-writing either lyrics or music for a musician or ensemble that qualifies above." (The Protomen have written all of their own works.) 4. "Has been the subject of a biography published as a book, or has several articles by at least 2 different authors in the peer reviewed publications." (They have been reviewed in published newspapers; even if said newspapers were independent, they were printed papers nonetheless, which were distributed to potentially hundreds of people.) 5. "Is cited in notable and verifiable sources as being influential in style, technique, repertory or teaching in a particular music genre." (As mentioned in my previous post, they include: Nintendo Power magazine, GameSpot.com, NuklearPower.com, and several unmentioned independent sites.) There are five reasons alone, but the Protomen could roughly qualify under some of the others, if one were to be loose with the rules. This would not be a bad thing to do, as: "Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; likewise, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. These are merely rules of thumb which some editors choose to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to keep an article that is on articles for deletion." And that is per the Wikipedia article on deletion itself. Therefore, I reiterate that their page does not deserve to be deleted. --RazMasters 10:04AM, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've struck out your <i>Keep</i> above as that could be construed as trying to render 2 opinions, which is not allowed. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assuming Good faith</a> that it was just an oversight on your part. You would also help your case if you could provide evidence to back up your claims... for instance, some sort of proof that they have <i>"...been the subject of a half hour or hour broadcast on a national radio network."</i> Personally, I think your strongest argument is #2 if it can be verified... or #4 (cites for #1 appear to be trivial &amp; #3 is self-referential for a band) --<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:18, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you for striking out the <i>Keep</i>, as I did indeed not know that it could be counted as a second vote. As for #1, I do not understand how one could view a publication such as Nintendo Power as being trivial when few magazines published in the United States have as large of a reader base. It's in the millions, and the magazine has been in publication for nearly ten years now. People of all ages and from all over the world read it. They were not just mentioned in passing, either; the Protomen had an entire article dedicated to them in issue #201. As for the radio station information, I will get that and post it by the end of today if possible. The same goes for the reviews. RazMasters 19:35, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I wasn't refering to the magazine as trivial, I was referring to the article... Though a full article would not be "trivial" if it were at least a couple of pages and not just a blurb. I will look into it. Also, were there several full page articles about them in NP or other magazines? The criteria is "multiple non-trivial..."

<li><b>Comment</b> I must apologize, as I did not know that opening a widely published magazine (available everywhere from supermarkets to specialty stores) to turn to page 91, or visiting websites and conducting a search, were extremely difficult things. May I rephrase, then, and say that the evidence has already been provided, but simply must be checked, and is unfortunately extremely difficult to get due to its accessible nature?

<li><b>Comment</b> I think you'll find that assumptions about the physical availability of a magazine are going to be fraught with difficulty - not everyone lives in your hamlet.

<li><b>Keep</b> Perhaps The Protomen were non-notable six months ago, and perhaps even three months ago. However, after three unique waves (that I have been aware of) of rising popularity since last October, The Protomen are no longer non-notable. As mentioned, popular sites such as nuklearpowered/<a href="../../../8/_/b/8_Bit_Theatre_78bd.html" title="8 Bit Theatre">8_Bit_Theatre</a> have linked to the band, and mention has also appeared on other notable sites, including the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machinae_supremacy.html" title="Machinae supremacy">Machinae_supremacy</a> boards, at the bottom of a <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamespot.html" title="Gamespot">Gamespot</a> article, and on the now-defunct cult boards at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28webcomic%29_73fc.html" title="Penny Arcade (webcomic)">Penny_Arcade</a>. In late October/early November, a number of popular videogame blogs, including <a href="../../../k/o/t/Kotaku.html" title="Kotaku">Kotaku</a>, picked up an article written for the Radio Free Internet blog about The Protomen (article available here: <a href="http://radiofreeinternet.imjasonh.com/index.php/archives/2005/11/08/89/" class="external free" title="http://radiofreeinternet.imjasonh.com/index.php/archives/2005/11/08/89/" rel="nofollow">http://radiofreeinternet.imjasonh.com/index.php/archives/2005/11/08/89/</a> ). In addition, dozens of independent blogs across the country have made posts proclaiming the strength of the message that The Protomen present through their music. Some fans were so-compelled to see the band live this past April that they traveled more than five hundred miles to Nashville for their first live show post-Internet-celebrity. I am one such person, having driven just over one thousand miles round-trip from Chicago. Of course, such factors are personal; apparently, via the wiki music guidelines, even the strongest up-and-coming bands are doomed for deletion until some arbitrary numeric popularity is achieved (via some common form media representation, regardless of community support). At the very least, as a Chicago native, I wonder how Chicago-local band <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Circles_bc9f.html" title="Russian Circles">Russian Circles</a>, acknowledging they play excellent music, can obtain secure wiki status where The Protomen must fight (indeed, in accord with the quick-sniping tone of most delete votes) even though, as I have personally seen, The Protomen have a wider worldwide following (though more scattered), and a more important message--though, again, personal feelings seem to sway little here. As far as traditional evidence: I have sent a scan of the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Power_90d1.html" title="Nintendo Power">Nintendo Power</a> article to RazMasters (who mentioned intention of acquiring the article to subsequently post) as proof of this article's existence. I also submit a link to a recording of the local-channel broadcast that was previously mentioned, which can be found here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4B8te4gu4Q" class="external free" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4B8te4gu4Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4B8te4gu4Q</a> which is still a recording of a local program, but I have trouble seeing how the continuous viral-media-style spread of The Protomen's popularity, at this point, fails to constitute notability. The Protomen have defined a new genre, achieved a following that has been producing a wide variety of fan-art since January, and have sold out of copies of their album at least twice since October. In the sad event this community does, in fact, decide The Protomen have yet to achieve their popularity at this point, all who are posting for deletion should be aware that they will attain notability eventually--and probably sooner than later, with a wave of shows being planned for this coming October.Rohsiph 00:14, 17 June 2006 (UTC) <small>User's first edit</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the full page article in Nintendo Power was enough alone to justify notability. Everyone needs to realize that those of us whom know of this band live in separate states and even countries because of the media and press this band has received recently. You can shoot down two of our sources if you'd like, but theres still all the other sources that are featured right here in Wikipedia and we only need one of them to prove notability. I also have to disagree with you on the Mix Magazine article, there was quite a bit of information available about The Protomen, enough to get another bunch of fans anyway. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraxis_e156.html" title="User:Draxis">Draxis</a> 12:37, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If you've simply stated that the article seems to be entirely about the university, does that mean you haven't read it in its entirety? The article opens (as many do) by leading the reader to their destination, which is a meeting with the Protomen. Also, you've cited the Mix Magazine as an example, but have neglected to mention the worldwide press that it proffers; additionally, by not commenting on the Nintendo Power article, you seem to be ignoring that as well. As aforementioned, Nintendo Power has millions of readers all over the world. Mix Magazine is published in dozens of countries. How much "stronger" must their evidence be? It does meet the requirements of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and we have explained why. Outside of people voicing their personal opinion, I have seen no one manage to effectively counter what's been said in the Protomen's favor. (And as for the radio station mentioned, it is also broadcast live over the internet, meaning that its potential listener base is limited only by what their servers can allow.)

<li><b>Comment</b> Please keep in mind the last five paragraphs on Mix Magazine are in direct reference of The Protomen and it's band members. There is even a picture of their frontman, Panther, featured in the article. Ironically, it even calls The Protomen a "notable band" in the article itself. Keep in mind all the information about McDonald is in fact about The Protomen, as he is a member. This and <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Power_90d1.html" title="Nintendo Power">Nintendo Power</a> is two non-minor articles that were physically published and distributed in multiple countries. I do not believe you can dismiss the five paragraph read on the band as being trivial, given it is giving the band high praise and includes a picture as well as a fairly lengthy read in and of itself. Combined that with very large and notable online sources (including, but not limited to gamespot, penny-arcade, and others) spreading the word of the band and what you have is alot of publicity that the band itself did not attempt to generate. It is through these sources that almost all of us have found The Protomen (from all around the world) and many more will no doubt continue to do so. I could see how all this could be dismissed if it were mere advertisements created by the band itself, but that is most certainly not the case. I believe this bands popularlity and non-self generated coverage is being sorely underestimated. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraxis_e156.html" title="User:Draxis">Draxis</a> 16:54, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> He's pretty much just repeated what the rest of us have been saying. I still strongly feel both of those criteria have been met. While you can argue the later, I don't believe it can be argued at this point that they have been featured in multiple non-trivial publications. This next statement is not directed at Wicke, it's in general: I have seen no valid argument beyond linking to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> or claims of sockpuppetry. This is not a vote, anyone whom is a sockpuppet is irrelevant. Our defense supported by facts has been presented. I have not seen a single person provide any compelling argument as to why these two criteria (among other things that would prove notability) are not legitimate and honestly I don't think that's going to happen given the strength of the "multiple non-trivial publications" argument. People can continue to point fingers at sockpuppets, they can continue to link to the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> but the fact remains we have provided factual resources and proof; these are the things that must be defeated, not each individual user in this debate.

I feel that a five-paragraph blurb is trivial, and non-trivial coverage would consist of two or three pages. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> does not say "Has had more than 250 words written about it in reliable and reputable media," so I have the right to my own interpretation of non-trivial coverage. Similarly, the Nintendo Power coverage seems bordering on trivial, as well as bordering on non-reliable/reputable media. It's not a reputable music publication, it's the mouthpiece of a video game company giving one-page coverage to a band that writes songs about one of their games. Don't get me started on how you guys feel being played on a 100 watt college radio station is an assertion of notability. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 20:16, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Though I can respect your arguments on the physical articles to an extent (noting I wonder how any highly meaningful and unique, yet unpopular example of anything could every meet the guidelines based on what I understand of your interpretations, which I state because of what I understand as the purpose of Wikipedia as collecting meaningful information in a free, easy-to-access source), you are still ignoring a plethora of evidence for notability from Internet sources, both notable (to the point of having pages on Wikipedia), and trivial. If it really is part of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines to ignore all such articles, which there is a clearly-stated exlusion for the trivial examples but none (that I see) for the notable sites, I have to ponder the irony of Wikipedia itself as a database proliferated via the Internet.
