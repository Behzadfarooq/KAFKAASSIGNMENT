<p>Dale Calkins and his Ferrari 1 site have come under certain criticisms for the content on the site's message board. Calkins' completely open forum policy has lead to certain users posting highly questionable topics. Certain topics about the Holocaust started by now banned members were quickly removed by Sportnetwork. Other users began to resort to personal attacks on Ferrari 1's message board and Dale's reluctance to ban them in accordance with his open forum policy also garnered him some negative feedback. Currently Ferrari 1 is not suffering from any sort of controversies as most of the trouble causing users have been banned by Sportnetwork.</p>

<p>Cosimo, a young Italian nobleman of the eighteenth century, rebels against parental autority by climbing into the threes and remaining there fot the rest of this life. He adapts efficiently to an arboreal existence--hunts, sows crops, plays games with earth-bound friends, fights forest fires, solves engineering problems, and even manages to have love affairs. From his perch in the trees, Cosimo sees the age of Voltaire pass by and a new century dawn.</p>

<p>The man who makes raibows is not god sending rain down upon the earth and lets the light reflect in the water. The real rainbowmaker lives in Norway, in a small town, but a big house where he has both a trampoline and a Rainbowmaker machine. He works day and night, filling up this machine and never rest. He has allies in all countries, placing pots of gold at the end of the rainbow so he can see where it stood earlier (he hates it when peoples take it btw).

<p>The first primary school in Bjelovar opened on November 5th 1761. There were only 6 students, military officer children, and the classes were in German. Since 1763, civilian children were admitted, too.</p>
<p>The construction of a new school in 1774 supplied the necessary space for schooling, and as early as 1776 a girl’s school was founded. After a brief period of stagnation, at the beginning of the 19th century, the first signs of a reform of the schooling system were recorded.</p>
<p>In 1805 the first really "big" school was built, and as soon as 1809 the Main four-year school and a girls’ school with 3 classes are operational in Bjelovar. The Cadet and geodesist school is opened, which in 1817 transforms into the Mathematical school. In 1858 the opening of a military school and a two-year "Real" school is approved and according to that, from that year on, in the town the Main school, the Girls’ school, the Military school, the Real school and the Ilirian school, with 388 students, are functional. In 1876 the small Real school transforms into the small high school and in 1901 the new building is finished named the Royal Real High School in Bjelovar.</p>
<p>The cities ongoing economic prosperity and growth made it become a city of the young. Kindergartens, primary and high schools, a music school and in recent years higher education institutions, are the places through which the citizens love their city, places that will generate new ideas from new generations that will add new colours to our Bjelovar.</p>

<p>The first kindergarten and day-care centre in the town of Bjelovar was founded on March 8th, 1946. The growing number of children and needs to care about children in that way triggered the construction of new functional objects. In that manner new kindergartens were built in 1973 on the Matoš Square and in 1977 another dedicated object in the king Zvonimir settlement. In the 80’s the need for opening an infant day-care centre arose and as a result three were opened. In 1988 a new nursery school was constructed by the already existing kindergarten in the king Zvonimir settlement.</p>
<p>All these objects function under the Bjelovar Kindergarten, the city of Bjelovar being the founder and owner. 650 children are embraced in 26 educational groups. The work of the Bjelovar Kindergarten shows through additional programs such as:</p>
<p>- the English playroom, around 60 children - the playroom "I know, I will and I can", 180 children - a playroom for handicapped children, around 10 children - a talented children playroom, an experimental beginning - a computer playroom, around 100 children - a children’s chorus, around 100 children</p>
<p>The preschool learning and education law allows for private initiative in the field of preschool education. In that manner in Bjelovar opened two private kindergartens "Ciciban" and "Bambi" which accept 200 children so that the total number of children embraced by preschool education is raised by 850.</p>
<p>The city of Bjelovar participates with 70% in financing the kindergartens and the parents come up for the remaining 30%.</p>

For this level of quality, the expert teachers must take great merit. Some of them are promoted into the office of mentors and advisers. All the data on the Bjelovar Gymnasium speak for the reason why this institution takes a special place in education, but also in the culture of the city and the county.</p>

<p>The Economic and Office school in Bjelovar was founded as the Economic school in 1955 and after a few school reforms, from 1993 on, it works independently under the current name. The school educates regular students, but also adults, for the profession economist and administrative referent through four-year programmes. The school has 16 class sections, 12 economic and 4 administrative, with around 500 students. The school has 51 employees, with the reminder that it takes care of all the accounting work for all secondary schools in Bjelovar.</p>
<p>In its five hundred year history it has educated a range of respected experts, some of whom are today’s leading economists, in Bjelovar as well as in whole Croatia. As a school it stands out for its modern approach to teaching, in common educational as well as in expert subjects.</p>
<p>"Dani slobodne nastave", the "free classes days", is a well known and unique pedagogical project which in its ninth year rallies over twenty famous lecturers in the fields of economics, culture, science, whose classes and workshops the students choose out of their own interests. Beside school, there are a lot of free activities at work: a historian group, a reporter group, a literature group and a very successful sports club with ten teams in different sports. The school is among the first in Croatia to have made, after an Austrian model, an authoring program in economic practise. Within the frames of the economic practise, the students are opening phoney companies themselves and take care of all the business, which is the best preparation for work.</p>

<p>The nurse school Bjelovar stared its activities in the school year 1958/59 with the enrolment of one section of nurses in the common course in the duration of four years. From 1975 on, the school activities were increased by enrolment of more first grade classes and later by adding additional profiles – midwifes, dental technicians, lab technicians, physical therapists, masseurs and pharmacology technicians. From 1978 until 1991 the school was integrated in the Centre for training and directed education where a workgroup was formed, which besides the health profession also had a pedagogical school, a wood school, an agricultural and nutrition school. Since 1991,the Gymnasium and professional schools again exist in the schooling system, so the school was renamed the Medical school Bjelovar.</p>
<p>Since then the school educates for the professions: nurse – medical technician, health - lab technician, dental technician and pharmacology technician in regular schooling. In the adult education role, the school has training programs for female tenders, which proves the school’s modern concept – a lifelong education.</p>
<p>Today around 400 students attend classes that are held by 30 regular lecturers and 20 outside associates, mostly doctors – specialists of the Bjelovar common hospital, where the students perform regular training and proficient practise.</p>
<p>The students are mostly educated for work in the health care system, but this school’s students often continue their education on medical or chemistry universities, but also in other professions.</p>
<p>Beside the regular school program, the students are active in out of school activities and in skill and knowledge competitions they achieve every year envying results, especially in proficient national competitions "Schola medica".</p>

<p>Bjelovar has a long tradition in the development of education for industry needs. As early as 1769, masons, carpenters and other future craftsman attended sections of a Latin and Geometry school.</p>
<p>The Apprentice school was founded in Bjelovar in 1886. The successor school to the Apprentice school was the “ Students in economy school”, founded in 1947. 330 students were enrolled into the school. Classes were held 3 hours a day, totally 18 hours a week. The school had 10 constant and 11 part-time employees. In 1951/52 the school had 11 sections. The 1958 resolution of the Council for education of the PRC saw the Central school for students in economy starting it work with the regular school for students in economy.</p>
<p>The metal professions sections were enrolled in 1960. The classes in the metal professions were held as practice in companies in the morning and lessons in the school in the afternoon. 1960 saw the opening of a section of the Technical school, machinist direction, for adults because of the needs of the Bjelovar economy (the tractor plant Tomo Vinkovic and Agro-services). There were a total of 33 students.</p>
<p>In 1962 the Technical school with one section of regular students was founded and 40 students were enrolled. By political decisions of the educational authorities from January 1st 1963 the School metal centre was founded within whom the Craftsman school works.</p>
<p>In 1978 the Centre for training and directed education was created. In that way the continuity in equipping the previous programmes of the Bjelovar secondary schools was ended.</p>
<p>In 1991 the Centre for training and directed education in Bjelovar was reorganized. This enabled the schools to work independently, among them the Craftsman school.</p>
<p>The Craftsman school in Bjelovar registered in 1993 as an independent school. It enrols and educates apprentices of different crafts, trying to meet the economy and personal needs. On that way it has to face many difficulties that are being transferred into the third millennium. The goal of the Craftsman school is to enable the apprentices for skilful, independent work on complex assignments in different crafts and the amelioration of the Croatian economy. Because of such importance of this educational process, the Craftsman schools deserve much greater attention in the planning of the countries future.</p>

<p>The Technical school was founded in 1960 within the School for students in economy and at the request of the economy. It had one section for adults and from 1963 it admitted regular students. Joining the Centre for training and directed education, one organisational unit educated the metal an electrical cadre. Since the 1993 reform of the secondary schooling system, the Technical school Bjelovar operates as an independent school.</p>
<p>With the rapid development of technology, specially in the fields of mechanics and electronics, needs arise for new and modern educational programs that will enable the students to work in the informatics era.</p>
<p>The Technical school has educated: mechanical technicians, electronics technicians and technicians for electro mechanics. The new educational programmes the Technical school offers now are: technician for informatics and technician for informatics in mechanics.</p>
<p>The Technical school’s working goal is directed towards the achievement of a high level of connectivity between theoretical and practical professions, with the aim to create skilful experts on a broad basis of usage.</p>

<p>The school centre for educating cadre in trade was founded in 1962 as an independent school institution. Until 1949 the school for students in economy has educated students for a greater number of crafts, among them salesman, too. In 1949 a lower sales course with a two-year duration was founded, and in 1953 the Central school for students in trade with a boarding school was opened. Since 1980, the school acts as part of the Centre for training and directed education and its independence and today’s name - Trade school, the school receives in 1993.</p>

<p>The secondary schools students’ dormitory Bjelovar building, which was not built for that purpose, dates back to 1900 and it hosted the first students in 1946. The 170 students, who live in the dormitory, come from different Croatian counties and visit all of Bjelovar's secondary schools.</p>
<p>The educational activity in the dormitory is very rich in contents. There are about twenty sports, music-scenic and multimedia optional programs that include almost all students. There are also a number of special programs supporting students in their development, adaptation, socialization and establishment of better communication.</p>
<p>The students, who participate in the dormitory’s activities, have in the past few years achieved numerous results at regional and national level and have in that way promoted the city Bjelovar and the whole region. The folk, video and music sections have been specially noted.</p>
<p>During recent years the number of activities organized by the student’s dormitory rapidly rises and in that way this institution opens up toward the city. Within the frame of the Dormitory Week, concerts, exhibits, meetings and elocutions are organized. The student’s dormitory is constantly involved in almost all happenings at city level: “Terezijana”, City Days, Economic fair, youth activities … The school year ends with a ceremonial presentation program “To Bjelovar with love”. We present in short to our friends and fellow citizens, through a musical-scenic program, our overall work in one school year.</p>
<p>The openness of such an institution toward the city shows as exceptional and of common social meaning, especially for the interests of the young. This is the reason why we try to involve students and associates outside the dormitory into all our projects, programs, elocutions and meetings.</p>
<p>In 2001 Bjelovar was host to a national dormitory contest in Umag for the first time. It successfully hosted 900 participants and presented the city of Bjelovar and the county in the best possible way. For this achievement it has been praised from all sides, among others by the Minister of education dr. Vladimir Strugar.</p>
<p>In the same year we celebrated the 55th anniversary of our dormitory and the next year we received a city award and the City Seal for special achievements in education.</p>

At the end of the 19th century the first singing societies are founded and parallel to their work in the 80’s of the past century the existence of the first private music school is noted.</p>
<p>The Music Society was founded in 1921 and soon thereafter its school, where playing the violin, the piano and blow-instruments was thought. From 1945 the music school starts out as a primary school and from 1957 on also as a secondary music school. The school has a district division in Cazma.</p>

<p>Basic Access Control (BAC) is a mechanism specified to ensure only authorized parties can wirelessly read personal information from <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passports.html" title="Passports">passports</a> with an <a href="../../../r/f/i/RFID_4b20.html" title="RFID">RFID</a> chip. It uses data such as the passport number, date of birth and expiration date to negotiate a session key. This key can then be used to encrypt the communication between the passports chip and a reading device. This mechanism is intended to ensure that the owner of a passport can decide who can read the electronic contents of the passport.</p>

<p>The data used to encrypt the BAC communication can be read electronically from the bottom of the passport called the machine readable zone. Because physical access to the passport is assumed to be needed to know this part of the passport it is assumed that the owner of the passport has giving permission to read the passport. Equipment for optically scanning this part of the passport is already widely used. It uses an <a href="../../../o/c/r/OCR_f529.html" title="OCR">OCR</a> system to read the text which is printed in a standardized format.</p>

<p>The Basic Access Control mechanism has been criticized as offering to little protection from unauthorized interception. Researchers claim that because there are only limited amounts of passport issued many theoretically possible passport numbers will not be in use in practice. And there are ages in theory that no passport carrying human has in practice. This is because children typically do not request passports and some ages are beyond a normal human lifespan.</p>
<p>In other words, the data used as an encryption key has a low <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entropy.html" title="Entropy">entropy</a>.</p>
<p>It is claimed this brings intercepted but <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encrypted.html" title="Encrypted">encrypted</a> data in the reach of a modest <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brute_force_attack.html" title="Brute force attack">brute force attack</a>.</p>
<p>This effect increases when passport numbers are issued sequentially or contain a redundant <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checksum.html" title="Checksum">checksum</a>. Both are proven to be the case in passports issued by the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. There are other factors that can be potentially used to speed up a brute force attack. There is the fact that dates of birth are typically not distributed randomly in populations. Dates of birth may be distributed even less randomly for the segments of a population that pass for example a check in desk at an airport. And the fact that passports are often not issued on all days of the week and during all weeks of a year. Therefore not all theoretically possible expiration dates may get used.</p>

<p>About ARTHUR SUYDAM</p>
<p>Marvel Zombie cover artist, Arthur Suydam burst onto the scene with his creative innovation of infusing the art of sequential art with classical painting. His extraordinary work helped revolutionize the industry and began the comic art renaissance of the 1980’s, opening doors for mainstream writers and artists to create literature for a more mature readership.</p>
<p>Recently honored with the coveted Spectrum Magazine Gold Award for Excellence in Illustration, Suydam’s immense body of written and illustrative work comprises an aesthetic that is uniquely distinguishable. Recent releases include Arthur Suydam: The Art of the Barbarian; Skin Deep; The Alien Encounters Poster Book; Visions: The Art of Arthur Suydam; The Fantastic Art of Arthur Suydam; Mudwogs and The Adventures of Cholly and Flytrap, published worldwide and currently in pre-production for film with Paranoid Delusions Productions. In addition to his own works, Suydam has contributed text and artwork to countless comics publications including Heavy Metal, House of Secrets, Batman, Conan, Tarzan, Predator, Aliens, Death Dealer, Epic Illustrated and National Lampoon, to name only a few, as well as new work coming out from Marvel, DC Comics, Image, Last Gasp, Vanguard Productions and Eva Ink. Current projects include Fireflies, Mouse in the House and When Giants Walk the Earth — witty looks at rural life and in the American Heartland, mystery and magic, presently under film option.</p>
<p>In fact, Arthur is on the comics scene in a big way this year, having in 2005 alone, received the “Artist Guest of Honor” Award from Dragon Con, and Lifetime Achievement Awards form the University of Maryland and the San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain. Two galleries in Spain are currently displaying over 150 pieces of original Suydam artwork, and Arthur has just been inducted into the Society of Illustrators in NYC.</p>
<p>You may have also seen his new superhero work from DC Comics and Marvel Comics over the last year—mostly recently his Marvel Zombie covers that have been named in the “Wizard Magazine Top 20 Covers of the Month”. The first issue of this over the top selling comic has already gone back to press an unprecedented three times.</p>
<p>His newest release debuts at this very show: “The Fantastic Art of Arthur Suydam” from Vanguard Productions.</p>
<p>All fitting tributes to this writer/creator/artist, whose over-riding passion has undoubtedly been creating stories, characters and memorable moments in a wide range of fiction via either his words, his art, or sublimely, both.</p>

<p>Braces Are Beautiful is a movement with a small number of members emphasizing the aesthetic perks of braces. This orthodontic fixation manifests itself in the procurement of cosmetic braces, mass collections of photographs of people with braces, and the idolization of braces. Propondent of the Braces Are Beautiful movement, Sam Siebel, said "I never met anyone who thought braces were ugly."</p>

<p>I began at PRC over two years ago as a Relay Agent. My role was to relay calls for the hearing impaired community. I accepted the position because it was an opportunity for me to help people in need. Now as a Communications Manager, I can say PRC has really given me the opportunity to grow my career, and do it with confidence.</p>
<p>PRC does a great job of recognizing the talents and hard work of their people and promoting from within. With that in mind, they decided to capitalize on my non-profit and fundraising experience. After I was promoted to Communications Manager, the PRC leaders asked me to also head-up the company’s philanthropic organization, PRC Community Care. I accepted immediately because helping people is something I’m passionate about and truly enjoy. Not to mention, it’s the reason I joined PRC from the beginning.</p>
<p>I can say without a doubt, there is no other position in this entire company of 10,000 people that I’d rather have. I really enjoy the people I work with, and I especially enjoy my customers. I think it goes without saying, I love the PRC Community Care role. It’s great to be able to earn a living, while help others at the same time.” – David L. Wylie, Communications Manager</p>

<p>Adam Moon was born in 1982 in Clapham, London. He showed early signs of promise on the Cricket pitch leading to astonishing performances as Captain of Dulwich College cricket team. The school's newsletter read "On the cricket field, there have been several memorable performances, notably the bowling of the 1st XI captain, Adam Moon". By 1999 Moon's bowling had reached extraordinary heights, he had made it on to an exciting and vigourous Surrey team, and had played for the second XI at county level. His tantalising skill as a left arm leg spinner caused the bails to fall on many a trigger happy batsman eager to knock his temptingly slow balls for six. Playing alongside Chris Salmons and Simon Hollingsworth his skill was developing into one of the most intriguing in young British Cricket.</p>

<p>Opportunity Samples are a frequently used method of sampling in psychology. Opportunity samples involve selecting participants who are around and available at the time.</p>
<p>Strengths: This type of sampling is quick and convenient and usually the most economical method of sampling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Because opportunity sampling selects only those participants who are near by and available, it can result in unrepresentative samples and, often, opportunity samples are biased on the part of the researcher who may choose participants who will be 'helpful'.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-16_407e.html" title="Edit section: Howie Hawkins- Green Activist">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Howie Hawkins- Green Activist</span></h2>
<p>Howie Hawkins of Syracuse has been active in movements for peace, justice, the environment, and independent progressive politics since the late 1960s. He was a co-founder of the anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance in 1976 and the Green Party in the United States in 1984.</p>
<p>After attending Dartmouth College, Howie worked as a carpenter, logger, and cooperative business developer. He was a co-developer and co-owner of a construction workers cooperative that specialized in solar and wind energy systems.</p>
<p>Howie came to Syracuse in 1991 to be Director of CommonWorks, a federation of cooperatives working for an economy that is cooperatively owned, democratically controlled, and ecologically sustainable. Howie also works as a truck unloader at UPS, where he a member of Teamsters Local 317 and active in the national Teamster rank-and-file reform caucus, Teamsters for a Democratic Union.</p>
<p>His articles on social theory, cooperative economics, and independent politics have appeared in many publications, including Against the Current, Green Politics, Green Perspectives, The Guardian, In These Times, Independent Politics News, International Socialist Review, Left Green Notes, Liberation, Left Turn, New Politics, Our Generation, Peace and Democracy News, Peaceworks, Resist, The Socialist, Society and Nature, Synthesis/Regeneration, Win, and Z Magazine.</p>
<p>Born in San Francisco, California in 1952, Howie became politically active as a teenager who faced the draft and the escalating war in Vietnam and participated in local struggles for racial and economic justice.</p>
<p>Howie knew he wanted a third party to support by age 11 in 1964 after being repelled by the racism of both major parties. The Republicans, with Ronald Reagan as their spokesperson, campaigned to repeal California’s Rumsford fair housing law. Meanwhile, the Democratic National Convention seated as voting delegates the segregationist Dixiecrat delegation from Mississippi instead of the integrated Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegation.</p>
<p>The Democrats’ Johnson won as the peace candidate in 1964, but then escalated in Vietnam. Though federal civil rights and voting rights acts passed in 1964 and 1965, Johnson’s half-hearted “war on poverty” was sacrificed to the war in Vietnam. So when the Peace and Freedom Party was formed in late 1967 to end US intervention in Vietnam and fight poverty and racism, Howie supported the registration drive to put Peace and Freedom on the ballot even though at age 15, he wouldn’t be able to vote for another 6 years because the law then stated one had to be 21 in order to vote.</p>
<p>Ever since, Howie has been committed to independent political action by poor and working people, with “independent” meaning completely independent of the corporate funding and sponsorship, and completely independent of the corporate rulers’ political representatives, the Democratic and Republican parties.</p>
<p>Howie also participated in the peace, justice, and environmental movements and demonstrations in the Bay Area in his high school years, including Stop the Draft Week in October 1967, the San Francisco State Strike in 1968-69, People’s Park in Berkeley in 1969, the first Earth Day and the nationwide anti-war student strike in 1970, and Black Panther Party proposal for community control of the police in Berkeley, California in 1971.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1971, Howie began attending Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, where he studied social and political theory. During his first year in college, college draft deferments were eliminated and Howie draft number was called in July 1972. He immediately enlisted in an off-campus Marine officer-training program before the Army’s draft letter reached him so he could continue his studies. But after a summer of officer training at Quantico in 1974, Howie had to inform the Marines that he did not have the funds for his last year of college. He informed that since he could meet the college degree requirement needed to take an officer‘s commission upon graduation, he was ready to serve as a regular enlistee the 2 years of active duty that he was obligated to serve under his enlistment contract. But the Marines never ordered Howie to active duty. So he spent the duration of his 6-year enlistment period waiting for order to report for active duty, perhaps because of his public activities against the war in Vietnam.</p>
<p>While waiting for orders to report to active duty, Howie remained active in the anti Vietnam War movement, and became active in the anti-nuclear and the anti-apartheid movements. He helped form New Hampshire’s People’s Energy Project in 1974 to fight the proposed Seabrook nuclear power plant, and then the New England-wide Clamshell Alliance in 1976 to organize occupations of the Seabrook nuclear plant site.</p>
<p>After the Soweto massacre in South Africa in 1976, he co-founded the Upper Valley Committee for the Liberation of Southern Africa, helped to form the Northeast Coalition for the Liberation of Southern Africa in 1978, and represented New England on the national anti-apartheid Call to Conscience coordinating committee in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Howie led several campaigns to link corporate exploitation in South Africa and the US, including domestic redlining by banks lending to South Africa and labor abuse by Phelps Dodge in Namibia and Arizona.</p>
<p>In 1984, Howie organized fellow carpenters to put up a pre-fabricated shanty-town in minutes on the central square at Dartmouth College despite promised resistance from security. Students then occupied the shanty-town, instigating a nationwide wave of shantytown protests that led to many college portfolio divestments of apartheid-linked securities.</p>
<p>During this same period in the 1970s, Howie worked as a carpenter and co-founded in 1978 a construction workers cooperative that specialized in energy efficiency and solar and wind installations. He also worked with students at Dartmouth to form a New Hampshire Public Interest Research Group in 1975. In 1976-77, Howie returned to Dartmouth for his last year of studies, where he completed all the requirements for graduation except learning a foreign language. Howie does speak the Polynesian language of Tonga, where he lived for three months in 1973, but it was not recognized by Dartmouth.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Howie decided to prioritize his political activity on building an independent progressive political party. He believed that progressive issue campaigns would be more effective if there was an independent people’s party. Without an independent progressive party to give political expression to these issue campaigns, progressive issue campaigners are left to lobby the corporate parties, most often the more “liberal” Democrats, who feel little pressure to act on the campaigners’ demands because they can take progressives’ votes for granted.</p>
<p>In addition, Howie also believed it was important to link single issues to each other and their systemic roots. Without linking issues like a party program does, single-issue campaigns can be easily defeated or co-opted because these campaigns don’t have a perspective that can sustain them for the long haul through the ups and downs of movements and help them understand the difference between token personnel changes and substantive policy changes. On the other hand, an independent party of working people can sustain issue work between periods of popular mobilization by actively advancing their program between elections (unlike the corporate parties which are primarily money collecting and vote mobilizing machines) and by providing education that links issues and provides a systemic analysis.</p>
<p>Howie has been active in every non-sectarian effort to build independent politics, from local independent parties where he lived (Peace and Freedom Party of California, 1968-1971; Liberty Union of Vermont, 1972-1978; Granite State Alliance of New Hampshire, 1974-1978), national independent parties (Peoples Party, 1971-1976; Socialist Party, 1973-present; Citizens Party, 1979-1984; Green Party, 1984-present; Labor Party, 1996-present); and a series of national coalitions committed to independent politics (People’s Coalition for Peace and Justice, 1971-1974; Mass Party Organizing Committee, 1974-1978; Peoples Alliance, 1978-1981; National Committee for Independent Political Action, 1981-1995; Independent Progressive Politics Network, 1995-present).</p>
<p>In 1984, Howie was one of the co-founders of the Green Party in the United States, in which he advocated a more grassroots organizing approach than earlier attempts at building a new progressive party. Instead of trying to build the national party from the top down through a presidential campaign as the Peace and Freedom, Peoples, and Citizens parties had done, the Greens would build local organizations and contest local elections until they had enough of a base to launch a presidential campaign, which the Greens finally did 12 years later when they drafted Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke as their presidential ticket in 1996.</p>
<p>As an activist in these parties, Howie worked on many electoral campaigns, including the Cleaver/Dowd ‘68, Spock/Hobson ‘72, and Commoner/Harris ’80 presidential campaigns, the 1970s Liberty Union campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Michael Parenti, and several Green campaigns in Vermont and New Hampshire between 1985 and 1990. Howie also gained experience by volunteering in the New Hampshire primaries for major party candidates, namely, Pete McCloskey, the anti-war and anti-corruption Republican challenger to Nixon in 1972, and Fred Harris, the anti-corporate populist Democratic candidate in 1976.</p>
<p>Since coming to Syracuse in 1991, Howie has been nominated by the Greens to run for city council, mayor, county executive, state comptroller, and the US House. He has been the Upstate New York Field Coordinator for Nader/LaDuke 2000 and Nader/Camejo 2004. He is also the co-founder and past president of the Green Alliance, a national federation of local Green Party clubs.</p>

<p>Eddie Dee is a reggeaton artist most known for his compilation album "Los 12 Discipulos" (Translated literally in Spanish as "The 12 Disciples"), released in early 2004. The album gathered many well-known reggaeton artists such as Daddy Yankee, Tego Calderón, Ivy Queen, Zion y Lennox, and Nicky Jam. In late 2005, Eddie Dee released a Special Edition CD/DVD which included 4 new tracks, 5 music videos (as well as other bonus features), and a preview of Eddie Dee's upcoming album, "El Diario de Eddie Avila", dated to be released in 2006. Eddie Dee collaborated with the 11 other reggaton artists on the track, "Quítate Tu Pa' Ponerme Yo" and on the "Salsa Remix" which is a bonus track on the Special Edition of the CD. Aside from this, Eddie Dee also featured La Secta (though they were not essentially a member of Los 12 Discipulos) on one of the new tracks and Daddy Yankee on another.</p>
