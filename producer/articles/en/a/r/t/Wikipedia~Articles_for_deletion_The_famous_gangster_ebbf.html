<p>Article claims notability, but searching Google, I've had difficulty pulling up information on this artist. This might be because Slovenian rap is not a huge marketplace, however I still do not feel he meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 16:46, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: LOL, I wish we could keep this on its comedy value alone. His "music videos" are just him videotaping stuff from the side of his car while playing 50 Cent music over it. If this is Slovenia's most famous gangster rapper, then he must be Solvenia's <i>only</i> gangster rapper. Seriously though, I think this fails the policy on notability and needs to be <b>delete</b>d. - <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunch_22cb.html" title="User:Runch">Runch</a> 20:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Some thoughts from the author:</li>
</ul>
<p>Wildthing61476 and Runch: you are correct, Slovenian rap is still very small and is still evolving. Mr.B has not yet published his CD, so looking him up on Slovenian web shops will be useless. You mentioned, that there were very little information on Mr.B, i agree with that totally, that is why i started to write this article - i summarised (yes with my own words&#160;:) ) his interview for a Slovenian tabloid and included my own interview (most of it is in the article). To get some more info, please try googling for "lordbebo" - without the quotations (lordbebo is a second alias from Mr.B). He went by that nickname when he started, so many people still use that name, and some know him only by that name. He is extremely popular on internet boards, beacouse he had published some of his writings, lyrics and music freely on internet, and boards are the best place for people for exchange toughts on his work, not to mention that 95% of topics you will find were not opened by Mr.B but his fans that copy pasted his works.</p>
<p>Runc said, that his videos are just him driving in a car and playing 50 cent. I partially agree, <b>but</b> only the first two videos are made like that. As i have written, he got some more money for the third video, so semi-proffesional cameras etc. were used. And i don't think he drives around and plays 50 cent in the last one&#160;:).</p>
<p>Also if you check the counter on the page where his videos were uploaded, you will see, that it has literally thousands of views (first video - 2227 views, second video - 6052 views and the third one only 550 views, if you do not believe the numbers, please check the links provided in my article!). But these videos are the low quality ones, the quality was reduced, so that these pages can host them. The bigger files are hosted on private servers, but there are no counters, so i cannot say for sure how many downloads. Maby you will think that approximately 9 thousands of views is not much, but it is in my land with only 2 million population.</p>
<p>Also his video and music was published on a DVD and CD, that comes with a computer magazine called Joker ( if i am not mistaken, it is the most popular computer magazine in Slovenia, i will provide the number of subscribers later after i contact the editor of the magazine). If their website could provide excact informations on what is on the dvd i would gladly provide you the proof, but sadly he had fallen under the "misc" section, so there is no explicit mentioning of him on the homepage. I will call my friend, so he can make some screenshots of the dvd, to prove that i am not lying about that. Danny Lilithborne: When you can, please provide some reasons on deleting the article i will try to answer them as best i can&#160;:)</p>
<p>Worker21, the writer of the Wikipedia article on Mr.B</p>
<p>I have just recieved a screenshot that my friend made. It was on the runnable CD that was added to the latest computer magazine Joker, the picture can be found here <a href="http://img81.imageshack.us/img81/5478/gospodarwicale2.jpg" class="external free" title="http://img81.imageshack.us/img81/5478/gospodarwicale2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img81.imageshack.us/img81/5478/gospodarwicale2.jpg</a> (if translated to English: MP3 Gospodar Wiƒça, that was made by a Slovenian rapper Mr.B). I still have to contact my other friend that has the DVD edition (they come seperately, depends on the type of subsctription), the video is on the DVD. I am still waiting for the response, from the magazine editor, on the number of subscribers for this magazine. If it is necessary i will add these pictures to the article as well</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The artist doesn't meet the criteria set out in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. It requires at least two albums released on major record labels or a charted hit- neither of these have been achieved. One tabloid interview doesn't meet criteria of multiple non-trivial independent sources. Maybe some other time when he becomes famous and notable, but not now.--<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 18:26, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
delete him because he is a fake and he only made 3 songs which he didn't even seriously think about selling. also the picture of him on the first page of a tabloid has been faked because the text next to it refers to something completely different. i also doubt anybody who is not a member of the mn3njalnik forum knows about him.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> from author:</li>
</ul>
I've decided to completely edit my arcticle and mostla gather <u>all</u> proofs that Mr.B is not just some random dude which thinks that it would be really cool to be on Wikipedia&#160;:). By proofs i mean scanning the other magazine he appeared in, which i did not know until recently. Thanks to Runch that pointed out a few mistakes i made unintentionally ( the article is titled the famous gangster but shuld be mr.b oufcourse&#160;:) ). And i will read the article about musicians on wikipedia more thoroughly.
<p>And a little comment to the anonymous comment: you say he made 3 songs? if i know rap, he only made one song (only one is mentioned in the article, the others will surely be in the next and improved article about mr.b), the rest are from 50 cent. But maby i am mistaken, *rolls eyes*&#160;:). Any you say he is only known on one board called mn3njalnik? Use google please, before writing such nonsene.</p>
<p>I will answer other accussations from the dearest anonymous comentator when i return from school&#160;:)</p>
