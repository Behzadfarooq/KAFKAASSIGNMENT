<p><i>Science &amp; Theology</i> is a book written by notable author John Polkinghorne. It chronicles the views of Science versus theology, and how over the years they have developed together through consonance and assimilation. It gives clear and consice understanding of the two topics. Even though this book is meant for study in classrooms, it is claimed to be too verbiose and slightly biased.</p>

<p>It all started with two clans. The first clan was JA. It was made by to people know as Milkman and Quigon. This clan was relatively new to it's great ally. Which brings us to the next clan. DJL was a clan formed a while before JA. When JA was made Quigon asked for an alliance between JA an DJL. It was accepted. After that Quigon and MilkMan formed friendships with the leaders of DJL ( Jeng, Viper, Quel Droma, Exar Kun{not the exar in our clan but a traitor of a leader}) and became the greatest allies of all time. Since DJL was in conflict with another clan called DJF, JA helped in as many ways as possible. After several battles with DJF they soon died. DJL was then the most powerful clan on the game. JA was quickly becoming known also.</p>

<p>When JA and DJL destroyed DJF it was calm for a while. DJL and JA just kept getting bigger. Then gradually a clan was made called DJO. It was no threat until we found out who they really where. DJO was leftovers from the former clan DJF. It was being led by 2 people called Leeros and Maul. When this was found out they were immediately an enemy. When this happened a man named Sith took over DJO. His plan was to make an empire and take over the game. So he made the 12 empires. It consisted of 12 clans that feared Sith and being the pussy's they were joined him so their clan was not destroyed. One of the main targets of their empires was JA and DJL.</p>

<p>After DJL became the strongest clan there were about 80+ members. This was great but alot of people just wanted power. Then Ulic Qel Droma(aka Siphon) ,the main leader at the time started to play EAW and the control of the site was left to Jeng which was to overwhelming(it took him a long time to answer every1's questions in the clan. When this happened Jeng Droga took over as the main leader. But before this happened a power struggle between there clan formed. People were fighting for power in the clan of DJL. People wanted this, wanted to be leader, wanted to have more power. DJL started to fall apart from a power strugle. When this happened, Jeng, Viper, Malak and several other former DJL members left to make a new clan called NJL. This clan was made to fix the problems that were found when DJL was made. Of coarse JA was still their best ally. NJL assisted in over 15 wars and never lost.</p>

<p>At the time DJO and their empires was not that big of a threat. Though we knew they would be later. But a new person came to Quigon with a bet. He was Lord.Wolf. Lord Wolf came with a bet that stated we have a war. Your whole clan VS just me. If i win your clan disbands. We accepted. But soon after we canceled it because of other problems. Soon after this Lord. Wolf began to hang out with members of NJL and JA. Surprisingly we became friends. Then Lord. Wolf came to Quigon for help. Wolf needed a place to stay low since he was a clan killer. Quigon accepted and allowed him to join JA. Wolf NJL andJa were the most unbeatable trio in all of history. Together we beat 15+ clans and were feared by everyclan to the piont that no one would even dare challenge us nor accept a challenge. This though did not last long cause of a fight between SHRP one of our JA members and Wolf. It was a constant fight in which led to both members leaving. This grudge still remains to this day.</p>

<p>ROL was of JA's and NJL's biggest enemies. The conflict has been on going with several battles. JA and NJL made a war with ROL. There was also a bet for the up coming war. IF JA won ROL disbands, if ROL won JA disbands. Of coarse our ally NJL helped. Other allies that helped were CA, WRL, and several others. JA defeated ROL. Tough being the jackasses they are ROL did not keep their word and did not disband. So we had several more battles. JA and NJL won repeatedly with the same bet. ROL has yet to beat us. If they think they did the war they think they won was not approved by Quigon nor Milkman. After several battles between NJL, JA against ROL the wars stopped but the enemy stage still continued.</p>

<p>Soon after conflict with ROL resolved DJO became a threat. DJO was making an empire. They were getting as many clans to join them trying to conquer all. No clan dared to face them because they were not skilled clans. But 2 clans did, NJL &amp; JA. Together they made allies and fought The Empire which led to the down fall of The Empire, 'The 12 Empires'. There were several small battles that had occurred. Several wins and losses on both sides of the force. But there was one major war. The main clans that took part in this was NJL, JA and the new clan quicly becoming powerful PWC.There were to be 3 battles. 1 Mos Elsey assault and 2 Conquest battles. On the assault battle DJO won by a few points. But the next battle was coming closer and it was on Mustafar. When this battle took place NJL, JA, PWC and allies annihilated the forces of DJO and there allies. Soon after this battle DJO slowly died and was extinct for some time.</p>

<p>PWC also ahd its own problems. Poeple left and made a clan called JEDI. The 2 clans battled. Since PWC was the first NJL and JA sisded with them to fight JEDI. After several battles the wars stopped, no clans were destroyed and the 2 clans went on.</p>

<p>Soon trouble came to JA. After We, JA and NJL, destroyed DJO Sith was thought to have changed, but he didn't. Also Lord.Wolf came back to JA. When this happened we also let Sith join JA. Soon after Lord Wolf once again left the allies. But Sith Stayed in the clan. Quigon kicked out a member of JA because of him being in so many clans, Commander. When he was kicked he left and made his own clan. He was out to destroy Quigon. He supposively went to Sith our JA member for help. But Sith says it was JA members that asked Sith for help to destroy JA. This was thought to be SHRP. When SHRP was asked of this he said it was another members idea, PAVER. When PAVER was questioned he said it was SHRP. So we don't really no what happened. Sith just said that JA was to die from the inside out. Quigon and Milk refused to let this happen. After much questioning and debating and such the conflict was resolved. Shrp left the clan to get back at, he has done this a few times in JA, Quigon for letting Wolf join JA again.And sith left to make his own clan, like he always does.</p>

<p>About 6 weeks after NJL was made Quigon came up with an unimaginable idea. A merge between 2 great clans, NJL and JA. The leaders thought it was a good idea. The wars together, the helping, the friendships between the 2 allies. It was the greatest thing to happen to the allies. After planning it was decided to make JSUA, Jedi Sith United Alliance. New rules were made to take down the old, new ranks were created, new leaders were chosen from the 2 clans. New recruiting ideas were used. This was the start of an everlasting relationship.</p>

<p>JSUA was gaining power day by day. The clan was constantly training its members. No clan has ever had so many active members. All of the people that were recruited were about active(but this changed in the months to come). There were JSUA gaming servers up all the time. All memebrs were trained by leaders. Leaders thought their techniques of Sith &amp; Jedi battles. JSUA was becoming the most powerful clan and the most skilled clan. The most skilled leaders were Quigon(till his computer got taken), Milkman(till he became in-active), Lordvader, Jend Droga, Viper, and paver. Not being able to get a leader spot was made because after much talking JA and BOS noticed the rank of Leader being able to be reached cause problems. Especially since Sith was at it again.</p>

<p>After Sith left JA he made his own clan. Then soon after he took control of DJO again. Of coarse he started making his empires again. In response an old ally, PWC started making a rebel alliance. Of coarse JSUA joined. PWC resolved their conflict with JEDI and JEDI joined the rebel alliance also. Soon several clans had joined the rebel alliance. But it was not actually needed. The empires never developed and there were not many battles. the Sith left DJO. Sith was once again let into JSUA and he still continues to be in our clan to this day. Although DJO was still an enemy.</p>

<p>Soon after the empires died school was coming. Also Quigons sister took his good computer to collage and he could no longer play. Then within the next week school started for most of the members. We were no longer that much of an active clan because of this. Then i have heard there was war between DJO an JSUA and JSUA had won. DJO was almost dead but hung on by a string and is still alive. Soon after several members started leaving JSUA ,because some leaders weren't on and Jeng's Computer broke down. We are struggling to stay alive but its hard cause of school is getting in the way. But NOW HENSE FORTH THE 3rd OF OCTOBER JSUA IS GAINING ITS POWER BACK TO ITS RIGHTFUL POSITION.</p>

<p>SWO, Star Wars Order is an alliance we made. Viper a member of JSUA was talking to a member of the clan know as (DFA), this members name was DK(no it doesn't stand for Donkey Kong). They had a small talk over it and Jeng Droga Finalized the plan with the leaders of {IC} (DFA) (JSUA) &amp; (DL). Over time SWO Grew, as it Grew it let in more clans two of these clans were (ROS)&amp; -[=ASB=]-. (ROS) began to fade in its hate for the clan called (DJO). -[=ASB=]- started to blossom. -[=ASB=]- was made after the destruction of (JS45).</p>

Colour Revolt is an Oxford, Mississippi-based indie rock band. They first called their group Fletcher, but later changed it to Colour Revolt, a name taken from Edwin Abbott's 19th century social commentary Flatland. The band's plans to record its self-titled debut EP in a friend's basement in Jackson, Mississippi in August 2005 were disrupted by Hurricane Katrina, which filled the space with evacuees. Instead, they worked in the living room of the owner of the local Esperanza Plantation record label, which issued the self-titled disc on a small-scale basis in December 2005. Colour Revolt undertook a five-week national tour opening for Brand New in the summer of 2006. Tiny Evil, an imprint of Interscope Records, picked up the EP and gave it a national release on October 3, 2006. Members include lead singer, guitarist, and keyboard player Jesse Coppenbarger; guitarist Jimmy Cajoleas; guitarist, keyboard player, and singer Sean Kirkpatrick; drummer and singer Len Clark; and bassist Drew Mellon.</p>

<p>Boston's James O'Brien began writing early in life. In 1994 he left college for a year and lived in Framingham, Mass., where he worked in a gargoyle studio three days a week and wrote four days a week. During that time, he published his first short story "Jesus and May Ellen Frost" in Haunts magazine (issue #33).</p>
<p>In 1995, O'Brien returned to school, attending Clark University in Worcester, Mass. as a screen studies/philosopy major. He left the university in 1996 when finances were exhausted. That fall, he re-enrolled at Framingham State College and finished his Bachelor's of Arts in English by spring 1997.</p>
<p>Boston-based sculptor Jason Karakehian introduced O'Brien to acoustic singer/songwriter environs in 1996, at which point O'Brien switched his writing focus from fiction to song. In 1997, O'Brien moved to Mission Hill in Boston and has lived in the city since.</p>
<p>O'Brien was a touring songwriter from 1998 to 2004. He shared stages with underground luminaries such as Dan Bern, Freedy Johnston and Howie Day ... and with cult heroes like Tanya Donnelly, Kay Hanley and Juliana Hatfield. In those six years he released three albums and logged hundreds of thousands of miles on the road.</p>
<p>O'Brien's third album, "Church of the Kitchen Sink" garnered critical praise and his prominence on the national political folk scene prompted rock journalists to start asking quesitons, post 9/11. O'Brien played a concert in New York City at the Sidewalk Cafe on Avenue A on Sept. 12, 2001. Following the concert, he walked through lower Manhattan, observing the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of the previous day. O'Brien's identity as a political songwriter was the focus of interviews about post-9/11 songwriting in the Boston Globe, the Boston Phoenix and National Public Radio station WBUR 90.9 in Boston.</p>
<p>Political performance was not always a boon for O'Brien's career. From 1999 to 2001, O'Brien appeared frequently on WERS 88.9 at Emerson College in Boston. In 2001, prior to an interview, an on-air DJ informed O'Brien that he could not to discuss politics during the program. O'Brien did not comply with instructions. It was his last interview with the station's morning program staff.</p>
<p>In other arenas, O'Brien was tapped to review Bob Dylan's return to the Newport Folk Festival for Voice of America in 2002. In 2003, O'Brien organized a showcase concert, "Songs Not Bombs," in Nashville, Tenn. at the 15th Annual Folk Alliance conference. During that showcase, O'Brien joined singer/songwriter Karaugh Brown and Grammy award winner Bill Morrissey on stage. The three musicians collaboratively performed Dylan's "The Times They Are A' Changing," each singing a verse. In the audience: Newport Folk Festival organizers and Harvard Square's Club Passim alumnae who'd worked with Dylan in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>Back in Boston, in 2003, O'Brien continued to work with the songwriting scene as a documentarian, writing for Club Passim's mini-magazine, The Listening Room. He interviewed 1960s Folk Revival icon Jim Kweskin upon the release of Kweskin's first album in 20 years. The interview was published in The Listening Room in February and Kweskin's label, Blix Street, asked for and was granted to use the interview as part of their promotional campaign for the new record, titled "Now and Again."</p>
<p>From 1998 to 2005, O'Brien hosted the open stage at Club Passim.</p>
<p>During that time he watched a small group of Boston songwriters emerge to form the Counterfolk scene. Later, O'Brien would connect Counterfolk artist Michael Epstein with Boston music producer Jordan Tishler (who produced O'Brien's albums in 1999 and 2002). Tishler and Epstein would go on to record "Her Brilliant Fifteen," under Epstein's new moniker The Motion Sick. With that album, Boston's first Counterfolk band would receive national attention in spring 2006, in Spin Magazine. Additonally, O'Brien's writing in 2001 in The Listening Room about Counterfolk and its precedent, Antifolk in New York City, prompted public response from New York-based Antifolk founder Lach. Later in 2001, Lach was booked to play Club Passim as a representative of the Antifolk sound.</p>
<p>In the winter of 2005, O'Brien brought his touring career to a close. He now plays the occasional solo concert, the most recent of these was Sept. 1, 2006.</p>
<p>Journalism became a supplemental income for O'Brien in the winter of 2005 and 2006. After freelancing for several online sports and music magazines, he was hired to write for the Norwood Times in Norwood, Mass.</p>
<p>O'Brien became editor of the Norwood Times and the Canton Times in spring 2005.</p>
<p>James O'Brien is currently editor at Boston's Bulletin Newspapers. He works specifically with the West Roxbury Bulletin, the Hyde Park Bulletin and the City Edition of the newspaper which covers the neighborhoods of Jamaica Plain, Allston-Brighton and the North End. O'Brien also reports for all of the Bulletin newspapers.</p>
<p>On Oct. 31, 2006, James O'Brien opened www.Cinescare.com, an academic/film criticism site devoted to the study and promotion of horror cinema as a valuable drama.</p>
<p>James O'Brien is currently writing two books: A ghost story, Ghosts Upstairs, and biography of civil rights lawyer, Christopher King, titled American Lawyer.</p>
<p>He is married to singer/songwriter Karaugh Brown.</p>

<p>70.191.197.61 06:16, 25 November 2006 (UTC) The Snowball Derby is a 300-lap super late model stock car automobile race held annually at the half-mile Five Flags Speedway in Pensacola, Florida. The race has been contested every year since 1968 and is always run on the first weekend in December. The race has a reputation for attracting some of the bigger names in stock car racing due to the fact that it is run after most tracks and touring series have concluded their seasons. Due to the “all-star” nature of the race, the Snowball Derby is considered by many to be the most prestigious race in late model racing.</p>
<p>Past Snowball Derby winners: 1968 Wayne Niedecken 1969 Friday Hassler 1970 Wayne Niedecken 1971 Dickie Davis 1972 Ed Howe 1973 Dickie Davis 1974 Pete Hamilton 1975 Donnie Allison 1976 Darrell Waltrip 1977 Ronnie Sanders 1978 Dave Mader III 1979 Freddy Fryar 1980 Gary Balough 1981 Freddy Fryar 1982 Gene Morgan 1983 Micky Gibbs 1984 Butch Lindley 1985 Jody Ridley 1986 Gary Balough 1987 Butch Miller 1988 Ted Musgrave 1989 Rick Crawford 1990 Rich Bickle, Jr. 1991 Rich Bickle, Jr. 1992 Gary St. Amant 1993 Bobby Gill 1994 Tammy Jo Kirk 1995 Jeff Purvis 1996 Rich Bickle, Jr. 1997 Bobby Gill 1998 Rich Bickle, Jr. 1999 Rich Bickle, Jr. 2000 Gary St. Amant 2001 Wayne Anderson 2002 Ricky Turner 2003 Charle Bradberry 2004 Steven Wallace 2005 Eddie Mercer</p>

<p>Epademik is an independent and well-know rap/hip-hop artist from southern California. Born Jason Perea, Epademik is based in Orange County, California where he is a leading figure in the OC hip-hop scene and has performed and is especially well known throughout southern California and Arizona. Currently an independent rap/hip-hop artist, Epademik got his start in the music scene in the mid-1990s. Among his first projects was a stint in The Casual Crew, a hip-hop group that included his older brother as a member. Successful locally, Epademik recorded the EP Casual One with The Casual Crew. Following the breakup of The Casual Crew Epademik joined with rapper KO and in 2001 unveiled the album Drinkin, Smokin, Straight Westcoastin, under the name 100 Proof. The tracks on the 100 Proof album featured both KO and Epademik as lyricists, a combination that worked well together and produced a number of standout tracks.</p>
<p>After over a year of promoting the 100 Proof album through local shows and radio, Epademik began to focus on his own solo career. In 2004, Epademik released his first solo project, Listen at Your Own Risk. A largely satirical album, Listen at Your Own Risk features large amounts of black humor, yet the most memorable tracks are when Epademik turns to more serious subjects, such as on the confessional track Catch 22. Released nationally, the album found its greatest success locally in Epademik’s home community of Orange County. The track Act Like You Know even maintained the number one spot on the Long Beach City College radio station for six consecutive weeks. Following the success of Listen at Your Own Risk, Epademik released his sophomore album in July 2006, called The Third Finger. The album was released as a largely reactive album directed at the lack of talent among many contemporary and mainstream hip-hop artists. As Epademik noted in one interview the The Third Finger was “an act of ventilation.”</p>
<p>As of recent Epademik continues to advance his solo career and his place in both the OC and national hip-hop scene, as well as continuing to work and promote future projects. Despite being a largely independent and underground artist, Epademik’s work and songs have gained radio play nationally, on both the west and east coast.</p>
<p>Trivia:</p>
<p>Epademik got his name during his Casual Crew days when at a high school house party he successfully battled other would-be rappers on the dj’s microphone to the delight of the crowd, after which one friend told him he had been like a plague or epidemic.</p>

Owgei outlines the nursing care to be provided to a patient. It is a set of actions the nurse will implement to resolve nursing problems identified by assessment. The creation of the plan is an intermediate stage of the nursing process. It guides in the ongoing provision of nursing care and assists in the evaluation of that care.</p>
<p><br />
Characteristics of the Owgei It focuses on actions which are designed to solve or minimize the existing problem. It is a product of a deliberate systematic process. It relates to the future. It is based upon identifiable health and nursing problems. Its focus is holistic.</p>
<p>Elements of the plan In the USA, the nursing care plan consists of a NANDA nursing diagnosis with related factors and subjective and objective data that support the diagnosis, nursing outcome classifications with specified outcomes (or goals) to be achieved including deadlines, and nursing intervention classifications with specified interventions.</p>
<p><br />
The nursing process Care plans are formed using the nursing process. First the nurse collects subjective data and objective data, then organizes the data into a systematic pattern, such as Marjory Gordon's functional health patterns. This step helps identify the areas in which the client needs nursing care. Based on this, the nurse makes a nursing diagnosis. As mentioned above, the full nursing diagnosis also includes the relating factors and the evidence that supports the diagnosis. For example, a nurse may give the following diagnosis to a patient with pneumonia that has difficulty breathing: Ineffective Airway Clearance related to tracheobronchial infection (pneumonia) and excess thick secretions as evidenced by abnormal breath sounds; crackles, wheezes; change in rate and depth of respiration; and effective cough with sputum.</p>
<p>After determining the nursing diagnosis, the nurse must state the expected outcomes, or goals. A common method of formulating the expected outcomes is to reverse the nursing diagnosis, stating what evidence should be present in the absence of the problem. The expected outcomes must also contain a goal date. Following the example above, the expected out come would be: Effective airway clearance as evidenced by normal breath sounds; no crackles or wheezes; respiration rate 14-18/min; and no cough by 01/01/01.</p>
<p>After the goal is set, the nursing interventions must be established. This is the plan of nursing care to be followed to assist the client in recovery. The interventions must be specific, noting how often it is to be performed, so that any nurse or appropriate faculty can read and understand the care plan easily and follow the directions exactly. An example for the patient above would be: Instruct and assist client to TCDB (turn, cough, deep breathe) to assist in loosening and expectoration of mucous every 2 hours.</p>
<p>The evaluation is made on the goal date set. It is stated whether or not the client has met the goal, the evidence of whether or not the goal was met, and if the care plan is to be continued, discontinued or modified. If the care plan is problem-based and the client has recovered, the plan would be discontinued. If the client has not recovered, or if the care plan was written for a chronic illness or ongoing problem, it may be continued. If certain interventions are not helping or other interventions are to be added, the care plan is modified and continued.</p>
<p>There are also care plans written for "at risk" problems, as well as "wellness" care plans. These follow a similar format, only designed to prevent problems from happening and continue or promote healthy behavior.</p>

<p>Roy A. Tangen started in photography at an early age. In fact he was first published in the New York Daily News at 14 years old. At the time he was the youngest ever to be published in a major daily newspaper on a regular basis. He was a "stringer" for many years while attending High School in New York City and worked full time for the Brooklyn Eagle.

<p>The Cartoon starts off with Tom hiding under a dresser in a baby's nursery. Tom's new owner (a little girl) is yelling at him for running awey from her. Tom's owner gets to her knees and pulls Tom out from under the dresser. Tom is dressed in a pink bonnet, blue baby booties, and a white cloth diaper with two saftey pins. Tom is picked up and thrown into a crib. Tom's owner (little girl) tells Tom not to get out of his crib after feeding him a bottle of milk (She tells him that she's going out to buy a new girdle). The little girl leaves the nursery while Tom lies in the crib thinking he has the worst luck in the world. But after tasting the delicious milk Tom decides to play along and be a baby for a day. After taking a few sips of milk, Jerry enters. Jerry sees Tom and can't believe what he sees as Tom sits there pretending to be a baby. While Tom is distracted by his milk, Jerry runs to the other side of the nursery and turns on a phonograph that plays "Rock-a-bye Baby". Tom then jumps in the air, out of surprisement and looks over to find Jerry making fun of him. Tom then (out of anger) electes to chase Jerry around the nursery. Jerry runs into a dollhouse in the corner and puts a sign that says "Measels" on it to keep Tom at bay. Tom opens the upstairs bathroon window blind only to find Jerry pretending to bath. Jerry screams at Tom and hits him with a toy brush as if he's a peeping Tom. Jerry runs downstairs and into a bedroom and jumps in the bed. A doll erupts from the covers and frightings Jerry for a second. Jerry then gets an idea. Outside the dollhouse, Tom reaches into the bathroom window hoping to catch Jerry, when the door opens up. Jerry walks out dressed in the dolls clothing hoping to fool Tom into beliving he is a different mouse. After fooling Tom once, Jerry goes for an encore but his dress falls of and Tom pins him down by his tail. Tom tries to grab Jerry but Jerry escapes to the dollhouse again. Tom, sick of the dollhouse rips open the roof of the dollhouse so his head can fit hoping to see Jerry. With his head in the dollhouse, Tom's owner comes back to see Tom out of his crib. She yells at Tom, and Tom shocked, drops the roof on his head. Tom manages to get free and pulls himself out only to get yelled at further by his owner. Tom is put back into his crib by his owner and is givin more milk. The little girl tells him this time that if he gets out one more time she'll feed him Castor oil. After she leaves again, Tom gets up angerly but decides to ignore Jerry and continue being a baby after seeing his milk. Tom continues to act like a baby. After seeing this Jerry decides to get reinforcements as he makes his way toward the open window. Jerry spots three alley cats (Butch, Meathead, and Shorty) going threw some garbage. Jerry lures the alley cats in by using himself as bait. But instead of finding Jerry when they walk in, they find Tom dressed and acting like a baby. Butch and company start singing "Rock-a-bye Baby" and make fun of Tom. Tom, now extremly mad, runs over to Butch and company.</p>
<p>Tom stares angerly at them but Butch and company just say "A-goo" and Tom is confused. Butch and company decide that thier going to have a little fun with Tom. While Tom stands there confused, Butch grabs Tom's bonnets laces, and pulls which stuns Tom. While Tom is stunned, Butch pulls open Tom's diaper from the front and stuffs his head and hands inside. Butch closes Tom's diaper, and rolls him back into his crib. Tom pulls himself out of his diaper and takes shelter under his blanket and puts his bottle in his mouth. Butch comes over and gives Tom "Rock-a-byes" and "Goochie goos". Then Butch steals Tom's bottle and drinks all his milk. Butch then puts the rubber stopper on Tom's nose and pulls back. Butch then releases the rubber stopper which snaps back on Tom's nose. Tom then stands up one last time, but Butch just blows into the rubber stopper which inflates Tom's head and then inflates the rubber stopper after deflating his head. Butch calmly picks up a saftey pin and pops the rubber stopper sending Tom flying in the air and landing back into his crib defenseless. Seeing the oppertunity at hand, Butch picks up Tom and gives him "Opps-a-daisys". The first one is normal, the second one is high and Tom hits his head on the ceiling and Butch dosen't catch him so he bounces of the floor right into Butch's hands, the third one is a forward motion in which Butch passes to Meathead who passes it to Shorty who throws Tom into a fishbowl diaper first. Tom manages to pull himself free but his diaper is soaking wet. Tom looks at Butch and company but Butch just says "Aww...he fell in the fish bowl". Tom tries to dry his wet diaper by shaking it but Shorty comes by and pulls Tom into a toy stroller and takes him to a changing table where he launches Tom on. Butch then puts on a baby bib like a doctors mask and orders Shorty to knock him out which he does (to prevent Tom from refusing). Butch pulls off Tom's wet diaper and applys a new one as well as Baby powder, Baby oil, Saftey pins, and because Tom's diaper didn't stay dry, a big, streachy, yellow pair of rubber pants.</p>
<p>Butch then opens Tom's rubber pants and Shorty throws the fish from the fishbowl into Tom's rubber pants which starts off the song " Mama Yo Quiro" from Carmen with Shorty on vocals, Tom's rubber pants as the bass and his whiskers as strings. The little girl though reappears just in time to see Tom out of his crib. The little girl yells "Baby". Butch and company then scram as Tom is left for punishment. Tom is put into a high chair and attempted to be feed Castor oil. Tom refuses to open his mouth, but Jerry snaps Tom's tail with a lobster claw opener and Tom scrams. Taking full advantage of this, the little girl fills Tom's mouth with Castor oil. Tom gags and runs to the window and upchucks. Jerry laughs at Tom, but Tom knocked over the Castor oil on his way to the window. Castor oil pours into Jerry's mouth electing him to as well to the window to upchuck.</p>

<p>69.125.193.25 23:36, 25 November 2006 (UTC) The Contraharmonic Mean of a set of positive numbers is defined as the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arithmetic_mean.html" title="Arithmetic mean">Arithmetic mean</a> of the squares of the numbers divided by the Arithmetic mean of the numbers: <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/2/6/c267183a5c87ddca57c262e3c015f638.png" alt="C(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) ={ { (x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_n^2) \over n} \over {(x_1+x_2+...+x_n) \over n}} \quad where \quad \forall i \quad x_i &gt; 0 \" /><br />

<img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/9/8/19887fa7848bee0682792249045b8c0d.png" alt="1)\  MIN(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \le C(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \le MAX(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)&#160;; \" /><br />
<img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/1/5/81597edba770c11f7985eea87fc2cca4.png" alt="2) \  C(t*x_1, t*x_2, ..., t*x_n) = t*C(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)\ for \ t &gt; 0" /><br />
Note that Property 1) implies that for all k &gt;0 C(k, k, ..., k) = k (fixed point property).<br />
For just two variables, a and b, taken as <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/d/c/3dc4ea4fa5bd921f8096299071a317f1.png" alt="0 &lt; a \le b" /> it is easier to see why this mean if complementary to the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonic_mean.html" title="Harmonic mean">Harmonic mean</a>. In the case of just two variables the Contraharmonic mean C(a,b) is also that mean that is as high above the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arithmetic_mean.html" title="Arithmetic mean">Arithmetic mean</a> as the Arithmetic mean is above the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonic_mean.html" title="Harmonic mean">Harmonic mean</a>:</p>
<p><b>C(a,b) - A(a,b) = A(a,b) - H(a,b) or C(a,b) = 2*A(a,b) - H(a,b)</b></p>
<p>From the formulas for the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arithmetic_mean.html" title="Arithmetic mean">Arithmetic mean</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonic_mean.html" title="Harmonic mean">Harmonic mean</a> of two variables we have&#160;:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/3/f/53f323614578cea002271d2bbd7b6e04.png" alt="A(a,b) = {{(a+b)} \over 2}" /> and<br />
<img class='tex' src="../../../math/0/d/4/0d48a9e270034fb8c9eed152cd95969f.png" alt="H(a,b) = {1 \over {{1 \over 2}*{({1 \over a} + {1 \over b})}}}" /> = <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/c/a/eca2174b3d4b7afaa64659f1f4a55f85.png" alt="{2ab} \over {a+b}" /><br />
<img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/4/1/241026f3bdffff1567568b8d2d1fa1cb.png" alt="C(a,b) = 2*A(a,b) - H(a,b) = (a+b)- {{2ab} \over {a+b}}" /><br />
<img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/0/0/b00bbbf9aa077a16cca2160d90f9e583.png" alt="C(a,b) = { {(a+b)^2 - 2ab } \over {a+b}} = {{a^2 + b^2} \over {a+b}}" /><br />
<br />
Notice that for two variables the Average of the Harmonic and Contraharmonic means is exactly equal to the Arithmetic mean:<br />
<b>A( H(a,b), C(a,b) ) = A(a,b)</b><br />
Also note that as <i>a</i> gets closer to 0 then H(a,b) also gets closer to 0. The Harmonic mean is very sensitive to low values. On the other hand, the Contraharmonic mean is sensitive to larger values, so as <i>a</i> approaches 0 then C(a,b) approaches <i>b</i> (so their average remains A(a,b) ).<br />
The Contraharmonic mean has the property that it is higher in value than the Average and also higher than the <a href="../../../r/o/o/Root_mean_square.html" title="Root mean square">Root mean square</a>&#160;: <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/0/0/4007b74b034085d034f71db23554f64b.png" alt="min(a,b) &lt; H(a,b) &lt; G(a,b) &lt; L(a,b) &lt; A(a,b) &lt; R(a,b) &lt; C(a,b) &lt; Max(a,b) \ for \ 0&lt;a&lt;b" /> Where <b>H</b> is the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonic_mean.html" title="Harmonic mean">Harmonic mean</a>, <b>G</b> is <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geometric_mean.html" title="Geometric mean">Geometric mean</a>, <b>L</b> is the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logarithmic_mean.html" title="Logarithmic mean">Logarithmic mean</a>, <b>A</b> is the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arithmetic_mean.html" title="Arithmetic mean">Arithmetic mean</a>, <b>R</b> is the <a href="../../../r/o/o/Root_mean_square.html" title="Root mean square">Root mean square</a> and <b>C</b> is the Contraharmonic mean. If <i>a</i> could be equal to <i>b</i> then the above <span class="texhtml">&lt;</span> signs can be replaced by <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/9/d/49dc1443f33cf63082d6e193dd2af78f.png" alt="\le" />. When a=b the above chain of comparisons collapses to the same value, a.<br />
There are two other notable relationships between 2-variable means. First, the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geometric_mean.html" title="Geometric mean">Geometric mean</a> of the arithmetic and harmonic means is equal to the Geometric mean of the two values&#160;:<br />
<img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/1/2/212c6ff6e36ecb48f710bb4fd468b071.png" alt="G( A(a,b), H(a,b) )=G({{a+b}\over 2}, {{2ab}\over {a+b}}) =  \sqrt {{{a+b}\over 2}*{{2ab}\over {a+b}}} = \sqrt{ab} = G(a,b)" /><br />
The second relationship is that the Geometric mean of the arithmetic and contraharmonic means is the <a href="../../../r/o/o/Root_mean_square.html" title="Root mean square">Root mean square</a>:<br />
<img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/a/2/5a20048150812fede923576307dc12f5.png" alt="G( A(a,b), C(a,b) )=G({{a+b}\over 2}, {{a^2+b^2}\over {a+b}}) =" /> <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/b/3/db31f596063ff37557ad5f4bddbcb53c.png" alt="\sqrt{{{a+b}\over 2}*{{a^2+b^2}\over {a+b}}} = \sqrt{{{a^2+b^2}\over 2}} = R(a,b)" /><br />
The Contraharmonic mean of two variables can be constructed geometrically using a trapezoid (see <a href="http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMT668/EMAT6680.2000/Umberger/EMAT6690smu/Essay3smu/Conharm.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMT668/EMAT6680.2000/Umberger/EMAT6690smu/Essay3smu/Conharm.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> ).<br />
You can also construct it using a circle similar to the way the <a href="../../../p/y/t/Pythagorean_means.html" title="Pythagorean means">Pythagorean means</a> of two variables are constructed.<br />
Basically, the Contraharmonic mean is the rest of the diagonal on which the Harmonic mean lies. Their sum is always the length of the diagonal (a+b) of the circle that shows the Pythagorean means (see Pythagorean means on MathWorld at <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PythagoreanMeans.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PythagoreanMeans.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> ).</p>

<p><br />
The Contraharmonic mean is useful in signal processing. For example, a contraharmonic filter can remove <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_and_pepper_noise.html" title="Salt and pepper noise">Salt and pepper noise</a> from a picture.<br />
In addition it is a useful descriptive statistic since it is sensitive to the larger values in a set.<br />
An analysis of the arithmetic, harmonic and contraharmonic means can yield information about the relative importance of very large or very small values.</p>
