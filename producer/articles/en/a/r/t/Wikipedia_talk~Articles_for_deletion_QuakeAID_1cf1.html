<p>The fact is that one of the users above specifically stated that they objected to QuakeAID's entry BECAUSE Baou Trust did not have a page itself. So I created one. I did not want to because it is not our focus. Remove Baou Trust if you want. I, but more importantly, our founder Katerina Theohari DOES NOT want a page for Baou Trust. I was asked to add it AFTER I explained the complaint that was being made by one of the above users. It is a nonsense to object to QuakeAID because Baou Trust does not have a page and then complaint that Baou Trust is trying to promote itself.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that Ms Theohari did not authorize the page regarding her painting. I published the information there because it explains or suggests how she obtained the considerable funding that is spent on endeavors such as QuakeAID. Remove the page for Kaith, if you want, it matters not to her or to me.</p>
<p><a href="../../../q/u/a/QuakeAID_76cd.html" title="QuakeAID">QuakeAID</a> is a legitimate organization whether users of this service like it or not and will continue to provide funding, research and educational information irrespective of your comments or action regarding the page published here. The only negative element of the proposed deletion is that if it is done, users of this service will not find reference to QuakeAID. That may or may not negatively effect QuakeAID, but it will demonstrate that because of a single user <a href="../../../r/a/d/RaD_Man_2e7f.html" title="RaD Man"><b>RaD Man</b></a>, your service is subject to and the victim of arbitrary censorship. But of course, you already know that because it has happened before; reference <a href="../../../r/a/d/RaD_Man_2e7f.html" title="RaD Man"><b>RaD Man</b></a>'s own comments, "If you stalk my habits, then you know I'm not a deletionist by nature." Where I come from one should need to make such a comment, it merely confirms the initial suggestion. Actions speak louder than words. It is perhaps why QuakeAID does not spend alot of time flouting its activities. We're too busy doing. I tried to convince Ms Theohari on the value of the Internet but her instincts, as usual, were correct. <s><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../q/u/a/QuakeAID_76cd.html" title="QuakeAID">QuakeAID</a></s> --BAOU 06:36, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please do not double vote. Your edit history is proof positive that you are indeed SPAMMING Wikipedia. There is absolutely no question about that. As I said before, I will be the first to openly apologize if someone (independant) can volunteer information that indicates that QuakeAID is not a fraud. As it stands, you have been <b>(a)</b> carelessly erasing Talk pages from numerous articles, <b>(b)</b> adding completely non-notable artists (who carry <i>less than 9 Google hits</i>) who are directly related to your Bauo corporation, <b>(c)</b> there is no documentation visible that indicates you are a non-profit organization of any sort, and <b>(d)</b> you've been spamming links left and right to QuakeAID, Bauo Trust and your news wire website (all people and organizations you are personally affiliated with and related to and virtually unknown to anyone except your subsidary companies) looks pretty goddamn shady to me.

Sad really. You deleted all of the comments that were made to refute the inaccurate information published (by you). Nice one. There is no proof of anything except that you have altogether too much authority in the management of this resource. I note that you removed my original vote as well. Nice one.

&gt; Dear Mr Wales,
&gt; 
&gt; I am preparing an article on the apparent attack against QuakeAID, a 
&gt; charity organized for the benefit of earthquake victims, by one of your 
&gt; services (Wikipedia) administrators: RaD Man.
&gt; 
&gt; Please note that OfficialWire.com is owned by Baou, Inc., which is owned 
&gt; by Baou Trust (New York), and that QuakeAID received financial 
&gt; assistance from Baou Trust.
&gt; 
&gt; In any event, for some days, this person has launched a personal attack 
&gt; against QuakeAID, criticizing the company's website, its methods of 
&gt; business and claiming that it is involved in fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; He has published numerous slanderous statements about the organization 
&gt; to your company's website.
&gt; 
&gt; Whilst I recognize that your website is an open source resource, the 
&gt; materials found there are unquestionably slanderous and based on nothing 
&gt; except, according to your admin's own statement, the lack of references 
&gt; about QuakeAID in Google.
&gt; 
&gt; I am writing an article about the apparent power this person has within 
&gt; your organization, to edit content, remove comments refuting untrue 
&gt; statements and his obvious attack against a reputable charity that has 
&gt; been in operation since 1998, before your company existed.
&gt; 
&gt; Please reply.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you,
&gt;

<li>Jennifer, I am not an administrator or sysop of any sort on Wikipedia. While I've made several thousand edits here and try to do my part to contribute and preserve (yes, preserve), I am just a regular Wikipedia user like most everyone else. I do find it laughable that you refer to yourself as a "reputable charity" which has been in existence since 1998 yet in 2005 is still not recognized by the U.S. government as an actual charitable non-profit agency. Your actions are all pretty transparent and at this point fairly predictable. Keep up the good work. â€”<a href="../../../r/a/d/RaD_Man_2e7f.html" title="RaD Man"><b>RaD Man</b></a> (<i>talk</i>) 08:19, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I agree with the general sentiment that this is a highly dubious "charity": I can't tell at all how many donations they've received in the past and what exactly they did with that money. It's also strange that the only way to donate is through a recurring membership subscription. But that's not primarily what's at issue in this vote.</p>
<p>I do see some evidence for notability, plus the article clearly has the potential to become an NPOV source of information eventually (it's already much better than the first revision). It is also pretty clear that the article was created by someone directly involved with this charity, possibly with the goal of self-promotion. But we're past that now. Like I said above, the current revision contains valuable information from background research done by WP editors. Information that does not seem to be present anywhere else on the web, like the list of missing reviews from BBB and similar organizations, or the fact that this charity is not a tax-exempt not-for-profit corporation under US law.</p>
<p>IMHO it is better to take the NPOV inclusionist road with self-promoters and spammers that are marginally notable. Someone thinks they can get free advertising, but on WP there is no such thing as a free launch. What they will get instead is an NPOV article that mentions the bad and the ugly as well. That is a valuable contribution: especially now that people may be looking for information on QuakeAid, a reader is in a much better position to judge what's going on based on this article, compared with most (all?) other secondary sources of information on the web. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 14:52, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mark. I understand your point on notability. I myself spent my time researched about their website's Wayback Machine log, I too want to keep those valuable info intact for others to see. But the fact is that, the <b>original QuakeAID info</b>, by user BAOU, is <b>non-notable</b>; because as I said, it is highly dubious in factual accuracy. Let me try to put it this way, we are torn between <b>user BAOU's dubious contribution</b> and <b>the factual research info</b> that is done in response to refute the original dubious info, and the dilemma is that they are <i>technically</i> on the same page (but noted that they are not <i>logically</i> on the same page though; because the <i>true</i> knowledge <i>copying</i> is done in our minds, not in the communication medium, whether it's in Wikipedia's database or on paper).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, after giving some thoughts on this dilemma, I've decided to vote for deletion; because it's very obvious that the original info by user BAOU is highly dubious, and not to mention its social impact during such a vulnerable time of unprecendented global disaster for Humanity now. I don't recommend that we give in to those dubious info with negative social impact, solely because we want to keep our own stuff (research info, rebuttals). In fact, we can always move the factual research info into other pages, and then reference QuakeAID as a <b>case study</b> of such incident/dispute.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My secondary alternative besides deletion is to <b>lock the QuakeAID page indefinitely</b> (effectively making it a static case study page), until the dubious matters it involves is resolved, at least to some acceptable degree of clarity (e.g. Law Enforcement investigating QuakeAID).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then you could ask me: what is the difference between a "locked case study page" and an "openly editable live page" of QuakeAID? The answer is <b>revert wars</b>. In this special case dealing with user BAOU, s/he was quite persistently "defending" herself and her "charitable organization" with constant personal attacks and evasive maneuvers (see this main page and talk page). It seems to me that she will be unlikely to avoid an epic revert war, solely for continuing her "personal defence". The sole notable casualty of this possible war will be <b>our readers</b>, whom will be exposed to constant revision after revision, revert after revert, on merely <b>insisting</b>, without factual support, that QuakeAID, the dubious organization in question, is indeed factual as claimed, by user BAOU, who practices limitless personal attacks and evasive maneuvers; but obviously we all know, with factual research, that it's dubious at its best.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And this is why I voted for <b>Deletion</b>. --<a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGodrickwok_251b.html" title="User:Godrickwok">Godric</a> 19:24, Jan 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I understand and share your concerns. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if QuakeAID was operating on the fringe of legality, though they appear to be very clever in not making any specific promises. I also agree that the kind of article that BAOU (or should we say "Kathy") has been pushing for is unacceptable. However, I still think that a reasonable NPOV article could be maintained and that it would be a useful thing to have. Like you said, people will now be searching the web for charitable organizations that promise to help quake victims. Where can they find objective, independent information about QuakeAID? I'd say Wikipedia is perhaps the only prominent place. For me the only question is whether QuakeAID is inherently notable. It's perhaps a borderline case, but I'd say it passes the notability test for me (it's a registered corporation, they have an online presence, so what if that's only due to self-promotion). When I first saw the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sollog.html" title="Sollog">Sollog</a> article, I nominated it for deletion. It was a similar situation, perhaps worse because the guy behind Sollog suffers from some form of personality disorder and is generally incapable of rational exchanges, plus he's quite the sockpuppeteer. However while I was arguing for deletion or protection, several editors convinced me to at least try the open approach that's normal on Wikipedia. Sure, Sollog keeps pushing his POV, but these futile attempts get reverted within minutes. We've seen revert wars, page blanking, vandalism, profanity, sockpuppetry, posting from open proxies, phone calls to Jimmy Wales, homophobia, legal and other threats, prophecies of eternal doom, fake court orders, verbal attacks against Jimmy Wales's wife and daughter, the creation of wikipedia hate sites, among many other strategies from presumably a single person. This even escalated to include Slashdot at some point. While some of these attacks are painful and reprehensible, they have had no effect on the Sollog article itself, thanks to extremely vigilant editors. I don't think it can get much worse here, but I could be wrong. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 22:55, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another thing. There are some striking parallels to the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sollog.html" title="Sollog">Sollog</a> case: the first revision was an act of vanity/self-promotion, the creators run their own news outlet and domain registration service, which are based in classic off-shore tax shelters, their notability is mainly due to shameless self-promotion, both are concerned with earthquakes, both also promote their own fine art, etc. However, Sollog appears to involve less than a handful of people, possibly only one main actor. Yet the result of the VfD on Sollog was to keep the article (trying to make/keep it NPOV is another story). I agree with all your objections against the <b>organization</b> QuakeAid, but they are not necessarily objections against the <b>article</b> about this organization. I agree in particular that calling it a "charity" is POV, but that means the wording should be changed to something more like "claims to be a charity but is not recognized by the IRS as a charitable organization for tax purposes, unlike [list of a few real chairities]". --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 18:53, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry that I'll investigate <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sollog.html" title="Sollog">Sollog</a> in depth later, I just skimmed through it a bit. However, I have a technical &amp; legal question about Deletion in mind now, and I'd like to know whether or not you guys know something about it already.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By GFDL, every text content submitted into Wikipedia is also GFDL-ed. This means that all the content that user BAOU submitted about her "charitable organization(s)" is <b>now accessible to all GFDL compatible usage</b>, and this is probably why user BAOU feared about this, thus saying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OfficialWire&amp;diff=9071042&amp;oldid=9070723" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OfficialWire&amp;diff=9071042&amp;oldid=9070723" rel="nofollow">this</a> in desperation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I guess I can relate this (GFDL-Deletion issue) to your concern Mark. If we deleted all of these dubious, but nonetheless GFDL-ed contents; would this act of <b>permanent deletion</b> effectively <b>revoked</b>, though not legally, but technically, the permission already granted by user BOAU to any other GFDL-usage (e.g. Wikipedia)?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And my last question is that, is Wikipedia's deletion permenant? Thus technically (based on MediaWiki's coding) acts like vanishing into thin air; therefore the GFDL-ed material, though dubious, will cease to exist upon deletion, thus effectively revoked the GFDL upon the completion of deletion?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'll look into the matter of MediaWiki's internal mechanism myself a while later. Here I just want to raise the concern between GFDL-revoke and MediaWiki's deletion mechanism. --<a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGodrickwok_251b.html" title="User:Godrickwok">Godric</a> 19:58, Jan 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure I understand what the issue is. I'd say (IANAL) that BAOU published her contributions under a GFDL license, which makes it possible for Wikipedia to create and publish derived works under the same (or compatible) license. There is no obligation to publish anything here, either the original version or any derived versions. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a> 22:55, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I noticed that <a href="../../../b/a/o/Baou_Trust_11d7.html" title="Baou Trust">Baou_Trust</a> is deleted now. Is the content of it <b>permanently unretrievable</b> after this deletion, at least from an editor point of view?</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My point was, if I don't have a copy of Boau_Trust at hand, and it's now deleted in Wikipedia; to me, it's content is forever lost. If everyone also doesn't have a copy of it after deletion in wikipedia, then it's forgotten. Therefore, we can never retrieve its GFDL-ed content anymore, thus effectively "revoked" <a href="../../../b/a/o/Baou_Trust_11d7.html" title="Baou Trust">Baou_Trust</a>'s GFDL-usage upon deletion. --<a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGodrickwok_251b.html" title="User:Godrickwok">Godric</a> 17:38, Jan 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
