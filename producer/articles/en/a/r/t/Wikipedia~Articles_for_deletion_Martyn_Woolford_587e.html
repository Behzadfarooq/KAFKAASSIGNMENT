<li><b>Comment</b> I'd recommend being very wary of using soccerbase as the way of backing this up. Nathan Talbott has played in the league for Yeovil Town according to the Stafford Rangers website for example.

<dd><b>Further comment and a suggestion</b>. Talbott and Flynn are the only two who appear to have played a game at a higher level than the Conference (I've added to those two articles to clarify this). Danny Edwards did not, the Edwards that played for Shrewsbury in 2002-03 was Dave Edwards. Not sure about Ged Murphy as he may or may not have played for Oldham. If the others are to be deleted, how about transferring the details to a section on the club page about non-notable (in the WP:BIO) sense players? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiGull_0eb2.html" title="User:WikiGull">WikiGull</a> 10:28, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Strong Keep - There is very little difference in standard between League 2 and the Conference.

<p><b>Reply</b> I would argue the Conference is the lowest league that should have player profiles in its own right as it is a professional league (personally I think 5 full time divisions is too many) , Conference North and South are not so any profiles should only be for players who have dropped down. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam4eva_d312.html" title="User:Ram4eva">Ram4eva</a> 19:31, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So your telling me, hours of work on professional footballers is just going to be deleted off because they are not in the top flight, please! And what do you mean you could write an article about yourself, you have, it's called your user profile, wake up!. All I'm saying is that the lower down teams deserve as much recognition as the Premiership, these players still go out on Saturday afternoon and play football for 90 minutes and if you ask me, a better quality of football than the Premiership sometimes. If there was a profile for every player in the Conference who would that be hurting? No one. it would just educate people. I think some people need to stop being so picky. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonesy702_ac13.html" title="User:Jonesy702">Jonesy702</a> 22:38, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I'm not saying these players should be deleted because they're not playing in the top flight, don't put words in my mouth. The point is, if Wikipedia is to maintain its standards, there has to be a point whether you're either worthy of a page or not. According to guidelines <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, Conference players are the wrong side of that line, so they should be deleted. The point I was trying to make with "an article about myself" (and by the way, the userpage shouldn't really be an article about oneself!) is that you can't use the justification that people have put time into something as grounds for keeping it. One could create an article on something utterly trivial (like me!) and devote huge amounts of time to it, but that doesn't mean it's worthy of a place on Wikipedia.

<dd>So what you are saying is if a team is relegated from League 2, all the profiles for each and every player should be deleted? and if your own userpage should not "really be an article about oneself", who should it be about? -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonesy702_ac13.html" title="User:Jonesy702">Jonesy702</a> 01:19, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>No. If a player plays in League 2 or above they pass notability criteria. That's why I haven't nominated every single player in the Conference. All the players (well, not all, I've made a couple of mistakes) have only played as high as the Conference, and thus do not pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<dd>One thing is that the BBC, Sky Sports websites etc all give as much coverage on the Conference as they do on other leagues; the BBC site has profiles for all Conference National clubs, and Sky Sports provides news for them. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattythewhite_4aa4.html" title="User:Mattythewhite">Mattythewhite</a> 10:46, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Fair point, but I'd argue that the press covers them far less. You might get a report on League 2 sides in the papers, but it's very unlikely you'll see anything but results for Conference sides. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornetMike_bb8b.html" title="User:HornetMike">HornetMike</a> 11:08, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>erm Danny Edwards HAS played for shewsbury, i saw him play for them in a competitive match. Also Ged Murphy has played in for Oldham Athletic during his time there.

<dd>Sorry, but the principle of an encyclopedia is that it requires sources in order to make the information verifiable. If you can provide sources to show that these players played, then please do, but we can't just take the recollection of someone who may or may not have seen them when there is no other evidence- in effect, to do otherwise would be to accept original research, as odd as that might sound. I myself strongly disagree with opening the floodgates to allow semi-professional footballers at conference and conference north/south level, but this is of course open to debate. You may wish to argue with the point at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Football_158d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Football">Wikipedia:WikiProject Football</a>, and establish a new consensus of notability. The state at the moment, however, is that the players (with the exception of the few noted above) fall below the level of notability established by consensus at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, that is, footballers who have played in a <i>fully professional league</i>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 15:52, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah I have to agree, some hard work has been put into these profiles and it shouldn't matter whether they are world class players or semi professionals, people work hard to make these profiles for others benefit, I cannot believe some people have the time to go over wikipedia with a fine toothcombe looking for things they don't like, my advice is get a life pal, there are more important things in life than deleting off profiles of players that you don't like. Anyway Hornet man the way Watford are playing they will soon be in the Conference and we can delete off all their profiles when that happens.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Parslow, Flynn, Talbott and Maamria based on above discussions. <b>Delete</b> others. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtVandelay13_daad.html" title="User:ArtVandelay13">ArtVandelay13</a> 17:07, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> - particularly those who have played one or more league games, U-21 internationals, or who have represented the English National Game XI. My experience is that Conference clubs/players DO get almost as much write up as their League 2 equivalents - the results are read out on Final Score/5 Live etc, and listed in the same newspapers as the League 2 results. Bookies offer odds on them the same way as League 2 games. Plus, there is a 60-page newspaper each week "The Non-League Paper", of which probably half is dedicated to Conference reports/features/speculation etc. Not to mention local sources. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 17:48, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'd just like to point out that this debate is lurching towards a generalised discussion on whether or not Conference players should be considered notable. As the current <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines say they aren't (not a fully professional league) surely such a discussion is better suited to <a href="../../../f/o/o/WP%7EFOOTBALL_ce84.html" title="WP:FOOTBALL">WP:FOOTBALL</a> where the supporters of this view could endeavour to establish a consensus for changing the guidlines.....? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 18:22, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> with the possible exception of Flynn and Maamria if their brief careers as professionals are shown to have non-trivial media coverage - though no sources demonstrating this have yet been provided. Talbott's professional career consists of a single substitute appearance which did not merit a mention in the local press report about the match <a href="http://archive.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/2004/4/22/17648.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://archive.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/2004/4/22/17648.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldelpaso_61eb.html" title="User:Oldelpaso">Oldelpaso</a> 18:25, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> - fail to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If the Keepers wish to make Conference players notable then this should be done through a separate policy proposal. The only basis for a keep would be multiple non-trivial sources that have not been produced. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 04:26, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep Nathan Talbott, Lee Flynn and Daniel Parslow</b> Nathan Talbott made fl appearance for Yeovil Town. Lee Flynn played for Barnet when they were in Football League.

<li><b>Comment</b> Soccerbase is, in no way, a definitive reference source.
