<li><b>Keep</b> - This is a fairly notable series, unlike most random fan-fiction this is well respected and heard of by people outside the community <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfsbane_Kane_1cb2.html" title="User:Wolfsbane Kane">Wolfsbane Kane</a> 12:52, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - They're also listed in a variety of other news source as well, including CNN. IMDB.com also has a page dedicated to this fan series as well. Despite the fact that it may be of poor quality or laughable storylines, it does have the virtue of being the Longest Running Fan Series for Star Trek, and one of the first to attempt to sucessfully recreate the Live Action series style from the professional TV series productions - 59.167.44.106 00:09, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Just in being a venture lasting many years with a large following grants it being in Wiki. Wiki is not just about history and many works of literature that are separate from the original venture, such as in Star Wars have been allowed to remain so this should be allowed to have its own page. Wiki is about bringing knowledge to the people and it would be inappropriate to make it harder to get information of this fan series. Lord_Hawk 18:13, 7 June 2006 (UTC-8)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Articles like this are the reason I began getting involved with Wikipedia several years ago. Something should not be deleted because a small number consider it stupid or unnecessary. This is supposed to be a fountain of knowledge, an Encyclopedia that covers all subjects. If you remove this and similar articles, what is to prevent someone from making a case to remove all articles about other small subjects. When someone is curious about something, this needs to remain the place to look, and if you remove this article, you are taking away one of the valuable assets of this be a free (in charge and thought) encyclopedia, focusing on things that For-Profit encyclopedias don't focus on. <a href="../../../t/e/g/User%7ETEG24601_3314.html" title="User:TEG24601">TEG</a> 17:31, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Aside from it being a well known fan project, the series itself is an example of the effects a franchise such as Star Trek has on fans and followers and, in this case, the internet community. Therefore it should be kept on a site that promotes learning. decapattack_uk 19:40, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
