<p>Character(s) from a upcoming TV show on ABC called <a href="../../../u/g/l/Ugly_Betty_f2d7.html" title="Ugly Betty">Ugly Betty</a>, which has not premiered yet. WP is not a crystal ball, and I don't think it is necessary or notable to have every character from this show, which has yet to be determined to be popular or notable in the long run since it has not premiered, to have their own article. What if the ratings tumble and it gets cancelled in 5 weeks? It's not out of the question. This could also be considered fancruft and original research, and it may have been lifted from promo materials. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 03:21, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The thing is, we have standards here, and we can't go around and make exceptions like that. Just because someone "worked" hard to create the articles does not mean that they are instantly notable or should be kept. Yes, the show has a fair amount of hype, but that doesn't mean that the show will be sucessful. I think it's best to delete/merge the articles until it can be assumed that the characters are notable (if ever). <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 13:38, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My point is what's the big deal about waiting one month? Many articles are listed as stubs with only 2-3 sentences and they are kept sitting around for months "in case someone decides to expand it". One month won't kill anybody. Regarding "we have standards", "Wikipedia is not a beaucracy." It isn't necessary to make a decision immediately--monitoring relevant external events for a short period is the best approach. <b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickReinckens_8aaa.html" title="User:RickReinckens">RickReinckens</a> 02:27, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</b>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, you're wrong, simple as that. There is a problem waiting another month or so as we can't just make exceptions for articles. Odds are, the article will be merged or such, and if it's certified as a notable show to allow character pages, then perhaps they can be recreated at a later date. WP is not a crystal ball, and we can't just forcast what is notable. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 04:32, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I really don't think the reasoning for this vote is valid. Yes, it did get decent ratings, but that doesn't mean that the show would be kept long-term at this point. And Lost and Desperate Housewives are confirmed hits and have been around for a few years, this show has only aired one episode and probably got the high ratings mainly on curiosity and the fact that Grey's Anatomy was on afterwards. Even a show like <a href="../../../w/e/_/We_Got_it_Made_c419.html" title="We Got it Made">We Got it Made</a> got pretty high ratings at first, but that show got dumped fairly quickly, and not even all of the actors on the show have articles, let alone characters. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 20:07, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../u/g/l/Ugly_Betty_f2d7.html" title="Ugly Betty">Ugly Betty</a>. The previous versions of this show have had at least moderate (often great) success in many other countries, including Russia, Spain, Columbia, and Mexico. Also, with the large Latino population in the United States, there are many people within the country who are familiar with the show already. While the jury is out on how it will fare in the US, I think that given its previous track record, the hype surrounding the show, and the great ratings it has recieved so far, so what's the harm in simply merging them with the Ugly Betty page and going from there in a month or so?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> for <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Suarez_4cb6.html" title="Betty Suarez">Betty Suarez</a> and <b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../u/g/l/Ugly_Betty_f2d7.html" title="Ugly Betty">Ugly Betty</a> for the rest. In time, the supporting characters could branch out into their own articles, but right now there isn't enough information in those articles to keep them seperate. - <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperlex_32b0.html" title="User:Superlex">Lex</a> 05:11, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I hate that I'm making so many comments on this issue, but I'll make some more. I really don't understand where people think that initial good ratings mean that the show is an instant hit or is instantly notable or what. I'm not suprised that the ratings were alright for the premiere (not a "giantic success", but respectible), there was a lot of hype and the premise was unique and it has Grey's Anatomy following it. Who knows what the ratings will end up next week? Even a show like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Single_Guy_c5da.html" title="The Single Guy">The Single Guy</a> always had decent ratings based on lead-ins and such, and I don't see any characters getting pages for that show. I'll make a compromise and <b>Withdraw</b> <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Suarez_4cb6.html" title="Betty Suarez">Betty Suarez</a> from consideration for deletion. Even if the show got cancelled tommorow, the hype and buzz about the character make her notable for WP for sure. I still stand by that the other articles nominated should be merged/deleted. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 04:32, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
