<li><b>Keep</b> It is unsourced, autobiographical, original research. On a wiki, however, this reality should only serve as an invitation to improve the article.

<dd>This AfD is not a forum to debate deletion policy. It serves as a forum to debate if this article meets the deletion criteria as nominated.

<dl>
<dd>As should be clear from my previous two comments, I feel as though the fact that the subject is notable trumps your concerns. I agree with you, but what I'm saying is that <i>all of those things are fixable</i>, where as not being notable is not. If the information is available from a variety of websites, and anyone has access both to this information and to the tools required to add it to this encyclopedia, then why do we need to delete it? I don't know how to say it any better than that. Sure, you listed it for deletion and put forth some criteria. Does that mean that all of us are required to address our comments only to you now, or that those are the only criteria that exist? Trying to control the discussion is not going to help get your point across any more clearly. You made your point, and I thought it was a good one. But you are not addressing what I'm saying, either. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 11:44, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fine, suggest away. The fact is that it's presumptuous to assume consensus at this point, when what you're essentially saying is that any article for which sources have not yet been cited or that someone suspects may represent a conflict of interest should be deleted. To address your concerns: Unverifed does not mean unverifiable. "Just read it" is not exactly hard evidence. I've already disputed "no value to wikipedia." And I don't know what "associates subjects of in vivo biographies in a way that may be incorrect" means. I'm done. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 12:03, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That was a little out of line, I'm sorry. It is probably autobiography, as I said myself. But it can be sourced and much of it can be verified, and there's nothing slanderous and anything incorrect can be removed. I'll try to work on it myself tomorrow. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 12:11, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>To respond to both of your last two comments, I don't know, maybe it could be moved for a while until it's ready; that's not a suggestion I would immediately reject. However, I still lean toward keep, only because I just don't think this article fits even that paragraph you just cited. The article, to a certain extent, violates some of these policies. However, it is certainly <i>not</i> impossible that an article on this topic can exist without breaching these three policies. Ergo, these policies need not be respected above other opinions. The article currently, in certain places (namely the paragraph I attempted to delete), does violate policy, but an article on this topic need not necessarily do so, as notability is established, the internal documents can be used as sources, and non-neutral tone is fairly easy to fix. Thus, according to the logic of the very paragraph you cited, the article does not demand deletion. A better option is repair. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 09:33, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Notability cannot be established because there are no acceptable sources cited. This is such a key element that many discussions relating to notability point out that some sources that are acceptable otherwise cannot be used to establish notability. Speedy delete makes an exception for asserted notability, but AfD actually requires it to be proven as per the excerpt I included above. I have discussed this with more than one arbcomm member. If the article is notable, find the verifiable sources that are accepted.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 09:58, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Quoting WP:V: "Material from self-published sources, and published sources of dubious reliability, may be used as sources in articles about the author(s) of the material, so long as: it is relevant to their notability; it is not contentious...." If you write about yourself saying that you're notable, that's contentious. If Sammy's HQ writes that they have chapters at 50+ colleges across the US and Canada, and if you can find them directory-listed at all 50 colleges, do we need to reference all 50 schools' directories, or can the self-published source stand? Note also that I have added a <b>scholarly reference</b>—a doctoral dissertation, which means heavy research and review—supporting the age and religious affiliation of SAM, which is half of its claim of notability. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 04:16, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Strong keep</b>. Organization meets WP:ORG. No one is debating the credibility of General Electric just because much of the information on the Wikipedia article comes from their own website. Sammy is a nationally known frat that’s quite a bit larger than many other ones which were proposed for deletion and allowed to stand. The article is in poor shape but for no reason should it be deleted. Sammy is an easily verifiable organization and I’m sure some editors are working on adding some other sources already. If you’re worried about some things being notable why don’t you go and AfD some articles on the random flash toons episodes and no name porn stars we have on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyt021_3281.html" title="User:Treyt021">Trey</a> 04:48, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Extremely bad faith nomination and/or unfamiliar nomination from a new editor. According to the nominator's logic, all fraternities, sororities and student organizations are inherently non-notable. A 100+ year old fraternity that is national in scope, part of the National Interfraternity Conference etc., has prominent alumni is notable. I've watched over all the fraternity articles and many of them have bias but to delete for that? You don't delete. You fix it up. The fact that the nominator states" Please comment on my nomination criteria, this is not a vote, but a debate" shows that the the editor is not familiar with AfD processes or Wiki policy because Afd's ARE votes. --<font color="#0000CC"><a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysepsion_8adb.html" title="User:Dysepsion">† Ðy§ep§ion †</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/y/s/User_talk%7EDysepsion_77d7.html" title="User talk:Dysepsion"><i>Speak your mind</i></a></sup></font> 04:57, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Though <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> and I have had a hefty back and forth over this article, I see no reason to label his actions as bad faith. In addition, an Afd, like most other things here, is not a vote but a search for consensus. The strongest argument wins (for example, a complete copyvio pretty much trumps everything). The problem Alan has is that while most of us would use common sense to conclude that the frat is obviously notable, most of us have not proffered a verifiable, third-party source to definitively prove any assertions of notability. Cfred's arguments go a ways towards alleviating that concern, but I understand Alan's argument. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 05:27, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I still believe this is a nomination on poor grounds. I too understand where Alan is coming from but if you've edited Wikipedia long enough, you'll see how much of the articles on here fall for AfD within his scope of reasoning. I've often participated in AfD for nearly two years and the reason why I stated this as bad faith is because of his arguments above and his wanting to start a "New Frat Patrol". Alan may not be one of them, but I've seen many notable student organizations get nominated for AfD by prejudice of an editor instead of a solid argument. AfD is usually reserved for controversial articles. This "debate" should have been on the talk page. At best a cleanup tag or disputed tag should have been placed. You can call it votes, consensus etc, but in the end, when the admin closes the nomination, votes for keep and not to keep are the primary considerations, not "comments" which this nomination is riddled with (myself guilty of this). --<font color="#0000CC"><a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysepsion_8adb.html" title="User:Dysepsion">† Ðy§ep§ion †</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/y/s/User_talk%7EDysepsion_77d7.html" title="User talk:Dysepsion"><i>Speak your mind</i></a></sup></font> 06:40, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, this is not a vote. The point of an AfD is to have a debate on the issues.

<dd><b>Strong Keep</b> Needs a little work, but should be improved. Articles of various level exist for all of the members of the North American Interfraternity Council and would be recreated immediately. There are editions of Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities which are in the public domain, but the only on Wikisource is from 1879 which is too early. 1920 edition would be ideal (Since SAM was founded in 1909). However using whether they would founded before the last public domain Bairds as a qualification strikes me as really goofy. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaraht_ac84.html" title="User:Naraht">Naraht</a> 11:53, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I cannot agree, as the proposed guideline does not clarify what constitutes a reliable thrid party source. If you read other guidelines relating to verifiability and notability, they consistently require a higher standard for sources that verify notability than any old statement in an article. A reliable third party is not a student newspaper. This article lacks reliable thirdy party sources and that is why I find that notability has not been established using a valid source. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 04:05, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alan, please stop patronizing your fellow wikipedians. A word of advise, if you see some 20 plus "Keep" comments and only one "Delete", it is time to back down.

<dd>And just to expand a bit on this. What I am trying to say is that when 16 people say "Keep" and only you (the nominator) and one other person say "Delete", it means that your arguments have failed to convince the rest of us and you are not going to achieve a consensus. This is not about voting but about common sense. Repeatedly re-stating your arguments or saying that "this is not a vote" does not make any difference - the consensus is to keep this article. Upon realising this (which you ought to by now), the best course of action is to back down and accept that at this time, the consensus is that such articles stand. You brought your test case, it failed, if you want to bring it or a similar case again at a later time, when the community standards and/or policies may have changed, you are free to do so. But if you simply keep labouring a spent point you will be seen as a troll and lose respect. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsten_cf99.html" title="User:Horsten">TH</a> 09:39, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I am repeating the comment every several paragraphs because it amazes me of how few people seem to know what an AfD is about. In fact, through reading, I found that a group has started an AfD patrol to educate people about the guidelines for it. I am more concerned with the lack of understanding of these guidelines than I am about keeping or deleting this particular article. I don't take this AfD personally, I have no interest either way. However, I will be diligent to make certain that famous Canadian politicians will not be associated with this article or fraternity without cited sources. From what I've read, the frat seems to have a positive message, but I have a strong motivitation to protect subjects of living biographies from association with groups of which they may have no association. If we cannot have that, we have a tabloid here. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 09:48, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't see what it has to do with the AfD debate.

It is not as if we are alleging membership of a Nazi party or something, there is nothing inherently negative or positive in being mentioned as a member of a student organization. I do not care enough to get involved though, but I really don't understand why you feel so strongly about this article. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsten_cf99.html" title="User:Horsten">TH</a> 13:15, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To some, a Nazi association is positive, not my opinion, but an opinion. The association of being a member of a group is a serious allegation to make. Keep in mind, I have no knowledge of this fraternity, only from this debate do I learn of them. How about tomorrow, the news media releases an article that claims this frat is a group of such and such or a position on a certain political viewpoint. Now, each member, who may or may not be an actual former or current member has their image affected. This is why, many politicians do not wish to be associated with any groups directly. For this reason in part, I believe we should be very thorough when associating subjects of living biographies (in vivo biographies). Not only does this article associate alleged members with the group, but associates them with eachother. As such, this article should meet the minimum standards of wikipedia and include third party, citable sources. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 22:59, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
