Might be just another one of the mixed breed. From the first set of RfD -</p>
<p><i>There are 500 breeds of dogs. Any of them can be mixed and anyone can name the mixes anything they want. (E.g., see American hybrid "registry" and Poodle hybrid and Dog hybrids and crossbreeds#Casual crossbreeds.) I realize that WP is not paper, but mostly what can be said about mixed-breed dogs is that they might have some characteristics of either parent, or not (if you also look at Maltipoo and Schnoodle you'll see what I mean). We've discussed this within the dog breed project before and feel that all these do is create multiple mixed-breed-dog articles. We're leaving in Cockapoo because it's been around long enough to be the only mixed-breed name to make it into the dictionary, and Labradoodles are so common as to be found in just about every puppies-for-sale list everywhere, with Goldendoodles getting pretty close, but I'm hesitant to open the floodgates for articles about everyone's mixed-breed dog with an invented name</i> (written by <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a>)</p>
<p>I am having more concerns over time as some of these articles keep reappearing (as did <a href="../../../p/u/g/Puggle_%28dog%29.html" title="Puggle (dog)">Puggle (dog)</a>). This article is a stub but a google search shows it to be used all over the place. It seems to me that we might be better off leaving some of the more common ones, which this seems to be, with all the warnings inherent that you don't really know what you're going to get. The other issue is that it's going to keep reappearing because the names ARE being used and the dogs ARE being sold and people WILL come looking for the name.</p>
<p>So if this seems inside out, I'm listing it because we've been trying to keep these invented combined-breed-name mixed breed dogs out, and I think this will come up for deletion eventually if I don't nom it.</p>

<li><b>Strong and Speedy Keep</b>. This article was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Robert_Steadman_7fc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Robert Steadman">nominated for AfD in October 2005</a> and easily survived. This nomination, like that one, is made in bad faith. The nominator has engaged in a series of POV edits on the article, has relentlessly attacked and criticized the subject, and in fact, his user name itself -- Crusading composer -- is a direct reference to Steadman (who has been called that due to his political activism). Take a look at his contributions, and the vast majority are to this article, its talk page and related pages. I don't know if he and Bakewell Tart (the user who made the original nomination) are sockpuppets of each other or not, but the nomination and comments are pretty much congruent. As for the substantive matter, please see the original AfD; there is no question at all of Steadman's notability and the encyclopedic nature of the article. It has been edited by many editors; it is clearly not authored by the subject or on his behalf. This AfD, like the last one, is simply the escalation of an edit war by one of Steadman's dedicated wiki-enemies. This is a repeated waste of our time and I think an RfC against Crusading composer for edit warring and abuse of AfD is appropriate here. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 03:10, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>The non-autobio assertion is very questionable: two of the protagonists on this article's talk page have lately been <i>established</i> as R. Steadman sockpuppets by checkuser, and indefinitely blocked as such (despite their denials at the time of any personal involvement). So let's keep <i>speculation</i> as to whether BT and CC are the same person in perspective. (My personal <i>guess</i> is not -- as CC implied, if s/he's made two AFD nominations, s/he's getting worse with practice at the technical details; Though equally that they have similar TES-messageboard-inspired motivations.) Most of the article itself was written from anon IP addresses. (My personal <i>guess</i> is, belonging to one Robert Steadman, or some closely involved person.) Actual notability seems to me marginal, but not non-existent, though hardly as clearly established as the above claims. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 03:49, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I cannot see how this can be classed as a bad faith nomination and I am amazed that someone has asked for me to be blocked because I have attempted to draw attention to a blatant abuse of Wiki's policies. I also find it surprising that I have been accused of edit wars. If the editor who thinks that was to actually look at the history of the Robert Steadman website, they'd find that I have been accomodating to others‚Äô views, have compromised and have refrained from reverting the same points. Some editors have referred to the previous attempt to delete this article. This was nothing to do with me. I voted to delete it but so what? That attempt failed. Yes Mr Steadman has a presence on the internet, most of it self initiated. Regardless of whether Mr Steadman is notable or not, that is NOT the issue here. This deletion is not about notability but about Wiki policies.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reasons for deletion:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If (and I mean IF) Mr Steadman has beenn guilty of using sock puppets and multiple identities ‚Äì particularly <b>vhjh</b> then there is good reason for deleting this article: 1. This is clearly a vanity article. It was created mainly by the subject. Two of the contributors have been revealed as sock puppets and have been permanently blocked. At least 2 more have made enough mistakes to be suspected of having clear links to the subject. This article was created for one purpose only - shameless self publicity and perhaps even as a way of increasing the subject's business. 2. The truthfulness of the article is in doubt. Much of the material comes from the subject's own website. The subject himself has shown himself to be less than honest over the last few months and this casts a strong doubt over whether the content can be trusted. 3. The subject clearly feels that he has ownership of the article. Attempts to edit the article have been constantly reverted. Sock puppets have been used to bully other editors, to smear and insult them. The subject's behaviour on the Jesus article shows that he is inflexible and totally unwilling to compromise. It is obvious that there can be no neutral POV when the subject himself takes such a strong interest in his own article and will use deceit to ensure that it remains a shrine to his own ego. If indeed these editors are sock puppets of Mr Steadman (and the administrators are the ones who have decided that ‚Äì I have not seen the evidence) there can be no real doubt as to whether this article has to be deleted. It is not a case of NOTABILITY. It is a matter of a breakdown of trust and good faith and repeated abuses of Wiki guidelines and p;oicies. This article, regardless of content, cannot be allowed to remain. I suggest that this article be deleted and if any of the editors who voted to keep this article really feel that the subject warrants an article then <b>THEY</b> could create one that does not breach wiki guidelines. It seems fair to me.Crusading composer 19:38, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I think the editor already has given the reason in his own (poor) defense against speedy deletion-- this isn't a dictionary, it's an encyclopedia, and there's nothing that ties these "defintions" (as poorly worded as they are) together into anything that approaches being an "article" about unusual sex acts, their history, their development in world or western culture, or how these terms came to be, or where they came from (i.e., there are no citations). It's a matter of being offended by the poor quality of the material and its presentation, not the subject matter.

<li><b>Delete</b> The title of the article is arbitrary, since "unusual" is not defined. A small (I believe) portion of the material describes genuine practices, urban legends, or slang, but none of the material is referenced. A substantial (I believe) portion of the material was obviously made up as a lark by illiterate buffoons. In summary, the small amount of material covering genuine practices, urban legends, slang terms, etc. belongs elsewhere, properly referenced. However, the generally poor quality of the entire page would make a merge impractical. --D.L. Hughes 15:22, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It may be very convienient for one politician if everyone were to forget about him. And, if you delete it, they may just. But Wikipedia is not here to do Amanda Vanstone's dirty work. This is an encyclopedia, not a political organ. Other persons who have been mishandled by politicians in the past have not been forgotten (Sacco and Vanzetti, Willy Horton, Stanley "Tookie" Williams). They are still listed with their own pages, despite the acute embarrassment felt by those who have been embarrassed by them. These articles have historical and social value, and they should not be erased just because someone realised too late that they live in the public eye, and are accountable to the public they serve.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I fear that the majority of people voting here are Australians, specifically Australians with the same POV about Australian immigration politics, and therefore the vote result will not be an accurate reflection of all of Wikipedia but rather just a certain Australian POV.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I fear that you have mistaken me for an Australian. May I suggest that you look at the user profile, where you will find it plainly stated that I am American. Perhaps you could do the same for the other users as well, and thus become better able to formulate a theory on what the origin of the opinions posted here may be. Perhaps it has nothing at all to do with a national bias. Perhaps you simply hold the minority opinion. Wandering Star 23:49, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My comment wasn't directed at you, but was just a general observation, so I haven't mistaken you for anything. Also, I couldn't check your user profile as you suggest because your username isn't a link. And a brief check through the profiles of other voters confirms that most of them are Australians. In any case, I would still be happier if more non-Australians voted. If most Wikipedians (not just Australians with a specific POV about immigration politics) do think that this article shouldn't be deleted, then that's fine with me. <a href="../../../e/d/r/User%7EEdrigu_1cf2.html" title="User:Edrigu">Edrigu</a> 02:14, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am Australian and I do have a POV about immigration politics, but I keep it out of Wikipedia. Whatever your POV the politics around the subject is important. I agree it is more important in Australia than elsewhere, but so what. There are thousands of articles that are important in the USA but are not really that important elsewhere. I therefore respect the judgement of Australian wikipedians on this article more than I do that of non-Australians. I think they are making a judgement to keep it because it is important. To suggest it arises from their POV is close to insulting. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 03:00, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - as above. If someone can give me a source for the book sales, I'd be more inclined to change my mind. For example, the article mentions "You Ain't No Dancer" published by the New Reliable Press. What it doesn't mention, is that the You Ain't No Dancer, is a collection of a lot of different works, Dean Trippe is just one of the many contributors. I doubt many people bought the book due to Dean Trippe's contribution. The New Reliable website <a href="http://www.newreliable.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newreliable.com/" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> describes it as a collection of stories from established an up and coming (which I'm translating as unknown) artists. I'm putting Dean Trippe into the latter category. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 15:15, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for your comment. I believe the relevant part of the guidelines here to be "<i>... or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more</i>" -- one writer doesn't prop up a good magazine, but the guidelines recognize their involvement just the same.

<li>I'm closing this as a <b>speedy keep</b>, as there is obviously some confusion about these pages. They are not duplicates of the month pages, they <i>are</i> the month pages. Several months (although not yet all) from the last few years have been split up into separate pages for each day, which are now included as templates on the month pages - see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=January_2003&amp;action=edit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=January_2003&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">source code</a> for <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2003.html" title="January 2003">January 2003</a> for example. So this is not a deletion issue - possibly there could be a debate about whether the month pages should be constructed in this way, but that's a matter for general discussion on talk pages, not AFD. ‚Äî <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a> <a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjorford_13fb.html" title="User talk:Sjorford"><small>(talk)</small></a> 11:05, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This wasnt even created a month time (no reason for speedydeletion), if you use Google/Alexia search for MMORPG you will get mainly FFXI, Warcraft,Lineage, Everquest mainly... all pay games with very very high player base due to you pay for it.. a free game which does almost zero advertising will not be able to compete... which is most games btw. As for Non-Notable comments note why its NN at least say why its Non-Notable, aside from the google/alexia all of the article is revelant and much played then some games listing on the Wikipedia MMORPG <a href="../../../m/a/s/Category%7EMassively_multiplayer_online_games_1192.html" title="Category:Massively multiplayer online games">Category:Massively multiplayer online games</a> and a more constant player base then most games.. dont know about the player ammount.. but im shure you guys are wrong, its more then 1000-2000 players (cant check due to round restart) Eijun</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> A 3 month long game of Thardferr attracts over 1000 active players--which is larger than the active players of some corporate games that are listed in Wikipedia. It is a non-profit game and has been around for years. It obviously has its own well-established community. Wikipedia readers would benefit from the ability to know about the possibility for a non-profit game such as this to succeed. It is not nationally famous, but as the Vanity Page says, "There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia." However I would also say that Thardferr is part of a larger subculture of online fantasy gaming in the D&amp;D tradition. Perhaps a larger article dealing with this gaming subculture would be more appropriate. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMango_Smoothy_a3fa.html" title="User:Mango Smoothy">Mango Smoothy</a> 14:15, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> A major reason this game currently is not as popular as many other famous MMORPG's is simply because unlike other games it does not Advertise in any way. The only way new players come to this game is by random chance or word of mouth by other users. That stated, the fact that between 1 and 2 thousand players from all over the globe (USA, Canada, Mexico, England, Turkey,Pakistan, Netherlands, India, Portugal, Philippines, and i am sure countless more) come to this game based on word of mouth advertising is quite impressive. Not only that but it continues to draw back the players round after round, as some people who originally found it when it started in 1999 are still among the current players base. <small>‚Äî<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Jrb225 (talk&#160;‚Ä¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jrb225_9af0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jrb225">contribs</a>) .</small> <small>Only edits are here and <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thardferr.html" title="Thardferr">Thardferr</a> <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECursive_f668.html" title="User:Cursive">Cursive</a> 22:45, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As stated above games with a more narrow player base are sustained, and simply because the game does not advertise it comes up with fewer hits. While using a wiki for this information is perhaps not the most preferable way, displaying it as such should not be something that is any less worth of display than something else. If the purpose of Wikipedia is to expand the possible topics people can search for, then by keeping it it has just done so by one more topic. <small>‚Äî<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 12.217.250.109 (talk&#160;‚Ä¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.217.250.109_a7d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.217.250.109">contribs</a>) .</small> <small>2 edits, one here, one at <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thardferr.html" title="Thardferr">Thardferr</a> <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECursive_f668.html" title="User:Cursive">Cursive</a> 22:45, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

I prod tagged this about 5 days ago. Back then, there was also the statement "Formed by teenagers this movie studio is very up and coming". Crystal ball, anyone? An IP user recently removed the prod tag, that "up and coming" statement, as well as the following OR statement: " The number of movies that have come form them in the last little while has finally slowed to a halt because most of the cast, being teenagers, have finally gotten jobs.", but has not addressed the point that this does not seem to be known about at all outside the group itself. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrat_53ce.html" title="User:Drat">Drat</a> <small>(<a href="../../../d/r/a/User_talk%7EDrat_c90f.html" title="User talk:Drat">Talk</a>)</small> 04:36, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. This debate isn't conclusive enough in the delete direction for me; the final comment is correct since Alexa headlines 3month moving averages, whilst this site's daily/weekly rank is better 1,000th. Since the debate rests mainly on unexplicated "nn" or "low alexa" I don't think the deletion case is made at present. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:18, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Involvement in hit national TV show, and substantial media attention, easily qualify this person. There is a regular precedent to keep comparable contestants on national hit reality TV shows (with substubs being merged). Instead of randomly deleting contestants, based on who shows up for AFD, a simpler solution would be to mege/redirect where appropriate. We shouldn't delete articles, because we don't like a particular genre of entertainment. Wikipedia should determine who others have found notable, not decide for ourselves (with our personal bias) who should be notable. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:00, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No one has said anything about not liking a particular genre of entertainment. I think the concerns of notability and importance that have been raised are quite valid. I certainly don't think the subject of this article would pass the <i>100 year test</i> from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. --&#160;<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrash_3aff.html" title="User:Krash">Krash</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKrash_5bb4.html" title="User talk:Krash">Talk</a>)</small> 18:20, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If this was an actor in a TV drama, same air-time, same success of show, same media attention, there would be no AFD. The *only* reason this AFD exists, is because this is reality TV. Normally, whenever a national TV show becomes a hit, all the stars of the show are deemed worth of an article. Also, the 100 year test, was a proposal, not accepted. Also, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a list ways which somebody may qualify. Nobody needs to pass each test, but rather just one. Let's use the non-crystal-ball 100-year rule: if somebody from a hundred years ago was writte about internationally, as much as this person was (on paper), would they qualify for an article today? Obviously, yes. If you can show the same international media coverage from a 100-year old entertainment personality, who had their article deleted, you'll prove your point. Otherwise, you'll prove mine. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:42, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll prove nothing until I'm good and ready to. But the real issue here is that I don't think being a contestant on a gameshow is tantamount to being a notable actor. You're welcome to disagree. I simply take offense that you assume that this is about not liking a particular genre of entertainment. --&#160;<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrash_3aff.html" title="User:Krash">Krash</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKrash_5bb4.html" title="User talk:Krash">Talk</a>)</small> 19:40, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe "not like" is bad wording. But it does seem you "don't respect" the genre. How do explain not treating a reality contestant the same as an actor, on a show, with comparable success and attention? This seems no different than denying a comedic actor an article, when you'ld let in an equivilent dramatic actor. Also, Survivor is not simply a gameshow. Are you basing your vote on the assumption this is game show like Price is Right, or Jeopardy? The show is about the about contestants personally. Jeopardy is about the questions/answers, not about the contestants. The Price is Right is about the prizes. Actually, contestants on a reality show, are probably more notable than many comparable actors. Often actors on certain shows (especially some daytime soaps) are not considered very important (by fans, the show, or the media). Often little info is available on them, beyond what they or their employers release. Rather the characters they play are what's followed, and written about (of course, this is true, only some of the time). On a reality show like Survivor (or BB) the contestant is the equivilent of the actor and character, combined into one. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 21:54, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Look at precedents over several months. Also, I include Big Brother precedents, as the show shares enough relevant characteristics with Survivor. The AFD you cited was going against precedent, and going against the spirit of BIO. Also, I'm just waiting for somebody to explain what these AFDs accomplish, that sensible merge/redirects (where appropriate) don't. It's foolish to destroy information, when we can, on on-going basis, make an editorial decision about whether info goes in the main article, or the individual bio article.

<li><b>Delete</b> Not yet. It certaintly isn't made up. I went to Hunter years ago and the Freak Hallway was a particularly notable feature of Hunter College High School with a unique culture that it has maintained for quite some time.

<p>I notice that this has a deletion notice but no comments why. A quick glance at the article doesn't make it clear to me why this article was nominated for deletion; the person seems notable if the information in the article is correct. In the absence of any reason why the delete tag was placed here, my tendency is to remove the delete tag. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Deville_1311.html" title="Special:Contributions/Deville">contribs</a>).</small></p>

</dd>
<dd>The lack of text here seems to be due to 85.182.15.4 having run into some trouble with AfD, as he/she explains <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_February_22&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40691717" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_February_22&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=40691717" rel="nofollow">here</a>. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 10:25, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> with revisions to make it less of a vanity article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>First off, autobiographical articles are not forbidden; they are just <i>discouraged</i>. And, unless a great deal of the objective facts on the page are false, this person seems sufficiently important to warrant a Wikipedia article. That said, there are problems with the article:
<ul>
<li>it's is long and excessively detailed. It's densely packed with information, but much of this is not necessary or encyclopaedic.</li>
<li>it's too praiseworthy of its subject. For example, regarding his books, it quotes positive reviews of books at great length, and describes them in superlative terms, e.g.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The magnum opus of Marcinkowski is his award-winning dissertation [...] Dastur al-Muluk (Regulations of the Kings) provides invaluable information on political and religious administration, biographies of eminent personalities, economics, as well as culture and geography, during the early 1720s."</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It seems that the article has been written almost exclusively by <a href="../../../a/d/u/User%7EAdul_99f4.html" title="User:Adul">User:Adul</a>, who is Christoph Marcinkowski, its subject. This isn't a problem per se, but it does lead to a general unencyclopaedic tone to the article at times, e.g.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>"In March 1995, Marcinkowski left Germany, first for Singapore, a city for which he has since then maintained always the deepest admiration,"</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I don't have much experience with how to deal with autobiographical Wikipedia entires. My current, somewhat uninformed, opinion is to keep it, and improve it in the ways described. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 10:25, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I suggest that the author set up a homepage for the content of this article. Wikipedia is not a website for posting resume. In addition, publicising the autobiography article by adding links in other articles such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nanyang_Technological_University&amp;diff=36886671&amp;oldid=36463496" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nanyang_Technological_University&amp;diff=36886671&amp;oldid=36463496" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geography&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36739243" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geography&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36739243" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> (and dozens other articles) is quite unacceptable, IMO. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> (<a href="../../../v/s/i/User_talk%7EVsion_836f.html" title="User talk:Vsion">talk</a>) 05:20, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I find the debate around this entry quite surprizing (following the 'nomination' of this article for deletion by someone who does not identify himself for obvious reasons...). Once we start to nominate for deletion articles written by people who we don't like we can close down as well the whole wikipedia project. I can only hope that there is consensus on this... But anyway, lets be less ideological or driven away be personal motivations... I suggest to keep it...<small>‚Äî<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 155.69.4.223 (<a href="../../../1/5/5/User_talk%7E155.69.4.223.html" title="User talk:155.69.4.223">talk</a>&#160;‚Ä¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_155.69.4.223_d9b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/155.69.4.223">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> (if an anon has any say in this) or make it look like a real neutral encyclopedia entry and less like a self-advertising homepage. The wikipedian to make the final decision should note that all but one 'keep' votes were unsigned or anonymous. (Quite an irony considering how they (mostly <a href="../../../a/d/u/User%7EAdul_99f4.html" title="User:Adul">Adul</a>/Mr Marcinkowski himself) rant against the initial proponent's (my) anonymity.)</li>

<dd>I first noticed a link to his page in the article about <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samarra.html" title="Samarra">Samarra</a> after the news report about the destroyed Al Askari Mosque, and asked myself why the name of any private person should relate to an Iraqi town.

<dd>If deletion doesn't apply here something should at least be done about his irrelevant linking all over the place. 85.182.13.210 08:19, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The issue of anonymouy 'requests' applies also to those in favour of deletion. Anyway, I would like to agree with regard to some of the linking but I think some of those in favour of deletion appear to be driven by some rather personal motives (envy among scholars or personal animosities? who the hell knows and why should that play any part here?...). So, do keep it but decide perhaps with regard to the extensive linking. I guess that should do it. <i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 155.69.4.223 (<a href="../../../1/5/5/User_talk%7E155.69.4.223.html" title="User talk:155.69.4.223">talk</a>&#160;‚Ä¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_155.69.4.223_d9b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/155.69.4.223">contribs</a>) .</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A word of constructive advise: It could be edited further by a careful hand. But I think deleting it altogether would be an act of vandalism in itself, especially since some of those who are so keen to delete it seem not to be free from selfish motives themselves.

<li>If it's that bad (which I don't think it is) or whatever then just delete it for Christ's sake, especially since there seems to be such an "urge" and "serious interest" to do so... Quite tiring all this sissy talk.... I can only hope that wikipedia will be able to deal with this in a professional, less injurious, manner with it. I still think revision would be the best way in dealing with articles which have academic matters as subject. This is just the irrelevant opinion of a non-American.

<li>Ik, that might make an actual copy of the video a collector's item, but I doubt it would make the video itself an encyclopedically notable work. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:00, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you say the video might be a collector's item that in itself means its worthy enough to be described on Wikipedia in my opinion.

Does this make that issue of TV Guide encyclopedically notable? <i>No</i> it does not. And <i>yes</i> it harms Wikipedia to let this article exist, because it becomes a precedent for future articles.

<li>I do not see whats wrong with having articles about less known movies, videos or compilations, porn or otherwise. If the article is written according to the rules commonly accepted on Wikipedia it is an addition to the encyclopedia. The article is there for people who are interested in reading about it. Since there is just a link to it from the article of Tove Jensen and the categories in the article itself I do think mostly people who are interested in seeing this article will read this.

<p>A Website Network Mangement Platform is a new category of software. There are very few listings because it is a new invention. If anyone can think of a better term for a system which manages a large group of websites and concurrently takes care of CMS, analytics, marketing and integration then speak up now. I'm the inventor of this category and its a bit disturbing that after five years of hard work on this new type of system, people are so happy to call it "Close to patent nonsense", without doing accurate research. Global companies have been using this Software as a Service offering for a number of years now. If you don't like the copy in the entry, then edit away. To delete the whole article is what I would call "patent nonsense", and ill-informed. I will be very happy indeed to debate the virtues of this term. Here is my email address: juz@bigfoot.com. Please do not delete my entry!</p>

<p>A high school football player who has yet to be drafted by a professional team, let alone graduate.

<dd>Sigh, again there is an American bias with Google results. Try a search for "Kate Fischer", compared with another B-grade actress "Moira Kelly" for example..there'd probably be more results for Kelly because she's American. Also "Robert Walls" gets just 17,000 results - and he is a deadset legend of the AFL. Google results are fairly irrelevant in terms of Australian stuff. See also "Wijnand Ott" who is a legend in Dutch music, gets 50 results. <b><a href="../../../a/f/l/WP%7EAFL_72f6.html" title="WP:AFL"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rogerthat_2a3b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rogerthat"><font color="red">o</font></a><a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerthat_6fee.html" title="User:Rogerthat"><font color="darkblue">gerthat</font></a></b> <i><sup><a href="../../../r/o/g/User_talk%7ERogerthat_5be9.html" title="User talk:Rogerthat"><font color="black">Talk</font></a></sup></i> 00:27, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let's see, Moira Kelly has been working for the last 15 years, stars (as in, gets her name on the poster) in at least one (internationally distributed) movie I can recall, stars in the 1st season of a popular (and internationally distributed) television drama series, and apparently appears in a current TV series. Nope, can't imagine why she gets so many Google hits: must be solely due to her being an American, clearly. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:14, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's been consensus in the past to delete local greek organizations; this one is on the cusp. It's not a national organization, but it's slightly more than a local. All of its chapters are in California, which is a large state. The Loyla Marymount chapter is either underground or inactive and isn't mentioned on the website. I find no mention on the USC student orgs site, UC-Riverside, or UC-Irvine. I'm of the mind that they're making a good attempt at starting a national fraternity but haven't quite reached a state of notability yet. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User_talk%7ERasputinAXP_2a9a.html" title="User talk:RasputinAXP"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="background: maroon;">&#160;RasputinAXP&#160;</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RasputinAXP_8e7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/RasputinAXP"><small>c</small></a> <a href="../../../g/a/d/Image%7EGadsden_flag_large.png_c0af.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a1/Gadsden_flag_large.png/25px-Gadsden_flag_large.png" alt="" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../g/a/d/Image%7EGadsden_flag_large.png_c0af.html" /></a> 15:54, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> There is a consensus to delete individual chapters of national organizations but there has never been consensus to delete local organizations. Many local organizations have articles on Wiki (e.g. <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Chi_Alpha_21d5.html" title="Alpha Chi Alpha">Alpha Chi Alpha</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_William_Penn_Society_8f49.html" title="The William Penn Society">The William Penn Society</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/p/Kappa_Kappa_Kappa_ef40.html" title="Kappa Kappa Kappa">Kappa Kappa Kappa</a>) I actually tried to nominate several of them for deletion but they have all survived AfD therefore the consensus in past AfD noms usually falls on the side of keeping these articles when they are local. Zeta Phi Rho technically isn't local but it is not national either. It is what's called a "regional" fraternity. I personally know members of this organization. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> is correct in that <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisco_Valverde_0ec9.html" title="User:Francisco Valverde">Francisco Valverde</a> should've used the talk page and dealt with issues there before putting this article on AfD.

<li><b>Comment</b>: All of the local greek org articles I've seen on AfD the last 4-6 months have been clear deletes.

<li><b>Comment</b> Interesting. Thanks for bringing up those past AfDs. At best then it can be said that there is no consensus about whether to keep or delete locals (I wish there was either way). I argue notability because I've known this organization to be well known among the Southern California greek community. Aside from the usual "fraternity stuff" I recall they have initiated several important philanthropies concerning the Asian-American community. I heard of them even before I was even in college. From personal experience, they are a lot more notable and a far more dynamic organization than many locals I've come across. Having several chapters denotes notability IMHO. I'm just having a hard time understanding how a regional fraternity with 8 chapters in some of the most well known schools in California lacks notability. Unfortunately though I can't and will not add info to the article because it would come under the scrutinity of verifiability and original research so take what I said with a grain of salt. --<font color="#0000CC"><a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysepsion_8adb.html" title="User:Dysepsion">‚Ä† √êy¬ßep¬ßion ‚Ä†</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/y/s/User_talk%7EDysepsion_77d7.html" title="User talk:Dysepsion"><i>Speak your mind</i></a></sup></font> 19:19, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article about a group of gaming clans is full of original research. Normally that's a reason to edit, not delete, but given the nature of the subject matter I doubt there exist any reliable sources covering this topic. I tried making it into a redirect to the Freelancer game article (assuming the folks there would be able to put in as much or as little info about this as is appropriate), but it was reverted. I don't see that this article should exist by itself, since the subject matter is important only to those who play the game. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:29, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I apologize if this is not the appropriate place for commentary. The redirect to your Freelancer game article was not deemed appropriate because A51 hosts and participates in more than only Freelancer, as my recent edit attempted to illustrate. In addition to games, members of A51 share tips about many other programs, such as photoshop, milkshape, and lightwave.</p>
<p>I added the web address of A51 for verification, but perhaps I do not understand what you mean by that. Lancer's Reacor (www.lancersreator.com) also has information about A51.</p>
<p>I understand this article may seem self-promotional, but it was added by members not staff. Staff only became involved in an effort to add a complete picture of the community and hopefully save the article from deletion. If I can be of further assistence, please contact me at aurora@asylum51.com. Thank you for your time. ~Aurora</p>
<p>1 peice of information - the current size of the member base is 1257. I know it does not meet the spec of 5000, but its still quite high.</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Far from being "original research" by "Kurdish ultra-nationalists", the articles cited are peer-reviewed articles, written by authors from many nations (France, US, UK, and Spain are prominent), and published in prestigious journals. Those trying to suppress this information should be ashamed of themselves. That said, I feel that the article itself is a bit unmoored -- I don't know anything about how "Kurd" was defined by the writers of the WP article OR by the writers of the scientific articles cited. I'd prefer the article to have more context, and in particular have more links to the WP articles on population genetics and on the wider genetic history of the Middle East and Central Asia.

<li>To understand the POV warring going on, it's probably necessary to note that proponents of the Kurdish national cause (see <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a>) seek to maximise claims of a distinct Kurdish ethnic/cultural/etc. identity, while opponents of that cause (mostly people describing themselves as patriots or nationalists from Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria) seek to minimise such claims. Judging from their userpages, most users seeking to delete the article hail from Iran. In wikipedia terms, we should establish whether this article is sufficiently non-original research to warrant inclusion, in which case it's probably an encyclopaedic topic, as noted above.

<dd>No, the articles are scientific peer-reviewed articles in academic journals. But taking selected excerpts out of them to promote anti-Iranian hatred and Kurdish separatism is wrong. Taking scientific articles out of context in order to prove one's prejudice is pseudo-science, or mis-using science, whatever you name it. You can likewise make pages on genetic origins of a lot of people, all of which would result in virtually the same thing: The people over there are mixed beyond recognition, which is what makes the whole point of this article ridiculous. There are artices relating Kurds to most other groups of people in the region. So, what is your conclusion? My conclusion is that the genetics of the people in the region is mixed, and singling out Kurds in such an article is thus irrelevant. Even if this is to be discussed, it does not need a separate page. There are people here who propose deleting every mention of the word <i>Iran</i> from Wikipedia, but those same people go to this extent in describing Kurds.

<li>Such articles could be written. Studies on Mongolian and Jewish men, and on Lebanese, have been recently published. Hmm, also a study of genetic differences between Rajputs and Rajasthani tribals. Note that these studies never, EVER, show that some groups have a genetic trait that is not shared by other groups. There is always intermarriage, always a gradual blending of populations, and local populations are best characterized in terms of percentages, not absolutes. This goes for every single human group on the planet. HOWEVER, it is still possible to distinguish some populations as relatively homogenous, and others as relatively mixed. Kurds are genetically heterogeneous, as are most Iranians. A map would show this better than words. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 16:37, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry But as your POV you even do not know the difference between racism and science. Among many Middle Eastern people such as Turks (for ex. Cool cat), Iranians (for ex. Shervinak) every thing is redefined in another way. race, ethnicity, linguistic family, DNA test, Human rights, Wikipedia policies! When I show them by credible sources they reject and reply with nonsense.

<p>Comment on the general issue: Coolcat says that "Treatng ethnicity based on genetics can be viewed as racism" and that WP shouldn't discuss this. I don't think that there's anything that WP shouldn't discuss. Genetic differences between local populations are fair game for scientific study, and help us learn about our past.</p>
<p>If science shows that all the peoples of the Middle East and Central Asia are genetically all-mixed-up (chop suey, as we say in Hawai'i), then that's a fact. If people have based their beliefs re ethnicity, and who is REALLY an X, or a Y, on supposed descent, and the descent turns out to be a myth, well then, that's a fact. It doesn't mean you can't have a group -- it just means that group membership has to based on criteria other than genetic. Which seems healthier to me. Surely group identity should be based on willingness to take responsibility for each other, to love, and not on "blood".</p>

I propose changing the article title to 'Zing Technology' and putting the focus on the technology, process, and facilitation skills rather than the company or the software and incorporate more academic material from the research that's been done. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatscratch_6778.html" title="User:Catscratch">CatS</a> 21:06, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>further comment</b> I will rework it to better conform to wikipolicy. Zing is much more widely used than a google search would suggest. A conference on activity theory and action research is being held in Australia in October, and zing is a powerful tool for these areas of research. I feel frustrated by it being marked for deletion and am not clear on how to dispute it. I am possibly the only wikipedian in the zing community, so getting a whole lot of zing people here to defend the page would result in an accusation of sock puppetry, so I really don't know what I should do. I'm happy to work on and improve the article, but I don't feel I can do that while it is marked for deletion. Some constructive criticism has been left on the talk page, and I would like to address and improve the article.--<a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatscratch_6778.html" title="User:Catscratch">CatS</a> 01:01, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. WP:Software requires at least 5k users for general use software. While specialized software may have less then that, best would be if it fulfilled any other criteria. Returning to the numbers of users-issue: According to the publisher, they have the following customers "</li>

<li>Schools: in 100 schools in Australia and the UK for learning, professional development, community activities and education reform." Although we must asume, that this is probably the very max of possible users, it _does_ substantiate the significance case. If your google for "anyzing pdf -wikipedia" you will stumble across several uses of anyzing during workshops and such, mostly in Australia, from 2001 up to 2005 (<a href="http://www.nowwethepeople.org/conference/2005/conference_speeches/human_rights_workshop_report.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nowwethepeople.org/conference/2005/conference_speeches/human_rights_workshop_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>). Catscracht supplied some links he found at the <a href="../../../z/i/n/Talk%7EZing_Technologies_db3b.html" title="Talk:Zing Technologies">talk page</a> that do not clearly match the criteria but come close. I don't know about the journals the publications have been printed, but the Alar Jornal seems to be active with an international conference held every 2-3yrs. <a href="http://www.alarpm.org.au/aboutus/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alarpm.org.au/aboutus/" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> To summarize my opinion, it seems that the software's notability is indeed limited, but as far as I can see, rather regionally than anything else. In Australia, there seems to be quite frequent use of the software. Since it is not personal software, but rather software for insitutions, it seems explainable that there are not a huge number of google hits. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyw_7c9e.html" title="User:Johnnyw">Johnnyw</a> 15:50, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The Zing software system and its associated facilitation processes seem to be a significant instance of group support/team learning. I agree that Google results are unlikely to demonstrate its user base, use or significance. As Zing is specialised software (not personal software) the 5k WP:Software requirement does not apply. The article needs to be cleaned up and I recommend it is re-worked. --Beraht (talk <small>‚Ä¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beraht_cc13.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beraht">contribs</a>) 12:08, 7 March 2006 (UTC) <small>User's sole edit</small></li>
<li>Since this is a tough call regarding the criteria, I let my vote be directed by second thoughts. The first one being <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">Ignore all rules</a>, or citing a statement that expresses this guideline: "We have a set of rules and standards and traditions, but they must not be applied in such a way as to thwart those newcomers who take that invitation (be bold!) at face value." CatS may not be a newcomer at all, but a less frequent then well spirited contributor whose one effort at Wikipedia is the Zing article. Rremoving an article that is or at least comes fairly close to being notable which has a good minded editor and maintainer as a patron seems rather destructive to me; in comparison to keeping an ill-maintained uninformational and badly written article which hardly meets the criteria (even after cleanup). The other thought is: "When in doubt, don't delete." <b>Keep</b> it is. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyw_7c9e.html" title="User:Johnnyw">Johnnyw</a> 20:25, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article fails to assert notability; however, the article has been on the site since Feb. 2002. Therefore, I do feel comfortable deleting it without community consent. The only reference for the band is their MySpace account.

So: this is almost certainly an example of gaming the system. On the other hand, there is some additional information in the article - it seems they have amassed a little bit of attention in the months since deletion. Much as I hate to reward vanity editors, it is probable that this now rises above the <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamcruftisement</a> threshold. I am, however, profoundly unhappy about Sleepyhead's apparent deviousness, since not only does he know that it could have been taken to DRV with a reasonable chance of success, but he's also been told that he <i>should not</i> be editing articles on subjects where he has a vested interest. I for one would have been happy to help Sleepyhead to get the article re-created, and so I am sure would Tony Sidaway. Hell, Tony would probably just have undeleted it. I'm bringing it here so we can have a formal endorsement for keep or delete; as it is it could be tagged as a re-creation by any passing editor with a memory. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:06, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have <a href="../../../2/4/s/24SevenOffice_4819.html" title="24SevenOffice">24SevenOffice</a> on my watch-list here on Wikipedia and was surprised to see the article re-appear today. I have no knowledge of Eggen (talk <small>‚Ä¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Eggen_403b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Eggen">contribs</a>) and I have no involvement in re-creating the article. I am an employee of 24SevenOffice and have made edits to the article - mostly to correct mistakes and add information from new events. I understand that <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">JzG</a> (<a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">talk</a> <small>‚Ä¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">contribs</a>) suspects vanity and advertising given the previous deletion and my involvement in the article. I would like to note that my contributions to Wikipedia continued after the deletion and has been fairly significant. So I am not on Wikipedia to advertise for 24SevenOffice.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am biased so I wont add my vote but I think 24SevenOffice meets the criteria for <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">notability for software</a>:</p>
<p>- Media coverage. See the references as examples of media coverage in English. I can also provide an extensive list of media coverage in the Norwegian press (including the major financial and IT publications). The Publish.com article lists 24SevenOffice as one of five enterprise-ready web 2.0 apps. In Sydney Morning Herald (the largest newspaper in Australia) mentions 24SevenOffice and NetSuite as succesfull <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_as_a_Service_f407.html" title="Software as a Service">SaaS</a> providers.</p>
<p>- The system have won several awards including 'Seal of Excellence' at <a href="../../../c/e/b/CeBIT_fe96.html" title="CeBIT">CeBIT</a>.</p>
<p>- The system is innovative as it is the first <a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajax_%28programming%29.html" title="Ajax (programming)">Ajax</a> based ERP/CRM solution. 24SevenOffice used Ajax before the term was coined. <a href="../../../n/e/t/NetSuite_f664.html" title="NetSuite">NetSuite</a> for example started using Ajax <a href="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/08/netsuite-with-ajax-support-in-next_11.html" class="external text" title="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/08/netsuite-with-ajax-support-in-next_11.html" rel="nofollow">about six months ago</a>.</p>
<p>- There exists wikipedia articles about 24SevenOffice in other languages: Norwegian (bokm√•l), Norwegian (nynorsk) and Swedish.</p>

<li>Zoe is correct. I checked, there are some forums, a lot of ads and press releases, but not much of substance that I could find. It doesn't seem to be publicly quoted, I coldn't find verifiable detail on the financial size of the company and I didn't see a list of notable customers, or a figure for the number of employees. Obviously I was going through a list, knocking out redlinks and looking for spam.

<li>It's a completely unsourced report of the different opening credit sequences from <i>The Cosby Show</i>. It's essentially an original paper on the subject. I suppose if it was thoroughly rewritten, it might look better, but as of present, it looks very bad. On top of that, it's quite a bit crufty (do we really <i>need</i> a detailed explanation of the opening credits of a TV show for each season? Didn't we just go through this with the studio logos thing?) There are asome passages of encyclopedic information present in it, but the info needs a lot of trimming if it is to be merged. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 01:09, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can find fewer than 10 hits in Lexis/Nexis, dated 2002-2004. I don't know how many computer mags are indexed in Lexis/Nexis so that might be an undercount. It doesn't seem to have been mentioned by the New York Times or Wash Post, which would surely have been picked up in the search. PC magazine reviewed backup programs in 2003 and called it "mediocre." In 2004 a tech columnist in the Bar Association's magazine praised it. It is mentioned in a Ziff-Davis produced segment on PCs that was offered to local TV stations in 2002. That's about the extent of the coverage. Notable?

<li>It's been tagged since January, which suggests <i>nobody cares</i>; this is a legitimate janitorial nomination on that fact alone.

<li><b>Delete</b> According to the IMDB, there is a real Indian actress called Shakila, who was active from the 1940s through the 1960s. This is obviously not an article about her, and may even be a subtle attack on her or someone else of the same name. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 21:30, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> The correct spelling is Shakeela and she was notable, er, notorious, for her roles from 2001-2003. Later, she shifted to acting in mainstream movies. IMDB entry is available on this name and refers to her movies. A google search gives 192,000 hits - most of the first 100 hits refer to this person, but as is to be expected, contain less of biographical information but more of pics. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 13:47, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Maybe I'm missing something, but I've read the article twice, and the only real problem I can find with this article is the title. "White Race" conjures up images of hate groups and genocide for me, but the information in the article isn't factually incorrect, as far as I know, and I'm a classicist who has taken two university courses on Indo-European linguistics, one at the graduate level. It is true that lingustic reconstruction, archaeological study, and, yes, even DNA studies (more popular in Europe) are done to further understand the Indo-European people. Ultimately, I don't think this is a useful article, because it is an attempt to unequivocally link the biology of all people with light skin color and European ancestry with ideas of Western Civilization. I don't agree, however, that it is "disturbing stuff." There are articles on this very deletion log that are many times worse, especially Unusual Sex Acts (see above), which is at best stuff made up in school one day, and at worst, a how-to manual on sexual torture and assault written by a group of sociopathic children. I've notified the original author of the article about this vote for deletion. If his talk page is any indication, ThePedanticPrick didn't tell him about this. I think hot coals of shame should be heaped upon anyone who nominates an article for deletion without making an honest effort to contact the author. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<li><b>Keep</b> Hey, hang on a moment. This is not actually an article, it is a stub, and no article links to it. I am the author, and have only spent a very short time exploring this topic as a possible article, and was curious how I could shape one up. All of this is very premature. I fail to see how one can judge an article before it is barely even started--it has a total of 6 sentences in it! I can see that none of the voters have given an indication that they have read the "rationale" for the proposed article that is on the talk page. This is not a "personal essay, nor is it garbage, nor is it racist." I am surprised, I must say at the depth of feeling it has engendered. Couldn't some of these thoughts have been put on the talk page first, so I had a chance to say what I hoped to do with it? And this many votes in the space of a few hours? How does that happen? I've created a number of articles for wikipedia with hardly any problems to speak of, and I believe I deserve, as a result, a little common courtesy. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonSiano_393d.html" title="User:DonSiano">DonSiano</a> 02:29, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>For the record, I don't think you're a racist. I just think the tone is wrong and the topic is fuzzy. Not everyone who thinks this is "disturbing" or cannot escape POV would necessarily think it reflects on you. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">The Republic Restored</a></small> 02:46, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I note your edit history and believe you're well-intentioned. That said, I hope you will take what I have to say here as equally sincere; feel free to check my own history before continuing. First, even if the article had no content whatsoever I believe the title alone would be controversial. There is, as far as I know, little consensus that such a thing as a "white race" exists. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but the article doesn't touch the question except for the title, which seems to imply that it does. That alone presents troubling NPOV concerns. Second, when "exploring [a] topic as a possible article," you might want to consider using a <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html#What_about_user_subpages.3F" title="Wikipedia:User page">user sub-page</a>, especially if the topic is potentially controversial. Third, writing about race for an encyclopedia is <i>going</i> to be controversial. That's not to say that you shouldn't touch the topic, but if it really surprises you that this is controversial you might want to read some of the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Category%7ERacism_ca08.html" title="Category:Racism">other stuff that touches on this</a>, particularly the talk pages and edit histories. Writing genuinely NPOV material on controversial topics is in my opinion a <i>good thing</i> but not for the faint of heart! If you'd like to turn this article into something encyclopedic, I'd strongly recommend you <b>move it to a user sub-page for further work and seek peer review before going back into article space.</b> --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraig_Stuntz_f2ad.html" title="User:Craig Stuntz">Craig Stuntz</a> 03:52, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the comments. Well, I never thought of using a "sub-page" as a way to start an article, and in fact never saw this mentioned in any of the wiki articles aimed at new contributors either. Is this really a standard practice? I haven't seen any examples of handling controversy this way. But, as I say, I am comparatively new to this. Actually, I had hoped in starting the article that it might attract a good writer or two--it is too big a subject for me. I'll look into it. About the controversial nature, I must say I really am surprised. On the title question, there is already a long article on "The White Race" ( I worked on it a little) but it only covers the usage of the term, its history, and is mostly etymological (section headers use "the term". I read the article on "Caucasian" and it was much the same. They weren't very interesting. If there is an article "White Race," an article on "White Race (history)" looked reasonable to me.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonSiano_393d.html" title="User:DonSiano">DonSiano</a> 10:24, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Userfy</b> for now per Craing Stuntz. DonSiano, this needs a new title before public unveiling, as "white race" is 1) just going to be a lightning rod for trouble and 2) there is no such "race" as "white", if you mean Caucasians or Indo-Europeans use that. The use of a work by Pat Buchanan as a reference in what is apparently intended to be a scientific (as opposed to a political) article is not a good sign, though. If writing an article about immigration controversies in the USA or whatever then Buchanan might be a perfectly valid source, but for a multi-millenium historical survey his credentials are, how to put this, weak. I'd advise you to check existing articles on the subject to see where yours fits in. Otherwise, good luck with the article, sorry about the piling on but as someone who's been in your position myself, recall that Wikipedia is made up of people, wherever there are people there is politics, and using the term "white race" is guaranteed to raise a ruckus, as you have learned the hard way. But don't let it get you down! I'm sure you'll be able to generate a good and encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 05:12, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The question of the existence of "race" in man is exhaustively gone into in the article on "Race" ( I worked on it a little), so there is not much need to repeat all of in the proposed article, though I had certainly planned at some point to acknowledge the controversy. If I get a chance...On the references, I think one can see from the few that I included that I had hoped to use only very recent ones, with scholarly articles predominating, and with an emphasis on genetics and migrations, which is mostly pretty new. Actually, I know very little about how this deletion thing works--I put one up for deletion before (a duplicate article) but never really followed how it works. I guess I'm about to learn...<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonSiano_393d.html" title="User:DonSiano">DonSiano</a> 10:24, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>On the NPOV issue, which I haven't adressed in my comments, I sincerely believe in it for wikipedia, and I believe one can be written on the topic under discussion, with some considerable amount of work. I really don't see where the problem is in what is there now. Each of the six sentences are not only neutral and true, they have references. Actually, it may be that the POV issue is actually some sort of reaction from people who have rather extreme views on the race issue. I note that ThePedanticPrick (does wikipedia permit obscene user names?!) recently modified the article on White Race on Mar 3. to include a picture. His nomination of my nascent article for deletion should be seen in this light. I (<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonSiano_393d.html" title="User:DonSiano">DonSiano</a> 11:33, 4 March 2006 (UTC)) show this picture in its context here:</p>
<dl>
<dd>While you're pointing out my posting of pictures, you should mention to everyone that you keep insisting on using a painting of Venus by Botticelli to represent white people.

<dd>I did indeed suggest using a picture of the painting by Boticelli to illustrate the article on White Race and I still think it is not a bad suggestion, contrary to the opinion of Pedantic Prick, nor was I the only one to revert to it either. I am proud of my work on this article and think my efforts improved it considerably--essentially none of it was reverted. PedanticPrick's suggested picture was reverted almost at once.</dd>

<p><b>Userfy</b> Don, the user space is a great way to work on complicated articles, whether they are controversial or not. Once an article is in the main space, it gets picked up but mirror sites and other search engines that search wikipedia. If you get distracted or something comes up and don't finish it right away, your half-finished article is perpetuated everywhere (like one of mine; I didn't know about the user space at the time and I need to get back and finish it pdq). Regarding the specific content, I have concerns such as have been expressed elsewhere. It's hard to write a good article; its especially hard to write a good article about a controversial topic. Good luck. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 02:59, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would further note the article by Nicholas Wade on my first ref in the NYT yesterday showed that the NYT is not afraid to publish an article reporting that the genes that differ in the three populations (=races) White, Asian and African, have evolved recently. The very idea that wikipedia is so PC that it would not allow an article on White Race (history) beause it, in its very concept, is not NPOV, is abhorrent, if not laughable.<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonSiano_393d.html" title="User:DonSiano">DonSiano</a> 07:37, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--Hi- this is Donna- I didn't know that putting something up would cause so much search for me! I'd like to address that the "seven-year-old" website was a site I made when I was 18- didn't even know it was still ingering around. I am a freelance writer with many publication credits, but if the Wiki community feels my book does not make me worthy yet to have an article, feel free to delete it. I didn't know there'd be so much research done about me! Did you find out yet that I was a TLC reality show last year? Thanks for your interest in me and at least looking into me a little more before deleteing. When my second book comes out, perhaps you can repost something about me. (The sales rank continues to change- it was once in the 70,000s)</p>
