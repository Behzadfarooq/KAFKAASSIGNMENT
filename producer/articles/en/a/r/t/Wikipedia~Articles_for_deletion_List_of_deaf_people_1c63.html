<li>Inappropriate article for an encyclopedia. Perhaps a better article title? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 16:34, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Sorry but I don't see that a list of people who achieved notability in spite of such a handicap is inappropriate. But perhaps the title is not considered <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">PC</a>? — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 17:05, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't see anything wrong with this list either, although including everybody who lost their hearing in old age might make it unwieldy. <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a> <a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjorford_13fb.html" title="User talk:Sjorford">→•←</a> 17:20, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think "deaf" is an un-PC word, given the number of charities that use it in their names (<a href="../../../r/n/i/RNID_1b2f.html" title="RNID">RNID</a>, etc). <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick04_a2be.html" title="User:Nick04">Nick04</a> 19:19, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. What is this, some sort of vendetta on deaf articles? Please note that I've been trying to get to this article to improve it but the anti-deaf crowd at Wiki is attacking deaf articles so frequently I haven't had the time. Inappropriate? With all due respect, it's a much needed article. Don't delete! No! No! No!. Just because the article can't be worked on on Alex's timetable is no reason to delete it. Oh! Now I see. Alex is an M.D. who believes medical science trumps social science. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERay_Foster_3fef.html" title="User:Ray Foster">Ray Foster</a> 19:35, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> this definitely <a href="../../../y/u/c/User%7EYuckfoo_5ab6.html" title="User:Yuckfoo">Yuckfoo</a> 19:38, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, then create a <b>category</b> of notable deaf people (we wouldn't want everybody's grandma in there, after all). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 21:27, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I suspect that I see where the problem lies. It's nothing to do with political correctness or vendettas. Not <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> has blinded you to the obvious. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERay_Foster_3fef.html" title="User:Ray Foster">Ray Foster</a> looks at the title but instead reads List of deaf people notable for their leadership and accomplishments; whereas <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> looks at the title (and the opening paragraph of the article), reads <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_deaf_people.html" title="List of deaf people">List of deaf people</a>, and is horrified at the prospect of Wikipedia becoming a <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">directory</a> of people who are deaf, a prospect that those who have dealt with how lists tend to grow will find all too probable. This article needs to be <b>Renamed</b> to nip things in the bud. That could have been done immediately, by just <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">being bold</a>, without need for bringing the article to <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:43, 2005 Mar 1 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think it needs to be renamed. Notability is implicit for lists. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 00:07, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A notability barrier is implicit for <i>the lists themselves as a whole</i>, but <i>not</i> necessarily for their individual entries. Indeed, one of the ways of including information that does not warrant an article in its own right is to include it within a list, providing context. Unfortunately, there's a tendency to over-wikify lists, especially lists of people. Then as a consequence of that people "helpfully" re-colour redlinks by adding sub-stub biographical articles that will never expand. And as the edit history of this article shows, we've <i>already had</i> non-notable deaf people added to it as redlinks at least once. <i>This</i> article does not make the inclusion criteria clear. It's title gives no clue that it is <i>not a "list of deaf people"</i>, neither does its opening paragraph, and one has to read to the <i>very end</i> of the preamble to see the phrase "notable for their leadership and accomplishments" occur at all. The case for renaming is a strong one. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:27, 2005 Mar 2 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, see <a href="../../../d/e/a/Talk%7EDeaf_f907.html#Disambiguate_the_.22List_of_deaf_people.22.3F" title="Talk:Deaf">Talk:Deaf#Disambiguate_the_.22List_of_deaf_people.22.3F</a> for ongoing discussion on cleanup/renaming. --<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPengo_70fc.html" title="User:Pengo">Pengo</a> 22:38, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I see nothing wrong with the word "deaf", and I think it's already obvious that only notable people should be included on the list. If we have a problem, we can always make it a redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_deaf_people.html" title="List of notable deaf people">List of notable deaf people</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinadot_5292.html" title="User:Binadot">Binadot</a> 22:46, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but I think all the "in later life" entries should be removed. Just about everyone who lives to a certain age experiences some degree of hearing loss. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 00:18, Mar 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Even if there is a category, it doesn't serve the same purpose as a category. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 06:21, Mar 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> if the name is changed to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_deaf_people.html" title="List of notable deaf people">List of notable deaf people</a> and all the entries can be verified. Those who have lost part of their hearing due to old age do not necessarily apply - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 09:30, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
