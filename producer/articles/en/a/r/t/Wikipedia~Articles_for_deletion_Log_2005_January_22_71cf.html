<li><b>Keep</b> This page is a draft for a set of guidelines. It is not claiming to be official policy yet. Bensaccount has not tried to discuss any issues he has with the page on its talk page before taking this route. Wikipedia needs guidelines as to how to be NPOV when comparing scientific viewpoints. This page details how NPOV policy should be applied in this situation. Perhaps people would wish to ensure these draft guidelines are reasonable and in accordance with the spirit of the NPOV rule rather than impulsively deleting them. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnaby_dawson_0c30.html" title="User:Barnaby dawson">Barnaby dawson</a> 00:49, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I would agree with changing the name to wikipedia: Draft of NPOV (Comparison of views in science) or a similar title. Note that the article does have a disclaimer at the top. Anyone disagree with a change of name? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnaby_dawson_0c30.html" title="User:Barnaby dawson">Barnaby dawson</a> 16:21, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It doesn't need a name change - putting it in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_policy_thinktank_91d8.html" title="Category:Wikipedia policy thinktank">category:Wikipedia policy thinktank</a> is the right thing to do - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 12:33, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In any case, of course (and in contrast to edits attempting to "save") don't make the change before the VfD has been closed and the permanent disposition of this subpage effected. Don't throw the closer-admin an unnecessary curve! --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 19:56, 2005 Jan 26 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> w/o regard to whether the policy proposed is sound; deletion is not the way to cope even with challenges to strongly established policies. But should it be linked into the policy think tank? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 05:23, 2005 Jan 23 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> The complaint "Policy to allow personal research" does not state a rational reason for deletion of this page. The cure to <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">personal research</a> is insisting on paraphrase, quotation, and citation to published scholarly opinion. This draft policy explicitly covers the issue of "personal research" in items 5 and 6--by requiring citation to "primary sources." ---<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERednblu_c10b.html" title="User talk:Rednblu">Talk</a> 21:03, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was delete. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a> 04:31, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>For some reason, <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a> did not carry out the delete. I reviewed this discussion thread and the relevant articles on 2 Feb in an attempt to close the remaining issues on this VfD day-page. I concur with his count of the votes for deletion. Since the anonymous votes must be steeply discounted, the concensus was a clear delete.</p>
<p>However, during a review of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Cosmic_Era_vessels" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Cosmic_Era_vessels" rel="nofollow">What links here</a>, I find a significant number of articles which <i>do</i> still link to or redirect to this page. That finding contradicts the primary argument in the deletion nomination and the assumptions made by the other voters who endorsed the nomination. I am going to exercise my obligation as an administrator to override the pure vote count and keep the article for now.</p>
<p>If/when someone cleans up all the redirects (and if it has be done in a way which preserves attribution for GFDL) so that this page really <i>is</i> no longer needed, please <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">contact me</a> or ask any administrator to review this page to see if it is then appropriate to carry out the deletion decision. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:34, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>On 20 Feb, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> reported that he had completed the clean-up. I have now carried out the deletion as decided by <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 07:24, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's true, there are still some pages that link here. Three of those pages are user talk pages, and the other two are redirects. The redirects should be expanded into their own articles, but I've never seen <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam_Seed_68d9.html" title="Gundam Seed">Gundam Seed</a> or <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam_Seed_Destiny_0b4c.html" title="Gundam Seed Destiny">Gundam Seed Destiny</a>; consequently if those pages are not made into their own articles someone will most likely nominate them for speedy deletion. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a></dd>

<li>I think some just removed all the other merge tos. Though I wonder why, since some of the things that were to be merged were somewhat trivial. I submitted several of them for SPEEDY, but they were rejected as not the right criteria. I suggest that before people delete this, that they go through <a href="../../../g/u/n/Category%7EGundam_Seed_b04f.html" title="Category:Gundam Seed">Category:Gundam Seed</a> and clean it by merging appropriate articles (some Gundam Seed zealots have been removing the merge requests on some of the minor articles) or nominating them for Deletion (there are about 100 articles on this not very noteworthy edition of Gundam).</li>

<li>Only one of the articles is over a page in length, the others are pretty short (<i>Archangel</i> being the exception).

The result of the debate was ambiguous. Votes are almost evenly split among "delete", "transwiki", "redirect" and "keep as is". Not reaching a clear concensus to delete, the article defaults to "keep" in some form.</p>
<p>Reading the current content, I also believe that this is a mere dictionary definition. It has an excellent discussion of origins, usage and similar words - exactly the content I would hope to see in a really good dictionary article. I see no potential that this will become a true encyclopedia article.</p>
<p>Noting that the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">transwiki</a> process does not destroy history and that it therefore does not require the same concensus to transwiki an article as it does to delete one, I am going to exercise my discretion as an ordinary editor to put this in the Transwiki Queue. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:45, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> (As Wingrat said, I created the page.) We have pages on other profane or pseudo-profane words, such as <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bollocks.html" title="Bollocks">bollocks</a>, and <a href="../../../t/i/t/Tits.html" title="Tits">tits</a>. Sucking (which, in my opinion, should be called <a href="../../../s/u/c/Suction.html" title="Suction">suction</a>) is an entirely different phenomenon than the slang term "sucks". If my etymology is shallow, I'd really like the input of <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEventHorizon_callingforexperts_93fe.html" title="User:EventHorizon/callingforexperts">a real linguist</a> and will defer to his or her edits. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEventHorizon_687f.html" title="User:EventHorizon">EventHorizon</a> <a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEventHorizon_f083.html" title="User talk:EventHorizon">talk</a> 05:17, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Comment</i>: I made some revisions to <a href="../../../s/u/c/Sucking.html" title="Sucking">sucking</a>, which I still think should be renamed as <a href="../../../s/u/c/Suction.html" title="Suction">suction</a>. In my opinion, the slang use of "sucks" should not be at <a href="../../../s/u/c/Suction.html" title="Suction">suction</a>. For one, I support WP in maintaining articles on things judged "offensive" by some, but I don't think a possibly offensive topic like oral sex should be in a science article (excl. biology articles where such things may be relevant). Furthermore (to get technical) oral sex, though sometimes described as "sucking" or "sucking off", does not always involve suction; they are different phenomena. You could redirect "sucks" to <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a>, but at this point, "sucks" is a slang term (or family of related slang phrases) that have little to do with oral sex. Which is why it's considered "PG" rather than PG-13 or R (in the <a href="../../../m/p/a/MPAA_rating_system_b2cc.html" title="MPAA rating system">MPAA rating system</a>). <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEventHorizon_687f.html" title="User:EventHorizon">EventHorizon</a> <a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEventHorizon_f083.html" title="User talk:EventHorizon">talk</a> 05:52, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>The etymology given disagrees with those that I have read at other sources. Redirecting to <a href="../../../s/u/c/Sucking.html" title="Sucking">sucking</a> would be to completely bypass the actual slang nature of the term. The same justification applies to this article as applies to others. "<a href="../../../b/o/l/Bollocks.html" title="Bollocks">Bollocks</a>" is a term that non-U.K. people often do not understand, let alone correctly. Equally, "<a href="../../../s/u/c/Sucks.html" title="Sucks">sucks</a>" is a term that non-U.S. people often do not understand, let alone correctly. There is an argument for Wiktionarification, but there is also a counter-argument that if these articles disappear from Wikipedia, some 10-year-old will only create juvenile rants under those titles the very next day.

<p>I should like to nominate John L. Kerry to be 'deleted'.</p>
<p>This article is not encyclopaedic knowledge (in my view) and I am not convinced it belongs in Wikipedia at all. At the least, it certainly doesn't deserve its own article. Perhaps it could be redirected to somewhere else. Furthermore the content of the article is wrong - 'John L. Kerry' does not refer to a person at all. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysteronald_4e93.html" title="User:Mysteronald">Mysteronald</a> 10:51, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Do not redirect without some verification that this is indeed a Jamaican form of "Armageddon".

Hi,</p>
<p>I was watching Animal Planet a few years ago and that told me about these Swans.</p>
<p>They showed modern color video of Mute Swans ringing a bell at the moat.</p>
<p>This video said that they were trained by a little girl(name unknown)that trained these Swans.</p>
<p>If the Swans in Wells do not do this any more, then what was I seeing?</p>
<p>I have contacted the Wells Cathedral and am waiting for a reply.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bishopspalacewells.co.uk/" class="external free" title="http://www.bishopspalacewells.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bishopspalacewells.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>I was told that the Swans "forgot" to ring the bells and had to be retrained.</p>
<p>This article Roy Smith shows is news to me.</p>
<p>Looks like there is a mystery here.</p>

Hello,</p>
<p>I finally got an email from Ms. Marian Shaw at the Bishops Palace moat at Wells cathedral who says that only one pair of Mute Swans are left that ring bells daily for food. If you do not believe this then email her at &lt;marianshaw@bishopspalacewells.co.uk&gt; . That website that says otherwise is completey innaccurate. They still do indeed ring bells for food! <a href="http://www.bishopspalacewells.co.uk/wildlife.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.bishopspalacewells.co.uk/wildlife.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bishopspalacewells.co.uk/wildlife.asp</a></p>

Hi!,</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, Are any of you Animal Lovers? Animal Rights Activists? Do you believe that we should protect animals that are Sentient beings like us?</li>
</ul>
<p>This article I wrote is proof that Mute Swans are intelligent enough to solve problems and pass their knowledge to their offspring. This is a well known phenomenon and World Famous. Do not let this person Roy Smith further debase Wikipedia. He has already deleted much knowledge from us.</p>

<p>I would generally refer to articles such as these as fancruft and be done with it, but I do not want to disparage the obvious effort that multiple contributors have put into these articles. The fact remains, however, that the articles seem a bit suspect as legitamate encyclopedia articles. They are not timelines that correspond to any particular fictional series, but detail events from a hodgepodge of different books and series smashed into one long timeline. For someone looking for information on any particular series, it would make more sense to check a page devoted to that series such as <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Star_Trek_ac3a.html" title="Timeline of Star Trek">Timeline of Star Trek</a>. Furthermore, with the amount of fiction out there, it would be impossible to make this in any way complete, and right now the article focuses on sci-fi and fantasy, adding a degree of POV as well. It seems to me that the articles in question fail to inform the reader of any information in a relevent fashion (since as I said, anyone looking for this information would be better off checking pages devoted to individual fictional universes instead) and are therefore not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 22:00, Jan 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - as one who has done a bit of work on these articles, I obviously disagree about their worthiness. I think comparing various fictional millieus together like this is quite interesting. Also, you need to fix the VfD headers on those two pages to make sure they point here to this VfD discussion, otherwise it's harder for people who have those pages watchlisted or otherwise stumble upon them to come here and vote. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:01, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Terribly sorry about the linking problem and my thanks to <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> for fixing things. While it is true that comparing "fictional millieus" as you say can be both interesting and rewarding, I believe it specious to say that these pages actually do so. They seem to be nothing more than rolls of years that list events from various universes without really doing any comparing. While some implicit comparisons can probably be drawn just by seeing some of these events side-by-side, the usefulness of these articles to draw comparisons appears rather limited. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 00:06, Jan 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Fascinating, and encyclopedic in principle.

<li>Yes, and I think that's almost inevitable if the article grows at all. But I question its usefulness... would anybody really want to read a 50-page article on Fictional Events in March, 1938, when the same info would be better put on the individual entries for the fictional works themselves, and when a lot of real historical events of the period aren't in WP yet? Who is this article for, exactly? People who want to know what Scrooge McDuck was doing in 1947 without being bothered to look up Scrooge himself? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 03:32, Jan 23, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I doubt anyone wants to read 50 pages worth of fictional things that happened in March of 1938, but IMO that's a silly strawman with no real bearing on whether these articles should be deleted - the timelines are currently nowhere near that dense, nor will they be in the forseeable future. If people are interested only in what Scrooge McDuck was doing in 1947 then this probably isn't the article for them, they should go to a Scrooge-specific article and I don't see why they'd think it'd be easier to find in this one instead. This article is for bringing together a broad range of fictional events from a variety of sources. One can use it to find out things like "what have various writers imagined the next hundred years to be like?" or "what major works of fiction have been set in the time of ancient Babylon?". How would someone do that if the date references are all scattered throughout Wikipedia's article space? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 09:58, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree that it's interesting and even useful in theory, but it's like building a bridge from Tokyo to Los Angeles: it sounds cool but you know it won't ever get even close to being finished. Even a single epic novel like <i>Gone With the Wind</i> might have 10-20 pages of timeline material or more, while something like the Marvel Universe would have tens of thousands of pages at least, and lots more new pages every month. And there's soap operas, where an hour's worth of stuff happens every say, and some of them have been running since the 50s or even earlier! When one considers the almost infinite amount of fiction out there... it's staggering. Even if all our WP editors made it their life's work to finish this article, it still wouldn't happen. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 20:59, Jan 26, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would like to contend that not all fictional historical and future events have their own timelines, and many of their timelines are not long enough to warrant a complete timeline article anyway. Having these fictional events here is an easier way to keep track of these individual "events" in a linear fashion. I would also like to argue that specific events from other timelines (most notably events from <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dates_in_Harry_Potter_db36.html" title="Dates in Harry Potter">Dates in Harry Potter</a>) be kept off these timelines; a brief mention for linear purposes is more practical.--<a href="../../../d/y/n/User%7EDynamite_XI_c221.html" title="User:Dynamite XI">DXI</a> 00:10, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Those 2 seconds weren't enough. What <i>would</i> provide a reader with "an accurate idea of how people's visions of the future have changed over time" would be the timeline of each individual universe <i>presented separately</i>, along with the date when that timeline was broadly conceived, so readers could (say) contrast a future history constructed in 1935 with a future history constructed in 1972. That's not <i>these</i> articles, by a long way. Indeed, a reader wanting to make such a comparison would support <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a>'s point of separating the timelines. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:37, 2005 Jan 24 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sounds like a worthy topic for a journal article, perhaps even a monograph, as then the data could be analyzed and interpreted, but the raw data presented in this timeline is useless for that purpose. As it stands now, it is useless due to its incompleteness. If it were completed, it would be useless for its unwieldliness.

<li>One of the major problems with these pages is that one of the biggest sources of such pseudo-history, <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a>, is vastly under-represented, but that if it <i>were</i> properly represented, the articles would be a complete mess. (The Doctor Who writers didn't work from a series bible, and historical continuity is often non-existent. Moreover, several years, such as 8891 for a trailer broadcast in 1988, were mere whimsies. There is a book, whose title I cannot remember off the top of my head, that actually constructed exactly such a timeline as this from all of the Doctor Who episodes. It was a self-contradictory hodge-podge, and massively long.) A kind of uncertainty principle operates here: These articles can either be neat and comprehendible, or inclusive and comprehensive, never both.</li>
<li>One of the minor problems with these pages is that it doesn't include the "Pulse" from <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Angel_%28TV_series%29_b030.html" title="Dark Angel (TV series)">Dark Angel</a>. The significance of this is only to be found if one considers this as being a small facet of a much larger problem. A <i>lot</i> of post-apocalyptic science fiction stories have posited a nuclear war or other such disaster in the near future. Dark Angel is but one of a <i>great many</i>. Are these pages to include <i>all</i> of the fictional disasters? It's hard to see them not doing so, given that in most of the fictional universes they are the central pivotal historical event that distinguishes them from this universe. But that means that these pages become <i>long</i> lists of fictional third world wars, atomic bomb explosions, worldwide plagues, robotic revolts, and asteriod impacts.</li>
<li>There are whole fictional timelines, such as Larry Niven's timeline for "Known Space" or the timeline(s) for James Blish's <i>Cities in Flight</i> universe(s), whose events aren't included here. But to include <i>even only them</i> would increase the sizes of these pages to the point that people would be calling for a split. And the logical way to split such articles <i>is</i> by universe, not by historical period. Splitting by historical period loses any sense of cohesion (except for those comparatively <i>few</i> pseudo-historical events that are attached to single, common, real historical events, and so can be meaningfully compared across universes), whereas splitting by universe does not. (Splitting by universe is of course what printed science-fiction encyclopaedias, which have already faced this problem, already do. It's <a href="../../../f/i/c/Category%7EFictional_timelines_91af.html" title="Category:Fictional timelines">what Wikipedia is already doing</a>, too.) Which then leads to the inevitable "Merge Timeline of events in Dark Angel with <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Angel_%28TV_series%29_b030.html" title="Dark Angel (TV series)">Dark Angel</a>!" calls.

<li>Much as I think vandalizing pages, etc, is reprehensible, I also don't think it's particularly germane to the discussion at hand. This article should stand or fall on its own merits. Oddly enough, I think there may be some value here. I've heard people use the phrase "Great Googly Moogly", and wondered about the origin. This article, silly as it may be, would have actually given me some useful (well, if not actually useful, at least relevant) information about that. So, I'm going to go out on a limb here and give it a <b><del>Cleanup and Weak Keep</del></b>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Oleg, "Original research" is a sort of shorthand phrase here. Wikipedia, like other encyclopedias, is a <i>secondary</i> reference work in which the articles are syntheses of well-known, established results that have been published elsewhere and can be referenced. You're actually supposed to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">Wikipedia:Cite your sources</a> although I'm afraid this is more acknowledged in the breach than in the observance. Wikipedia is not a vehicle for dissemination of new work. You could write <i>about</i> a computer code that someone <i>else</i> had published, in Dr. Dobbs or whatever, and if it were on the Web you could link to it, but you can't put a new program that you wrote yourself into the main Wikipedia namespace. You <i>could</i> put it on your personal user page, if you liked. In fact, that might be the best disposition for this material. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:15, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> to wikisource. I think the interesting thing here is the <i>output</i> of the program, not the program itself. I have to agree that the program falls under the 'original research' clause, so belongs more in wikisource. However, the output, that is the table of 163 numbers and their happy-number derivation sequences, is not original research and is rather useful to someone interested in exploring happy numbers. Wikipedia often has sub-article "list" pages and such pointed to by an article, and I think <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_number.html" title="Happy number">Happy number</a> could point to a list page for the 163 entries. But just transwiking the whole existing Happy number code page would serve both uses. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._S._Shaw_abc4.html" title="User:R. S. Shaw">R. S.

<dd>What I stated is that if you start in the range 1 to 163, and do some iterations, then you end up either in the 4, 16, ..., 4 loop, or at 1.
