<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Jessica Lee Rose is the lead actress in a video series that has millions of viewers, not to mention a gigantic amount of media attention (Google news count for Jessica Rose or Jessica Lee Rose is a total of over 400 articles <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22jessica+lee+rose%22&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22jessica+lee+rose%22&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;q=%22jessica%20rose%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;q=%22jessica%20rose%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). Due to lonelygirl15, she has become a big star. She's done numerous interviews now and has even been on Jay Leno. There's a strange argument that lonelygirl15 was the only notable thing she's done so far and therefore shouldn't have a page. That makes no sense. Just because an actor gains notoriety for their leading role in any single movie or TV show means they shouldn't have an article about them? Under this argument, all Big Brother (every country version) and Survivor contestants pages would be deleted. Jessica Lee Rose is arguably more well known then most of those reality show contestants with articles. That people want to delete a page about this extremely notable actress is just nonsense. She's a star now. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 21:26, 20 September 2006 (UTC))

<li>By "that link" I was answering TonyLeigh directly. Their link lacks double quotes. As for your own numbers, that total includes repeats. Unique Google hits are an important factor for editors who care about the <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOGLE_1973.html" title="WP:GOOGLE">Google test</a>.

<ul>
<li>Nobody is saying a certain article is not published in more than one place. Like with alot of google news articles, the google repeats are usually articles published in different newspapers or other news services, but from the same source. For instance, if AP writes a story, frequently many newspapers will publish the same story because the editor feels it's newsworthy for their local market and/or reader base. A newspaper editor in Seattle might choose to publish an LA Times article (provided they have a contract with said paper), then that would appear as 2 articles. That over 400 times editors choose to publish an article on Jessica Lee Rose, whether it was their own original material or not, shows she has a huge amount of media attention that can't be denied.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 23:11, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's nice, but I'm not arguing anything in particular. I'm just providing the numbers that editors tend to ask for during AfDs.

<li>The numbers for Jessica Lee Rose are much higher than your claims, anyone can see that by looking at the pages and the descriptions of what those pages contain, the numbers you quoted are way off! <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.11.html" title="User:205.188.116.11">205.188.116.11</a> 22:01, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>You'll have to be more specific about what "pages" you're talking about. I'm merely reporting the numbers Google returns on the searches I described. I'm not saying those number are low or high, so I don't understand why you think you need to "defend" against them.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Lonelygirl15 is the name of the ficitional character/series of videos she has been in. These videos are notable enough for mention so the star of them should also be. There are many one hit wonder pop stars who have articles (and big brother contestants too) and this is no diffrent. What about <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Brown_3feb.html" title="Howard Brown">Howard Brown</a> who is only notable for bank commericals in the UK (very popular ones though) who has his own article? This page should not be deleted. TonyLeigh 22:02, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This is going to be an article that grows, just like the orginal lonelygirl15 article. It will allow for some of the info to be stashed elsewhere. basically, it will keep the lg15 artcile about that, and the info about the actress seperate. The orginal arguments about lonelygirl15 in the AfD's and the undelete there are all going to be made again. I think the same outcome is going to occur. Dave 22:04, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>- Merge with <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonelygirl15.html" title="Lonelygirl15">lonelygirl15</a>. It just doesn't deserve it's own page at this time. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECriptofcorbin_060f.html" title="User:Criptofcorbin">Criptofcorbin</a> 22:18, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonelygirl15.html" title="Lonelygirl15">lonelygirl15</a>. Her only claim to fame is a direct connection to the lonelygirl15 series. Outside of her involvement in it, which is extensively covered in its own article, there's nothing of note to say about her. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 22:29, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - She's notable enough by now, and her biographical info does not belong on the Lonelygirl article.

<li>People are entitled to their point of view, especially because the point of an AfD is to solicit opinions.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't edit on this website, but frequently reference it, like I did when seeking information on this actor and that is my perspective so value my opinion accordingly. Deleting or merging the biography on this person doesn't seem consistent with the rest of this website.

This actor seems to be singled out for arbitrary reasons. 206.170.104.47 20: 54 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I may not agree with the videos and it's intended secrecy, but if we decide to merge this article with LonelyGirl15, we might as well merge all of the other articles regarding actors and actresses who are only known for one role. She has had roles in other movies besides LonelyGirl15. People seems to forget that "lonelygirl15" is mearly the title of the vlogs she is in, and she plays the role of "Bree", the lead role in them. --<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERaderick_97ff.html" title="User:Raderick">Raderick</a> 07:01, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> She isn't just Lonelygirl15, she's a young actress. She's mentioned in dozens of newspapers, appearead on The Tonight Show, and has had a minor career as a make-up artist as well. There are thousands of actors on Wikipedia who have less prominence than JLR who simply aren't flagged for deletion for the ironic reason that nobody is paying as much attention to them as they are to her, along with a sense that just because her claim to fame hasn't been developed by a major Hollywood studio it's somehow less credible than someone who appeared in three episodes of <i>The O.C.</i> - <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">dharmabum</a> 07:28, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Carl Douglas is <b>ONLY</b> known widely for <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kung_Fu_Fighting_a476.html" title="Kung Fu Fighting">Kung Fu Fighting</a>. That's it. His one claim to notability and fame in the entertainment world at large. He has done <b>nothing else</b> anywhere close the that level. So the point is if Jessica Lee Rose's page should redirect to Lonelygirl15, because that's is "the only notable thing she has done" (which is the argument for deleting her page in the first place) then Carl Douglas should redirect to the one song that has given him any notability. There is no difference in the matter. The song may have been around 30 years, so what? The man has had nothing else come close in three decades. So for you to suggest just because his one big success was many, many years ago somehow makes him more worthy of a page than Jessica Lee Rose because her one notable credit (so far) happened this year is what is what is silly. She's also got much more chance of doing something else more notable than <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Douglas_f7b0.html" title="Carl Douglas">Carl Douglas</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Beck_51f5.html" title="Robin Beck">Robin Beck</a> et all because it's a fact those people have failed again and again to have another success over many years of failed attempts to recapture their one moment in the limelight, what the future holds for Jessica Rose is still yet unknown. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.71.html" title="User:64.12.116.71">64.12.116.71</a> 00:15, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I never said Wikipedia is a Crystal Ball, I said quite the opposite. However, you CAN compare someone who has starred in an online Internet show that has been seen by millions to a person who has had one major hit single. They both have had the limelight for one thing and one claim to fame. There is no difference between Carl Douglas and Jessica Rose other than one is a one shot singer and the other a one shot actress, therefore she is just as worthy of a page as he. If the wiki guidelines somehow view that as different then that is crazy. If the guidelines were than black and white surely this VFD wouldn't even be here, the page simply wouldn't have existed (or at least just simply and quickly been deleted) <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.71.html" title="User:64.12.116.71">64.12.116.71</a> 11:04, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your example of Carl Doulgas is flawed. Douglas's <i>major</i> claim to fame is "Kung Fu Fighting," but it is not his only one. His song "Dance the Kung Fu" was a top ten hit on Billboard's R&amp;B chart. That too is pretty notable; hence, I won't be nominating Douglas for deletion. Robin Beck had a very prolific career as a background vocalist on popular hits before her success with "The First Time," which gives her notability outside of her song. If Jessica Rose ever does something comparable, this article can be recreated... but she hasn't yet. GassyGuy 15:29, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
