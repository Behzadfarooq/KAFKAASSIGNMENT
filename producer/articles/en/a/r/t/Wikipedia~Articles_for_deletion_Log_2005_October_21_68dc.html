<li>Comment: I'm opposed to transwiki. Nobody should put this, or anything, in the Farsi wikipedia, unless they're fluent in Farsi, and are capable of reading the text. The two-weeks on <a href="../../../p/n/t/WP%7EPNT_42b9.html" title="WP:PNT">WP:PNT</a> was for the purpose of finding such a person, who was able/willing to do something with the content (which could mean making an English version and/or putting it in the Farsi version).

<li>You're right it does disagree completely with me, and I completely disagree with it.

It's bad enough we give it the two weeks and five days, but now it's gonna get even more time. We desperately need a speedy delete for this.

<li><b>Comment</b>: borderline notability, plus the fact that is patented does not warrant deletion.

<ul>
<li>Well, according to our article here on patents, there have been well over 100,000 patents granted in the US alone. To me, that doesn't in itself warrant inclusion. As for not being an ad, well a single line whose sole purpose is to mention a minor consumer product more or less <i>is</i> an ad, whether it reads like one or not. Something needn't be dripping with praise to advertize. Ask any company that endorses NASCAR. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:49, 21 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While I agree on your comment about advertisement, you also have to realise that the patent thing is used as an argument for deletion, which is not. The fact is, Wikipedia <i>has</i> articles on patented materials and one can even argue than an invention granted a patent <i>may</i> be notable enough just for being, well, an invention. As a side comment, the graph in the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent.html" title="Patent">patent</a> article shows patents granted per year in the U.S., so the total number of granted patents clearly exceeds 100,000 (and is in fact around a few million already). -- <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune.welsh_2e22.html" title="User:Rune.welsh">Rune Welsh</a> | <a href="../../../r/u/n/User_talk%7ERune.welsh_7599.html" title="User talk:Rune.welsh">ταλκ</a> | <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#339900">Esperanza</font></a> 22:01, 21 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>100,000 did seem awful low. I should read things more carefully. Anyway, I didn't mean to imply it being a patent was a <i>reason</i> for deletion, just that a patent is really all it says it is, and that being one of several million patents is not a claim of notability. Obviously we have articles on patented items (<a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonograph.html" title="Phonograph">phonograph</a> is certainly not going to show up as a redlink). -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:18, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>OK I started rewording it and cleaned up the definition but when I got to the sections I realized that they're already covered on their individual pages (and much better so) which was stated by the nominator. What's more is that it should really just redirect to <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arithmetic.html" title="Arithmetic">Arithmetic</a> or <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elementary_arithmetic.html" title="Elementary arithmetic">Elementary arithmetic</a>, because that's the more correct name.

<li>Hmm.. would the redirect really be ideal? While the original article was discussing <i>arithmetic</i>, not basic mathematics -- both articles skip discussion of the most basic and fundamental ideas of them all; deductive reasoning -- if there's something it should redirect to, it's probably just <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">Mathematics</a>, which, of course, should say something about <i>Elementary Mathematics</i>, but <i>Basic Mathematics</i> seems like a much broader category ... --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> (<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysidia_50b2.html" title="User talk:Mysidia">talk</a>) 01:44, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Merge</b> (3m, 2d).

<li><b>Comment:</b> ZDnet has in recent months published a number of articles (sometimes categorized as "commentary" instead of "news" in ways not obvious to casual readers) containing assertions that were verifiably untrue (disprovable with a couple of minutes of research) and apparently motivated by blatant commercial interests. They've had to publish retractions and apologies. I do <i>not</i> recommend treating a label in one of their columns or headlines as an authoritative source establishing notability.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Let's just remind ourselves what Wikipedia is about ... it's about there being somewhere where people can go to get access to the sum of human knowledge. My view on deletion proposals like this one is that if (a) somebody, somewhere, at some point, might want to find out about a particular topic, and (b) a Wikipedia article exists which has the potential to enable somebody to become more informed about that subject than they were before reading that article and (c) the subject matter doesn't sit better in one of the other Wikimedia projects, we shouldn't be deleting it. On this basis, there is enough in this article to warrant it being kept. There appears to be an element of "I didn't learn anything from this article, so no-one else could either" in some of the above comments. Put yourselves in the position of someone who knows absolutely nothing about cakes, who hears the phrase "Date and walnut loaf" for the first time, and looks it up in Wikipedia. What value would this article provide? First it would enable them to validate that such a cake does actually exist; without this article, for all they know, Date &amp; Walnut loaf is as fictitious as "rhubarb and hazelnut tart" or "gooseberry and brazil nut pie". The article give details of a geographical area in which the cake is a traditional food, and in which it is still eaten. It also gives two pieces of information about the the cake's composition over and above what one could glean from the name. I make that five useful pieces of information in total. Add to that the links to recipes, and ... Wow! What a useful article!! But then I wrote it so I'm biased... <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 17:28, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>It also tells me it's a kind of cake, not a kind of bread or meatloaf, which it might have been. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 17:42, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>And not forgetting the categorisation at the bottom, which will introduce our cake virgin to a whole new world of information about cakes. Delete? ... Pfffff!!!!! <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 22:01, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To be fair to SP-KP, I spent about 30 minutes searching for information to add to this article. A google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22date%20and%20walnut%20loaf%22%20-recipe%20-chopped" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22date%20and%20walnut%20loaf%22%20-recipe%20-chopped" rel="nofollow">"date and walnut loaf" -recipe -chopped</a> gives 502 results, most of which just link to recipe pages. I can't find anything about the history of this cake, how it became a traditional British recipe, its popularity in various regions, etc. That is, I can't find anything that could reasonably be used to expand the article. I have no problem with stub articles, but they should have a potential for expansion; I can find no evidence that such information exists for this article. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix">Mindmatrix</a> 17:50, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As a further note, I wanted this article <b>transwikied</b> because I think the information in this article should be salvaged, and I'm sure someone would be willing to add a recipe to go with it. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix">Mindmatrix</a> 17:55, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article needs to be expanded heavily though, as a stub it is close to useless <i>"Date and Walnut Load"</i> made with <i>Dates and Walnuts</i>. <a href="../../../y/_/c/User%7EY_control_a9b9.html" title="User:Y control">Y control</a> 10:35, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and expand</b>. Yes, as it stands currently, it is a bad article (actually, not really an article at all). Nevertheless, as Kappa points out, it's a traditional food, and as such, I am sure that quite a bit could be added to this article. Why do people make these? What time of year do they eat them? Do they keep them, or give them away as gifts (see also <a href="../../../f/r/u/Fruitcake.html" title="Fruitcake">fruitcake</a>)? Who made the first one? etc. (Also, if you can't find this kind of information online, that doesn't mean there's nothing at your local library.... Google is not the sum of all information.) --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 02:56, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I wasn't trying to imply that google, or the internet, is the only repository of information. Rather, it was the most convenient way to search for information for me - not everyone has access to a decent library. I also wanted to show that I didn't just mindlessly nominate this; I did put in some effort to try and expand the article. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix">Mindmatrix</a> 17:43, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This word is in usage in everyday speech, maybe not everywhere, but it is an incredibly useful word. I understand your skepticism, but there is not other word for "to idealize at a distance" and its popularity is growing based solely on the fact that there is no other word with this definition. It is especially in use in Blogs, Livejournals, Myspaces and other cybercommunity sites. The idea of Wikipedia is that it can pick up on new facts before they hit the encyclopedias or even newspapers. And so Keep, I say. Keep

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It's important to remember to not let your emotions get in the way of your judgment. This article is NPOV (notice how some positive stereotypes are included as well as the negative). Most importantly, this is not yet an article. Grue has every right to keep this in his user space. It's far from a personal attack. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAcetic_Acid_8f87.html" title="User talk:Acetic Acid"><font color="#0AC92B">Ac</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#00CD00">e</font></a><a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAcetic_Acid_8f87.html" title="User talk:Acetic Acid"><font color="#0AC92B">tic</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random"><font color="#FFFFFF">'</font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcetic_Acid_31d1.html" title="User:Acetic Acid"><font color="#FF8247">Acid</font></a></sup> 04:33, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I feel this article may be useful to some people (for example if you want to count how many stereotypes are encountered in some movie), so I'm keeping it in my user space. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 07:15, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The list isn't a personal attack against any particular WP user (or any particular group either). It is just an insult catalog with the hope of being exhaustive. In this context, even the insults that might be directed <i>at me</i> are usefully listed. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:40, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Grue is not stating a personal belief in any of these stereotypes. Like it or not, stereotypes are part of life; there's nothing wrong with cataloguing them. This is a userpage, in any event. - <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESensor_bf13.html" title="User:Sensor">Sensor</a> 23:12, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep it and close out the discussion.</b> I nominated this mostly becuase I was not sure what the attitudes of WP would be.

<li><b>Keep but edit.</b> I also believe that it is useful for some to see these entries. I like that it is so comprehensive in covering so many different groups. However, it does need to be edited, both for content and grammar/spelling/etc. - User:Sorria2000 26 October 2005</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - Our site is pretty well-known. The only problem with a listing on Wikipedia is that users like to post things on here to put down other users, so if we quit doing that, it wouldn't be such a problem...haha -sickmyduck</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - The article is actually a good depeiction of the ICB2 and to say that it's irrelevant on a site like Wikipedia is not only sheer stupidity, but it also happens to be very subjective. Does Wikipedia necessarily <i>need</i> articles on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_15_in_rail_transport" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_15_in_rail_transport" rel="nofollow">February 15th in rail transport</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/205_Martha" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/205_Martha" rel="nofollow">205 Martha</a>? <b>No.</b> This article has been marked for deletion because of a vendetta, pure and simple.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - Fuckin' Hun bastards and their biases, First gas warfare, then the fucking holocaust, and now this. Kraut these buddy</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - ICB2 is a rebellion against the moderators and users of the site and company that is IGN. To delete this would show certain favoritism towards IGN and no equal oppertunity towards other small sites that are showing other options and facets of gaming industry.</li>

<p><a href="http://boards.icb2.com/" class="external free" title="http://boards.icb2.com/" rel="nofollow">http://boards.icb2.com/</a> is the web address of the ICB2 (Short for Insider Community Board part deux), commonly referred to as "The Deuce". It is a forum where refugees from IGN's original Insider Community Board regularly post. Topics range from politics to s&amp;m, which makes for an ideal place of varied discussion, criticism and opinions. There is usually a harsh "breaking in" of new users, which ultimately leads to them leaving angered if they haven't been blessed with a hard outer shell, or staying for the ride if they can take the initial ribbing. Many new users at first cannot comprehend what is the initial attraction of The Deuce, yet given a few weeks they too, become regulars. For the moment there are twelve people total who are in charge of keeping the peace, yet The Deuce is far from authoritarian, with Moderators, Managers and Administrators rarely taking their power into account.</p>
<p><br />
The user count of The Deuce has been estimated to be in the thousands, yet the regular poster count whittles this down to the couple hundreds. Most users who secede from the original ICB rarely opt to go back, for said forum leaves one's freedom greatly severed, this being embodied in censorship, overly strict moderators, etc.&#160;; This explains why the original ICB is slowly but surely dying, for where there once was a golden age of discussion, there it now lies a rotted corpse of its former self, averaging barely thirty or so posts a day.</p>
<p><br />
There is said to be a certain rivalry between the ICB and The Deuce, with the ICB claiming Deucers to be vulgar and low in IQ count. The Deucers claim ICBers are prude ninny conformists, in their own right. Who knows if someday the two will join forces once again?</p>
<p>P.S. Don't buy anything from SaffronsGhost.</p>

<li>lol, how did I know - *know* - Kappa would vote to keep this&#160;;)&#160;? The Troll will be next. Anyway, to me this reads like a personal CV, complete with redolent hyperbole (<i>vast</i> public service, <i>proud</i> parent - as opposed to all those ashamed ones out there); I say <b>Delete</b> since this is a classic, straight up, textbook example of a vanity page and I highly doubt that such officials are important to <i>every resident of New Jersey</i> considering that barely a fifth of them bother to show up and vote in these elections (probably less). The remarks above from <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> are chilling insofar as it looks like waves of self-authored New-Jersey-Minor-Public-Officialdomcruft is coming down the pipeline.

<li>One of the reasons that "barely a fifth of them bother to show up and vote" for these "New-Jersey-Minor-Public-Officialdomcruft" is that residents don't know who they are. Every two-bit musician with a demo disk, every professional wrestler and bit-character on a TV show has a page. The bar ought to be set far higher in justifying deletion of a page for officials elected at this level. 31,940 registered voters in Passaic County -- more than any of the five other candidates -- voted in favor of Mr. Gallagher in the 2003 election. So far, one aggrieved Wikipedian has voted against. I'd say the people have spoken. Empower citizens instead of trying to keep them uninformed and then maybe they will show up at the next election. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 16:48, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

The closest I've known anyone ever coming to this would be in the <a href="../../../d/s/m/DSM_IV_2543.html" title="DSM IV">DSM IV</a>, but even those definitions are fairly generalized and subjective, which leads me to my next point.</li>
<li>Unlike most articles, this one could eventually become a breeding ground for <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> violations. One user might consider another user "eccentric" or "wierd" and place them on there.</li>
<li>What defines "widely"? That's another fairly subjective term, "widely" to one person can be entirely different than "widely" to someone else. If anyone has a precedent on what that actually is (I have a viewpoint on my user page, but that's just a viewpoint and not binding towards anything other than that), please let me know.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the very least, this article needs to be renamed, and drastically cleaned up, perhaps to the point of where it would need to become a <a href="../../../c/o/t/WP%7ECOTW_227d.html" title="WP:COTW">Collaboration of the Week</a> for it to be fixed.

<li>Yes, he could have been, if any significant groups had tried to paint his unusual activities as "eccentric" rather than either "holy and righteous" or "dangerously subversive". But since none did, he doesn't belong on the "list of people widely considered eccentric". This list is not about people who <i>are</i> eccentric, it's about people who have been <i>considered</i> eccentric. Hence even if Jesus shares some traits with people on this list, it doesn't matter as long as few, if any, would associate him with eccentricity. This page is as much about popular opinion as about the people listed themselves; it would even be appropriate to list someone who a smear campaign tried to label as "eccentric", as long as that view has become a very dominant one. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:40, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

The fact that a topic is disputable does not imply that it is impossible to write about; just because different people have conceptions of what is or isn't eccentric doesn't mean that there <i>aren't</i> people who are widely considered eccentric. Additionally, "eccentric" is hardly comparable to "list of fat people" or "list of stupid people", as it's a very specific term, is certainly not strictly pejorative, and, even if it isn't <i>universally</i> conceived of in a singular, exact way, it's still certainly <i>very widely</i> conceived of as having a certain set of noteworthy traits. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:00, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree entirely with Rarr's description of this as a "valid article", Comic's statement that there is "no harm in keeping it, but we lose something if we don't," and it has nothing to do with the POV red herring. No one has yet said anything about <i>why this list ever should have been started to begin with,</i> and I do believe that list writers have to meet a burden of proof to show that. What purpose does putting ~150 people's names into a list serve? How can this list expand anyone's understanding of the concept of <a href="../../../e/c/c/Eccentricity_%28behavior%29.html" title="Eccentricity (behavior)">eccentricity</a>, or expand someone's knowledge about any of the listed people? I contend that it cannot, and as such, <i>the list makes no positive contribution to Wikipedia and two negative ones</i>: it wastes server space and adds clutter, and worse, it furthers the false and detrimental attitude that vapid, unproductive, lists are permissible. I believe that this is a vapid, unproductive list, and will continue to do so until someone convinces me not that we <i>can</i> build an objective list of eccentrics, but that we <b>should</b> build such a list. Until such time, I strongly urge all editors to join me in calling for this entry's deletion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 01:47, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There are several figures in history who are mostly noted for being eccentric. Several books and documentaries of eccentric people have been done. A list allows you to easily get to articles concerning such people without the same kind of groping a category or nothing would do. Now the list as it currently stands is poor, but you can strongly urge something without being right. If it is to be deleted I hope there is in least a category for eccentrics to replace it unless there is such a category already.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dl>
<dd>As you've noticed, there is a Category:Notable eccentrics. However, don't rush off to add people to that category quite yet: if this deletion succeeds, that one will inevitably follow very quickly, as there's even <i>more</i> of a case for deleting the category than the article (i.e. the category is genuinely POV because it specifically says that the people listed <i>are</i> "eccentrics"; the page is not inherently POV, because it says "people <i>widely considered</i> eccentric": it's <i>about</i> POVs, it's not POVed itself). Personally, I'd support keeping both the category (though rename the category to "People widely considered eccentric"; the "noteworthy" is unnecessary, both because it's POV and because anyone noteworthy enough to be on Wikipedia is already noteworthy enough to be in the category, hence redundant) <i>and</i> the list. Or, if I had to choose one or the other, I'd probably choose: the list. Why? Consider:
<ol>
<li>Lists are maintained on a single page that anyone can easily monitor and check on the validity of each new addition to the page, while also ensuring that noone who belongs on the page gets removed. Categories, being based on edits to hundreds of distinct articles, are next to impossible to keep clean of bogus additions, especially when they get large. The easiest way to maintain the category would be to have both the category and the list, and simply once in a while go through the category with the list in hand and check to see if there's anyone on the list who's not on the category, or vice versa; then investigate why the discrepency exists, and correct it (either by removing the person from one or adding the person to the other).</li>
<li>With a list, it's possible to list <i>explanations</i> next to each person to specify <i>why</i> they're considered eccentric. Even if you think that the current way the LoPWCE handles descriptions is poor (I certainly do), it's <i>improvable</i> and could eventually be quite valuable, whereas with a category there will never be an efficient way to explain <i>why</i> each person is on the list; it's nothing but a big alphabetized list of names, no more useful to someone not familiar with the individuals than if the page was total gibberish. If we had both the list and the category, the category could be the quick, easy, shorthand version of the list, providing the brief alphabetized archive, whereas the list would be more expansive and informative, providing further subdivisions to make exploration easier—whereas the category makes it easier to find a <i>single person</i> who you already know of and are looking for, which I'd say is less important than the list's role, because if you already know the guy's name you can just do a Search for him anyway. Descriptions, on the other hand, highlight perceived eccentric behavior, occupation, nationality, etc. and give people much more to work with.</li>
<li>Criticize the current list if you want for not being cited (I added a NOR tag to it, incidentally, so we can get started on the long-term mission of adding sources for all the claims eventually), but keep in mind that it's at least eventually <i>possible</i> to have a fully-cited, expansive, high-quality article named "List of people widely considered eccentric", even if that's not a practical likelihood (though I think it is!). Categories make citation impossible; we just have to accept the people included as gospel, and centralizing debate over which people to include and which not to include will be <i>nightmarish</i> without an article page, as much of the discussion of who is and isn't "widely considered eccentric" will end up centering on the pages of the individual people described, making consistency a huge issue! Having both list and category gives us the best of both worlds, tying everything into a single article but <i>also</i> involving each individual article in the article by putting the category at the bottom of their pages. Win-win.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and possibly <b>rename</b>. The current name arose from the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_notable_eccentrics_ba07.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of notable eccentrics">second deletion debate</a> back in December 2004. A number of users have brought up concerns about the term "widely", and I agree. In the second debate. the original proposed name was "List of individuals who are famous for being widely considered to be eccentric". I cut it down to "List of people widely considered to be eccentric", and soon another user moved it to its current title, without the "to be" (which was a big <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elements_of_Style_aa68.html" title="Elements of Style">Elements of Style</a> blunder on my part&#160;:-) ). Looking back on the original title, I think the "famous" part was more important than the now-disputed "widely" part, mostly because I think it's a good idea to keep this to people famous for their eccentricity, perhaps among other things. So, how about this for a new title: List of people famous for being considered eccentric. Anyway, now I'll try to get off that tangent... We'll never agree on an <i>absolute</i> place to draw the line between "eccentric" and "normal", but I think most of the people on this list do belong here. Who would argue that, say, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Hughes_c1be.html" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> isn't enough of a weirdo for this list? How about <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua_A._Norton_8e48.html" title="Joshua A. Norton">Norton I of the United States</a>? Another important point: we're not asserting that the people on this list <i>are</i> eccentric, only that they're <i>perceived</i> as such. But isn't such a judgment unverifiable and subject to bias and original research? Not necessarily. How much dispute can there be, from contemporary accounts and elsewhere, that a lot of people think it's really, really weird to <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Winchester_2c5e.html" title="Sarah Winchester">build a house for 38 years to confuse the spirits</a> or <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Wilson_47c4.html" title="Brian Wilson">spend years doing nothing but lying around in bed</a>? <a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak"><font color="green"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">sɪzlæk</span></font></a> [ <a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak">+t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Szyslak_7616.html" title="Special:Contributions/Szyslak">+c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Szyslak_1b31.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Szyslak">+m</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">+e</font></a> ] 09:44, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not a bad idea, but I think that would cause new problems with many of the people on the list. For example, could we keep Albert Einstein on the list? He's famous for being eccentric, but only because he's <i>already</i> much for famous for other, unrelated things. Furthermore, it doesn't do anything at all to solve the main problem people have had with the current wording: that there's no solid, definite line to draw between "widely considered" and "not widely considered". I don't see a big problem with this myself, since I expect that only a few cases will have disputes over whether or not they're "widely considered" enough, and the rest will be pretty obvious one way or the other, but for those who do object on these grounds, adding "famous" has the exact same problem: where do you draw the line between "famous" and "not famous"? How "famous" do you have to be, and how "eccentric", and how "widely considered"? Personally, I think the ideal way to implement the concept of "people who are famous for being widely considered eccentric" vs. "famous people who are widely considered eccentric" is to keep the list where it is, but have some extra marker, like an asterisk, to denote people who are famous chiefly or entirely <i>because</i> of their eccentricity (as many on the list are), vs. famous historical figures who happen to also be widely considered eccentric. Of course, this line isn't the easiest one to draw in some situations either, since there are a lot of "kind of noteworthy" people who might have a Wikipedia article without their bizarre quirk, but are enormously <i>more</i> noteworthy for it. So.. tricky. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 10:06, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>But what's the point?</i> Yes, Sarah Winchester, Brian Wilson, Norton I, and Howard Hughes may well all be widely considered eccentrics, or famous for their eccentricity, or widely notable people who are or have been regarded as eccentric by a proportionally significant percentage of the population, or whatever you want to call the list. What I <i>don't</i> understand is what reason there is for putting all those people together in a list. Is it just for the amusement of people like Clapaucius? Or the convenience of his hypothetical researcher? Or Silence's claims that it's better than a category? Those aren't good enough for me. Besides, eccentricity is an encyclopedic concept, but that only justifies eccentricity. The listed people may be encyclopedic, but that only justifies their individual articles. Neither justifies the list. As far as I can tell, <i>there is no reason that this list, in any form, by any title, with any inclusionary criteria, should remain on Wikipedia as an independent entry.</i> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 14:54, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I did not base my "keep" vote on the fact that it's better than a category; that argument came later, in response to T. Anthony finding that category and assuming that it would be used if this list was deleted we would simply switch to the category, when I believe that ideally we should use both. While I disagree with the people who have voted to delete this page, I at least <i>understand</i> those who have voted to delete it on the basis that it's unsalvageably biased (though it's not <i>inherently</i> biased, contrary to some votes above) or who think that it should be cut down to only a handful of people and merged into the eccentric behavior article. However, if you base your "strong delete" vote (the only one on the whole page so far) on the fact that you personally simply aren't interested in the topic (which your latest comments have led me to believe; do correct me if I am mistaken) and hence it's "listcruft" to you, I'd take issue with that (though of course you have the right to vote as you wish). The fact that <i>you</i> would never use a page like this doesn't mean that noone else would have a legitimate reason to research noteworthy people who have been considered eccentric throughout history. Additionally, the fact is, while perhaps most of the people on the list of eccentric people currently are also famous for something other than their perceived eccentricity, a large number <i>aren't</i> really noteworthy for anything (or much) other than their unusual, eccentric behavior or qualities. Those sorts of people would not be listed anywhere else on Wikipedia where a person would find their articles while casually browsing, and thus many high-quality, interesting, informative, useful articles on significant topics would almost never be read, even by people with a special interest in eccentrics. Lists and categories like this, disputable and hard to maintain though they may be, are beyond a shadow of a doubt <i>useful</i> to many people, as there are many people who are very interested in and study people throughout history who have defied social norms and established themselves as "eccentrics". And that is the purpose of this page. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 10:36, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why do we have to be signed in order to be "notable"? We can't self produce our albums? Who cares if we have a myspace site or not? In fact a lot of notable bands have myspace pages. We do have a real site, if you search on google for "necron+band" or "necron+chestertown" we will get results. We might be getting signed anyway to an indie DIY label. -Necron

<li><i>Why do we have to be signed in order to be "notable"?</i> is a very good question.

<dd>While 'opposition' is a more NPOV term, the article on 'persecution' is really about that (persecution of JW during WWII and/or in Soviet Union would hardly be fittingly described by the title "Opposition to...".

<li><b>Merge</b> Persecution article into Opposition article. There should definitely be an Opposition article, since, as was mentioned above, there are things that are Opposition that aren't Persecution (heck, I would probably say that there's a heck of a lot more regular Opposition than outright Persecution). Technically, stuff like Nazi Persecution is also Opposition, but, being a pretty specific and severe type of Opposition, also deserves its special mention. My original thought was that, if one had to go, merge them together as an Opposition article, since Opposition encompasses Persecution and considerably more. Maybe it's possible to keep both, but there's bound to be difficulty and subjectiveness in splitting the line between regular Opposition and Persecution (the Nazi stuff is obvious, but not everything involves the Nazis), assuming that we don't want half of each article to be the same as half of the other one. I still think the cleaner solution is to just merge everything into the Opposition article, and perhaps have a separate section in it just for things that can also be classified as Persecution if it's that important. This way, people aren't left to decide whether something should go in one of the articles, or the other article, or both articles, or what, there's just one article that contains everything related to Opposition.<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommstein_671e.html" title="User:Tommstein">Tommstein</a> 11:03, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> Persecution article into Opposition article keeping all relevant info. Opposition takes many forms (like efforts to delete information regarding opposition to JWs), persecution is more specific so it would make sense for it to be folded into the more general article. After merging a general cleanup and deletion of redundant material would be in order. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDannyMuse_9f6f.html" title="User:DannyMuse">DannyMuse</a> 02:54, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> These are definitely different topics. A person may oppose the group's behavior due to what they perceive as a mistranslation of a bibical text, for example, and yet not persecute them.

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../l/a/s/LASIK_194d.html" title="LASIK">LASIK</a>] and <b>delete</b>. I can't help but point out that this content was written by me, and that I had originally put it in the <a href="../../../l/a/s/LASIK_194d.html" title="LASIK">LASIK</a> article. Another user took issue with this and we got into an edit war, and then he inappropriately moved the content to its own entry. I then made NUMEROUS attempts to get community input on the issue and it went completely ignored. The content is relevant and Kathy Griffin has been a VERY VOCAL opponent of the surgery; she is not simply expressing a POV, but she gives a detailed, <b>FACTUAL</b> account of her own experiences with the surgery including the fact that it left her partially blind. She has spoken out about it on numerous television shows, most notably Oprah. The section should be merged back into the LASIK article and should be left there for expansion of other notable and informed individuals including but not limited to scientists, doctors, or other noteworthy individuals (celebrity or otherwise) with informative, factual stances on the surgery in question. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 07:55, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree that the <a href="../../../l/a/s/LASIK_194d.html" title="LASIK">LASIK</a> article should present “informative, factual stances on the surgery”, and thus far it does. Anyone reviewing that article will see that the attention given to the potential drawbacks of LASIK in the discussion of complications, factors affecting surgery, and concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of the procedure far outweighs any discussion of the procedure’s benefits. The blurb regarding Griffin, however, is NOT directly relevant to building a neutral and informative article on LASIK. It is indeed a fact that Griffin reports having a poor outcome and that she believes LASIK is an inherently bad procedure, but there are no specific facts about <i>LASIK</i> in Prominent proponents/opponents of LASIK or on her website.</li>

If we must present Griffin's POV, then put it in <i>her</i> article.<a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardian_b62f.html" title="User:Edwardian">Edwardian</a> 04:53, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There should not be a list, and the page should be <b>d</b>eleted. If Kathy Griffin has made it to Oprah there may be a case for <b>m</b>erging that back into the LASIK article. This does not seem to be a common occurrence, which is why I would recommend that every doctor who treats a celebrity should have the consent meeting witnessed by a lawyer and a confidentiality agreement signed by the patient at the same time&#160;:-). <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 20:57, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

The page itself seems in the main to be one user's reaction against the neutrality of several bike and bike safety pages.</p>

<li><b>Don't delete</b> - A merge of Strawberry Press into Strawberry Ragtime makes sense to me. However, the magazine exists, and I have already said I would be willing to send copies to Wikipedia to prove its existence. Online it can be viewed at[ <a href="http://strawberryragtime.com" class="external free" title="http://strawberryragtime.com" rel="nofollow">http://strawberryragtime.com</a>] I'm not sure how the process of verifying these things goes, but you can call St Mark's Bookshop as well (212) 260-7853, and ask them about it. They can verify its existence. The magazine had a print run of about 500 copies a month, which isn't much, but it is something. Also, the magazine published many different writers from all over the world. I'm sorry for the anonymous IP address. I even tried creating an account this morning, but I don't know how to have my account logged in when I type this. The other anonymous IP addresses are from writers/ readers of the press I asked for support. Please give us a chance. -Whit Frazier</li>

<p>'* <b>Reply to strong delete</b> The only person involved in the creating of the magazine from above is me. I sent out an email to old writers, and readers who had written in with comments asking for support. How else would people know this discussion was going on? Like I said, SR was and is a small operation. I repeat that there are not many venues for talented, marginalized writers, as many little literary zines as there are, because the focus is ultimately profit. Since I pay for absolutely everything out of my own pocket to run this operation, there is no profit here for me. There is a fan base. Give people time to write in. Did you visit the site?

It's not fair to have this on AFD when it's currently protected, either. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:00, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> is this encyclopedic? Instructions for something destructive and yes, illegal, does not strike me as something that should be in Wikipedia.

<ul>
<li>Why not? Knowledge is why we're all here, spreading it is good and hiding it is bad. If people don't know what helps murderers get away then murderers will continue to use those methods. More knowledge is a better defence than less. Simililarly with suicide - the less we talk about it, the greater a problem it is. Ifnord 02:41, 21 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well like I said, it's something illegal and destructive... giving out instructions is risky. For one thing, suppose someone follows the instructions and their family sues WP or even the editors of the article? But that's probably beyond the scope of an AfD. Discussing suicide/other harmful or illegal things is one thing, telling people how to do it is another. Just looking at that list, it could point someone who is suicidal to a more effective method... that kind of bothers me. I just don't see how that kind of stuff belongs in an encyclopedia...--<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 02:49, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>There could be any number of jurisdictions where suicides (and physician-assisted suicides) are legal or illegal, but that has no baring on this work of text. <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F_6995.html" title="User:Yamaguchi先生">Yamaguchi先生</a> 03:23, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> this because it is a valid subject. Wikipedia has an article on <b><a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape_fantasy.html" title="Rape fantasy">Rape fantasy</a></b> as well.

<li>I disagree, this is a notable message board as measured by a) traffic, b) members, and c) relevance to commercial activity. Over the course of 2005 the message board has received tens of thousands of posts in response to in excess of 1000 topics. It represents a notable number of users drawn together by their enthusiasm for one of the most widely distributed and played MMORPGS of 2005. While there is no shortage of "non-notable boards", this is not one of them and it merits a listing in the Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.6.152.58 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.6.152.58_79c1.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.6.152.58">contribs</a>) 2005-10-21 05:05:32 UTC.</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> since it's annoyingly registration only to do anything, I can't verify the popularity of the board at the moment. It needs to have a certain ammount of traffic and unique, active members (5,000+ or so) to be notable enough for WP. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 05:21, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I don't see how signficant verifiable information could be gathered on this. I'll reconsider if somebody shows verifiable independent sources that show there's a basis for writing a good article. If one has to log into the site to get any substantial information on it, then I think that pretty much disqualifies it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:01, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

I thought about trying to just move it to here, the problem with that is I don't know how that would affect the old closure, which I'd hate to see that day stay open just for this.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I went back and took a look at Eskimo Bob's AfD. There were 4 registered votes, 2 keep, 2 delete. The 2 delete were obvious experienced users, the 2 keeps were obviously new users, but not obviously meat/sockpuppets. Both had about 20 edits, and the focus did not seem to be on Bob or it's ilk. Thus, 2 v 2 is no consensus, and as a result, keep. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibofh_f636.html" title="User:Wikibofh">Wikibofh</a> 15:42, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is another one that was taken out of Britannica.

<dd>It might have been notable in 1911, but is it notable now? I have spent many hours in electrical wholesalers over the years and never heard this term! Maybe it's US-specific? It's just another type of uplighter, after all. Not that I diss Britannica, an old friend wrote the article on heating and ventilation for Britannica, but it does not seem to have much point as a standalone article. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 11:37, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment (no vote)</b>. I agree that the band meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> (I consider Tenacious D a big enough deal to meet point 5). My personal feeling, though I'm not voting, is that this article probably won't ever get much bigger, and therefore doesn't need its own space.

<li>There are thousands of brands, many of which are not notable at all, and they all have big marketing machines behind them... they don't need free advertising IMO, and I'm not sure most of the articles are encyclopedic, unless they can include stuff like histories, controversies, lawsuits, or perhaps even significant cultural references. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 17:38, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>I was at the meeting of the WPCUG in Windsor Ontario ,on Oct 20/05 when this article was created. It was used as a demo to illustrate how to post an artile on Wikipedia and it was intended that members would log on and edit or expand the info in this article as per your policies. The demo lasted over an hour and a half. Most people there including myself, had never heard of this web site and were quite interested. Your protocalls and/or language requirements were new to us so much effort went to showing how various elements could be created. It was intended an is a learning tool. I assure you this is neither a vanity ad article nor a hoax. Art Belanger belanger@mnsi.net</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, unfortunately since this usergroup appears not to be notable enough beyond its current membership. You might as well have used the sandbox for the demonstration of the wiki. Please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What wikipedia is not</a>, specially the section on "free hosting". Of course, you and your usergroup are encouraged to keep contributing to wikipedia.

<p>The reason for this artile is to give history of our users group. The article the way it stands is a stepping stone for our membership to give it life. The point of the Wikipedia is knowledge, knowledge of things present and past, which is what we entended out entry to be. It was not a 'vanity' post as was suggested. I ask what we would have to do to keep this page on your site. We feel that the history of our club is something that can benefit the internet community. Michael Celotto mcelotto@cogeco.ca</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The first thing you see on their web site is the link to their entry on Wikipedia and anyway what about all the other WPCUG groups?. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> 17:47, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b> or <b>Userfy</b>. If what these anons are saying is true, then perhaps one them should create an account with Wikipedia (it's free) and work on the article in their user-space until it is acceptable. As it stands now the article is just advertising. It addresses the reader (ie. "We are located...", and it has an external link in its header). Besides that it has nonsense text (ie. "Stuff Entered here") and inaccuracies (ie. "club was formed before I joined long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"). --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 18:23, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</s></li>
</ul>
<p>Actually I do have an account with Wikipedia (mcelotto) I'm the person who is in charge of the website, and I gave the demo on who to use the wikipedia. The reason that we have the entries (ie. "Stuff Entered here") and inaccuracies (ie. "club was formed before I joined long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"), is because I was showing the users where to enter their information. I assure you that the information will be updated from what I have put. Actually if you look at the entry now, there is club history. I appoligize for the "(ie. "Stuff Entered here") and inaccuracies (ie. "club was formed before I joined long time ago in a galaxy far, far away")", but it was a way to show our membership how to enter information, because well the club did start before I joined. It has been corrected now, again I appoligize. Also the entry in the missage from Michael Celotto (me) I didn't sign into my Wikipedia account, and when I was giving the demo on the entering of information, I didn't even think to log in at the time. How do I edit the article in my userspace? I will also say that I did not know that we could not put our website's address in the header, I will change that. --mcelotto</p>

<li><b>Userfy</b> to mcelotto. He appears to really want this article on Wikipedia. If it is not notable enough for the main-space, certainly it is notable enough for his user-space. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 06:58, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am the president of the WPCUG and let me set the record straight. The posting of the page on your site is meant to document the history of our users group in Windsor that has been serving the area for more than 20 years now. The first posting was used as a learning tool to introduce members to wikipedia and show them how the site works, the content was a starting template. The night of the page was posted had the members were so involved browsing and viewing wikipedia and its contents that our time at the meeting ran out and the page could not be updated from it very simple template. The object was to have the members go home and at update the content. The posting of the deletion notice has stopped that process. I am asking that you get the club a chance to update the page and its content so it can be a valuable link to the clubs history. Let me also apologize for the way the fist page was left on your site. I assure you this is neither a vanity ad article nor a hoax. President of the WPCUG Larry Ruston pres@wpcug.com</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, and give the new users a little <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> and a little space for the joy of editing. This group has a <i>very</i> long history by measure of the history of personal computers, so there's your notability. Because it's near to me, and I was Vice President of a similar user's group in the same general area, I have knowledge of and can vouch that it has existed for more than 20 years. WPCUG members, this is when you should find some sources to cite to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> the data in the article. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 03:07, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>First I would like to thank everyone for the help that they have given us with our page. In regards to the <b>Westchester PC Users Group</b>, we at the Windsor PC Users Group would be more than happy to change the title of the Wiki as to not cause any arguments. Our page as it stands now does give history to the group. I do appoligize for the way that we left the page originally, I should have looked at the rules of the Wikipedia more closely, it was just poor preperation on my part...--Mcelotto 03:23, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
