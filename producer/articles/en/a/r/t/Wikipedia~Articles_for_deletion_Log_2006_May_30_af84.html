<p>Oh my, the wonders of the internets! We are not voting on a website, or webforum, instead we're voting on a specific forum thread! I've not even bothered to Prod this, as I know someone will inevitably remove it, maybe one of the "near legendary GDT Crew". I wonder who it would have been, maybe "Oreo- A real life black person."? I am quite possibly breaking the first rule of GDT which is to "Respect the GDT", and for that I apologise. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:02, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I also doubt they'd name this vessel 'before' naming the 130,000 tn ship.</p>
<p>An anon user removed my prodtag and added an article from <i>Florida Today</i>, which in my opinion says "its all speculation" The CEOs of Carnival and <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fincantieri.html" title="Fincantieri">Fincantieri</a> (Carnival's preferred shipbuilder) say that the "Pinnacle Project" (as dubbed by the paper) is at the discussion stage, with "nothing on the table". -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 00:19, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I tend to object to WP:NOR... because it means that only stuff that has been said by someone else can be said on wikipedia - defeating the whole purpose of the project which is that anyone can edit it. WP:NOR turns the project into a repository of things that the mainstream media has said, and one of the reasons i joined (b4 everyone was so fussed about NOR) wikipedia was to get away from the bias and POV of the mainstream media. I tend to think, along the same lines as the early wikipedians, that a large group of editors will produce a better article through collaboration, than a few people regurgitating what the media says. Anyway the articles good now with sources anyway. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETHE_KING_2419.html" title="User:THE KING">THE KING</a> 05:23, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Is this is a dicdef? The article only has two sentences, of which basically states that a roll number is (obviously) the number on a roll of film. <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> states that speedy deletion can apply to "very short articles providing little or no context... [and that] limited content is not in itself a reason to delete if there is enough context to allow expansion". There doesn't seem to be anything else that can be written to expand the article (what else is there, the history of numbers on a roll of film?), so it should qualify as a speedy delete.

<p>Ok, so why can't there be an article on bmxboard? This is an encyclopedia, right? Well, Merriam-Webster reads that "... an encyclopedia is: a work that contains information on all branches of knowledge or treats comprehensively a particular branch of knowledge usually in articles arranged alphabetically often by subject." Bmxboard is no different than the Romans. They were a particular group of people, and so is bmxboard. Bmxboard is a niche of <a href="../../../b/m/x/BMX_aa44.html" title="BMX">BMX</a> riders. I have to ask how bmxboard is different than having Star Trek on this website. Star Trek is definitely a niche. At least bmxboard is real, you can participate in it, you can meet people from it. I have driven to both Miami, Florida and Binghamon, NY, just to meet people that participate on bmxboard. And as far as not having an infinite amount of server space, hard drives are so cheap right now, along with bandwidth, do you really think that the agrument of servers is jusifiable, with this article currently taking up a mere 525 bytes of space (This discussion takes up more than that). Regardless of whether this article makes it or not, bmxboard is definitely a part of the bmx community' it has even been written about in nationly published magazines that anyone can pick up at even a local Wal*Mart (Ride BMX, Ride UK, Dig BMX, etc). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bmxky (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bmxky_846f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bmxky">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>The difference: Star Trek and Rome are known by billions of people, Bmxboard is known by a small, group of people. If we allow everyone to post their website on Wikipedia as long as the website is "real", regardless of notability, Wikipedia would be flooded with thousands of spam articles each day. Please remember the cost of <i>mantaining</i> wikipedia (not only including servers) is defaintly <b>not</b> cheap.

<li><b>Keep it</b>. If it was entitled "History of women's role in society" and rewritten a little it would surely qualify as an encyclopeadia entry. Ceretainly it needs cross references to sources but it seems to me to be reasonably "factually" (therefore neutrally) written as far as is possible about pre-history. This is a very important article which should be built upon not deleted. It would sit well within a series of articles on women in society ... women in Islam, women in a Christian society, Women's role in modern China etc ... possibly each could be considered to be from a POV but together they would form an important whole. If in doubt better to keep it surely? That's how I see it but then I am new to this.

<li>Which section? The only thing I can see that might be remotely relevant would be <i>"Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events"</i> and that only applies if (a) childbirth is a "newsworthy event" and (b) the newborn may be considered a "participant". <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:11, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's the part. We, unfortunately, don't get to choose what's newsworthy. Unfortunately, it's been widely determined that this is. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 21:58, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>To me, the most applicable section of WP:BIO is the alternative test of Expandability. As the world stands on May 30th, 2006, I don't see how this article could ever exist as more than a stub. A month from now, maybe the kid shoots <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Burns_ea5e.html" title="Mr. Burns">Mr. Burns</a> . . . who knows? <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 23:13, 30 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, if we want to use applicable alternatives, Shiloh certainly meets the Google test and verifiability standards, but they're in the "alternative test" reason becaue they lackwide support. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 00:16, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sure, I understand that there are other alternative criteria which are just as much not consensus as Expandability, but for this article, this one makes the most sense to me. Based on history, as it stands today, can this be a good article? My opinion is no. I'm open to being proven wrong though. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 00:26, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, if e're going to continue to look at WP:WEB, we need to start looking at what's generally accepted before what's alternately accepted. Generally, there's no question - Shiloh meets the basic standard as her birth is a newsworthy event, as pathetic as that is. If we want to move to alternatives, it certainly meets Google and verifiability, and there's plenty of legitimate speculation that it doesn't pass expandibility or 100 year test. Of course, one wonders if people would think the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lindbergh_baby.html" title="Lindbergh baby">Lindbergh baby</a> would be memorable either. so yeah. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 00:32, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, the sad state of the news . . . but that's another subject. But yes, this child's birth is certainly covered in the news, no question there. Despite that, I feel ok about advocating deletion on this one. WP:BIO is clear that "meeting one or more [criteria] does not mean that a subject must be included." I think that this is just such a case where that clause is relevant. I just don't see how a good article can come of this. This is why I'm citing Expandability here. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 00:48, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>her birth is a newsworthy event</i> Which shows how wrong Badlydrawnjeff is with his ridiculously overbroad criterion: the <b>child</b> is not the subject of the news stories, the <b>mother giving birth</b> is.

"There is also a proposal to build a Talmud Torah and an eruv in nearby Newmarket which, after extensive market research is believed to be a location which many Jews may be interested in moving to.</i>" (Also, I couldn't find any reference to HaMaayan on Lexis-Nexis UK)--<a href="../../../h/j/m/User%7EHJMG_daa3.html" title="User:HJMG">HJMG</a> 21:54, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would urge a little bit of caution before rushing to delete this page - there are two google references to the organisation as cited above (one from the cambridge evening news which is a proper newspaper)and I tried the links at the bottom of the page and they worked, one being to the website of the charity commission, which is a government site. It could be that someone has added a joke into the article at our expense (that's not exactly infrequent here!) but that doesnt mean we should get rid of the whole thing. If we did that there'd be no profile for George Bush, Tony Blair....

<p>I understand what you are saying but as far as I can see the organisation is real, as shown from the google search and the charity commission website. If it is small, it was nevertheless big enough for its trustee to be interviewed by the Cambridge Evening News as a representative of the Cambridge Jewish community so it can't be that small. In any event, wikipedia has hundreds of pages on individual churches, synagogues, temples or cults with only a few hundred members (i've certainly read quite a few here!). HJMG - would you not agree with me that we should maybe be concentrating on making the page better and not removing it based on current knowledge. look forward to hearing your thoughts - i am new round here so apologies if i have something wrong.

<dd>Having an article about an organization does not imply that Wikipedia "endorses" it as a "bona fide synagogue". Many organizations we have articles about are not affiliated to the Federation of Synagogues. What does count is that they are not notable. What is worse (as far as I can see) is that most of the information here is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>.

<p>Article concerns small scholarship program serving thirty students a year. Article is totally unsourced except for link to scholarship program itself and reads like a press release. Source of assertion that this is "widely recognized as one of the most innovative collegiate merit scholarships in the U.S." appears to be UNC press release <a href="http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/apr06/robertson041806.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/apr06/robertson041806.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. Subject is not notable, particularly when compared with other scholarships in this category serving thousands of students. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELastexit_0ce1.html" title="User:Lastexit">Lastexit</a> 14:02, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - While this does have a small number of students, and I agree we could get thousands of similar articles, is there any consensus about how large a scholarship needs to be to get an article? (Certainly I think that independent articles for every elementary school in America is insane, but that's how consensus fell) <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:55, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as per my nom. Article has been revised since nomination to remove the unsubstantiated puffery, which only underlines the notability issue. UNC-Chapel has <i>16,700</i> undergrads, which makes size of program even less consequential. Despite revision, article remains essentially a glorified press release, written from information provided by the scholarship, contrary to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELastexit_0ce1.html" title="User:Lastexit">Lastexit</a> 19:04, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> – although it did read like a press release (as noted above), the article is fixed now. IMHO the subject is notable enough; it <i>is</i> a link between two colleges that are traditionally rivals, and it seems to be fairly prestigious. (Full disclosure: I wrote the first version of this article, though I don't have any ties to the scholarship, the benefactors, or the colleges.) --<a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdesham_60a4.html" title="User:Bdesham">bdesham</a>&#160;<a href="../../../b/d/e/User_talk%7EBdesham_1dd0.html" title="User talk:Bdesham"><font color="#007F00">★</font></a> 20:23, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Article isn't a press release any more. I added a very little bit more. I found independent, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> for the existence and basic terms of the program. I also found a couple undergraduate level research papers acknowledging the program as the funding for it. But I didn't find enough to make me sure the article should be kept. I also think that <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a>'s comment above is cogent - is there any consensus on scholarships? <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 00:28, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is the first time I've ever been accused of being an abusive Catholic. (Hint: I'm Southern Baptist and, more importantly, a born again Christian.)

The problems are threefold: (1) if you go to <a href="http://www.google.com" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com</a> and type in "Sankta Lusse", you get nothing whatsoever. (2) There is already an article called <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Lucia_Day_bc6a.html" title="St. Lucia Day">St. Lucia Day</a> that discusses the holiday in Sweeden. This topic belongs in that article, not a new article. (3) The article is very difficult to understand.

<li>Your threefold problems: Sankta Lusse exists,is no Catholic Saint,and last but no least it appears in Google. 1)Reads again my former letter. And learn to uses google. 2)Saint Lucy Day is a day devoted to a catholic saint. It hadn`t any relatuion to Sankata Lusse. Give me more time to write proofs,sources,it. By the way I works in a corporation,I`m no a lazy teenager writing articles in favor from pornography and catholicism as you. 3)Is very difficult to understand,because it is for inteligent people only?.

<li>What are you talking about? The impetus is on the person adding content to the Wikipedia to prove its <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, not the other way around. You've done nothing to prove that it's verifiable, and have done little more than accuse people here of being biased/lazy/pornography-loving Catholics. It's only <i>slightly</i> amusing. And no, Google does not find anything on "Sankta lusse". It does find the two words seperated, but that's fairly useless. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 22:31, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>The Heinen's stub is not intended to advertise the store whatsoever. It is merely providing information on a local community-based grocery store. Perhaps it could be placed within a larger group of articles that discusses community-based grocery stores and their importance in modern suburban areas. Notability need not be a concept of national concern. Grocery stores small and large contribute to the growth of cities alike. They equally bring about the ideas of economy, consumerism, and small business.</p>
<p>Heinen's is comparable to many other grocery stores such as Giant Eagle, and it can furthermore be identified as a competing force against these stores. It should not be considered non-notable simply because it is a local chain in its infancy.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Companies like this are precisely why <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is in place. Wikipedia is not the Yellow Pages. The intent is to only document companies that are newsworthy and notable.

<p>Though the chain is small, upon further research I have discovered that it passes 2 out of 3 of the criteria required to be considered notable listed in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. A company known as Wyse Advertising has decided to work for Heinen's and to conduct research for the business. <a href="http://www.wyseadv.com/news/news_link8.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.wyseadv.com/news/news_link8.asp" rel="nofollow">Wyse Advertising</a>. Moreover, as I stated before, Heinen's is listed as a top 100 private Ohio business (it was ranked 51 in 2004) and continues to grow in size and volume. Please consider that Heinen's, although not newsworthy, is indeed notable and competes with many large businesses within its operating area, including <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_Eagle_dbff.html" title="Giant Eagle">Giant Eagle</a> and Tops to name a few. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluebul1989_7d7d.html" title="User:Bluebul1989">Bluebul1989</a> 03:59, 31 May 2006 (UTC)bluebul1989</p>

<p>"An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia... Lack of fame is not the same as vanity."

<p>As I said before, I am not trying to advertise the store. Yes, I am from Ohio and I in fact live near a Heinen's. Yet I have no bias towards Heinen's and consider it as one of many grocery stores in the Ohio region (these other businesses being recognized in Wikipedia). I feel the chain is an important and influential business in Ohio, and should additionally be recognized as a business competitor. I do not work for Wyse Advertising as I am a 16-year-old junior in highschool. Please consider everything that I have discussed in my posts above. If you still do not believe that Heinen's should be submitted as an entry in Wikipedia, at the very least perhaps it could be grouped with other small, less nationally known businesses (or regional businesses), in a "small and notable businesses" article. This would give an opportunity to many smaller businesses that are important but are left in the dust only because they are not nationally recognized. It would also expand Wikipedia without giving too much attention to each individual business. I know that Wikipedia is not the Yellow Pages and I agree that not any ordinary or local business deserves a place in an enyclopedia. My only intent is to enter Heinen's as a rather notable and competitive supermarket chain in Ohio, and to eventually bring light to other small and growing businesses in the United States that deserve to be known and recognized as important parts of the economy. <b>-Author of Heinen's Article</b> <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluebul1989_7d7d.html" title="User:Bluebul1989">Bluebul1989</a> 20:07, 31 May 2006 (UTC)bluebul1989</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think if a business has 2200 employees and is a chain it should be kept. I Think the idea behind WP:CORP is to keep the random hot-dog stands off of WP... not the company who owns 400. Seems to pass WP:CORP in any case. No need to automatically assume bad faith... this is the author of the article.

<p><b>IMPORTANT</b> Heinen's is located on the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarkets_in_the_United_States_8277.html" title="Supermarkets in the United States">Supermarkets in the United States</a> page under the "Smaller Chains" section. It was already on this page before I even created the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinen%27s.html" title="Heinen's">Heinen's</a> article, signifying that the creator intended to eventually link this to a Wikipedia article specifically about Heinen's. Having a spot on this page, it is obviously a notable small business, and the Heinen's stub should therefore be permitted. View the page here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarkets_in_the_United_States" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarkets_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. I would also like to note the permittance of other smaller, regional chains in this section that are comparable to Heinen's. Many of these chains are as small as Heinen's. Here are some examples: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodman%27s_Food_Market" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodman%27s_Food_Market" rel="nofollow">Woodman's Food Market</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westborn_Market" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westborn_Market" rel="nofollow">Westborn Market</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrop%27s_Super_Market" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrop%27s_Super_Market" rel="nofollow">Ukrop's Super Market</a>. There are many chains that are smaller and have a lower sales volume than Heinen's that are located on the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarkets_in_the_United_States_8277.html" title="Supermarkets in the United States">Supermarkets in the United States</a> page and that have been granted Wikipedia pages. I find it absolutely ridiculous that there is an obvious inconsistency and discrepancy in Wikipedia policy and ruling that I got trapped in the middle of. My article was not judged in the same manner that these other articles were and was immediately proposed for deletion without any consideration. The fact that I had to fight so hard to support something that should not have been debated in the first place is even more upsetting. I urge that this issue be settled immediately and that all "smaller chains" located in the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarkets_in_the_United_States_8277.html" title="Supermarkets in the United States">Supermarkets in the United States</a> article be granted a Wikipedia page, as they are certainly important grocery chains. I hope that all future additions of smaller, notable businesses are overlooked with a fairness and consistency that is expected from Wikipedia. A business does not have to be a large, nationally recognized chain, to be considered notable. -Author of Heinen's stub <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluebul1989_7d7d.html" title="User:Bluebul1989">Bluebul1989</a> 03:05, 1 June 2006 (UTC)bluebul1989</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I was the orginal prodder on this and think it does little to nothing to assert any notability. Individual chapters of fraternities don't get covered unless they're notable. Things like alumni gets mentioned in the national organization's article if one exists. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 00:02, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> Do not delete. The chapter has figured into the lives of several significant individuals, not the least of which are Sam Walton, Edgar Snow, and Kenneth Lay. To cultivate an understanding about these figures I think their college experience is worth noting. I must concede the article is at points vain, but it shall be edited to meet wikipedia standards. This particular chapter started out as a literary society and became affiliated with a fraternity years after its inception. I must respectfully challenge the idea that a fraternity's alumni do not lend notability. There are entries on prep schools in wikipedia that have far less significance. Perhaps the entry falls short in conveying how unique the chapter is. If so, it's worth mentioning the million dollar study facilities in-house and the chapter's four Rhode Scholars. Have you run across fraternities that can make similar boasts? This is no animal house. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.143.204.40 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.143.204.40_0d3b.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.143.204.40">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Either <b>keep</b>, <b>delete as copyvio</b> or <b>userfy</b> to wait for author to work on it. (Yeah, I can say that, this is not a vote...) The important thing is that I think this does assert notability. Having been around for 135 years is pretty good for a student society in Missouri, I think. It would be a respectable age even in Europe. I hope the author can work on improving the tone of this and adding some better references than that website from which the text was taken. I am assuming there is a permission to use that text here.

<li>That's part of the sticky wicket with this article. The original editor claims that it is not copyright violation since he is a member of the fraternity and on behalf of the chapter controls the original text and licenses it GFDL by placing it here. However, that makes it a vanity article—or at best original research—since the original editor merely repeated comments made at their university web page. Hence, even if we clear the notability hurdle, we still have verifiability to deal with. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 22:03, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>keep</b> Why not leave the article? Almost every article about a person on wikipedia is a "vanity" article. Most are positive anyway. It is still interesting and I ended up reading it after reading that Ken Lay was a Beta at Missouri from a bio I read on the web. I think it is amazing that the Betas at Mizzou have had men like Sam Walton and Ken Lay (even though he was convicted and that takes the luster away from the association) as members. Shoot, most articles about cities, colleges, etc are postive and sya good things about the places. What else are they going to say? "Smith, Montana...the crappiest little town in the world where all the women are ugly and all the children are stupid." No, they are going to be positive.

<li><b>Keep</b>, and <b>do not merge</b>. Agree that its not worth having an entry for every fraternity chapter, however, judging by the alumni and (relatively) long history this association appears to be anything but pedestrian. To merge this chapter into the main Beta Theta Pi article would wash away the significance of the local history, which appears to be considerable. Would you merge the Yankees into an article on major league baseball if there was something interesting to tell about the franchise? Of course not. So it is with this chapter. I'm guessing it was the prominence of the Zeta Phi chapter that drew those individuals to become members, not the main fraternity of Beta Theta Pi. Seems like the standard for notability has been met. Keep the article if it will be further cleaned up to meet wikipedia standards. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.143.64.241 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.143.64.241_0ce8.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.143.64.241">contribs</a>).</small> <small>User's two contributions are on this discussion.</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Hard to see why there is still debate about notabilty. If there is concern that other fraternity chapters will want their own wikipedia pages, make them meet this high standard. If they have a 135 year history and alumni on the level of Sam Walton and Ken Lay, let their pages stay too. There seems to be some bizarre agenda against fraternities in some if these evaluations.

<li><b>Oppose deletion</b>. Certainly seems like a valid topic. Accuracy disputes are not normally grounds for deletion, which would render the article's extensive edit history invisible. The talk page editors need to <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bolder</a> in editing out inaccuracies and substituting more valid content. I have no grounds to pass judgment on the accuracy of what's there now. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:05, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Salvageable, but massive editing required</b> -- This article has some useful information and much information that is patently incorrect. Chilean Spanish is not so different as the article contends. What the author calls Chilean Spanish should instead be called Chilean colloquialisms, or "modismos" in Spanish. I've spent considerable time in central and southern Chile (though not northern), and my wife is Chilean. I have not encountered the second-person plural in Chile, except in the case of "Como estás?" In southern Chile, you will sometimes hear "Como estai?" (notice no 's'). The vocabulary section could be retained, and the page could be renamed <b>Chilean Idioms</b> or something similar. <a href="../../../g/r/h/User%7EGrharshman_2eeb.html" title="User:Grharshman">Glenn R.

<li><b>Keep</b> the form "vo" is used throughout Chile (informally), not just in the South. In "symmetric" conversations between people of all ages, but especially youth, this form is used, most of all the phrase "Como estai?" Though this difference is not literary (as is the Argentine "vos" form, see Rayuela by Cortazar for one example) it is nonetheless real and should definitely be noted. I have lived in Chile for nearly a year and traveled to north, central, south. (<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_chile_ae53.html" title="User:Sean chile">Sean</a> 18:33, 31 May 2006 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - The current article is not very encyclopedic. This topic is important and interesting, but it deserves a better article. (<i>from the scratch</i> better). <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBaloo_rch_c8ac.html" title="User:Baloo rch">baloo_rch</a> 15:35, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> - The article is very messy and unencyclopaedic but those are not valid reasons to delete. Chilean Spanish does differ from forms of Spanish spoken in other countries so this is a legitimate article (just wrong on many points). Needs major overhaul, not deletion.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">WilliamThweatt</a> 15:57, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Start from Scratch</b> - Starting from scratch won't be so hard. People from chile use this kind of speak in their everyday lives, so they don't need to research too extensively. Explanations for the origins of MANY chilean terms can be found (probably part-hidden) in the webpage of the chilean newspaper La Cuarta <a href="http://www.lacuarta.cl" class="external free" title="http://www.lacuarta.cl" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacuarta.cl</a>, because it has a section about chilean speak ("la ficha pop") and is published daily since years ago. I'm sorry I don't have time or motivation to do it myself. My opinion is that it's just a moderately distorted spanish with many colloquialisms. -- ANONYMOUS CHILEAN</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Seems to be an informative article. I don't see any reason why this subject shouldn't be covered by WP. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocument_d5bf.html" title="User:Document">Document</a> 23:00, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I appreciate the opportunity to address this issue. The term "Vanity" seems very innapropriate, in that the motivation for posting the Maximum Cultural Development (MCD) article is rooted in an appreciation for mankinds ability to adapt to his/her environment.</p>
<p><b>Premises:</b> All things enduring move through (4) progressive phases... These four (4) phases are: development, establishment, maintenance, and refinement...</p>
<p>Almost everything we see around us is at different stages in this process. Understanding this basic, universal concept empowers the knower with the ability to successfully architect positive change. This process also includes ourselves as people. What phase are we oriented towards as individuals, and/or as a group of people? What phase does your personal every day life reflect?</p>
<p>Though we as individuals come and go, we have the blessed opportunity of leaving behind us things that endure for those to come after us, our children... For our young ones to survive and thrive with dignity, it is up to each and every one of us to contribute in some way to the heritage, legacy, and culture that will be looked upon by those of us to come.</p>
<p><b>The concept of Culture, when fully understood is a very powerful one...</b> It should be noted that even an elaborate inventory of the parts and traits of a culture cannot adequately characterize it. Cultures have organization as well as content. Emphasis on some features as opposed others and the total interrelation of the isolable parts has much to do with the distinctive properties of a culture, in addition to the way they work together as a system. Many definitions have been submitted by scholars from many countries, from all fields of social and biological science and the humanities and in aggregate form the foundational basis for this article. Those herein are contemporary since this is the focus of the topic.</p>
<p>Culture: is the complex system of meaning and behavior that defines the way of life for a given group or society. It includes beliefs, values, knowledge, art, morals, laws, habits, language, and dress. Culture includes ways of thinking as well as patterns of behavior. Observing culture involves studying what people think, how they interact, and the objects they make and use.</p>
<p>The second emphasizes culture as a comprehensive totality and enumerates aspects of culture content. Franz Boas: “Culture embraces all the manifestations of social habits of a community, the reactions of the individual as affected by the habits of the group in which he/she lives, and the products of human activities as determined by these habits.” The third is built on the feature of social inheritance. Ralph Linton: “As a general term, culture means the total social heredity of man-kind, while as a specific term, a culture means a particular strain of social heredity.”</p>
<p>The fourth emphasizes culture as a way of life, a design for living. Paul Sears: “The way in which the people in any group do things, make and use tools, get along with one another and with other groups, the words they use and the way they use them to express thoughts, and the thoughts they think...”</p>
<p>The fifth is psychological in the sense that processes such as adjustment, learning, and habit are single out. Culture as a problem-solving device is stressed. Ralph Piddington: “The culture of a people may be defined as the sum total of the material and intellectual equipment whereby they satisfy their biological and social needs and adapt themselves to their environment.”</p>
<p>The sixth identifies as central the patterning or organization of culture, and its systemic quality. John Gillin: “Culture consists of patterned and functionally interrelated customs common to specifiable human beings composing specifiable social groups or categories.” The seventh and final definition used here focuses on culture as an accumulated product of group life. Kimball Young: “A precipitate of man’s social life.”</p>
<p>Wikipedia itself comfortably falls within the MCD framework with a stated mission of providing free and open access to knowledge resources (assets) for all... Its also reflects adherence to the above stated four phase process.</p>
<p>Wikipedia strays from the process, however, through its rampant merging of vaild, free-standing, concepts (articles) which represent Reusable Learning Assets (RLAs). A classic manifestation of european hegemony...</p>
<p>Maximum Cultural Development warrants that: "We must be producers of culture, not passive consumers of it. Cultural development must be intentional and proactive, focused on clear and valid goals with a concrete vision of how to attain them. We are inundated by language, symbols, ideas, and technology, none of which is neutral. We must therefore define where we stand with regard to them and adopt appropriate intellectual and behavioral responses, if we are to be champions and not victims."</p>
<p>May we all be blessed with deeper understanding. Thank you for allowing me to share... <i>Marcus William Tremble</i>--<a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodestream_d3cb.html" title="User:Codestream">Codestream</a> 10:17, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I came across this article a few weeks ago and thought it might be an AfD, but there's too much substantiaton. The references section of the article has sufficient press mentions and there are also shows in public buildings. As the magazine articles have been scanned for her site <a href="http://www.veroart.com/_html/zoomify.html?width=864&amp;height=618&amp;name=publicity/Lifestyle1" class="external text" title="http://www.veroart.com/_html/zoomify.html?width=864&amp;height=618&amp;name=publicity/Lifestyle1" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.coastalbendhomes.com/stories/s_homes/2004/0328/southwest.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.coastalbendhomes.com/stories/s_homes/2004/0328/southwest.cfm" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.veroart.com/_html/zoomify.html?width=864&amp;height=618&amp;name=publicity/Visual2" class="external text" title="http://www.veroart.com/_html/zoomify.html?width=864&amp;height=618&amp;name=publicity/Visual2" rel="nofollow">here</a>, there's no reason to doubt the genuineness of the "Newspapers in Mexico" section (NB all 1986–89). The shows are also supported by photos. There's a large show of work <a href="http://www.veroart.com/_html/Pictures/Airport/pictures.html" class="external text" title="http://www.veroart.com/_html/Pictures/Airport/pictures.html" rel="nofollow">"Gallery of the Benito Juarez International Airport in Mexico City, Mexico"</a>. There's one <a href="http://www.veroart.com/_html/Pictures/ModernArtMuseum/pictures.html" class="external text" title="http://www.veroart.com/_html/Pictures/ModernArtMuseum/pictures.html" rel="nofollow">"Museo de Arte Moderno, México"</a>, where you can see her name displayed outside the building. There's an official opening <a href="http://www.veroart.com/_html/Pictures/ABC/pictures.html" class="external text" title="http://www.veroart.com/_html/Pictures/ABC/pictures.html" rel="nofollow">"ABC (American British Cowdray) Hospital, México"</a>. It's undoubtedly not a hoax and the evidence shows she's not an "unknown amateur" artist. However, most of the activity is mid 1980s – mid 1990s and the mentions in print form, both of which would explain the current lack of web hits. The links in the article need pruning certainly. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 19:04, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>On the other side, a few exhibitions in mostly small, privately owned galleries + some mentions in life-style magazines (written perhaps by people without art education) + one mural painting given to a hospital (the celebrities were of course present not because of the mural, not because of the painter, but because of the inauguration of the hospital) + one or two artefacts presented as a part of collective exhibitions in serious galleries - this does not constitute notability in the world of artists. Now she seems to be completely forgotten outside of Wikipedia, in the phase of life, when most artists are at the heights of their activity. In <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, the criteria for inclusion are much more strict: "Painters ... whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field."--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 19:51, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So you agree she's not a "hoax or an unknown amateur artist", which was why you made the AfD in the first place. Now it's a matter of judgement as to how notable or otherwise. Obviously not top rank, but probably has as much presence in the art world as, for example, many bands do in the music world for whom articles are retained. She has had shows in private and public spaces, and she has been covered in the press including the New York Times (Shown, John; “Veronica Put Theater on Canvas”, <i>New York Times</i>, October, 1986). Check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Ruiz_de_Velasco#Newspapers" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Ruiz_de_Velasco#Newspapers" rel="nofollow">Newspapers section of the article</a>. This seems to me to be sufficient verifiable coverage in the public domain to merit retaining this article. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 21:17, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I still think that it is both: A <i>hoax</i> because it depicts her as an important artist (which is clearly not the case); and perhaps an <i>amateur</i> artist who was a member of the Mexican high society 15 years ago but earned few critical acclaim and is forgotten today. - The nawspapers cited in the article are not independent critical studes but just normal newspapers. Wikipedia should reflect importance of its subjects, not generate it.--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 21:32, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>She had a solo show at the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museo_de_Arte_Moderno_d34e.html" title="Museo de Arte Moderno">Museo de Arte Moderno</a>, Mexico City. This is the Mexican national museum with "the best permanent exhibition of painters and sculptors from the modern Mexican art movement. It also features some of the most important temporary exhibitions of national and international modern art in the world."<a href="http://www.frommers.com/destinations/mexicocity/A24317.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.frommers.com/destinations/mexicocity/A24317.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> — hardly a "small, privately owned gallery" The article makes no claim of any "importance" specifically. It just states the facts of where she has had exhibitions and where she has been mentioned in print. A "hoax" is when something is fictitious, which this is clearly not. An "amateur" artist is not someone who has a solo show in a national museum or who exhibits in professional (i.e. by definition "private") galleries. Normal newspapers, as you put it, are acceptable sources to verify the notability of a person. It is not our job to evaluate whether she is a good, bad or indifferent artist quality-wise. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 21:49, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wrote much of this article based on her information on her website. The article has a neutral view and based on facts presented from several articles/photographs from her official website. Tyrenius has been really helpful in making sure this article is wikipedia formatted correctly and factful. With Veronica being in the National Museum of Mexico in 1986 and her teacher was Rufino Tamayo (one of the most famous painters of Mexico) and Jean Dubuffet, one cannot simply forget Ms. Ruiz de Velasco. Also, the Director of Mexico Art has confirmed this in a letter. Check out <a href="http://www.veroart.com/_html/zoomify.html?width=864&amp;height=618&amp;name=publicity/NBAGerardoEstrada" class="external text" title="http://www.veroart.com/_html/zoomify.html?width=864&amp;height=618&amp;name=publicity/NBAGerardoEstrada" rel="nofollow">Letter from Bellas Artes Director</a> and <a href="http://www.veroart.com/_html/zoomify.html?width=864&amp;height=618&amp;name=publicity/MuseoDeArteModerno" class="external text" title="http://www.veroart.com/_html/zoomify.html?width=864&amp;height=618&amp;name=publicity/MuseoDeArteModerno" rel="nofollow">Director of the Modern Art Museum</a> In terms of importance, I concluded from her website that if the owner of two professional hockey team has bought her art for a substantial price, then she might be notable. Also, in the 80's she had a show at the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico. In the late 90's she had a show at the Irving Art Center. <a href="http://www.ci.irving.tx.us/arts/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ci.irving.tx.us/arts/" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> The Irving Art Center is a Museum for Contemporary Artist. This was also a solo exhibition and cannot be forgotten. Also, she was chosen by the Dallas Museum of Art for art charity. This is also a notable National institution. They do not ask anyone for art charity. I am all for deleted this if someone could simply remove the fact that Veronica has been in several National Museums. Also her teachers were Rufino Tamayo and Jean Dubuffet, and she has sold paintings at a notable price. Also, in terms of her mural at the ABC Hospital. It seems that the ABC Hospital in Mexico City is a world class private hospital built in 1954. Therefore, Prince Charles and the US Ambassador did not show up to this hospital to inaugurate the hospital, but most likely to inaugurate her mural. There are pictures on her website. Please check out this website <a href="http://www3.abchospital.com/domino/abchospital/WebPageABC.nsf/VwAuxContPub/H991?OpenDocument" class="external autonumber" title="http://www3.abchospital.com/domino/abchospital/WebPageABC.nsf/VwAuxContPub/H991?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> for more information on the hospital. Also, she completed a mural for the Hamon Building at Southwest Medical Center which is a world renowned facility. Nancy Hamon is a very notable individual. It would seem that if Mrs. Hamon had issues with the notability of Veronica, why did she ask her to create a mural for her building? <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nancy+Hamon" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nancy+Hamon" rel="nofollow">[36]</a><a href="http://www.cpmc.org/giving/philanthropy/about/nancy.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cpmc.org/giving/philanthropy/about/nancy.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> Kmowery11:57, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kmowery isn't the only source. Kmowery is the only author (of the article). There are plenty of sources given, and backed up by scans/photos if you follow the links in my first statement above. Her name is prominently shown in <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Museo_de_Arte_Moderno_Front_Sign_RDV.jpg" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Museo_de_Arte_Moderno_Front_Sign_RDV.jpg" rel="nofollow">a photo of the Museo de Arte Moderno</a> for example. The (external) links are reliable—they all link to what they state and are relevant to items mentioned in the text e.g. a particular museum. I think what you mean is that they don't necessarily show an artist mention at that museum, so they don't all need to be there. I have transformed some into a "see also" section. Re. "advertising", there is an explanation on <a href="../../../k/m/o/User_talk%7EKmowery_2402.html" title="User talk:Kmowery">User talk:Kmowery</a>: <i>Veronica Ruiz de Velasco was my first article.

<dd>Vortex, take it easy. For starters, you are wrong about Wikipedia being a place to get known. This site's traffic isn't as good as MySpace. If you get a MySpace account in the "film" section I guarantee you about 200 hits a day and you get to add embeded video. It's the best promotion you could get besides getting to interact with other filmmakers than can help you in the future. This wikipedia BS gets only a quarter of the traffic you could achieve in MySpace. So don't sweat it.BrandNew21 03:30, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b>: If i'm not mistaken. Isn't wikipedia the effort to sum all human knowledge? This guy is making films, he exists, he is human. Ok. So then why are we denying him the right to exist in wikipedia? because the wiki users are all so afraid that the guy could make a buck if people get to find him here and read about it?. People, wake up, you know what wikipedia is? wikipedia is what wikipedia is not. Exactly. Why you deny this guy the right to make an article about his production company? because its not important enough yet? wait a second, who has the authority to say this guy isn't important yet? If someone gets to see this guy's films and then wants to know a little bit more about him then they MIGHT turn to wikipedia and look for him.... but oh no... they won't because you guys THINK that you have the authority to get rid of him. Wikipedia IS NOT a reliable source of information because of people like YOU. So stop trying to make it one, this is just a site to let people give definitions to things in the world, not to qualify you and him and them according if they are important enough.

<p>Please read this carefully. At first glance, this <i>seems</i> valid, but I assure you the topic matter of furries and furry fans is not my motivation for this nomination. I have a few, please react to these arguments in your votes:</p>
<p>1.Unverifiable-- (Wikipedia policy requires all articles be verifiable) Furries are very verifiable and notable, and they have their own description at several wikipedia pages, such as <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">Furry fandom</a> and others. I argue that any information on the term furry lifestyler is unverifiable: Zero hits on LexisNexis and Google News (news search engines with archives of two years) for "furry lifestyler" Zero hits on Jstor search</p>
<dl>
<dd>Now, there is a cited "source" that I could go into the rules about using self published articles, but it turns out I don't need to, because this essay on furry fandom does not use the term "furry lifestyle" or "furry lifestyler" once. How can it be a source for an article on the term if it doesn't use the term once?</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have called for and argued for verifiable sources on this page since this January.</p>
<p>2.Original Research- (Wikipedia policy requires that pages not be original research) No original research states "the only way to demonstrate that you are not doing original research is to cite reliable sources which provide information that is directly related to the topic of the article, and to adhere to what those sources say." Since are no sources, I don't think I need to argue this point too much. There is the self published essay, but it isn't "adhered to" since it's info is used to define a term it doesn't ever use, "furry lifestyler" or even "lifestyle." Use of published primary sources is okay, use of unpublished primary sources, forums or newsgroups before a reputable news agency has made light of them, is against policy. People who call themselves furry lifestylers have edited this page, however"policy prohibits expert editors from drawing on their personal and direct knowledge if such knowledge is unverifiable." And I believe I have established that this article is unverifiable.</p>
<p>3.Non-notable(which I know is a suggestion, not a policy for deletion)-- 366 hits on google for "furry lifestyler" in quotes. This page is, on close inspection, an attempt to describe and define posters to the furry lifestyler newsgroup. People on the talk page have described it as a sort of "everything else" newsgroup where furry fans did not discuss furry art, but other things. I can only speculate, since I have found no documentation or reliable definition of furry lifestylers. Whether or not it is a clearly defined term in real life that could have a coherent and true article written about it is questionable, but somewhat irrelevant since I believe I have proven such an article would be in violation of wikipedia policy on several points.Articles such as this are welcome at places like wikiinfo, but are put here because of the trust and popularity of wikipedia, which is of course based in the policies that are against this article. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 15:42, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>From a glance at <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">Furry fandom</a> (which in itself is a completely justifiable article), it seems to me that there are too many separate and disparate furry-related articles as it is. I don't think furries are a wide enough phenomenon (outside of a very particular subculture) to justify so many articles. This article seems to tell us little that the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">Furry fandom</a> article doesn't, with the added point that the phrase "furry lifestyler" itself doesn't, based on a Google search, appear to be in particularly popular use (and according to the article it's just a synonym for the far simpler, far more widely-used "furry"). Ergo, I can't see a reason for this particular article to exist, and would suggest <b>merging</b> any original and useful content (if there is any) into <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">Furry fandom</a>. I wouldn't even suggest a redirect, though, since the phrase just doesn't seem common enough. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 16:14, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Policy says it's the right way to go. If you don't like wikipedia policies you don't have to contribute here. "Text that does not conform to all four policies is not allowed in the main namespace" and one of those policies is verifiability. Also, your chronology is off, a page should not be created and wait until it has been in a published source that can back up that content. That's after the fact justified original research. Another "not" entry, wikipedia is not a crystal ball. We are not meant to put up what we do not know is verifiable because we think some newspaper will back up our content or should, at some point in the future.

<li><b>Keep</b> - valid subset of furry fandom, and merging might start a lengthy discussion that could get messy. Fact is, "furry" gets lumped together so badly by major media that it's not surprising there are no distinct references to furry lifestyle. Here's some other links: <a href="http://www.humantruth.info/furry.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.humantruth.info/furry.html" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> as an alternate source of information that does use 'furry lifestyle'. <a href="http://fursuit.timduru.org/dirlist/InTheNews/ClevelandChannel5_20010506.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://fursuit.timduru.org/dirlist/InTheNews/ClevelandChannel5_20010506.html" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> refers to the 'furry' lifestyle in the title.

<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a>, or even <b>keep</b>. (Disclaimer: I probably fit to the vague description of a "furry lifestyler", but since it's impossible to prove conclusively that I exist, please try to avoid the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontology.html" title="Ontology">ontological quandry</a>.) Let's shoot this interesting deletion motion down, shall we? 1) Unverifiability: The nom's argument hinges on news media's mentions. Contrary to that, there's actually people calling themselves "furry lifestylers". Yet, you don't hear the <i>news</i> organisations calling them that. It's almost like if <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_M._Stallman_5369.html" title="Richard M. Stallman">RMS</a> said something in public and the news media said "Yesterday, a famous <i>open source evangelist</i> opened his mouth again. There were no survivors." (emphasis mine.) I'd contest this is a highly "technical" term that the news media is simply not interested about. Look for "furry fans who believe they have some connection to the animals" and you may be start finding something.<br />
2) OR/Sources: I admit full well this is on much shakier ground. The article <i>does</i> cite the origin of the term (namely, discussions in Usenet) and the existence of an actual Usenet discussion group alt.lifestyle.furry. If you dig through the Google Groups archives, you'll probably found wealth of information on the particular culture - when I followed the group, they had FAQs posted periodically (<a href="http://www.tigerden.com/infopage/furry/lifestyle.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.tigerden.com/infopage/furry/lifestyle.txt" rel="nofollow">actual copy of the FAQ</a>), and had frequent user surveys. Some actual research to this phenomenon or media mentions would be extremely sweet, <i>that</i> I agree. But I'd like to say what verifiability policy said last I checked: Extraordinary claims need extraordinary proof. We don't need extraordinary proof to establish the <i>existence</i> and even <i>extent</i> of furry lifestylers. <i>Details</i> may be a bit more different.<br />
3) Notability: I really wonder if Google is broken with these searches, I remember the lifestyler activity being fairly active =) I concur this may be a little bit of a fringey stuff to be mentioned in an article of its own, but it <i>is</i> a notable phenomenon <i>within</i> furry fandom. Thus, I'd be cool to have a merge at least; and hey, there's always WikiFur for this kind of stuff. =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 18:57, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Lack of Google News or LexisNexis articles does not mean a lack of significance, and I think the argument for deletion is artificially downplaying the significance. Wikipedia's benchmark for significance is Google, not Google News. A Google search on "furry lifestyler" brings up "about 8,390" hits (369 for exact phrase), and "furry lifestyle" has "about 619,000" (604 for exact phrase). So much for notability. Among them I have found citations that can be incorporated into the article (and I'll do so when I get the chance), such as <a href="http://fursuit.timduru.org/dirlist/InTheNews/ClevelandChannel5_20010506.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://fursuit.timduru.org/dirlist/InTheNews/ClevelandChannel5_20010506.html" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> and <a href="http://fursuit.timduru.org/dirlist/InTheNews/Tennessean/47865895.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://fursuit.timduru.org/dirlist/InTheNews/Tennessean/47865895.shtml" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> (which explains the difference between furry lifestylers and furry fandom). It appears to me that there's not so much a lack of citations as that no one got around to finding them or has been motivated to. You're not going to find them merely in Google News because it doesn't keep articles around indefinitely. You shouldn't base deletion proposals on looking only where the light is better. <a href="../../../t/y/c/Image%7ETycon.jpg_e3bd.html" class="image" title="Image:Tycon.jpg"><img src="../../../upload/c/c1/Tycon.jpg" alt="Image:Tycon.jpg" width="25" height="21" longdesc="../../../t/y/c/Image%7ETycon.jpg_e3bd.html" /></a><b><a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoyoty_72ae.html" title="User:Coyoty">Coyoty</a></b> 19:39, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Self published articles do not qualify as sources. Moreover, some of the links that y'all provided don't use the term furry lifestyler. The reason why furry lifestyle without quotes gets so many hits is because every day of the week a lifestyle column in a paper prints a story about "our furry friends the squirrels" or similar. Calling furry fandom a lifestyle is not evidence for the usage of the neologism "furry lifestyler".

<dd>A Cleveland television news channel report is self-published? A Tennessee newspaper article is self-published? That's what those links are to, <b>mainstream news articles</b>. Either you didn't bother to read their provenance, or you are lying about accepting good citations. "The Tennessean" specifically uses the term "lifestyler", but you are trying to claim the articles don't say anything about them. "There is a distinction, they say, between the people who enjoy the costuming aspects of the culture and <i>lifestylers,</i> who incorporate their animals into their lives in a more spiritual way." I don't know how much clearer that can be. Or the Cleveland News 5 article title, "Group Celebrates 'Furry' Lifestyle". You are setting extraordinary criteria in order to dismiss the citations you asked for and probably did not expect to get. Despite your gymnastic denial that it's the furry lifestyle itself you're challenging, your resistance indicates otherwise. "The more he talked of his honor, the faster we counted our spoons."

<dd>So you feel that any source that does not use the word "furry lifestyler" directly next to one another, despite that last one in the Tennessean referring to "lifestyler" in the context of discussing "furry," as well as other similar references, is unqualified to be considered in this discussion? My apologies, but you're doing a very fine job of splitting hairs here. Editors have presented a large number of new references, including to mass media outlets, that quite obviously refer to the furry lifestyle. I'm certain the administrator who looks over this discussion when time comes to close it will consider those favourably. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> 00:01, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article nominated for deletion is not furry as a lifestyle choice(as is the article you mention), but the neologism "furry lifestyler" and some spurious definitions and qualifications on it. The article does not, as you say, refer to "lifestyler" but lifestyles. An article on womens' lifestyles would not justify a wikipedia entry on the term "Woman lifestyler." It happens to have some of the same words, or similar words to the article furry lifestyler, but does not validate any information therein. Your "large number of sources" is only that one article, and many self published websites, which are not allowed as sources as a matter of policy. See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. But the article has not been deleted yet. If the claims in the article can be sourced, go to the article and source them.

<dd>It's analogous to the difference between Trek fandom and devoting one's life to Vulcan or Klingon philosphy and traditions.

<li><b>Make Article Redirect to Furry Fandom and Move Content. Then revamp furry articles for verifiability and published sources</b> - I thought furry lifestyler and furry fandom or at least one were up for deletion upon a time and I know there's been merger votes. I don't remember the results. Anyway, furry lifestyler and fandom seem about the same thing and the fandom has a lot of different types of furries--nobody can agree on which is which and there's tons of debates on it, such as sexual aspects are always a big debate. For my revamp thing, there's a good trend on controversial wikipedia articles for every bit of info has to have verifiable sources that can be found to state what the info is. Furry articles are full of debate about what is what and all info needs reliable sources (wikipedia says something like news media and puplished academic research? Well that sort of thing). Most of the sources are "in my experience, furries are like this and there's not like this." I personally think Wikifur does a much better job than the furry articles here because it is more inclusive. So basically I can't grasp a clear difference between fandom and lifestyler so I say merge, and furry articles are controversial so they need everything there supported by sources that meet wikipedia's standards for sources and not personal experience like the article is now. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 03:26, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No - very much no. The distinction is pretty obscure, but can be summarized thus: The otherkin community is more or less defined by a belief that one existed as some form of mythological creature in a previous life. The furry community is a bit more fuzzily defined, but can be generally lumped together as people who identify with animals to some degree or another. There's significant crossover between the two groups, but they are emphatically not identical. A person who believes they are the second coming of Dracula is probably not a furry, and a person who likes to draw anthropomorphic foxes isn't necessarily an otherkin. That all being said, though, I still find the distinction between the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a> as a whole and the concept of the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_lifestyler.html" title="Furry lifestyler">furry lifestyler</a> unnecessarily narrow; as such, my vote to merge stands. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 10:28, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well first off not that i give a flying duck about furry stuff (I say this now to stop the stipid question of why am i here, i am at work and bord)the thing and wants to does cover things that are very different from the other articles. I dont believe the common furry has the whole spiritual and body mod thing going on, granted this is lacking in quantity of information, its simply a topic that realy does not have a lot of reaserch done on it. so lets say someone wants to learn about the whole furry lifestyler thing, its got enoff difference that it should be its own thing otherwise that person is going to have to sift through all the regular furry stuff just to find the info they need. i say keep it and work on improving the quality and quantity of info. also just because SOMEONE does not like the idea of this lifesyle does not mean it should be deleted. i bet you just dont want to incurr the wrath or any other alternitive lifestyles so you pick on an obscure one.-me-06/04/06 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 192.18.128.13 (<a href="../../../1/9/2/User_talk%7E192.18.128.13.html" title="User talk:192.18.128.13">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_192.18.128.13_3e31.html" title="Special:Contributions/192.18.128.13">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think the point centres on the fact that not every single character in the history of a TV show deserves a WP article; and whether or not this particular character will go on to become a notable enough character surely cannot be established until they have been on the show for a certain amount of time. I don't really have a vote to make either way, though, although I would perhaps suggest an appropriate <b>redirect</b> (either to the main EE article or, if there is one, an article about minor characters) that can be made into a full article should the character later be deemed important enough. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 16:18, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I can't tell if this is notable or not. It claims to be a satirical magazine published in Germany with a circulation of 12,000. I can't find a listing in Ulrich's or a web site. It has a listing on the german wikipedia <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samowar_%28Zeitschrift%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samowar_%28Zeitschrift%29" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> which seems to have the same info as here.

When I undid it, acting upon <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiface_de15.html" title="User:Liface">Liface</a>'s suggestion, I didn't look up whether it was more well known as flutter frisbee or flutterguts, which was my error. The current [Flutter_Frisbee] article should probably either be moved as-is to [Flutterguts] and redirected, or become a subsection of [Guts_frisbee]. [Guts_frisbee], however, should not be a candidate for deletion under this proposal, even if flutterguts is eventually deleted. I suggest we move/merge flutter frisbee for now, look at sourcing it, and reconsider deleting it at a later date (preferrably a pre-determined timeframe) --Superflyguy 0:23, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

OK here... <b>move <a href="../../../g/u/t/Guts_Frisbee_8c17.html" title="Guts Frisbee">Guts Frisbee</a> to Team Guts</b>, a more established name for the game discussed in the article; <b>delete <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flutterguts.html" title="Flutterguts">Flutterguts</a></b> as a failed attempt at disambiguation; <b>merge <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flutter_Frisbee_c554.html" title="Flutter Frisbee">Flutter Frisbee</a> into Team Guts</b> under a subheading of "Variants of Team Guts". What does the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wham-O_d098.html" title="Wham-O">Wham-O</a> site say about these?

<p><br />
I have never heard the name <b>Team Guts</b>, and can find no reference to that name on the World Flying Disk Federation website, or any other for that matter. It also fails to accurately describe it, as the WFDF rules for guts allow 1-5 players per side <a href="http://www.wfdf.org/index.php?page=rules/art3.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wfdf.org/index.php?page=rules/art3.htm" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>. It would be better to alter the article to make note of the variable number of players than to create separate articles just to make a distinction based on the number of players. Also, Wham-O currently has no information on guts that I could find, and it's publications are not as authorative as the WFDF. --Superflyguy 23:21, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm going to go ahead and fix the number of players in the <a href="../../../g/u/t/Guts_Frisbee_8c17.html" title="Guts Frisbee">Guts Frisbee</a> article, then move <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flutter_Frisbee_c554.html" title="Flutter Frisbee">Flutter Frisbee</a> to <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flutterguts.html" title="Flutterguts">Flutterguts</a> and mark it as a possible merge to a subsection of Guts Frisbee, and we'll go frum there.--Superflyguy 1:46, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Prod disupted on talk page. This is a non-notable "meme" (I counted 12 Google hits) centered around a buyer's revenge story. While some of these stories achieve sufficient notability by virtue of their creativity and execution (i.e., "P-P-P-Powerbook" and "scam the 411 scammer" stories), there's nothing particularly notable about this one; in fact, it's little more than an attack of the seller via dissemination of personal information. It seems to be an attempt to use Wikipedia to further promote a short-lived blog subject that is losing steam. <b><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie"><font face="Arial" color="#D47C14">OhNo</font></a><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie"><font color="#7D4C0C">itsJamie</font></a><a href="../../../o/h/n/User_talk%7EOhnoitsjamie_2359.html" title="User talk:Ohnoitsjamie"><sup>Talk</sup></a></b> 18:47, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>As the original author of the page, I obviously feel that the meme is of sufficient notability to have a place in Wikipedia. The internet meme is exceedingly difficult to assess regarding notability. However, according to the guidelines (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MEME" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MEME" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MEME</a>), the creativity involved is not a determiner in a meme's notability. Even so, if you look at the web page started by the buyer, there is a modicum of creativity involved anyway. The fact that it's an attack via the dissemination of information is not a determiner either - it may be wrong, it may be childish, but it's still notable. The main reasons I feel that it's notable are, however, the coverage it has received in the UK and Irish press (linked in the article), covered by national newspapers and on the radio. I don't understand the assertion that the blog is losing steam, stated on the very day it receives such coverage in the national papers. For this and the reasons above, I believe the item is of sufficient notability. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaise_Joshua_a0a6.html" title="User:Blaise Joshua">Blaise Joshua</a> 19:57, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The blog that outlines this has been mentioned on the BBC, by the newspapers both here in the UK and in other countries, and the blog has also clocked up over a million hits. This is not just about the google test(which, incidentally, since it's last algorithm update, seems, to me, to be returning a lot of junk links quite frequently, google is only indicative, it should not be the only criterion) --<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorelog_d219.html" title="User:Corelog">Cal</a> 18:25, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The name completely fails the Google test, bringing up just NINE total (not unique- <i>total</i>) hits.

<li><b>Keep</b> (sorry - I think I should have added that earlier). Just a note guys - I just tried the Google test for myself. You're quite right - a search on "Amir Tofangsazan" returns hardly any hits, but a search on "Amir Moussoud Tofangsazan" (the poor guy's full name) got 145 hits on my count, and a search of Amir and eBay produces 245,000 hits, which are obviously not all related to this particular meme, but there were specific hits down as far as page 10 (after that I stopped checking). Therefore, depending on your search terms, I don't think it fails the Google test at all. Maybe I've named the article poorly. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaise_Joshua_a0a6.html" title="User:Blaise Joshua">Blaise Joshua</a> 21:11, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just one last point - I just tried entering the search words Amir, laptop and eBay. This got almost 25,000 hits, and from this entry you can see how well represented this story is on the internet. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaise_Joshua_a0a6.html" title="User:Blaise Joshua">Blaise Joshua</a> 21:18, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I think this is a meme in its ascendant phase (I'd bet it'll be on Slashdot tomorrow and Wired by Friday) - that doesn't mean it really meets WP:MEME right now.

Equally if we keep and it peaks before the WP:MEME threshold, it's hard to AfD again (for the same reason) for a month or two.

<li>Jamie - I agree that the article, as it stands, only presents one side of the story, but this is a problem that can be rectified and certainly doesn't warrant deletion on the grounds of being non-notable. There are bound to be press reports stating Amir's side of the story - we can put these in to make it more balanced. Unfortunately for Amir, however, from what I've been reading on blogs most people are sympathetic to the buyer of the laptop, probably ones who have been done on eBay! <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaise_Joshua_a0a6.html" title="User:Blaise Joshua">Blaise Joshua</a> 17:16, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, I've been screwed both ways on eBay; by unscrupulous sellers and surprisingly by a buyer (who filed bogus complaints against me to try to weasel out of paying for items that UPS tracking said were delivered; fortunately, I prevailed in that one, but it was a huge pain). On the other hand, I think the P-P-P-Powerbook story is great, though in that one it's undeniable that a scam was going on. This case is a little different because it's not entirely clear if there was a scam going on; it may be that the laptop was damaged (or just died) in transit, and the seller was slow to respond to the complaint. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Brian_Peppers&amp;oldid=28988396" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Brian_Peppers&amp;oldid=28988396" rel="nofollow">Brian Peppers</a> is an example of a precedent where the subject was notable yet ultimately Jimbo kaboshed the article for other reasons (at least temporarily). <b><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie"><font face="Arial" color="#D47C14">OhNo</font></a><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie"><font color="#7D4C0C">itsJamie</font></a><a href="../../../o/h/n/User_talk%7EOhnoitsjamie_2359.html" title="User talk:Ohnoitsjamie"><sup>Talk</sup></a></b> 17:34, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Let's wait and see how this whole thing turns out. Might be a real precident case here, in the times we live in, scaming on eBay is a very serious internet problem. --HamstaHuey 17:30, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's just appeared as part of a serious discussion of the legal implications of how 'Tougher libel laws may be needed to combat cyber vigilantes, lawyers warn' in <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,200-2205289,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,200-2205289,00.html" rel="nofollow">The Times</a> of 31 May.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is the true 'one man does good story'. Far too many of us have been scammed over the years by the faceless, nameless, untouchable individual....well frankly this story is one many of us can relate to in terms of 'appropriate' revenge. The victim of the fraud has never advocated violence, racism or any similar inappropriate behaviour. Instead given the information they had they very reasonably just asked the perp to reimburse them for the amount of the fraud and the matter would end there. Instead the perp mocked the victim, accused the victim of being a paedophile, threatened them with violence and called them a liar. The weight of evidence available shows the victim gave the perp every opportunity to 'make good' before they posted the story. The biggest reason to keep this entry is because it's now become a global story inside 2 weeks, and in my opinion the reason for that is because so many of us can relate to it as we've been the victim.</li>
</ul>
<p>keep it</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>remove</b> I've only seen the 'blog' once. I think the concept of 'internet revenge' is a common theme on the net. I don't think this one incident pervades our culture enough to be condsidered a 'meme'. I'd consider it a meme when the Tshirts and spoof sites of it come out such as 'Amir sold me a photocopier that didn't work but it had an ass copy stuck in the mechanisms' I'd like to see a fake blog made about the 'revenge buyer' going <i>My name is .... and I got suckered into buying a crappy laptop and instead of resorting to the eBay dispute resolution process, I had a hissy fit and scanned the drive for personal information. Don't these people know they're supposed to PGP their drives! AMATEURS! I guess I will never work again because by now my name has been googlebombed a million times and every HR person will think I'm a big fat loser who sits at computer day and night. At least Amir has some friends in his pictures, and is photogenic enough to pose semi nude, unlike myself."</i></li>

<li><i><b>Keep</b> This whole thing has now been reached by media outside the internet (the Sun, the Daily Mail, the BBC, ITV (in the UK) and others) and is propogating all over the world on various news sites across multiple countries. The original blog site now has over 2 million hits. I think it has "sufficient notability" now.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to add as a chief administrator of the group, that we are not just a small web based comunity, we are a media group/cult. We do not charge money. More parts of DCUK are under construction, including www.swuk.org, www.dotcartoon.com(pending) so we are definatly not just based on invisionfree, i assume you didnt take proper care when visiting our community. Just a quick scan. Also this is a list about out cartoons, and other things. Our "small community" has been going over 5 years now.</li>

<p>Thankyou! Im going to assume you will revert this as you have everything else, if you are fair and just you will not revert this, and as for evidence i think its only fair ill screen shot this all. Swuk6 19:20, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article describes a non-notable, non-existant band and includes various phrases of vanity such as, " Each member has their own magical musical powers, which they use to fight evil." and "They have been compared to a mixture of bands like Weezer, The Strokes, The Unicorns, and Van Halen." Overall, this article is poorly written and describes a non-notable fake band, with NO hits when performing a google or yahoo search. <b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThetruthbelow_03f2.html" title="User:Thetruthbelow">Thetruthbelow</a> <sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../w/i/k/Image%7EWikipedia_minilogo.gif_399b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/0/04/Wikipedia_minilogo.gif/20px-Wikipedia_minilogo.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" longdesc="../../../w/i/k/Image%7EWikipedia_minilogo.gif_399b.html" /></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThetruthbelow_886a.html" title="User talk:Thetruthbelow">(talk)</a></font></sup> 19:41, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, NN, vanity. This "commercial feature film" outfit's been around six years and has 27 minutes of film to show for it?

<p>As per <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a>'s prod:</p>
<ol>
<li>The length of this article (approx. 250 kb) is unacceptable. This is an encyclopedia article, not a book.</li>
<li>The quoted texts are much too long; as such, they may not fall under fair use. Only brief quotes from copyrighted sources may be used without permission.</li>
<li>The writing style of the entire article is inappropriate. The whole thing is filled with innuendo, speculations, uncited accusations, and gossip.</li>
<li>Finally, and most importantly, virtually nothing is cited. The article makes a number of extraordinary claims about the involvement of the <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Skull and Bones</a> group in drug dealing, but there are only 20 citations in the entire article, most of which are for auxiliary points. To put that in perspective, that's about one citation for each 12 kilobytes of text.</li>
</ol>
<p>I do believe that there may be some encyclopedic content which can be discussed here, if appropriate sources can be found, but this wall of text isn't it. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 20:24, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

This is a titanic (novel-length, damn near) heap of unsourced POV-ridden innuendo with relations to Skull and Bones that's tenuous at best -- for instance, I'm missing the connection that a long section on the ramifications of an ex-Taliban spokesman being an ex-Yalie has to S&amp;B in specific. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 21:12, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Taken separately the four points above just indicate a need for cleanup, but taken together, I think they indicate deletion and starting this article over.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Joelmills is right -- I'm convinced this thing is beyond repair from looking at it and the nominator's statements. Large parts of it may be copyvio because of the inappropriate use of quotes. I can't imagine anyone wanting to take on this monster.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Basically uncleanable, and uninteresting. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>rewrite</b> and <b>shorten</b>. The subject matter is very notable and would make for an interesting article. However the present article violates NPOV, probably NOR as well, and I'd also check closely to make sure it isn't copyvio, too. But the purpose of AFD is to vote on whether articles should be deleted due to worthiness of content, and IMO that isn't the case here. As ScottW indicated, the points noted by the nominator indicate an article in bad need of repair, but not necessarily deletion. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:35, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't delete</b> Its not advertisement, theirs pleanty of information given</li>
<li><b>Don't delete</b>. The studio is exceptional in the fact that it offers level design for video games upon requests from individual customers, not game companies as all other studios do. In doing so the studio is pioneering this area of video game market. No other studio takes requests from average players to provide them with what they desire. The article's purpose isn't to advertise the studio but to rather describe the new trend in video game development that the appearance of this studio shows. With the modern technology, level design becomes such an accessible tool that it can now be done on a smaller, individual scale rather than through mass-produced video games as it was before. From the previous suggestions on deletion I see that this idea wasn't expressed clearly enough in the article therefore it will be <i>edited</i>, NOT <i>deleted</i>.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Why is it a problem that the person adding the prod tag also brought it here? <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">Wikipedia:Proposed_deletion</a> is clear that this is the procedure to follow. From the Conflicts section "Contested deletions: If anyone, including the article's creator, removes Template:Prod from an article for any reason, do not put it back.

<li>If i undertand the prod template correctly, its to be used by people who think their might be a need to delete but aren't sure. If your sure it needs to be deleted, you should say so from the get-go. Thats what i think bout that. <a href="../../../n/u/m/User%7ENumerao_9838.html" title="User:Numerao">Numerao</a> 20:52, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, the prod tag is for deletions that you feel are uncontroversial. Any deletion that may be contested or that you are unsure of goes to AfD. This is why so many things in AfD are articles which are contested prods. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 21:17, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I take it you mean the line "He or she often strikes at the most crowded places including buses, discos, hotels, shopping centers and restaurants." I find your reaction truly bizzare, this seems like a simple and <i>extremely</i> obvious observation. Where else would a terrorist strike, a deserted place?

<li><b>Delete</b> I started the site and you people who are calling for its deletions just prove that www.antiwikipedia.com is much too important to be on your site of techno-ignorance. I have no idea who made a Wikipedia page for it but it provided my amusement for the evening. The Antiwiki, while containing some criticism of the Wikipedia, is here to open all wisdom and technology to everyone on the planet. It is not meant to be a nonsense site like Uncyclopedia. It is meant to end history by creating a post-Hegelian dialetic. Do you know what this means? Maybe you should actually read Hegel instead of the Wikipedia article on Hegel. Why is it called Antiwikipedia? Because your mindless deleting of my articles started the idea of creating a site to aggregate all wisdom instead of creating a battleground to argue over some insane concept like 'NPOV'. There is no war because we have already won. Plus we'll get a post on Wikitruth perhaps? =) Much love, hugs, kisses, and check out the Not-To-Do List on the site.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.124.27.93 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.124.27.93_e481.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.124.27.93">contribs</a>).</small>
