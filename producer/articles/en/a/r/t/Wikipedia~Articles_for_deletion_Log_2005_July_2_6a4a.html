For that reason, Cognition is trying to have his Wikipedia entry deleted. In addition, the arbitration committee has ruled in two separate cases that LaRouche supporters are not allowed to use Wikipedia to promote LaRouche's ideas, or to further his cause. This VfD is in clear violation of those rulings. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> July 2, 2005 21:55 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your ad hominem reasoning is barely worth a response. Just because you happen to get something published doesn't make you notable enough for a Wikipedia entry automatically. <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECognition_c8b2.html" title="User:Cognition">Cognition</a> 2 July 2005 21:59 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is either POV-pushing or someone sorely misguided as to notability, neologisms, and Wikipedia. I am prepared to assume good faith and suggest the former, though other actions do lead me to doubt that...

<li>This page is on VfD because he is not notable, which is evident in the tiny number of hits he generates on google. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Chip+Berlet%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Chip+Berlet%22" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECognition_c8b2.html" title="User:Cognition">Cognition</a> 2 July 2005 22:01 (UTC)

<li>I shall make several points, for posterity's sake:
<ol>
<li>There are 32900 pages on Google for me. That's plenty high enough for "notability".</li>
<li>Notability is not a policy. See <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a>.</li>
<li>Verifibility is a policy. Look at the references. This is verifiable.</li>
<li>Would you care to explain the neologism comment? <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">smoddy</a> 2 July 2005 22:07 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Non-notable, not important, same thing here. Hardly anyone read his book. And the reviews on Amazon are quite revealing. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00072BU96/qid=1120342355/sr=8-14/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i11_xgl14/103-9827824-1759821?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00072BU96/qid=1120342355/sr=8-14/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i11_xgl14/103-9827824-1759821?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECognition_c8b2.html" title="User:Cognition">Cognition</a> 2 July 2005 22:13 (UTC)

<li><b>Speedy Keep RIGHT NOW</b> This is such an obvious bad-faith nomination that I can not imagine why it's still on VFD this long after nomination.

<li><b>Keep, and calm down everybody</b>. Cognition appears to be new here and has made a nomination that many people disagree with. That's no biggie, the net result is that the article will have a templated box on it for about a week. Yet somehow, life goes on. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> July 4, 2005 09:02 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep, preferably speedy keep, but on the other hand calls to sanction the nominator seem extreme. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 4 July 2005 10:13 (UTC)

<li>No excessive, not overstated — <i>extreme</i>, no less. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 4 July 2005 10:16 (UTC)

<li>Well, I thought about excessive, but I went with extreme. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 4 July 2005 10:37 (UTC)</li>
<li>One particular editor has fairly recently adopted the attitude that any sanction against any editor is "extreme". He appears to have adopted this attitude immediately after being sanctioned by the Arbitration Committee for obsessive and possessive editing of any articles referring to a particular young female singer. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 4 July 2005 18:34 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No such attitude exists, so both sentences are false. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 4 July 2005 18:52 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You're right, I should have said "just about any sanction" and "exhibits behaviour indicating that etc." It's possible he still supports some sanctions against editors, though I haven't seen any evidence of that. And while his behaviour indicates that he possesses this attitude, he may well feel something entirely different and is making all these statements for some unknown and unfathomable reason. I apologize for making this inference merely based on all available evidence. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 4 July 2005 19:11 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I block vandals on occasion, as you can see in my admin log, so that right there refutes your claim that I support no sanctions. In fact I support many sanctions, provided there is due caution and fairness involved. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 4 July 2005 19:47 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I said "just about any sanction". Reviewing blocks logs reveals that perhaps even a half dozen times, this editor/admin has blocked the most egregious IP vandals for a whole day, and has even, on a couple of occasions, blocked obvious impersonators. None of this, of course, is at all relevant to the evidence he displays regarding sanctions against editors. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 4 July 2005 20:01 (UTC)

<li>How is that not relevant? Are you making a distinction between that and ArbCom stuff? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 4 July 2005 20:07 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Briefly blocking obvious vandals is not the same as sanctioning editors. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 5 July 2005 19:47 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unless they're vandals, I'm not empowered to sanction anyone, unless they have violated the 3RR, but I don't believe in that so I don't block people for that. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 5 July 2005 19:56 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ah, but that wasn't the issue.

<li>Ha. Now the text says 1458 too. Nice. You know, it only took me like 5 minutes (well, 10 if you count the time it took to write the program) to search from 1--10000000 and uncover 1458. Does this "professor"'s "proof" mention 1458 or not?

<ul>
<li>Actually, the proof that there were only 3 such numbers being <i>wrong</i> would not make the article unverifiable. This is not <i>mathematical</i> verification, but <i>encyclopaedic</i> verification. What makes the article unverifiable is that so far no source has been proferred (apart from a vague statement that <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masahiko_Fujiwara_e756.html" title="Masahiko Fujiwara">Masahiko Fujiwara</a> published this theorem in "a book which became a best-seller in Japan", which entirely fails to state the ISBN of the book or any way of determining what book is being referred to) for the theorem's publication by anyone anywhere. It's less about whether the proof is correct, and more about whether the statement that <i>such a (fallacious) proof was published</i> is correct. The only thing that the addition of 1458 does is cast yet further doubt on the existence of any actual source material. Peer-review of a mathematical article would have caught that error within minutes, as demonstrated here. It looks like what is actually happening is that the original publication and peer-review of this mathematical assertion is happening <i>here in Wikipedia</i>, which is not what Wikipedia is for. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 2005-07-03 00:06:09 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't fully agree with you. It's true that a false theorem could be encyclopedic, but that requires special circumstances. As you note, there's no evidence of that here. It is absolutely not verifiable that the information in the original article is correct, because in fact it was wrong. An encyclopedia article that simply stated "1+1=3" would fail verifiability even if there is someone somewhere who claims that it's true. You could instead say "Japanese mathematician xxx claims 1+1=3" and that might be verifiable, although it would probably be doubtful that it was notable. The article I voted on fit into the former category (made a claim that was demonstrably false), thus not verifiable. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 3 July 2005 06:27 (UTC)

<li>Also, I would hazard that the article is more or less correct. The result is natural because the number of digits grows logarithmically with respect to the number itself and so the product eventually falls short of the original number.

<li><i>Iff</i> the book is valid, then I see nothing wrong with <b>keep</b>ing this article, albeit probably under the name Ugly number.

<li><s><b>Keep</b> (pending further facts)</s>, but rename to (for instance) Fujiwara's ugly theorem, or perhaps Fujiwara's ugly property. An ISBN number is now given, so it's falsifiable (see <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/books/4480687114/250-3763696-4109838" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/books/4480687114/250-3763696-4109838" rel="nofollow">this page</a> on amazon.co.jp as evidence that the book exists), the current sales rank seems to be 132 which would certainly make it notable, especially if it turns out to be wrong. Masahiko Fujiwara is a mathematician at Ochanomizu University with 22 publications on MathSciNet. I also note that nobody seems to have checked the book. The name <i>Ugly theorem</i> reminds me of a fragment in Hardy's A Mathematician's Apology, in which he states that some theorems, while true, are devoid of any interest. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 4 July 2005 14:15 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, as per Vipersp51, and also because:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Its almost an insult having such a thing as a mathematicians <i>only</i> referenced work.</li>
<li>What is the relevance of such property?</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Why is it almost an insult? Because it took me less than 15 min to find that this is true for 1, 81, 1458 and 1729, and no other number up to 5 digits.</dd>
<dd>Its easy to show that any number with 5 digits can't have this property:</dd>
<dd>The sum of the digits would have a maximum of 45(=5*9), a reversal of such number would at most 93 (reversing 39&lt;45), so any such product is less than 4185, which as 4 digits, thus is smaller than the target value.</dd>
<dd>This can be performed by any high school student studying math. A generalization of this for any number of digits is also relatively simple, yet quite boring to post on VfD.</dd>
<dd>Last, but not least, a Google search shows Ugly numbers as a completely different thing: <a href="http://acm.uva.es/problemset/v1/136.html" class="external text" title="http://acm.uva.es/problemset/v1/136.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5</i></a>.</dd>

<li>I would say <i>keep</i>, but I ought to reveal that Masahiko is a friend of mine from way back. This material is also perhaps not quite stand-alone. Merge into the article on MF.

<li>Masahiko is your friend! Is it true? Masahiko has been giving his opinion on how education in Japan ought to be. It seem as though he has a conservative idea. His main opinion is that Japanese children should not</li>
</ul>
<p>learn English while they're young.Instead, they should go back to Japanese classic literature. As I said in the article, Masahiko thinks great Math comes from the sense of beauty. So he thinks what children should do is to learn and memorize beautiful Japanese poems and phrazes.

<p>Article by anonymous AOL user "64.12.117.5" and "Gotti Babii 89". <i>John takes his appearance very seriously. His favorite designers are Versace, Gucci, Kenneth Cole, Armani. His hobbies are sports, reading, music, computer studies, and hanging out with friends. He is a charismatic person. John was named after his grandfather, John Gotti. He loves to laugh and has a great sense of humor. His favorite perfume is Versace. John is outgoing and loves to have fun. In school, history is his best subject. He enjoys reading the following magazines: Source, Rides, and XXL.</i> Current content is not encyclopedic. Links to a fan website whose two contacts are also on AOL. Possible website promo. Although there is some notability for John Gotti Jr., the reality TV show is mostly about the family, not just him.

<p>This is not an encyclopedia article, it's a Simpsons trivia listing. Fine for a fan site, but what is it doing in an encyclopedia? If someone could point me to a Ph.D. dissertation on nudity in The Simpsons, I might concede that there's a topic here to be discussed, but otherwise it's just snippets from episodes. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 2 July 2005 03:03 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm the author, so I don't know if I can vote. But we also have a References to Star Trek in The Simpsons. Anyway, this is a dimension of the show <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> 2 July 2005 03:05 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (but a weak vote only). No stupider than 17,497 other junky trivia articles we wind up keeping. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 2 July 2005 03:10 (UTC)

<li>OK. I'll VfD those also. Nothing personal. It's just that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and I don't consider this an encyclopedia article. If it's valid, so also would be Celebrity appearances in The Simpsons, Animals in The Simpsons, Sports in The Simpsons, Cross-dressing in The Simpsons, Alcohol in The Simpsons and hundreds of similar topics. Is there a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikicities.html" title="Wikicities">Wikicities</a> site for The Simpsons yet? If so maybe we could move the article there. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 2 July 2005 03:22 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I'm not the first to say this, but: the fact that we have articles that don't really belong on Wikipedia is not a reason to add more such articles. Like I said, this is nothing personal. I consider Wikipedia a public resource, and would thus prefer that it not dedicate server resources, memory, and bandwidth to serving as a fansite host. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 2 July 2005 03:37 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now that I've had a chance to clear my head, let me start over: the reason I started this was not because we have other trivia articles, but because it's a dimension of the show and a depiction of nudity, but wouldn't fit in either (already long) major article. <i>Simpsons</i> is a cultural item of nearly equal importance to other major fictional topics. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> 2 July 2005 20:44 (UTC)</li>

<p>A strange list - at the same time too broad and too selective - of terrorist incidents under a vaguely defined theme of war on terror. At the very least it needs either a new title (List of terrorist attacks on the US and Russia?) or to be true to the original title would have to include incidents other than actions of terrorists. But there are a number of lists of terrorist incidents already floating around which cover all the same items in this list. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 2 July 2005 04:11 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The list is not really all related to the United States government's "War on Terror." For example, the attack on Beslan is more related to a territorial crisis that long predates the Al Qaida attacks of 11 September 2001. The incidents cannot be related the same way battles in a single war or conflict can. This too easily simplifies every act of international/territorial violence into a war on or with terror. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColoradoZ_ee5b.html" title="User:ColoradoZ">User:ColoradoZ</a> --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColoradoZ_ee5b.html" title="User:ColoradoZ">ColoradoZ</a> July 2, 2005 04:19 (UTC)</p>

<li>Agree with the above - the content is ill-conceived and ridiculously broad (the 1983 US Embassy bombing in Beirut is somehow related to the "War on Terror", a term coined by the Bush administration?). The title strikes me as rather POV as well.

<p>1. just because a User disagrees with one of the inclusions here does not mean that the list should be deleted.</p>
<p>2. just because someone disagrees with the "Bush" War on Terror does not mean that the list has not been proposed by academics and politicians and thus is valid and should remain.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This list appears misconceived and confused as to its own content. As far as I know, Bush did not use the words "War on terror" until <i>after</i> 9/11, so everything up to then shouldn't be on the list. The term is too losely defined as it is, and the inclusion of Beslan seems inappropriate too since that was related to a very specific geo-political point; it had little or nothing to do with the actions of the US and her allies against terrorism. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> July 2, 2005 16:52 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I think perhaps the point here is that the user wishes to blame these actions on what he/she views as the overreaching nature of GWB's "War on Terror", rather than on those that GWB would call "terrorists." While I understand that there is a chicken/egg issue, I still think <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_terrorist_incidents.html" title="List of terrorist incidents">List of terrorist incidents</a> is the least confusing name for this category, and is an acceptably NPOV name. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> July 2, 2005 18:21 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article is a fabrication. If it were true, Salih would be a very notable chess player, but all the chess claims are lies.

<p>This stub article attempts and fails to explain the concept of <a href="../../../f/l/u/Fluid_breathing.html" title="Fluid breathing">fluid breathing</a> using a false, pseudoscientific analogy. It was apparently created solely to provide a link from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Abyss_babb.html" title="The Abyss">The Abyss</a></i> about the film's use of a fluid-breathing system. I've already directed that article's two links to the existing, robust, accurate article. Since the more generic concept of "oxygenated liquid" could refer to anything right up to pond water for freshwater fish, I doubt this article could be made useful. — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 2 July 2005 08:36 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually, it's not even from the film at all. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Abyss_babb.html" title="The Abyss">The Abyss</a></i> explicitly describes the Deep Suit as a fluid-breathing system (a real-life concept that is used in more than just this one film, moreover). The closest that it comes to this article's title is in referring to an "oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion", which is indeed the very correction that <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeffq</a> has made to the article about the film. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 2005-07-02 22:04:05 (UTC)</li>

<li>Strong <b>Keep</b> for both. <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodwards.html" title="Woodwards">Woodwards</a> the department store chain was a very important chain of department stores in Western Canada, and is quite notable in itself. The <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodward%27s_building.html" title="Woodward's building">Woodward's building</a> was just one of many of their locations. The Woodwards Building has become a very important political symbol that has absolutely nothing to do with its former role as a a department store. Saving the building has been cited as one of Mayor <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Campbell_e5be.html" title="Larry Campbell">Larry Campbell</a>'s primary achievements in office. Merging the two articles is a very bad idea. Both articles need to be cleaned up a bit and more information should be added but that is not a reason for either deleting or merging the two articles. The building has been the site of a very visible squat, many protests, it has been the subject of literally thousands of hours of City meetings, a documentary movie (or 2), and millions of dollars has been spent trying to save it. None of this has anything to do with its old role as a department store, except that many Vancouverites have sentimental memories about it. -- <a href="../../../w/e/b/User%7EWebgeer_3ab7.html" title="User:Webgeer">Webgeer</a> July 1, 2005 20:39 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I disagree that the articles are redundant. Woodward's was an important retailer in Western Canada and its article attempts to document that. Very little is said of the building there. The Woodward's building was the prominent location and Western base for Woodward and as <a href="../../../w/e/b/User%7EWebgeer_3ab7.html" title="User:Webgeer">Webgeer</a> stated, now of some political importance as well. Its page tries to document that. I think they are both encyclopedic and expandable. The city of Vancouver's <a href="http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/corpsvcs/realestate/woodwards/" class="external text" title="http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/corpsvcs/realestate/woodwards/" rel="nofollow">page</a> on the building briefly describes some of the building's importance to the city.

<li>I think I can resolve this dispute. I created this article a while ago, as part of a series of articles on politicians in Manitoba. At the time, I thought that anyone who ran for federal or provincial office was fair game for an article on Wikipedia. We've clarified the rules since then, and the accepted practice now that failed candidates of fringe parties don't deserve their own pages (unless there's something truly unique about them) but can be featured on "list pages". As such, I plan to create a "list page" for CHP candidates, and to compress the Reimer page to a redirect.</li>
<li>I should also clarify that I am not affiliated with the Christian Heritage Party of Canada, nor do I sympathize with its goals in any way, shape or form. I've written similar pieces on fringe candidates from across the political spectrum. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 3 July 2005 18:32 (UTC)</li>

<li>I should clarify that the page has already been merged to a redirect, and that a clear Wikipedia precedent permits list pages to exist (we had a long discussion about this).

<p>The Fucked Company entry is a joke being played on Wikipedia users. A few kiddies from the message board there think it is funny to keep vandalizing Wikipedia entries. Along the way they decided to throw in an entry for the message board they come from. Philip Kaplan who created Fucked Company is a minor notable person in the history of reporting on the Internet, as is his web site Fucked Company. However, the kiddies who keep vandalizing Wikipedia entries and creating Fucked Company entries do so to make a mockery out of Wikipedia. For example, Kaplan's younger brother (Joseph) is disabled. The kiddies keep throwing in references to Philip abusing Joseph, or to Joseph helping establish Fucked Company (neither comment has any basis in reality, they are both deliberate vandalism and inside jokes of the kiddies).</p>
<p>There is no purpose to the page. Why should Wikipedia have an entry about a message board used by a few dozen kiddies? <i>(Above nomination by User:207.237.210.68)</i></p>

<p>There is no original research. It is just a page with bullshit assertions that was created by the kiddies from the message board as a joke. I edited the more inane crap in it just now, but it still should go altogether. <i>(Above comment by User:207.237.210.68)</i></p>

<li>Go back and re-read the historical versions of the article. The reason that you think it is ok now is because I just cleaned the article up. However, the article will probably be vandalized in the next few hours by the kiddies. The clean version I have created through my edits contains no original research. It is just a bunch of assertions, which is not what Wikipedia entries are supposed to be.

<li><b>comment</b>. The distinction is between articles where notability is not yet established and articles where it could not possibly be established. The lengthy debate about school articles in general showed that many people feel that schools have intrinsic notability. If nothing much has been said, it is <b>preferred</b> that they remain merged with their locale, but such preference does not amount to an established criteria for deletion.

<p>Page exists to push the POV of the creator, who has been asked not to include this information in the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> article. As the creator said when creating the page, "This was placed as a serparate article because homophiles on the homosexuality page wanted that page to be strictly dedicated to promotion of the behavior, not logical repudiation." A discussion has ensued on the talk page and an edit war appears to be in place about whether or not this page is NPOV. Also the external link is someone's personal website, not a scientific journal or anything: "[Homosexual] existence is an embarrassing anomaly for Darwinism." If this isn't POV I'd like to know what is... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs2000</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Talk</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 2 July 2005 18:46 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think the page could contain some good information, if both sides of view are presented. However, it is clear that the author is just trying to push an agenda, as judged not only by his actions in this article, but his history of actions in others. Furthermore, he has repeatedly removed the NPOV disclaimer, and made a statement to the effect of "I will allow the NPOV disclaimer if...". It's clear he's using the article to push an agenda, as shown not only by his actions, but by the fact that he wishes greatly to retain ownership of the page. – <a href="../../../m/i/p/User%7EMipadi_1585.html" title="User:Mipadi">Mipadi</a> July 2, 2005 18:48 (UTC)</li>

<li>Is it possible that a logical argument can exist without proper documentation on the internet? If so, why can't Wikipedia be a trailblazer and include information presented as unbiased iteration of that logical argument? I have nothing wrong with putting more information in the article, such as, "opponents belive..." but there are certain editors who want to remove the knowledge altogether, which, to use their own words, "push[s] the POV of the creator." <small>(Unsigned comment by <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntellectualprop2002_a89a.html" title="User:Intellectualprop2002">Intellectualprop2002</a> (<a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EIntellectualprop2002_1cc8.html" title="User talk:Intellectualprop2002">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Intellectualprop2002_9785.html" title="Special:Contributions/Intellectualprop2002">contribs</a>), the article's creator shortly before he left <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;diff=18025462&amp;oldid=18015353" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;diff=18025462&amp;oldid=18015353" rel="nofollow">this message</a> on my talk page -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs2000</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Talk</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 2 July 2005 19:08 (UTC))</small>

If there are specific opponents who have opposing beliefs, they should be explicitely referenced, not given the generic title "opponents", and references should be added showing where they state these beliefs. If there aren't specific opponents whose opposing beliefs are documented, then these purported opponents and their purported beliefs have no place in an encyclopedia article. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> July 2, 2005 22:32 (UTC)</li>

If everyone can agree on that statement, the idea is to include all rational information in this encyclopedia, NOT to exclude it because it goes against what some people believe. We can state that there IS a school of thought that agrees with this argument, however small and however source-less it is. To exclude it from Wikipedia, despite the amount of sources, would be counter to the goal of Wikipedia. To my knowledge, there is no shortage of storage space for the website, and we do not need to start pruning ideas that aren't known by EVERYONE.

<li>Francs2000 was the one who put this article up for deletion because it, "exists to push the POV of the creator." The deletion of this article, however would, in turn be pushing the POV of the deleter, Francs2000. After some research, it appears that Francs2000's sole purpose in his Wikipedia endeavor is to promote homosexuality, and reject ideas that are contrary to what he believes. Every article of his creation that I looked at (about 15) involve actors in a pro-gay television show, homosexual police commanders, types of sexual procedures (cottaging), and even a tremendously insignificant thing such as a "glory hole." A glory hole, evidently, is a device mostly used by homosexual men to engage in sex while maintaining their anonymity Francs2000 began that article, yet he wishes to delete an article describing a logical argument contradicting the genetic probability of homosexuality. It's easy to see what's going on here. This person wants to censor any arguments that do not coincide with his agenda. Wikipedians must realize this and defeat this close-minded behavior. It can lead only to mental prison.

<li>My goal was to admonish the voters on this article that point of view is relative the person who is reading it. The initial proposal for deletion was, in itself, "pushing a POV," which undermines the argument against the article's existence. It's a very challenging proposition, but if you thikn about it for a moment, I trust you will come to the same conclusion. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntellectualprop2002_a89a.html" title="User:Intellectualprop2002">Intellectualprop2002</a> 3 July 2005 20:05 (UTC)

<li>You act as though an NPOV notice is something novel and new on Wikipedia, and we can't possibly understand its implications because we're treading in new waters. This is not the case. NPOV disputes have come up before, and the community is settling them in the prescribed manner. – <a href="../../../m/i/p/User%7EMipadi_1585.html" title="User:Mipadi">Mipadi</a> July 3, 2005 20:23 (U</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's new to me, that's why I admittedly overreacted, initially. However, your initial requests for corrections to produce a neutral article were followed and still you maintained a NPOV warning. For the amount of emotion involved in this issue, it's unlikely that any attempt to document these ideas will be met open minds. The first instinct will be to delete, delete, delete. That is a shame and is the reason why google will remain a better encyclopedia than wikipedia. There is NO censorship on search engines.</li>

<dd>Since many wikipedians have started using a google search to determine if certain articles are legitimate. Google's mission is "to organize the world's information and make it unversally accessible and useful." That says encyclpedia to me, though, I may have been too poetic for your strictly literal mind, UkPaolo. 66.74.196.5 3 July 2005 21:56 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But Google isn't an encyclopedia at all. A collection of information&#160;!= an encyclopedia. Google makes no attempt to verify its information, and it lists plenty of things, such as personal webpages and corporate webpages, that are not encyclopedic. It also makes no attempt to keep points of view out of its information. Finally, the information contained in Google is not written to nearly the same standards as an encyclopedia. Google might attempt to organize information, but not all information belongs in an encyclopedia. A perfect example is the About page on my personal website, which is catalogued by Google, but is hardly something that should be placed in an encyclopedia. – <a href="../../../m/i/p/User%7EMipadi_1585.html" title="User:Mipadi">Mipadi</a> July 3, 2005 23:35 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You will learn (probably later than sooner) that all information is a point of view. You cannot get away from bias in information. The best one can hope for is a summary of all the points of view out there. Sure, Google isn't an encyclopedia, by definition, but why do wikipedians use it as a source to legitimize articles? Could it be because it is the closest thing to a summary of all knowledge out there? Again, that says 'encyclopedia' to me, but that's just semantics getting in the way of truth finding. 66.74.196.5 4 July 2005 15:24 (UTC)

<dd>All information may be point-of-view, but no encyclopedia (including this one) would ever wish to incorporate the idiosyncratic views of every person. You hold this theory, and doubtless find its logic compelling. We have no evidence that anyone else does. Surely, other people do support various anti-gay "theories," might have formed similar notions, and might agree with you -- even they, though, probably couldn't claim to have heard of this specific "Either-Or" theory prior to meeting you. Evidence suggests this particular formulation is yours alone; and, as such, it doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 6 July 2005 05:40 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Summary</b> This is a farce. Justice is being flogged on this website. A band of wikipedians (most of which constantly contribute to pro-gay articles with their POV), yet won't allow a separate article explaining a logical theory in a neutral tone contesting the natural (as opposed to cultural) existence of their beloved behavior. It appears that I have no chance in opening minds on this subject, but I am better for it, while this website and the little band of deleters above IS WORSE OFF for it. They will continue to wallow in their ignorant misery, while the rest of us continue to search for the truth, not a medical "mainstream", google-proved, politically correct shade of the truth.

<li>The criteria for deletion generally point to the question of whether an article on the topic in question is <i>inherently</i> unencyclopedic, irrespective of content. A vanity page, for example, may never be encyclopedic even if the author manages to include 20 page of information about every detail of his life. A one-line article on a federal appellate judge (of which we have had a few), on the other hand, should clearly be kept because the topic is notable, and there is indeed potential for expansion. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> July 2, 2005 20:30 (UTC)</li>

<li>We shouldn't delete short, valid articles about topics wikipedia needs to cover, whether they are villages or everyday objects. Vanity articles and hoaxes do not fit that description.

<li>The article in its current form is by no means encyclopedic. Numbered, two sentence fragments, short and choppy. Dicdef. Also, I do not believe the notion of adding "history" and "construction" information is valid either.

There is some good information there that shouldn't be trashed because of editorial weaknesses. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 4 July 2005 02:35 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm curious which portions of this article editors find too POV. I think it's fairly neutral. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 4 July 2005 05:17 (UTC)

<li>I agree. Of course, POV-ness on its own is not a reason to delete anyway. <a href="../../../j/g/m/User%7EJgm_096b.html" title="User:Jgm">Jgm</a> 6 July 2005 22:20 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If he really is anything like one of the top ten jazz critics, as claimed, he's definitely notable. Surely we have server space for ten contemporary jazz critics on Wikipedia.

<li><b><s>Keep</s></b>, expand. Different from <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_anesthetic.html" title="Local anesthetic">Local anaesthesia</a>, and if that is a valid topic then this should be also, with cross-reference links both ways.

<dd>Back to <b>Keep</b>, with restructuring. Looking for definitions makes me think that local anaesthesia is a subset of regional anaesthesia. Therefore, I suggest that the material in <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_anaesthesia.html" title="Local anaesthesia">Local anaesthesia</a> be moved to <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regional_anaesthesia.html" title="Regional anaesthesia">Regional anaesthesia</a> and a redirect created from the local anaesthesia article. But, first, we must ask the age-old question - <i>Is there a Doctor in the house?</i>. --<a href="../../../w/c/f/User%7EWCFrancis_461e.html" title="User:WCFrancis">WCFrancis</a> 4 July 2005 09:35 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> Had I done some research before posting here, I would probably not have posted as VfD. Acccording to <a href="http://www.oyston.com/anaes/local.html#1.1|Dr" class="external text" title="http://www.oyston.com/anaes/local.html#1.1|Dr" rel="nofollow">Oysten's</a> website, local anaesthesia is indeed a subset of regional anaesthesia and so <a href="../../../w/c/f/User%7EWCFrancis_461e.html" title="User:WCFrancis">User:WCFrancis</a>; you are correct. However, as Dr Oysten states, ".... many people use the phrase (local anaesthesia) loosely to include regional anaesthesia". That begs the question, if "Local" is more commonly used to refer to the medically correct term "Regional", and I would hazard a guess that "more commonly" should be read as "almost universally", then should "Local" be the main entry? I note also that the original "Regional" article spells anaethesia without the second 'A'. I have no idea if this is American spelling or a typo. So, I am giving up with this VfD and copying this whole section to the two discussion pages - "Regional" and "Local" in the hope that a medical person and/or a person better versed in Wiki procedures can clean up the issue. <a href="../../../l/-/b/User%7EL-Bit_18c9.html" title="User:L-Bit">L-Bit</a> 01:11, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
