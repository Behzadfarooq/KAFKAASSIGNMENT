<li>Although I recognize that such a list can be problematic, I don't see it as a delete per se. Here's why:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>There are a significant number of people for whom an ongoing debate about their sexuality is a pretty central part of understanding their historical and cultural context. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, for example, wrote a large number of love sonnets addressed to other males; it's <i>impossible</i> to understand his context without at <i>least</i> acknowledging that an unresolved debate about the deeper meaning of that fact <i>exists</i>.</li>
<li>There are even a significant number of people (e.g. <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrissey.html" title="Morrissey">Morrissey</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Manson_e590.html" title="Marilyn Manson">Marilyn Manson</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a>) who've <i>deliberately</i> cultivated a sense of sexual ambiguity as part of their marketing strategy. In Morrissey's case, particularly, the debate isn't just a part of his cultural context as with Shakespeare — to a very large extent, that sexual ambiguity <i>is</i> the cultural context of his work, and divorcing him from that context would be entirely wrong. (And yes, Bowie later recanted and therefore shouldn't be listed as "debated", but that doesn't change the fact that an ambiguous sexual presentation was part of his public persona at one time.)</li>
<li>It is not original research to report on the existence of a debate that's already been placed in the public sphere by other people outside of Wikipedia, so characterizing this as OR is a misrepresentation.</li>
<li>Deleting this list actually increases the likelihood of people being inappropriately added to the "confirmed" lists. We <i>already</i> have an ongoing problem with people being listed as confirmed GLBT based on circumstantial evidence, even <i>with</i> this list available — without this list that problem will become even more uncontrollable.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>My bottom line, basically, is that I don't see why this needs to be held to different standards than the confirmed list: names listed should provide some support, either in the article itself or through listed sources, that a debate about the person's sexual orientation legitimately exists in the public sphere, and otherwise a name shouldn't be listed at all. If that standard is properly met, however, I don't see why this can't be a <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:14, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>FWIW, I definitely see Bearcat's point. In the examples he names, there's something notable about their sexuality being "debated". There are a couple reasons this doesn't quite persuade me to change my vote though:
<ol>
<li>Given that just <i>what</i> is notable in each debate varies widely, do we really lose anything in having these discussions only in the subject articles? I definitely think it's worth mentioning that <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a> said he was bisexual in the 1970s, but said he was straight in the 1990s (and it's not hard to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> on this fact). If the list had meaningful annotations about exactly what the nature of the "debate" is in each case, I might be more sympathetic; but it doesn't, and I'm not up to the huge effort of making it so personally.</li>
<li>The quality of the list as it stands is absolutely terrible. Names are added almost at random, or on "a friend-of-a-friend told me" basis. Not to say that some of the same problem hasn't applied to the "confirmed" lists; but we've made a good start at improving the quality of those others (and cites are more straightforward: e.g. the person really said something to so-and-so newspaper). But this "debated" one seems even more gossipy, and more or less certain to stay there if it is kept. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 23:21, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
