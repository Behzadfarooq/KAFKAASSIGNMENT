<p><b>Delete</b> - trivial beyond belief. That Stan Lee or some other editor or whoever called someon by an adjectival name once or frequently is a ridiculous criterion for a list. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete —</b> Otto's right - this one is incredibly trivial. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilippe_dffa.html" title="User:Philippe">Philippe Beaudette</a> 03:58, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - One can't dismiss the context. These endearments were part of the direct reason that Marvel went from a minor upstart with eight titles a month to a pop-culture conglomerate. It wasn't just the quality of the stores -- lots of critically acclaimed comics, movies, TV shows, etc. never find success -- but from the deliberately familial sense that these endearments created. Aside from the importance as an historical marketing tool, many (such as "Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man") have entered the popular lexicon. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 04:56, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Trivial. Tenebrae's argument would best apply to an article on the usage of the nicknames, provided sources discussing the phenomenom could be found. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxamegalon2000_b578.html" title="User:Maxamegalon2000">Maxamegalon2000</a> 05:06, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b> If all of these are by Stan Lee (and so far as I know they are), then <b>merge</b> to his article, or <b>rename</b> to make it clear that we're talking about his practices, not Marvel's per se, even if they have adopted them. I'd say that would be a reason to cover the practice in his article, since influencing a major comic book publisher is a notable act in itself. I don't know if somebody has covered this in any Stan Lee biographies off-hand, but it certainly seems possible. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I can see how this has some value. But that value is geared more towards an encyclopedia covering either comic books or marvel specifically. In a general use encyclopedia it seems out of place. Also, looking at the guide lines for the creator articles (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) and character article (<a href="../../../c/m/c/WP%7ECMC_eb00.html" title="WP:CMC">WP:CMC</a>) it seems the inclusion of "nicknames" is frowned on in those places. Since that is where you would normally expect to find this stuff, this list begins to look very out of place.<br />
(<i>Note:</i> the character nicknames were not limited to use in the editorial texts, they permeate the scripted dialogues through out the comics in question. I'm surprised that Hulk's terms for other characters didn't make the list.) — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 05:42, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> You need to know the context. These are a bigger piece of comics history than people who haven't read as many comics might realize. I'm not sure "endearments" is the best term for these nicknames, but these expressions played a surprisingly important role in distinguishing Marvel Comics from its rivals back then. And to address Manticore's question, no, these do not all come from Stan. Often they were originated by Roy Thomas and other writers and editors of the time. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 05:42, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Comment</b></s> <b>Delete and Merge</b> All the points given above are correct as these endearments played an important role in recognizing these important comicbook people. But question is, do we need a separate endearment article? or couldnt we just <b>merge</b> these endearments to their respective owners? PS: i suggest that they be included in their infoboxes <a href="../../../b/l/o/User_talk%7EBloodpack_3533.html" title="User talk:Bloodpack"><span style="color:#fff;background:#800">†B<span style="background:#a00">lo<span style="background:#c00">o<span style="background:#d00">d</span>p</span>ac</span>k†</span></a> 05:49, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That <i>may</i> work for the real people under "Psuedonames", but I still believe that is not wholly in line the Biographies guides. The characters though is a non-starter. There is a strong sentiment in the Comics project <i>not</i> to have these types of nicknames in the 'box. — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 05:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think I already know why and its probably the <i>same</i> reason it shouldnt have an article about endearments. If it cant be included in infoboxes, then the more of it if it has an article (endearments). As for the real people, yes, lets just include that in their bio <a href="../../../b/l/o/User_talk%7EBloodpack_3533.html" title="User talk:Bloodpack"><span style="color:#fff;background:#800">†B<span style="background:#a00">lo<span style="background:#c00">o<span style="background:#d00">d</span>p</span>ac</span>k†</span></a> 06:02, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, no sources for the central thesis that use of these nicknames is somehow important to Marvel's success.

<li><b>Keep</b> - One could also make a DC version of this page (though it'd likely be shorter). Just for Superman we have such names as: The big red S, The big blue boyscout, the man of steel, the man of tomorrow, the last son of krypton, etc. Then Batman: The Dark Knight, The Dark night detective, The caped crusader, etc. (And not forgetting the boy wonder, of course). How about Capt. Marvel as the Big red cheese? Or the Phantom as the ghost who walks? I think that a list of such names is a great way to be able to look them over as a group. And marvel (through Stan Lee) <i>did</i> have a "way with words" when it came to describing the characters. I do agree with the poster above though that I wouldn't mind a rename if we could come up with something better than "endearments". - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 09:22, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete Or at Least Tweak</b> we could change the page around to just explain what it is, and add a spot to the superhero box for endearments with a link to this page to explain what it is.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> -- really, these nicknames don't need an article of their own: It would be pretty easy to incorporate them into the superhero info box, and mention the creator's names in their relevant articles. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPat_Payne_b797.html" title="User:Pat Payne">Pat Payne</a> 19:16, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Move.</b> I'll grant that maybe the list doesn't deserve its own article, but it should be incorporated into another article. As for the importance of the endearments in boosting Marvel's popularity...I can't remember the actual title (so this isn't really much of a reference), but there was a coffee-table book on the history of Marvel up to about 1990 (I think it was released in 1991, as it was the 30th anniversary of the beginning of the Silver Age) and the author mentioned at one point about how personalising the Marvel bullpen endeared the staff to readers, and by implication, this increased the company's popularity.The Drainpipe 00:02, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Move</b> The above editor is thinking of <i>Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics</i>, by Les Daniels (Harry N. Abrams, New York, 1991) <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-8109-3821-9</a>, which does, indeed, write about the catchphrases and endearments being part of "Marvelmania". "Origins of Marvel Comics" by Stan Lee (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1975) <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-7851-0579-4</a>, and <i>Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution</i> by Ronin Ro (Bloomsbury, 2004) <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-58234-345-4</a> also talk about it. I'm thinking the article might be more appropriate as a section with Marvel Comics. And given the pop-cultural weight, this information is at least as significant as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_rabbis.html" title="List of fictional rabbis">List of fictional rabbis</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_Alias_88fc.html" title="List of characters from Alias">List of characters from Alias</a>.... --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 02:37, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Regardless of what else you argue, please don't argue that an article should be kept because some other article exists. Articles stand and fall on their own and the existence of one article has nothing to do with whether another article should exist. As far as the references go, they don't establish the necessity of a separate list article for the endearments themselves. The existence of the endearments may itself be somewhat notable but, again, a listing of every single time that an alliterative word got attached to someone's name in a comic is not. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 13:02, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> <b>Delete and Merge</b> (though not in that order) While the information is useful, a list page is not. This is all information that belongs on the page for the character, the page for the creator (stan lee), OR possibly as a mention on the Marvel Universe page, wherein one can say 'Certain endearments and nicknames have permeated the Marvel universe.

<li><b>Keep and merge</b> - Normally I might say it needs to go, but these can be cited and put into context by being added to the Marvel Comics article as part of a style section. These are part of how Marvel defined itself in the 1960s, along with Stan's Soapbox and the interaction of the Marvel Bullpen with the fans and characters. It's actually a pretty important detail to Marvel Comics; it just needs to be put into context, which can be done. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:black">☓</span></a></big>) 13:38, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The present text, title, (I brought its preciousness and vagueness up on the article's discussion page a while back), and treatment of the article is embarrassing, but the topic itself seems valid. The article attempts to describe part of a popular and distinctive literary style. Stan Lee the stylist has been appreciated, loved, imitated, disliked and mocked by writers, editors and readers for decades. If he's important in his sphere as a stylist, then that style should be relevant. In hindsight I regret exerting so little effort to improve some of the article's obvious defects: for example the article's current 'Cultural influence' section contains a sub trivial example. --AC 08:03, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
