<p>This article seems to be about the historical opinions of one lecturer. "Desmond Fernandes" isn't a major historian, and the article treats what he says as consensus. It is my opinion that this article (whose title misleads as to the consensus around this issue) will never be able to avoid being either a soapbox or a PoV-fork, and is in any case a non-notable term for the event. I know this doesn't mean much, but searching for the "Kurdish Genocide" on google gives 50k links (compared to about 1 million for "armenian genocide" and a whopping 40 million for "Holocaust"), nearly all of which talk about Saddam's, not this. The accepted content (i.e. people died and it wasn't by accident) is already in the relevant articles. Otherwise, take your pick between <b>deleting</b>, <b>merging</b>, <b>redirecting</b> and <b>keeping</b> the article... <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 15:14, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Added several references. There is a wealth of published material on this topic, and the article can be further improved beyond the comments of one lecturer. The topic is very important: <i>Turkey genocide Kurd</i> gets 24 articles in the New York Times alone, and I see 21 more in Proquest. Naturally some say the actions arre genocide and others say they are justified. The article should perhaps be retitled Alleged Kurdish genocide (Turkey) since the other side says the villages were bombed to get rid of guerillas. Deleting it because the Holocaust get more Google hits does not make a lot of sense. Any genocide is notable, and the stats might reflect the relative paucity of Kurds with blogs. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:51, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is an excellent point.<br />
In WW2 some say the German bombing of London and Allied bombing of Berlin were justified. I'd be uncomfortable calling it "genocide" because some don't feel it was justified.<br />
The United States assimilates (naturalizes) any immigrant. They too 'genocide' Kurds and others as they immigrate. I'd be uncomfortable renaming the US naturalization process as a genocide.<br />
The original source is the 'Armenian Forum'. I do not see it as a neutral source. Article talks about a 'violent repression of any Kurdish resistance'. That <i>Kurdish resistance</i> is considered as terrorist attacks by the NATO and EU nations as well as others.

<li>I meant if you was to do a research on people's experiences who lived in Anatolia they'll be more than happy to tell you their stories and academics who do the research and became the "reliable sources" do not do much more work then what I've mentioned; but of course "any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source". I know such research hasn't been done but the results are obvious to me because I've interviewed many people in many Kurdish communities on the same matter for various projects and non of them contradicted the issue so I didn't hesitate to say it in my previous post.

<p>There seems to be a confusion as to the meaning of the word genocide. Take for example, the German occupation of France. Lots of French people were killed. A few were guerillas, but most were not. Entire villages were burnt to the ground. Torture was common. But this <b>was not</b> genocide. There's a difference between brutal repression and genocide, and from what I've read in the various links provided and googled, the consensus on this is that it was the former, not the latter. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 08:17, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

All articles start from a specific POV and end to NPOV with the intervention of other editors. Deleting it is wrong, as the particular POV is adequately sourced. We should expand it and then seek if we need to rename it. One side's POV in this cannot be punished for the lack of work from the other side (attributed IMO to the concern that it would <i>legitimize</i> the article). As the article stands now, content is verifiable and title is correct. I would definitely like to see those points regarding <i>terrorist attacks</i> etc, sourced and included in the article.

<dd>NikoSilver, the artile itself is a pov-fork. The title is the least of the worries.

<dd>Thanks yandman for clearing that out. As I said, I'd like to see the scholars/countries/groups/organizations etc and their arguments that contest it.

<dd>Niko, you cannot contest something which is an extreme pov. We cant create a fictitous debate on whether Kurds suffered genocide in Turkey when there is no such debate. You employed the same argument on the Pontian greek "genocide" article, it has the convenience of confirming the extreme pov as 'unchallenged' when in fact it so minority that there exists few people to counter such claims. The problem is the claim still lacks authoratitave and verifiable sources. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 12:29, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Alf, <i>no other view</i> is different than <i>minority view</i>. It is completely legitimate to have a sourced view.

<dd>No, those sources have to be authoratative and verifiable in the first place before you ask for counter-claims. If i created a sourced article on a genocide of Turkish Cypriots, and asked you to show me sources explicity claiming otherwise, would you be able to do this? No you would not, because there is no such academic debate, which in your view, would somehow mean my article is representative of academic consensus. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 13:03, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's not let this turn into yet another regional argument. As an academic view, it should be presented. I'm just not sure that it merits an entire article. The previous gSearch was flawed, as it gave mainly links to Iraq. "kurdish genocide in turkey" gives 47 hits, all of which are dodgy (either "Desmond Fernandes" or "cultural genocide" allegations or Kurdish sources). I'd say that a redirect and a paragraph in "Human Rights abuses in Turkey" is enough, but then again maybe this academic view has more proponents than my (admittedly crude) research has shown. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 13:21, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, if you want a good Google search, try this one <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=el&amp;q=%22Genocide+of+Kurds+in+Turkey%22&amp;btnG=%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7&amp;lr=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=el&amp;q=%22Genocide+of+Kurds+in+Turkey%22&amp;btnG=%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<li><b>Hesitant keep to neutral</b>. 'Hesitant' because more information is needed. 'Keep' because for over 20 years there has been constant criticism in the media about the fate of the Kurds in Turkey. There are reports that over 3,000(!) villages have been emptied, of armed campaigns by the Turkish army, pictures of Kurdish refugees fleeing, cross-border attacks against refugee camps in Iraq, etc. 'Neutral' because the term genocide seems to be evolving; also, because there seems to be a cross-over between understandable Kurdish resistance and outright Kurdish terrorism (against innocent Turks and tourists) that has to be rooted out.

<li>Just to add a few notes. Baristarim there are some references on this issue, some which are already in the article, some which are not and are waiting to be added and for you to note that no huge research has been done mainly because of the corruption of Turkey's higher education system. You say there's millions of Kurds still living in the Turkey, as if how could this be, after a genocide; well look at Germany there's still millions of Jewish people living there after the Holocaust. I also find it ignorant for you to mention some voters ethnicities and say that it reflects their opinion on the matter. Please let's remember Wikipedia does rely on realible sources and books but we write those books and it's time to understand that this issue has been restricted long enough, let's be open about it. <a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgurgerilla_c1aa.html" title="User:Ozgurgerilla">Ozgur Gerilla</a> 01:54, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ozgur, of course I will mention the ethnicities, since it seems to me quite interesting that ten Greek editors turned up here, in the AfD of a page created two days ago, in the space of a couple of hours. It doesn't write "Stupid" on my head, if I didn't mention it, then I would be really ignorant as you claimed. And you are wrong again Ozgur, there are not millions of Jewish people living in Germany after the Holocaust!!! Are you OUT OF YOUR MIND? Did you just take that number out of the air or do actual research on this? And your claims about the lack of research is completely off the charts. Where were the Europeans? They could have done research.. Half the article is a POV FORK of Human rights in Turkey in any case. You are confusing the meaning of genocide with something else. Turkification does not imply genocide, I am afraid. Ozgur, you are living in a completely dream world! What genocide? Do you even know what that word means?

<li>Baristarim, if we was to decide these things depending on peoples ethnicities then we couldn't decide anything because we will be stereotyping; which means that we nor the greek nor the turks nor kurds could give an opinion on this matter. You're complaining about the amount of greeks voting for an article considered for deletion which is completely not logical when we think about the amount of turks that have voted here, how about them? is the turksish opinions always right ha? is this what you're going to say next? Check on your sources again there's millions of jews in germany and EU. Of course we aren't a forum but we are here to discuss matters and decide and stop accusing me of not knowing the meaning of words please. I'm here to do research and put some useful information backed with reliable sources on an issue that has, in my opinion, happend, with many Kurds backing it. You have your opinions I have mine, here's the arena, let's prove it with academic sources if we can't, don't be angry and sad about it we'll be here in one month. <a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgurgerilla_c1aa.html" title="User:Ozgurgerilla">Ozgur Gerilla</a> 02:35, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

There are not millions of Jews in Germany, that is FALSE. You don't seem to have an adequate grasp of the subject matter, therefore I see no reason to continue my debate with you. This is not about our opiniong my dear fellow.

<li>Ozgur, I agree with Baris. The turkish editors vote here because Turkey is a side in this genocide allegations, therefore they are voting for it. It is probable that Turkish writers have a better understanding of the issue. For you, due to your ethnicity, you are also at a side and you have a greater knowledge on the issue, therefore you vote in this discussion. Greek writers are not directly related with the topic, but interestingly numerous editors from Greece vote here. I do not want to conspire on the issue, both Baris and me might be wrong, but the ethnicity of the voters seem funny to me. <a href="../../../c/a/g/User%7ECaglarkoca_4bc9.html" title="User:Caglarkoca">Caglarkoca</a> 03:21, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Despicable tactics and <i>votestacking</i> by the "so-called" "pseudo"-members of the cooperation board</b></p>
<p>I am not stupid, neither are other people. I know exactly what went down with the article that Dirak created, and most importantly, also know why it was created. It was created two days ago, it was AfDed by an Englishman, with even a Swiss editor voting for delete, and BOUM <b>ten Greek editors show out of nowhere one after another and vote keep</b>. There is no way that so many Greek editors would be aware of that page since it was created only three days ago. <b>That's not possible.</b> This is <b>despicable</b>. I would kindly request that all those editors strike their names out of the cooperation board participants list. There is no need for editors who engage in such charades for such blatant attempts at disruption of Wikipedia to use that board as a smokescreen. That's not why it exists. It is not the roll call of every Greek and Turkish editor on Wikipedia, it was created for a purpose. I am sure that those with self-respect and dignity will heed my call. What is even more disturbing is the reason for the creation of the article in question. It is blatantly obvious: The debate in the PGG article has been heating up for the last week after a two month sleeping period and BOUM this article comes. Real class. We are not at a carpet store: if there are those who envy carpet-selling techniques, they can open a carpet store.

<dd>Well, I was not referring to anyone in particular. I cannot change your opinions, but if a simiar thing had happenned with Turkish editors, ie if a Turkish had created a Albanian genocide article, then ten Turkish editors who had signed up to the coop board jumped in (some who had not even edited since November 11 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kalogeropoulos" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kalogeropoulos" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, then I am sure that you would have felt the same way. Especially, if the article in question was created per WP:POINT because of a dispute in another turco-greek page. Of course you have the right to browse any page you want in Wiki, but it might be nice if you explained how you actually learned of this AfD. I really would like to know what you would have felt if the situation was inversed between Greeks and Turks. Have any Turkish coop board members created an Albanian genocide article, emailed each other and all showed up in the space of ten hours to vote keep? Are you honestly telling me that there isn't anything fishy? How did all those users learn of this so quickly? Personally, I was contacted by a non-Turk over this after ten Greek editors suddenly showed up and voted keep. This user emailed me because I was at the coop board and also because he thought that there was something "extremely fishy" going on (his words). <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 09:51, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could <b>everyone</b> calm down, please? The main argument here seems to be that most people think that the content of the article is important and needs to be discussed. Well, to be honest, the main argument seems to be about Greco-Turkish relations, but let's pretend it's not, mmmmokay?

I think this article deserves a seperate article, since the human rights status of Kurds in Turkey is a major issue towards Turkey's accession in EU. The current article we discuss could be renamed as I propose and expanded, inlcluding the 3 bullets above I mentioned. The section <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Turkey_da3b.html#Kurdish_people" title="Human rights in Turkey">Human_rights_in_Turkey#Kurdish_people</a> could link to this article like that:Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey.

<dd>No, half the article already falls into the scope of the Human rights in Turkey, and such allegations of genocide etc are <i>always</i> talked about in the human rights sections of countries. "History of human rights abuses also falls into the scope of that article. Human Rights in Turkey article is not even a "long" article, you cannot expect another article to be created that incorporates two paragraphs of a Spanish guy's thesis. As for the current status of Kurds in Turkey, there is an article at Kurds in Turkey. Huamn rights of Kurds is not a major issue in TR-EU accession, have you been following the subject closely? There are already four articles: HR in TR, Kurds in Turkey, Turkish Kurdistan, Casualties of the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, why do we need a fifth article except for POV:FORK? Are these articles filled to the brim already? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 10:09, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, my friend. It is a major issue for EU and for Wikipedia, unless you close your eyes to the violent manifestations in Turkish Kurdistan concerning the human rights violations of the local population, the manifestations against Erdogan, the incident in the local police station involving the current chief of staff of the Turkish armed forces, the restrictions concerning the use of Kurdish language in Turkey. These issues definitely deserve a seperate article, including also:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The history of violations of their human rights.</li>
<li>The alleged genocide.</li>

<dd>There is no need to mention every single event, Wiki is not a newspaper. Can I add all sorts of incidents to the HR in GR article? EU doesn't care at all about the situation of Kurds in Turkey, you should check that again per realpolitik. The restrictions on teaching another language as a first language other than the official one is also banned in many EU countries, and the HR in TR article also covers this issue, and I was the only one who actually dug up the references and rewrote the section, btw. There is no need to move it to somewhere else, since it is only two concise paragraphs to begin with. There is no such official thing as Turkish Kurdistan, so cut down on the political overtones. There are already four articles that relate to this, what is the fifth one for? The other articles are not even half-Long. If you were so interested in this, then why am I am the only one practically to have edited the HR in TR article in the last two months? I have <b>never</b> seen any of the voters above to have actually matched their statements of "i think this is important!" with any sort of act on the ground, so why should I believe that this is not just an attempt to create a bastard POV fork that will lay there for ages right after the AfD has closed? Am I wrong? There is no such thing as alleged genocide. Does the article Cyprus include "Turkish cypriot genocide allegations"? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 10:27, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Only an editor of an article has the right to be interested in it? Of course not! The fact that there is a section somewhere else does not mean that we cannot add another article providing further analysis. You argument does not outdo notability. And, in order to prove my interest in this topic, I can be the one who will create this article. And, say if I'm wrong, but the problem with the Turkish language is not just teaching, but also use of language in public places.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 10:40, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>?Again, an insufficient grasp of the subject matter: what public places? on what are you basing this? There are tons of music stores in Turkey that sell Kurdish music, in Istanbul there are many people who speak Kurdish in cafés or in the streets! Are you joking? It seems that none of the keep voters are not even sure what the subject matter is! Ozgur, for example, tried to prove that this was a genocide by saying "there were millions of Jews in Germany after Holocaust!!" (twice), to counter what I said about there being millions of Kurds in Turkey! That statement was utterly false, the same way with the relation of "public places" in languages. The notions are so confused, I might as well be arguing that Pyramids were built by Martians. I suggest to follow Yandman's version: the relevant text of this article has already been incorporated into HR in TR, let's redirect this to that article. <b>However</b>, keep in mind that the inclusion of genocide thesis in any article will be carefully scrutnised by WP:V, WP:POV and WP:OR <i>no matter what</i> zombie article it goes into. In any case, this won't be a healthy discussion if people who are participating will not reveal how they came across this AfD.

<dd>From <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurds.html" title="Kurds">Kurds</a>:"Until 1991, the use of the Kurdish language — although widespread — was illegal. As a result of reforms inspired by the EU, music, radio and television broadcasts in Kurdish are now allowed albeit with severe time restrictions (for example, radio broadcasts can be no longer than sixty minutes per day nor constitute more than five hours per week while television broadcasts are subject to even greater restrictions)." Do you understand now what I mean? Can the Kurds create a channel broadcasting 24 hours a day in Kurdish? Can they form a party advocating autonomy in Turkish Kurdistan? Are the Kurds <b>officially</b> recognized by the Turkish governent as a seperate nation and a minority? I do now what I'm speaking about. And I do now that a judge who tried to reveal the truth in the "fiasco" in the police station in Kurdistan is no more a judge.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 13:06, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

I am in law, and I know the jurisprudence <i>very well</i>. If you are asking such a question, how can you come and participate in this debate by making such large claims as "genocide", "abuses" etc!!!!!! What the hell do some people think Turkey is??!! Is this A JOKE? The only thing you can be prosecuted is for <i>actively</i> (physically) supporting PKK et al. That is normal since it is recognised as TERRORIST, and such prosecutions have also happenned in Turkey. STOP! If the keep voters in this AfD are asking such basic questions, how can their comments even be considered as serious?! First it was Ozgur who tried to prove that this was genocide by saying "There were millions of Jews in Germany after the Holocaust" and now this? Are there any arguments out there that come this close being serious?! Yannismorou, if you do not know the answer to this, why are you asking this after voting? Why haven't you asked this to me before the vote? I could have easily told this you! How would you like it if I asked you "would I get prosecuted in Greece for saying "I am an Albanian - not a Greek""? as if Greece was some sort of Talebanic shithole. Please tell me, how would you have felt? Particulary after I had volunteered to write the "Human rights of Albanians in Greece" article!

<dd>I'm not joking at all. After all, I'm also a jurist. If you are right, then on what grounds was Pamuk prosecuted? And all these Kurdish members of the Parliament, who lost in the past their seats and were put in jail? And what is the nature of the crime of "seperatism", based on which many many human rights fighters and Kurds proud for their national identity have been persecuted (and not just prosecuted). And you still don't answer the other issues I mentioned, especially the freedom of use of the Kurdish language.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 14:52, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To prevent a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>, it's absolutely sensible to include this in another article that already deals with these subjects, such as <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Turkey_da3b.html#Kurdish_people" title="Human rights in Turkey">Human_rights_in_Turkey#Kurdish_people</a> or <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurds_in_Turkey_c5e2.html" title="Kurds in Turkey">Kurds in Turkey</a>.

The resistance should not be restricted to PKK. This prevents the discussion of the problems of Kurds in Turkey on neutral grounds. This kind of genocide allegations just causes provocations.

<dd><b>Comment</b> For those who are interested, I also included above how some "so-called" "pseudo" members of the Greek and Turkish Wikipedians cooperation board <b>deliberately attempted to disrupt Wikipedia by creating such grave articles per WP:POINT and engaging in blatant votestacking campaigns that led to ten Greek users voting in this AfD in the space of ten hours. An AfD for an article that was only created <i>three days ago.</i> ALL THE KEEP VOTES HAVE COME FROM THESE USERS, WHEREAS MULTIPLE ADMINS, ALONG WITH MANY NON-TURK EDITORS HAVE VOTED FOR A CLEAR DELETE.</b> This <i>despicable</i> campaign included bringing back a Greek user who hasn't edited for 1.5 months. If some people have some fantasies that they actually want that there was a genocide inflicted upon the Kurds, this is not the right forum. I will definitely file a report at ANI. <b>This article was created per WP:POINT because of disputes in a similar article</b>. This is unacceptable behaviour. None of these users have explained how they ran into this AfD at the same time. As I have said, if some people cannot fulfill the criteria required for the coop board membership, then they SHOULD REMOVE THEIR NAMES. Nikos's response to my question as to where he heard of this is simply making a mockery of Wikipedia. I am sorry folks but this failed coup attempt (no pun intended) is not going to succeed. Won't these users be warned to cease playing with this AfD? Have they been warned at all? There is no rational explanation as to how a Greek editor came back from a sleep of 1.5 months to vote in this AfD, along with the fact that so many Greek users all voted at the same time, out of <i>nowhere</i>. <i>This attempt to portray a whole nation as genociders is simply racist, if any Turkish users tried to do this for some other country, blocks and ArbComs would be flying off the bat.</i> <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 14:31, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> It is becoming easier and easier to attach the <b>legal term</b> genocide next to every ethnic group who has beef with Turks. Armenian, Assyrian, Kurdish, Pontic Greek Genocides, I've heard Bulgarians claim genocide by Turks, I am sure Serbian and Ionian Greeks will folow. These accusations and misuage of "genocide" is becoming harder and harder to take seriously. Of course it finds support from the Greeks -who in my opinion are better off dealing with their own minority problems: Albanians, Macedonians and Turks who they call Muslims- and from other interest groups and those who have little knowledge concerning the subject and its depth yet like to be the <b>good guy</b>. You may not like what I am saying but I sure am behind what I wrote and believe in its truth.--<a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktor_Gonzo_bed0.html" title="User:Doktor Gonzo">Doktor Gonzo</a> 14:29, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK. This is an AfD, not an RfC. I've moved the page to <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey_a9ca.html" title="Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey">Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey</a>, mixed it with some of the content taken from <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Turkey_da3b.html#Kurdish_people" title="Human rights in Turkey">Human_rights_in_Turkey#Kurdish_people</a>, and made it clear that only one academic believes it's a genocide. However, this article as it stands is still absolutely awful, and I hope that all those who have participated so virulently in this discussion will help bring it up to standard, lest one think they were just engaged in petty nationalistic disputes. I'd suggest continuing the discussion on the relevant talk page.

<dd>Well said. The term Genocide is a tricky one and it is probably best that this article should be moved.

<dd>Politis, let's stop it here. You may be right, but there is no reason to continue this discussion here.

<dd>Yeah similar to what's happening when residents of Athens revolted because they didn't want those 'filthy Muslims praying in their neighbourhoods'. You would be surprised at the horror stories Albanians who have lived in Greece have told me. Beating by the police, by the populace which the police doesn't do anything about, racist comments even by grocery shop owners etc. Not to mention the Neo-Nazi groups that regularly beat immigrants up.
