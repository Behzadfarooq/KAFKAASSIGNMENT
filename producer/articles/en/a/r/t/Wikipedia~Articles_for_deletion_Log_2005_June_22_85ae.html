<li>Merge and redirect: Notice that this article has both capital letters. It's an article on one particular paradox. Whether other people waste space or not is not our concern. Med student tutorial pages are also not our concern. The question is whether this particular phrasing is a famous enough term that a person needs an encyclopedia to explain it and will search only by this phrase. I don't see much popularity for this phrase. Therefore, a mention of it in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradox.html" title="Paradox">paradox</a> and in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conditional_probability.html" title="Conditional probability">conditional probability</a> would be sufficient.

<li><a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradox.html" title="Paradox">Paradox</a> has the definition: "an apparently true statement or group of statements that seems to lead to a contradiction or to a situation that defies intuition".

<li>Hmmm, I'm not sure which part of this pseudo-example is paradoxical. First, we should ignore the example in the article since it is incomplete and mathematically wrong. The Smurfs example on your link is (one of) the correct formulation(s) - note it has an additional piece of information. But even in that example, if you improve the true-positive rate from 99% to 99.9% (you improve the test), the chances that the smurf is ill, given that they test positive also goes up (to 20.1%) which is hardly counter-intuituve. If you increase the false-positive rate to say 3% i.e. you make the test worse (with true +ve still 99%), then the chances that the smurf is ill, given that they test positive, fall to 14% — again hardly surprising. If it were a paradox, something would go 'the wrong way'. It is perhaps <i>surprising</i> that a 99% accurate test only picks up 20% of actual cases, but there is nothing <i>paradoxical</i> about it. Perhaps an example on the conditional probability page is in order, but certainly not the malformed one of this article, and certainly not under a 'paradox' heading.-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 13:37, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)

<li>The counterintuitive part is the test has a very low rate of false positives, but a large proportion of the positives are false. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 14:03, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hmmm, perhaps. But the counterintuition only results from a cursory examination of the facts. Seeing as the OED more or less concurs with the def you give above, I suppose this could be loosely termed a paradox but, given the almost complete absence of the terminology in actual usage (including on Google), and the (mathematically correct) page that <a href="../../../c/y/a/User%7ECyan_b70d.html" title="User:Cyan">Cyan</a> found below, I still think this page should be removed.-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 16:28, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: First, this should be a speedy delete candidate for being criterion #1. Second, no notability offered in the article.

<li>That would have to be <b>rewrite</b> instead of <b>cleanup</b>.

<li>Ok, <b>Keep</b> and <b>Rewrite</b> then. You're right that the article as it stands is advertising but the topic is certainly encyclopedic, and deserves an article.

<p>Response: As the author of the article, I do not intend the article to be an advertisement for the forum or an entry in a "web guide.' Rather, I was perusing Wikipedia, and I noticed several entries regarding play-by-post gaming and online roleplaying games. However, there were few entries which described an example of the operating systems behind such a forum. As such, I felt it necessary to describe one such system in some degree of detail, so as to provide a more comprehensive knowledge of the topic.</p>
<p>I have also edited the article to more clearly reflect its intent. I read the entire rulebook before posting the article, too, and I see nothing to disallow articles which enhance the depth and breadth of knowledge on particular subjects. It may be, however, that a better method is just to hyperlink for examples in the external links section, or provide a generic "example" within the context of other articles. If that is the case, feel free to say so.</p>

<p>Response: AllRPG.com is the parent site of Althanas, and due to their usage of sidebars and XHTML, there is a direct link to Althanas every viewable page. "Spiders" that are meant to make Internet searches more thorough and complete have indexed every single page of AllRPG and every page of Althanas (which both have forums), making it seem as though our entry is JUST a web forum. A regular google search shows <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link:www.althanas.com" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=link:www.althanas.com" rel="nofollow">3,840 total links</a>. Google filters out many of the "Spiders," and as you can see, there are many unique inbound links to Althanas. This should prove that Althanas is both a fantasy world and a unique gaming system comparable to existing entries on Wikipedia such as "Play By Post" and "Alleria."</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Losing minor party candidates (and, indeed, major party candidates when they have no chance whatsoever) are not as a rule notable. Articles on the parties are fine, but unless they are a recognisable figure in there own right (e.g. the late Screaming Lord Sutch in the UK) then nothing can really be worth saying about them other than their percentage of the vote, and that is most usefully achieved in an article on the election rather than the candidate. This Tim Smith has certainly had less influence politically than, say, the former Conservative party MP for Beaconsfield in the UK of the same name. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 15:08, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Even if we should have an article on the district (which I agree we should), I disagree with incorporating information about <a href="../../../g/a/d/Gadfly_%28social%29.html" title="Gadfly (social)">gadfly</a> candidates.

It appears that Smith was not on the ballot; therefore, I am changing my vote to <b>Delete</b>.

<ul>
<li>This discussion has been had before. It is trivially easy to get onto ballots in many countries. (In several, it's merely a matter of a monetary deposit and a certain number of people's signatures.) A general principle of allowing biographical articles for people whose sole claim to notability is that they managed to have themselves listed on ballots is an unwise one. <i>Actually winning the election</i>, on the other hand, is a different matter. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:33, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I suggest that a losing candidate is notable by their candidacy alone (as opposed to some wacky thing they said or did) <i>if</i> the number of votes they received has some legal significance (in many districts, a minor-party candidate who gets more than 5% of the vote assures their party an automatic slot on the ballot for the next cycle), <i>or</i> if their presence on the ballot actually influences the outcome of the election (in the sense of <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Nader_6df8.html" title="Ralph Nader">Ralph Nader</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>). --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 03:50, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)</li>
<li>And I still disagree that including federal candidates regardless of ease of candidacy is an unwise principle. For example, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Guthrie_fa8e.html" title="Bruce Guthrie">Bruce Guthrie</a> in WA-2 received 2.5% of the vote in a U.S. House of Representatives election. That's not a huge percentage (and less than the 5% referenced by BD2412 above), but it still means that nearly 8,000 people voted him. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Moore_%28politician%29_d8e1.html" title="Charles Moore (politician)">Charles Moore</a> in WA-1 had 1.75% of the vote, which means almost 6,000 people voted for him. I'm fine with merging them into district articles if really necessary, but we've kept article that I feel have far less notability than federal political candidates. However, I do realize that consensus is (usually - see <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_de_Jardin_71ab.html" title="Alan de Jardin">Alan de Jardin</a> and the related VfD) against me in this and will not create any more articles for losing third-party candidates.

<dd>Geez, what does someone have to do to become "somewhat notable" by your elevated standards to justify a small Wiki article besides being the world's Pro tennis champion several times and beating Bill Tilden from time to time?! Many American sources spell his name Karol. But I've checked, and you're right -- it's Karel. I'll correct it in the article and try to change the redirect or whatever. But if you think the article could be much better, why don't you improve it yourself instead of carping about it? I'm the first person who ever wrote a single word about him and I've got a gazillion other things to do besides listening to complaints about how it could be better.... <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 04:46, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, we often use the "Google Test" to determine the notability of an person. If Google can't find information on a modern-day person, it's likely that their notability is, at the very least, highly questionable. With the pervasiveness of Internet news, it should be simply easy to find links between a person and his claim to notability. If it is difficult, then that rightly invites discussion of whether that person's claim to notability is sufficiently encyclopedic. I would invite you to stay on Wikipedia and improve it - these discussions are part of the ongoing process and if you want your voice heard, make it so. --<a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 17:45, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>Edwinx2 18:43, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC) <b>[NB - This user's only Wiki contributions relate to this vfd]</b> - User's second vote, struck through.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Updated entries to reflect clarification of background info (strike moved from second entry to first).</dd>
</dl>
<p>I feel that I must clarify that I have no previous knowledge of any of the subjects of the article in question; I just found the entry compelling, and created my account to introduce research advocating the inclusion of an interesting, though possibly only of local interest, historical footnote. My decision to wade into public Wiki mediation is based solely on my reaction to the pathos of this poor kid's brief little life-- to survive through all that and affect (indirectly, I suppose it could be argued) major legislation-- only to get killed in a motorcycle accident. It seemed to me that no one was willing to look deeper than what a cursory Google returned, and a potentially important (beginning) of an article was to be dismissed without adequate research consideration.</p>
<p>Apologies for accidentally voting twice; that was not my intent. I suppose I should have read the instructions more thouroughly; I thought noting that the summary provided was an update would be sufficient. I suppose it is not outrageous to assume that I have some personal interest in this issue, based solely on the fact that it is my first foray into wikipedia research advocacy, but, again, the first I heard of any of this was reading through the delete comments on this entry. I don't even know anyone who has been affected by a similar tragedy, nor do I have personal experience with any of the issues involved.</p>
<p>I have no problem with the article being deleted based on the merits of the facts of the story as exposed by research, but I have read no response addressing the four linear links which provide documentary context in the above summary. If the local nature of the story makes it inappropriate, then delete away... I suppose it is not inappropriate to scrutinize the motives of someone who posts emotional pleas or pure opinion in defense of an article. It is, however, inappropriate to ignore clear research in favor of speculation about the motivation and character of the researcher. Edwinx2 01:04, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

This contrasts with other child victims of crimes who were murdered during the initial crime, and hence did not get their name protected as laws were passed "inspired" by their cases (Emily, Amber, etc.). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 2005 June 30 16:10 (UTC)

<dd>Do you <i>really</i> doubt that the <i>Ryan's Laws</i> are named after Hade?! Or are you just being pedantic about an ultra-rigorous <i>proof</i> that it is so? I guess it's <i>conceivable</i> that the newspapers are falling for a hoax, and some different Ryan was the inspiration for the laws rather than this one that died... but pretty darn unlikely. FWIW, I think almost all these laws named after child victims are quite offensive to civil liberties; dead or abused children make for convenient hysteria. But good or bad, the laws (and indirectly, their source vicitims) are <i>notable</i>. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 2005 June 30 17:44 (UTC)

<dd>Pedantic is probably it.&#160;;) Point me to a source that refers to a law as "Ryan's law" and says it's named after Ryan Hade. I saw an article that mentioned a Ryan Mason <a href="http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/news/s/22/22732_ryans_law_to_keep_thugs_locked_up.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/news/s/22/22732_ryans_law_to_keep_thugs_locked_up.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. --<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtacar11_a365.html" title="User:Etacar11">Etacar11</a> 30 June 2005 17:55 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, that UK case is something different (different vicitim and criminal, different decade). I definitely remember hearing about "Ryan's Laws" in a US context, starting around 1990 (i.e. "preventative detention" of "sexual predators"; e.g. semi-judicial w/o reasonable doubt conviction). I also remember reading much more recently about the Manchester murders, which horrifying also, natually. And I guess one of those Manchester victims was named Ryan (I hadn't recalled that until I clicked Etacarl1's link). Despite the common first name (and perhaps similar laws), these are definitely different cases. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 2005 June 30 20:51 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>More on context. While I certainly never knew Hade's name prior to today, the so-called Ryan's Law(s) that came out of Washington state (but were later copied in other states) are well documented. In Washington, this was passed as the "Community Protection Act of 1990." The history, in synopsis:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1989, Governor Gardner established a task force on community protection following a trilogy of events: the murder of a young Seattle woman by an offender on work release; the brutal assault of a young Tacoma boy and the murders of two small boys in Clark County. The task force conducted a series of public hearings across the State to discover what citizens believed were major flaws in our State laws regarding sexual and violent offenders. Following extensive research and study, the task force made three key recommendations: significant increases in offender control and treatment, community prevention and protection services, and victim services. As a result of the task force work, Washington State was the first state in the country to pass a community protection law (the Community Protection Act of 1990). <a href="http://www.doc.wa.gov/CPU/lawenf_index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.doc.wa.gov/CPU/lawenf_index.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a></p>

<dl>
<dd>Now admittedly, you have to put some pieces together to conclude that the recently deceased Hade is the same Ryan. But typically news agencies wind up knowing, but not disclosing, the names of rape victims, and especially of juvenile victims. Rape shield laws typically prohibit disclosing their names prior to their death (or the victim's voluntary statement as to their role). I find it <i>unlikely</i> (but admittedly not inconceivable) that CNN, AP, etc. didn't, in fact, look up their old non-disclosed name for Hade before running his victim status in his obitz. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 2005 June 30 21:19 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is too narrow a article. A Union School District is (?) a type of School District that is unified with greater independence per school. (nominated by User:70.185.179.4)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> in preference to having an article about each school. BTW if the nominator didn't read the article before nominating, then this VfD is invalid. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 15:59, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I moved the original content to Union School District (San Jose).

<li><b>Comment</b> a brief Google search leads me to believe that this phrase means different things in different U.S. states.

<ul>
<li>I think we should just dismbiguate on the name. Individual articles can explain the local significance. For instance, the San Jose district which is the subject of this VfD was called "Union" to express loyalty to the Union army, in 1863. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:58, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. For some reason the VfD notice has become detached from the text which has then been cloned.

<li>I agree, <b>don't move back</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I suppose I should vote since it's the first article I've contributed to be nominated for VfD--what a milestone&#160;:/ .

<li>Why redirect a company name to a generic site on hair extension? Sounds misleading since there is no mention of a specific company (nor should there be) in the article you plan to redirect to. Just because the content is similar does not mean the redirect is a good idea. Beyond that you are redirecting to hair extension when the company may have other products. This could result in confusion for someone looking for combs, hair gel, etc. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 21:34, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>"Monofibre" is <b>not</b> a single product. It is a trademarked name of a line of products. Linking this to hair extensions is misleading. From the Dome website:
<dl>
<dd><i>Select our individual Monofibre Products from the navigation menu on the left</i>.</dd>
<dd>Some of the products in that line:
<ul>
<li><i>Monofibre Collection</i> (razor, colour shade chart, shampoo, conditioner, mist...)</li>
<li><i>Monofibre colour shade chart (in above collection)</i></li>
<li><i>Monofibre Laminate</i></li>
<li><i>Monofibre Window Poster</i></li>
<li><i>Monofibre classic</i></li>
<li><i>Monofibre wave</i></li>
</ul>

<dd>The <b>trademarked</b> Monofibre <b>product line</b> is not a single product and not only a hair extension. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 15:34, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I see nothing of the sort on the Dome Cosmetics website, but I'll take your word for it, given how bad that site is. You'll find that the colour shade chart is a chart telling people what colours the Monofibre hair extensions are available in, and the window poster is a poster that salons can stick on their windows advertising to passers-by the availability of Monofibre hair extensions. You'll also find "Monofibre is the original hair extension product." on the web site given by <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> at the beginning of this discussion. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:42, 2005 Jun 25 (UTC)</li>

<li>Being specific to one company, and being not a word in the dictionary, does not preclude something from being an encyclopaedia article. <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trademark.html" title="Trademark">Trademarks</a> are <i>not supposed</i> to be in dictionaries, and trademark holders vigourously oppose their inclusion in dictionaries. <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photoshop.html" title="Photoshop">Photoshop</a>, <a href="../../../m/c/r/McRib_5c9a.html" title="McRib">McRib</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepsi.html" title="Pepsi">Pepsi</a>, and <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatorade.html" title="Gatorade">Gatorade</a> are trademarks, not dictionary words. So the question is, really, whether <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monofibre.html" title="Monofibre">Monofibre</a> is a product/invention worthy of an individual encyclopaedia article, not whether the word is in a dictionary. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:29, 2005 Jun 22 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No, they are not.</b> "Merge and delete" is perfectly valid, but strongly discouraged because if the edit history is nontrivial it is a lot of work for the acting sysop to merge the histories. But in <i>this</i> case and many others, the edit history is trivial, as the entire content of the article, other than adding VfD notices and so forth, is the result of one edit by one editor. All that needs to be done is to insert the text of the 07:19, 22 Jun 2005 revision before making any changes, make a simple note on the talk page saying that the inserted text was created by 210.86.121.151 on 07:19, 22 Jun 2005, and then making any desired edits, and GFDL is fully satisfied. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:02, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hear, hear.

<ul>
<li>In that case, we need to update the <a href="../../../g/v/f/WP%7EGVFD_9ddb.html#Incompatible_votes" title="WP:GVFD">VfD guide</a>, because the guide seems to indicate that this is an incompatible vote. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 05:04, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I haven't read this guide but really people make "votes" but all we're doing is expressing our opinions.

<li>Note that the actual language used is "should be avoided," not "is prohibited." And in general it should, but there are times when it is reasonable. Note, too, that the <i>rationale</i> is the requirements of the GFDL. Well, the GFDL requires only that the history be preserved.

<p>Sure looks a lot like advertising to me. If the product is notable -- it gets a lot of Google hits, as can be expected from a product of this type, but I have no idea if it's something that deserves an article of its own. As it is, though, this doesn't establish notability or anything else -- like i said, sure looks a lot like advertising to me. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 16:50, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

It mentions a commercial product but that's not unique for Wikipedia. In fact, it references competing products that are also listed in Wikipedia- specifically the '<a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymizer.html" title="Anonymizer">Anonymizer</a>'. If this page comes down, would the <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymizer.html" title="Anonymizer">Anonymizer</a> page come down as well to keep editorial consistency? Why hasn't the <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymizer.html" title="Anonymizer">Anonymizer</a> been deleted previously if mentioning a product is reason for deleting a page? The editorial standard has already been set for this issue, and the mere mention of a product doesn't mean that the page must come down.</p>

<li>That's mis-stating the issue and dangerous ground to tread. The number of people voting is not what is "clogging up VFD", according to those who make that assertion. It is the number of articles <i>to be read and discussed</i> (a natural consequence of the growth in the number of new articles being added). The number of people commenting is not the issue. (Furthermore: If 2 editors were plenty, this would be speedy deletion.) It's dangerous ground to tread to chastise others for adding their opinions because "2 [delete votes] would be plenty" when also making the 3rd vote at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Mark_Kenneth_Matthews_c0b6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Mark Kenneth Matthews">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Mark Kenneth Matthews</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:28, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>2 editors are not always plenty, but they are in obvious cases like this, where no-one's actually going vote keep unless the article is rewritten or new evidence is produced. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 16:35, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If these cases were obvious to 2 editors, we would already have worked out a speedy deletion criterion to cover them, long since, stating the reason that they are obvious. (I happen to think that we are close to working out a speedy deletion criterion that does cover them. There's certainly a hypothetical speedy deletion criterion where <i>this</i> article qualifies, which 2 editors could apply. These cases may become obvious if that hypothetical criterion is accepted. But it hasn't yet even been proposed, and it's a criterion that I suspect is only obvious in hindsight.) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:40, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)</li>

<p>How is this band vanity? It's information about a band that has a meaning and a direction, not just nonsense music. The reason there's nothing in allmusic about Happy Spastics might be because they are Anti-Corporation. Try Googling them. And get your heads out of the clouds and listen to the message they spread, because they're right.</p>

<li>Hi, I was the original creator of this article. I was a personal friend of Michal Golos and went to school with him in the 1960s. I made this page as I thought that other people should know about his unique talent and be able to see some of his work. Some of his cartoons are actually available on the net, though he is rarely credited (Moona Liza is an example). I, however, do not endorse the behaviour of some of the users who have been editing this page (including deleting certain portions of the article). I assure you this is not a hoax. Please feel free to ask any more questions. Regards, Richard.
<ul>
<li><small>(above comment by User:DRonalds)</small></li>
<li>In that case could you please post some links to his cartoons in Net? I tried searching for "Moona Liza", but couldn't find anything relevant. Or any other independently verifiable source, e.g. a reference to Golos in a published encyclopedia of artists, magazine articles, books ... will do. Please see <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> for the standard we try to set for information sources. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, so by definition we should not include information that is unverifiable or about non-notable subject matters. However, if a source that establishes notability can be found, this VfD can be ended quickly. <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> 21:21, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>how is Darren Wogman at all related to this article?, who the hell is barney spiro, i happen to know about Darren Wogman as i was on the board that decided to seacrh for this 'lost' research. due to the fact that many thought he went mad, and immediatly dismissed his work means that there is very little information, i was hoping wikipedia could be an important resource as it is a full document about him, most of his information can be found in a single conveniant place. i though wikipedia was an embracing and inviting place ,obviusly not.

<p>What is the point of this page? Thai immigrants in US are relatively SMALL number compared to other nationals. If you want to talk about In-Chan, then creat a page about them. There is no Thai official record about Mr. He Thien whom the author claimed to be the first student to immigrate from Thailand. The number of Thai immigrants to US that the author provided does not have any reference. If you want to put this page on, you have to do more in-depth with reliable FACTS, not something you guess. And again, what is the point of talking about Thai immigrants in US which are relatively VERY SMALL number compared to other nationals. Dhanakorn 00:00, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I quote: <i>"Vanguards of Serenity is a Community/Clan started by *VaS*Buffy in the Game Star Wars: Jedi Outcast 2 and has moved on to Star Wars: Jedi Academy 3(www.lucasarts.com). The previous name of this community was Vampire Slayers."</i> In other words, vanity/advertising; there may be some gaming clans or communities notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia, but this, I'm afraid, is not one of them. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 12:16, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>How is it vanity/advertising? I removed all links towards it. Also why would some gaming clans or communities be notable and others not? How do you rate that?</p>
<p>I was simply giving out information about this community I don't see the issue with it.</p>
<p>*VaS*Buffy</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I hate to say this, but most gaming clans or communities are not notable. (That is to say, right off the bat I can't think of a single one, but I'm willing to entertain the possibility that some might be for one reason or another -- if, for example, a certain clan or community were to put their heads together and form a company that creates a hit game, that would probably make them notable enough. However, a bunch of people who like to hang out together and play games just aren't anywhere near notable enough. And mind you, I'm not saying that they aren't important to the people involved in them, but they just aren't significant to the rest of the world and thus not suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia. To quote the official Wikipedia policy at <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>: <i>"Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia."</i> -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 12:29, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I just don't get how things like feces is important yet a pretty succesfull community isn't? That is very how would you call it... discriminating? I removed all advertising and all that its plane information about a community now. If you don't agree then edit it until you think it is.</p>
<p>*VaS*Buffy</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, but it <i>is</i> discriminating, absolutely. That's the whole point. I repeat: <i>"Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information."</i> Unless you guys have done something notable, I don't think your group deserves an article... and for the record, I'm not putting you down, because I don't deserve an article either. Most of us don't. It's not what Wikipedia is here for. So, no, I don't agree; that's why it's now up for deletion. And it's not my decision, mind you; there'll be a vote on it here. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 12:46, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Agreed. I vote for deletion. In answer to the question on what would make a guild important enough for Wikipedia, I would say:
<ul>
<li>Signifigance in the real world (e.g. the example above of creating a new game)</li>
<li>Widely influential in the gaming community (e.g. the first guild to codify a set of rules or by-laws that were adopted widely)</li>
<li>Significantly influential over a major title (e.g. the guild that was banned en-masse from EverQuest for cheating, resulting in a PR-overhaul to the SOE customer support procedures and policies)</li>
<li>Does it pass the "will we care in 20 years" test?</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Just wait and see over 20 years when i started my own company for the community. I'm already making 60 dollar a month with it.</p>
<p>Beside an Encyclopedia like this should contain all information of the planet not the onces you think is important to you.</p>
<p>but like i said you just wait and see. *VaS*Buffy</p>
<ul>
<li>Uhh... yeah, sixty dollars a month's a good start. If I were you, I wouldn't give up my day job just yet, but we all gotta start somewhere. I appreciate your position regarding what an encyclopedia like this should contain, but as it happens, that's not compatible with official Wikipedia policy. If you want to change that policy, well, join the debate in the appropriate place. However, for the time being, we'll follow the established policy. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 12:56, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

I dont think it harms anyone... and if its not, why should we delete it? some people might find this useful... u find it insulting? i dont think so.... if somebody will search for it here - it means this info WAS useful (and that is what WP is all about, right?), and if its not useful - nobody will see it anyway, because they wont be interested in this... so just pass on it</p>

Vanguards of Serenity" has a great influence in the Jedi Academy 3 community, I believe this is valid information - not just for the people playing this game, this shows that it is possible to actually earn money by running a game clan, and who knows, maybe in a year or more she'll be able to make a living from those money.</p>

Ok this should stay on Wikipedia cause the information is not harming anyone in any shape or form. I have seen the website and have have noted that this is a growing community. Does anyone gain from deleting this...no. Wikipedia gets more clicks, thats more people coming to this site and possibly giving you guys a donation. You wont be doing yourselves any favours by deleting this. This information is relevant. Your site 'Wikipedia' is all about the gaining of infomation, if you delete this, like I said you wont be helping anyone. The course of information and data has changed regularly and decisivly over the years. Even in this site! this is a quote from Captain Disdain 12:16, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC) "In other words, vanity/advertising; there may be some gaming clans or communities notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia, but this, I'm afraid, is not one of them." This is not vanity my friend, nor advertising. This gaming clan is a 'standalone' in the JK:A community. Nearly everyone who has played the game has heard about *VaS*. Ive spoken to random people in the Jedi Academy community and 95% have heard about *VaS*. This is an outstanding accomplishment by *VaS*Buffy&#160;; to be well known in only two years, to get to a point in the gaming community that is highly respected and accomplished. So all up im voting for this to STAY! --Luke 05:48, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
