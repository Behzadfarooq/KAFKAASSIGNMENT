<p>The original article on this subject Angry Nintendo Nerd was deleted after an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Angry_Nintendo_Nerd_9ec0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Angry Nintendo Nerd">AfD</a>. The Angry Video Game Nerd article was originally protected to prevent it being used to recreate Angry Nintendo Nerd. After AVGN was unprotected it was recreated on January 16 covering the material from the original ANN article, despite there being no deletion review to overturn the original AfD. So technically this article could be speedy deleted under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>:G4. However I'd rather open discussion to the community. There is a claim of notability, but the only <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> cited is a brief mention of one of James Rolfe's online reviews being shown in the background of an MTV report on internet celebrities. This doesn't seem to reach the requirements of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, so I believe unless further sources can be found this article should be deleted and salted to prevent further recreation as the subject is not <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> and the article is not properly <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 08:27, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let me get this straight.</p>
<p>If people from many different countries who speak nine different languages have noticed something it still isn't notable because IGN hasn't written an article about it?</p>
<p>If millions on youtube have been watching him, and Alexa confirms those millions, that isn't verifiable because they aren't "independent of the subject". What entity has taken control of Alexa and youtube to make them biased in favor of this character? Richard Cane 12:48, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>MTV isn't enough obviously. This site is run by elitist, jealous idiots. 216.37.86.10 13:28, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You know, if I didn't know better, I'd accuse the Wikipedia elitist society of taking kickbacks from <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired_News_072a.html" title="Wired News">Wired News</a> or <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a>. What does this guy have to do to get an article, shoot the president? He's been listed on legitimate media outlets, the people clearly <b>want</b> an article. So why is all this even an issue?

<dd>They don't seem to realize his notoriety wouldn't have come about without the advent of youtube which is an extremely recent technology. His popularity is due to people voluntarily viewing him and those people are the ones who give him all the things that are necessary for him to be on here. He doesn't need Wired News or IGN.

<p>I'm going to explain what's happening in detail because I think you people are really confused about all this newfangled technology.</p>
<p>Remember in the old days when people needed things to be mentioned in books, newspapers, and television for it to be famous?</p>
<p>Nowadays, we have this magical invention called the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>. Through this amazing advancement in technology we can quantify something's popularity without the need of publications telling us something is famous, because we already know!</p>
<p>Have you heard of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blogs</a>? Notice how new they are and how they don't rely on the media to obtain information? That's the age we're living in.</p>
<p>Now, five years from now, gramps, you're going to look pretty silly when you look back at yourself insisting that something wasn't notable because a publication didn't make it official when millions upon millions already knew about it because they realized things had changed when you didn't.
