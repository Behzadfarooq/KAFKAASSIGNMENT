<li><b>Strong keep</b> - this is not just another random 'place in a TV show', but an important location that appears in many many episodes, in a very notable show. it is impractical to delete all location articles related to TV series just because some might like to see a Wikipedia that ignores popular culture. <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Wikipedia is not Encyclopædia Britannica</a>, and can deal with popular culture if it is non-point-of-view, verifiable and not involving original research.

<dd>Well, for a start the article fails to claim notability in anyway. From <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, "a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other. The show is notable. A fictional demon-friendly karaoke bar is not. And straight from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source." Where can I check a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> about this article? This article also fails <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Wikipedia's no original research policy</a>, as the only place this information comes from is original research. I agree that this is not the Encyclopedia Britannica, and I welcome popular culture, but, only popular culture that is verifiable and not involving original research. All of the above arguments have focused on the notability of the show and not this room. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 00:38, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I might take your arguments more seriously if your repeated use of the word "room" to describe Caritas didn't indicate to me that you have no real awareness of what the article's even about. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:14, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The article doesn't have to claim notability when it is a sub-article of a television show. Furthermore, there are references. Take the Buffy/Angel magazines, I'm sure they had some information about Caritas, as it was a set used multiple times over several seasons. Try an unreferenced tag next time. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:10, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The television show has notability. This does not. "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other." The show has been written about, this place has not. Buffy/Angel magazines are not reliable source that are in my opinion "independent of the subject itself." Furthermore, while you can argue notability and sourcing here, and claim that there are sources out there, they were not cited or used in this article. The entire thing fails <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. And again, if you want to rewrite, take 5 minutes and do it. I will take another look then. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 16:21, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>A further thought, if this show filmed at a gas station, under your reasoning, what stops someone from creating an article about it? It was on the show, so it is notable, and we would have to allow an article? Who decides what is a minor and trivial element in relation to this show? The answer to the question would be we would look at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. If it passed both of those we would keep. But, if it failed, as this article fails, we would delete. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 16:21, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>While the Buffy/Angel magazines are not completely independent, but licensed, they serve as useful references since they do contain valuable information about the series, and are substantially more than just press-releases. They are reputable sources as far as I'm concerned. And while a set that only appears once may not be important enough for its own article (it would probably best receive an entry in whatever episode description there is for the series), a set that appears multiple times in the same series is another matter. And seriously, if you want people to rewrite it, you should have tried the option of asking first, then if that didn't happen going to AfD. The fact that it can happen though, is enough for me to stick by my keep. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:30, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If they are not independent, they are not reliable. And while they may be useful references for a fan of the show, they do not qualify as sources for Wikipedia. Someone rewriting an article to fix objections happens all the time in AFD. And, I don't want to delete anything that passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, these do not. I am also curious how you respond would respond to my hypothetical gas station article above. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 16:57, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They are not independent, so they are not reliable? Sorry, does not compute. Where in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> can I find support for this claim? Even if it were there, you should note that RS itself says "However, it is not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception." Accordingly, you cannot just say that the magazines are licensed and therefore, they are not reliable sources. You'd actually have to convince me that the actual magazine itself was unreliable. Common sense should tell you that something in print is likely to be edited for accuracy and especially when it's licensed and the owners of the media don't want false information about their product to be released. And I have already responded to your question about a gas station. Did you not realize that "a set that only appears only once" was about that subject? And no, I don't think that the gas station in season 5 of Buffy should have its own article. Information about it would belong in the episodes it was in. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:07, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is not from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, but from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. From there "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and <i>independent of the subject itself</i> and each other." And from <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a>, an essay not policy, "An independent source is a source which describes a topic from the outside." Clearly these magazines are not. And I am sorry, I missed your response about the gas station. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 17:28, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't using the magazines to assert notability, but offering them as references. If you need me to establish that the shows are notable, well, I would say the existence of the magazines would serve that purpose actually, but it's hardly necessary anyway. Television show on a major network? Notability is a done deal. And um, your reference to WP:INDY makes no sense, since the fact is, the magazines DO describe the show from the outside. They are not in-universe, they are licensed works about the show. As such, I consider them reliable in terms of the content they have to offer. Have you read them yourself? Because I get the feeling that you are objecting in ignorance. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:34, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, I was confused about the content of the magazines, and didn't realize that there they were not "in-universe". And as to the the notability. Notability of the show is a done deal, I agree. But not the notability of a fictional demon-friendly karaoke bar as a stand alone article is not. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 17:42, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, if knew more about the show, you might recognize that the setting appears in multiple episodes (and is the focus of at least one), so I'd say that establishes the notability, the same way with any other number of places in fiction, whether it be <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gondor.html" title="Gondor">Gondor</a>, the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starship_Enterprise_3c8f.html" title="Starship Enterprise">Enterprise</a>, the <a href="../../../b/a/x/Baxter_Building_6156.html" title="Baxter Building">Baxter Building</a> or any number of other places important enough to have an article of their own. I would probably agree with you if it was in only one episode, or more properly fit under some sub-category but in this case? No, I understand why it's worth having its own article, even absence outside review. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:07, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, could these all fit into some single new article about the settings of the Buffy world? Say one detailing important places? I don't know, I am trying to come up with something. Then the article could be started and kept well referenced. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 18:19, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - These locations are notable as <i>crucial</i> locations in super-notable series. Wikipedia can cope with few of the most important locations from fictions, I'd never argue that we need an article for every room in a series, that would be madness. I'd agree that they could be improved by citing where information is coming from (e.g. footnotes referencing specific episodes). Wales: "free access to the sum of all human knowledge", we don't need to censor the popular culture bits, instead lets improve them. It's easy to sneer at popular culture, but the fictional narratives that millions share say a lot about us. - <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyverse_d279.html" title="User:Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The main problem with this article at present is that it is, at best, a summary of the primary source material regarding the subject. Per <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)</a>, it ought to discuss discussion of the room in a reliable source external to the show. If there isn't any to cite, well, perhaps it really isn't notable then. If there is, I think that will sway those who seek deletion. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 03:05, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
