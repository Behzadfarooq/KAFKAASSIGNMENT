<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>.

The article itself starts off with an unsourced claim "It was a huge hit", followed by a copyright-violating lyric transcript, followed by nationalistic <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original thought</a>: <i>"It can serve as an illustrative example of famous Serbian proud defiance (srpski inat) with which Serbs have resisted and eventually defeated many mighty enemies through centuries - Turks, Austro-Hungarians, Germans, and were now applying the same unashamed attitude of defiance towards mighty NATO"</i>. It's never going to be an acceptable encyclopaedia article, and this discussion has proven that while ably demonstrating why AfD is not a vote. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:05, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - this was one of the most popular songs during the bombings, along with others (Ja sam ja for example). In fact, we should make an article about the Indeksovici.

<dd>If it was so popular, how come the entry on Serbian wikipedia about this band does not mention it? Check <a href="../../../../sr/%D0%B8/%D0%BD/%D0%B4/%D0%98%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%86%D0%B8.html" class="extiw" title="sr:Индексовци">sr:Индексовци</a>. What is the title of this song in Serbian, anyway? That would be a useful piece of information to include in the article, don't you think? Especially since a search for Индексовци AND 117 on Google returns no hits. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 04:24, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because Indekosovci was group that also had many satrirical songs about Milosevic ,so they were pretty much banned from all TV stations.But thi particural song was played all over the country,and you couldn`t find A SINGLE SERB THAT NEVER HEARD IT!!! Its very famous even outside Serbia.</p>
<p>Also I should just mention such classics as "Ja sam Ja",those are also even more popular songs by Indeksovci.</p>
<p>Blacer,you should ask someone who knows Serbian to help you with that Google search,you will find planty of "return hits".Dzoni 04:36, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. That should have been provided in the first place. Now please explain how "El Condor Pada" translates to "Pilot of invisible F-117-a". <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 04:49, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Anyway, if the article is moved to a title which is the actual translation of the Serbian title, if the links to the Serbian text you listed above are added as external links (so that others can check the translation), and if the popularity of this song is demonstrated with at least a few sources, I will withdraw my delete vote. Wikipedia is not a lexicon of song lyrics, and the song lyrics that it has articles about must be <b>shown</b> to be notable. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 05:02, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>yes,but 2 link are Serban,one is Slovenian and one is English.Tha only means that song was popular even outside of Serbia.Ask any Serb if he heard it,everyone did. I can hardly find a web site that have an article about the song,but not a single SErbian song got articles about it on the internet,does that mean that there is no nobale Serbian songs?

<li><b>Comment</b> - Actually, Indeksovci would be Indexovo radio pozorište (or Index's radio theater in English). They where/are an acting company, not a music band. Title of the song is play on the title of El Condor Pasa (to which music it is sang) (padati - to fall, pada - falls, so El Condor Pada == El Condor Falls). Should the article be kept? Maybe, but absolutely <b>not</b> in this form - this way it is probably copyvio, or very close to it. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraneJ_8440.html" title="User:BraneJ">Branislav Jovanovic</a> 21:59, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I come from Balkans but never ever heard anything about this song. I think it is not notable enough to have its own article. Just maybe few people heard about it don’t mean it should have its own encyclopedic article.

<p>I wouldnt agree that we voted because someone told us to vote.We all explained our votes.</p>
<p>Anyway,what I dont see is,why would this Albanians opinion be important in thi case.He can not possible be honest and objective on this subject,so he should be banned from voting here. Also,"Siptar" is not offensive,because thats how they call themselves.</p>
<p>Kris12 have not said anything offensive,I did said what I mean of Siptars,but since I was officialy warned on my talk page that I will be banned,I will try not to use those words again.</p>
<p>And yes ReyBrujo,you got some nerves to say that we did not explained our votes.You was the one to said only few words with your first vote:"Song is not notable". We proved that song is VERY notable,so it would only be fair for you to apologise and change your vote.Off course,you can continue ignoring the facts...</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> There have been 4 keep votes that only have the vote, not even a small explanation of why the song should be kept. As for my vote, I wrote <i>the band seems to fail <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, thus song is non notable.</i> That is explanation enough, unless you want me to tell check every of the WP:MUSIC the band does fail. As for probing, as far as I see in this thread, no, nothing was probed. You provided four links, and I already explained why notability hasn't been probed:

<dd>Does the Serbian Wikipedia have a page about this song? If not, it should not be in this version of Wikipedia. If so, it may provide us information as to how important this song is. There is no serious reference thus far about why this song should be kept in Wikipedia.

<p>I voted keep, with some suggestions. I think the song has merit as an entry, given what else gets its own entry on Wikipedia. I'm no friend of Dzoni. He's a racist pig. He's an anti-semite. He imagined that I'm Jewish and then spewed his anti-Semitic vitriol on me. I'm not Jewish, I'm not Serbian. I'm...nevermind. He's a troll, basically. But I do think the entry has merit, and ... he did ask me to vote for it. Strange, eh? But so be it. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfnjm_f2dc.html" title="User:Profnjm">Profnjm</a> 19:20, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - No name group with no name song, nothing that the world should hear about it. Did this song even have an nr.1 place in any Serbian top list?

"Delete, Wiki doesn't need such nationalistic songs" -- is that really the criterion for inclusion? Nationalistic materials need not apply?

<p><b>Comment</b> Having reconsidered, this article would fit better as a part of an (yet unexisting) article Anti-NATO propaganda in Serbia in 1999 (or similar titled). As for my previous post here, the original lyrics is now included but as some users pointed out, there might be a copyright violation so keep just an exemplary section or the lyrics included (decide for yourself what part). --<b><a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETone_f843.html" title="User:Tone">Ton</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETone_Esperanza_c538.html" title="User:Tone/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a></b> 21:43, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
