<li><b>Notability information</b> - Below are various new notability signs about "Alice Soundtech"/"Alice Broadcast". -- 62.147.86.249 15:53, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>From the <a href="../../../o/f/c/Ofcom.html" title="Ofcom">Ofcom</a> (Office of Communications, the UK's communications regulator, formerly <a href="../../../o/f/t/Oftel.html" title="Oftel">Oftel</a>) in a 1996 publication <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/oftel/publications/1995_98/broadcasting/terrest/intro.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/oftel/publications/1995_98/broadcasting/terrest/intro.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, "Competition Issues in Terrestrial Broadcast Transmission": " <i>Chapter 2: market and competition analysis [...] Transmission equipment is increasingly being supplied by a few small specialist companies such as Alice Soundtech, SSVC and SBS, particularly to small independent radio stations with lower power transmission requirements.</i> " <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/oftel/publications/1995_98/broadcasting/terrest/chap2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/oftel/publications/1995_98/broadcasting/terrest/chap2.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
<li>In an official application to the Ofcom (in order to get an FM radio license), the would-be director's resume says in section "Ability to maintain proposed service": " <i>He moved to the UK in 1995 and has worked in high profile positions in the broadcast engineering sector ever since. At Alice Soundtech (1995-1998) he developed a good direct knowledge and relationship with many key players in UK broadcasting</i> " (Given in this context, it means Alice is a "high profile position" well-known to the Ofcom people and namedropping them is supposed to be impressive.) <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/radio/ifi/rbl/car/ifmapps/exeter/yourradio.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/radio/ifi/rbl/car/ifmapps/exeter/yourradio.pdf" rel="nofollow">(PDF)</a></li>
<li>An independent assessment made by Radiquip (a radio equipment renting company): " <i>Manufactured by Alice Broadcast Solutions the desk has proven popular with hospital radio stations for many years. Whilst its big sister the Alice Air 2000 desk is used extensively by ILR stations, the Series A has proven a popular choice for smaller community based stations, RSL's, and training studios around the world.</i> " <a href="http://www.radiquip.co.uk/1_hire_centre/cat_pages/10087.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.radiquip.co.uk/1_hire_centre/cat_pages/10087.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>From an independent press release of Bryant Broadcast: " <i>Alice appoint Bryant Broadcast as a new distributor (5 Feb 2004) Bryant Broadcast has now become an official distributor for Alice Broadcast Products. In particular we stock a number of the more popular "PAK" boxes, which are widely used in edit suites, studios, etc. to 'mix-and-match' domestic and line level equipment.</i> " <a href="http://www.bryant-broadcast.co.uk/alice" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bryant-broadcast.co.uk/alice" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
<li>From independent reseller CP Sound: " <i>Alice soundtech build problem solving boxes to interface unbalanced to balanced units, splitters and stereo source combiners for every eventuality. [The founder and owner of CP Sound] states that they are a very professional company and would recommmend using them where ever possible.</i> " <a href="http://www.cpsound.co.uk/products/alice.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cpsound.co.uk/products/alice.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>
<li>From the resume of an executive at the UK branch of <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Computing_Services_c3d5.html" title="Radio Computing Services">Radio Computing Services</a> ("the world's leading provider of broadcast software"): " <i>Ben has been at the forefront of technical supply and management in the UK broadcasting industry since 1990 when he joined Alice Soundtech plc, a turnkey broadcast equipment manufacturer and transmission provider.</i> " <a href="http://www.rcsuk.com/company/bios/hart.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rcsuk.com/company/bios/hart.asp" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></li>
<li>From the "The Creative Team" (graphic house that made their brochure): " <i>A new brochure for Alice Broadcast Solutions, an established name in broadcasting, brought their extensive range into the 21st century</i> " <a href="http://www.thecreativeteam.co.uk/catalogues/catalogues7.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thecreativeteam.co.uk/catalogues/catalogues7.php" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></li>
<li>From their own history page: " <i>Alice was first company to produce 'off the shelf' broadcasting equipment in high volumes. This was a revolutionary concept for the industry</i> " <a href="http://www.alice.co.uk/history.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alice.co.uk/history.shtml" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></li>
<li>It should be noted that of course, community or hospital radios rarely provide the list of their equipment, thus manufacturers in that branch aren't much visible, even if very present on a market. Thus, it's probably significative that we can still find quite some, such as:
<ul>
<li>From the <a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>'s "Intergovernmental Council of the IPDC; 23rd; New projects" about a "Production of radio programmes for young people on the rights of the child" project, equipment list: " <i>Mixing table (Alice Soundtech A-3 inputs).</i> " <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001292/129294e.pdf" class="external text" title="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001292/129294e.pdf" rel="nofollow">(PDF)</a></li>
<li>From "Chippenham Hospital Radio - Engineering - For the geeks among us" infos: " <i>The mixing desk is probably the most important part of the studio - we use an Alice Soundtech Series A desk with 18 channels</i> " <a href="http://www.chrs.org.uk/id21.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chrs.org.uk/id21.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and " <i>The old EELA desk [...] The New Alice Soundtech Desk</i> " <a href="http://www.chrs.org.uk/id25.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chrs.org.uk/id25.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> (so that's the gear they have chosen when upgrading)</li>
<li>From "Hospital Radio Tunbridge Wells - Our Technology": " <i>These are all connected together using an Alice Air 2000 mixing desk, which allows the presenter to be in complete control of the equipment. The output of the mixing desk is what the patients hear at their bedside.</i> " <a href="http://www.hrtw.org.uk/pages/our_technology.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hrtw.org.uk/pages/our_technology.shtml" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></li>
<li>From "Portsmouth Hospital Radio - Studio Three": " <i>It houses a broadcast control desk (Alice Soundtech 'A' Series)</i> " <a href="http://www.andrewb.btinternet.co.uk/phb_studio_three.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.andrewb.btinternet.co.uk/phb_studio_three.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></li>

<li>In an official application to the Ofcom (in order to get an FM radio license), the "Flame FM on Wirral" radio lists its equipment: " <i>Transmitter (Manufacturer) (model) Alice Soundtech GTx20</i> " <a href="http://www.wwww.radioauthority.org.uk/radio/ifi/rbl/commun_radio/tlproc/archives/applications/England/NorthWest/wirralchristianmedia.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.wwww.radioauthority.org.uk/radio/ifi/rbl/commun_radio/tlproc/archives/applications/England/NorthWest/wirralchristianmedia.pdf" rel="nofollow">(PDF)</a></li>
<li>From The Radio Magazine, in an article where some other company names are followed with an explanation, they are casually mentionned like all readers in this biz already know them: " <i>Forever Broadcasting and Alice Soundtech PLC are backing the Splash FM bid</i> " <a href="http://www.theradiomagazine.co.uk/PastNews/2002-02.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theradiomagazine.co.uk/PastNews/2002-02.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></li>
<li>From the mailing list of the Community Media Association <a href="http://mailman-new.greennet.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/cma-l" class="external autonumber" title="http://mailman-new.greennet.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/cma-l" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, a 2002 thread about "Broadcast equipment needed": " <i>Resonance FM one of the UK pilot access stations is now buying its broadcast studio equipment - anyone selling or with knowledge of where to get quality broadcast desks and equipment secondhand please reply [...] Try Alice Soundtech... not exactly cheap but damn good gear.</i> " <a href="http://mailman-new.greennet.org.uk/pipermail/cma-l/2002-March/000144.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mailman-new.greennet.org.uk/pipermail/cma-l/2002-March/000144.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'd add that I also stumbled on various yellow pages and catalogues in German, Spanish, Dutch, Danish, French, Polish, indirectly confirming their claim to be used internationally, such as their saying " <i>a popular choice for smaller community based stations, RSL's, and training studios around the world</i> ".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - IMO, the official <a href="../../../o/f/c/Ofcom.html" title="Ofcom">Ofcom</a> document analyzing the UK market and citing 3 main companies including Alice Soundtech would be quite enough for <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> alone, considering the governmental source and the fact that this domain isn't one popularly written about. And I think it's clear they're "an established name in broadcasting" to professionals in the radio business: being very notable inside a given domain is important even when relatively unknown to the main populace. (Full disclosure, I researched the above material. I am however not linked in any way with this company.) -- 62.147.86.249 15:55, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Sounds like they make good mixers, boards and other audio equipment, but no articles are presented from, say the audio or broadcasting press to show notability even within one industry. And as for the claim "first company to produce 'off the shelf' broadcasting equipment in high volumes" one might check <a href="http://www.oldradio.com/archives/hardware/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oldradio.com/archives/hardware/" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> to see many companies (RCA, Gates Radio, General Electric, Westinghouse, Collins Radio) supplying off the shelf broadcast equipment long before this company was a twinkle in anyone's eye. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:24, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Counter-comments</b> (in answer to Demiurge's comments):
<ul>
<li>For one thing, since the Ofcom report is about a different topic (competition in the radio market), it is telling that some companies of mere hardware get mentionned at all. And for another thing, it's about the weight of the source: when Ofcom says those three companies are the main suppliers of transmission equipment, it provides a great authoritativeness to the information, regardless of the main topic of the document. IMO, this claim in a governmental document, that Alice is one of the main players, shows as much notability as three dedicated puff pieces in industry magazines. It's about the spirit of the notability criterion, not the letter: a non-notable, local company simply doesn't get mentionned as one of the three main players in an Ofcom document, whatever the main topic of said document.</li>
<li>Another point about the "Ofcom criterion" would be: would accepting it open a Pandora box of hundreds of small companies being justified too? No: the Ofcom report mentions only three names. And those three companies Ofcom list as main players on this market, why wouldn't they be documented in Wikipedia? How can this market and domain and topic be covered on Wikipedia, if even the top 3 players named by the authoritative Ofcom aren't allowed on Wikipedia?</li>
<li>"Catalogue entries and sales brochures" may not be admissible for their content itself (commercial hype), but they can still provide good hints, since we're not just talking about an abstract company but also its products and its sales. For instance, if a company's products can be found all over the world in all catalogues from resellers, then it does provide another sign of notability: a non-notable, local company's products just aren't sold and found everywhere.</li>
<li>The other items aren't convincing by themselves, sure, but such accumulation of different sources help show there's something there, at least for casting a reasonable doubt against just immediately killing the article without further investigation. (If there's only a handful of highly specialized industry magazines, for a relatively very small readership, finding dedicated articles online is illusory, it'd require a professional to lookup specialized databases in his library.)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>&#160;: the UK broadcast industry should be covered, and a few of its players, even if they're notable only inside this industry, rather than to the mass public. The topic of the UK's <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Local_Radio_0243.html" title="Independent Local Radio">Independent Local Radio</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restricted_Service_Licence_4a24.html" title="Restricted Service Licence">Restricted Service Licence</a> links to a few articles about UK local radios or TVs, but has not much background for the hardware industry behind it (mixing consoles and transmitters). The official Ofcom reports provides an authoritative source about which main players can have an article. -- 62.147.39.76 10:18, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
