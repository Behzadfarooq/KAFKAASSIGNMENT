<li><b>Comment</b> I have no idea whether the claims made on the talk page (specifically that Green is the sole author of authoritative works on cannabis cultivation) are factual or whether, if they are, the spirit of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> would be met. Since there <i>were</i> claims of notability on that page, I did recommend that the issue come to AfD rather than speedy deletion. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 16:20, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless notability can be proved, though afd is right for this article. While it wasnt an autobiography it appears to me that the person who was the subject of the article made a request for the article to be created, thus delete on vanity grounds as well, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:02, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>DO NOT DELETE: The original assertion that Mr. Green is the only author to ever publish a book in this field is correct and true. As such, this book is very notable in circles and industries relating to the cannabis breeding. Most people in the US do not understand, and therefor fear, said subject matter, but in many countries around the world Mr. Green's work is a standout and well-respected. I, myself, am a journalist for High Times magazine, based in Manhattan, and can atest that this author's works are used consistently for research directly related to articles we publish that are read by over 1 million people worldwide.<small>This comment unsigned by first ever edit anon user User:69.116.201.26</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> "The original assertion that Mr. Green is the only author to ever publish a book in this field is correct and true." A search for "cannabis cultivation" on amazon.com quickly shows that this claim is not correct. If the author or the books are notable, then it should be easy to demonstrate using references to reliable sources. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChondrite_3324.html" title="User:Chondrite">Chondrite</a> 23:05, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DO NOT DELETE: Yes the original assertion was true. He is the only author to publish two books in those fields. If you have any experience with cannabis litrature then you would know that between 2003 and 2006 his books may have been the best selling cannabis books on Amazon, to my knowledge anyway, or should have been because they are well regarded, but Amazon is a poor choice of rating. Right now Jorge Cervantes has a new book which would be a better seller. The only other modern breeding publication would be from DJ Short, but he has not done a cultivation manual. I am not surprised that High Times references Greg Green. The author is notable and should stay.

<li><b>Comment</b>As the former Washington editor for High Times, I would like to point out that several authors wrote more than one book on marijuana cultivation, especially Ed Rosenthal, who was affiliated with <i>High Times</i>. I think there is room for an entry here on Wikipedia for Green, but the baloney hype needs to be screened out, otherwise it is just badly crafted self-promotion.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 20:58, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Two things are very strange. 69.116.201.26 is New York with claims to be affiliated with HT. So if Simonapro is banned and is 69.116.201.26 then that is a NY entry. As you can see the IP that was attributed to Simonapro was not in NY. So I do not see how an Afc could have linked the two. That seems very wrong to me. Secondly, the claim is that Greg Green is the only author to have dedicated book on cannabis breeding/genetics and another dedicated book on cannabis cultivation. For the life of me I have looked through my book collection and online, and the statement seems to be absolutely true as far as I can tell unless you can bring up an author who has done the same. It seems exclusive to Green. Also do you remember Green's work being reviewed or cited by HT mag?

<dd>The internet is not geographically constrained, a person of even limited intellegence can appear to come from many places at once. Simomapro got caught as a sock-puppet due to a lack of understanding about how to not get caught as a sock-puppet(no gunna say what the mistake was though). The check-user can be relied on.</dd>

<dd>Indeed it is easy with the resources to appear to come from more than one place. I, for instance, while in Honduras, have the ability to make edits as if they come from the UK as I have (legal) access to a computer in London using simple software) so we cant discount that a user in the Czech republic could do the same with a US computer, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 20:15, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Can I suggest that discussion of Simonapro's sockpuppetry would be more appropriate at <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Simonapro_ad86.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Simonapro">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Simonapro</a>, and <b>Comment</b> that Backlit's second point constitutes <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and for that reason would not be appropriate for inclusion in the article. The problem is that nothing seems to have been published in reliable sources <i>about</i> Green or his books. Since the Green Candy Press site does not include biographical information about Green, verifiable article content is limited to mentioning that Green has published two books, and so the article will never get beyond a stub. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChondrite_3324.html" title="User:Chondrite">Chondrite</a> 20:32, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
