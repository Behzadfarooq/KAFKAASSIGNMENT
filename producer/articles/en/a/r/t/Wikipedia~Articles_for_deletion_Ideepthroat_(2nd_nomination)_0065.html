<li><b>Comment</b>. Thank you for providing refernces supporting your opinion. I personally don't feel that helps her or the website meet the criteria in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> (respectively). My biggest problem with using the films to provide an "air of notability" is that the production company seems to not pass <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. If you can show that the production company meets the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> requirement then I would gladly support a move to <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heather_Harmon_8a6d.html" title="Heather Harmon">Heather Harmon</a> leaving this article and <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideepthroat.com.html" title="Ideepthroat.com">Ideepthroat.com</a> as redirects. I would investiate the matter myself, but I am currently using a company computer and this subject area is forbidden by our internet policy. <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/v/User_talk%7EMovementarian_393b.html" title="User talk:Movementarian">Talk</a>) 12:44, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

The Wikipedia community is not required to adhere to them as strictly as you seem to want. And while those guidelines aren't written in a way easily applicable to porn stars, Heather Harmon meets the tests of having a large fan base, selling over 5,000 copies of her movies, and everything in the article being verifiable.--<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeAnswers_dc5d.html" title="User:ThreeAnswers">ThreeAnswers</a> 23:14, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To begin, I never claimed they were policy. As you correctly stated they are guidelines and should be given serious weight. I don't see how selling 5,000 copies of a porn video makes someone notable. That wouldn't get any other indepant film in unless it won an award. Did she win an award? The guidelines are derived from policy and community concensus. I agree that they may not always address the subject of internet porn very well and, as I suggested in my first comment, it may be worthwhile to find a community concensus for thier inclusion (i.e. WP:PORN). My biggest problem is that people have not even tried to establish why she merits inclusion beyond arguements claiming personal knowlege of the website, which is not consistant with <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> (you are, of course the exception to that statement). Whilst I agree that guidelines need not be followed as strictly as rules, they cannot be completely ignored either. <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/v/User_talk%7EMovementarian_393b.html" title="User talk:Movementarian">Talk</a>) 04:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The 5,000 test is analogous to "Recording musicians who have sold more than 5,000 albums, CDs, or similar recordings" in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I don't know about the prices of CDs and porn movies or the relative sizes of the two industries but that doesn't sound like a bad test to me. She was also a finalist for a KSEX radio Listener's Choice award in 2004 but didn't win.<a href="http://www.ainews.com/Archives/Story7574.phtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ainews.com/Archives/Story7574.phtml" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>--<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeAnswers_dc5d.html" title="User:ThreeAnswers">ThreeAnswers</a> 05:07, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
