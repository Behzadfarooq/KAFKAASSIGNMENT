<dd>It's not my list. I had no idea it existed before finding this AFD. Nor do I particularly care if the list is restricted to people with articles or not but this sort of list in my experience tends to end up with mostly bluelinks anyway. As for the list being "controllable," it does not appear that there has been any great rush to add people to it at all, let alone add people inappropriately. And if people are being added inappropriately, well, that's what editing is supposed to be for. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:37, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Quite aside from all of that, what is the attribution, never mind the criteria, for calling some of those people gay/bi, and what is the attribution, never mind the criteria, for declaring any such "no longer identified?" I hear what Otto's saying, but frankly, barring an attribution <b>in print</b> from a <b>reliable source</b> of one of these people saying "I used to be gay but now I'm not," any such citation is garbage. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:41, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm actually quite neutral on whether this <i>should</i> exist or not, but I can clarify that the reason it <i>does</i> exist is because people such as David Bowie and Lou Reed kept being added to the main LGB people lists. <i>Every</i> person listed at present <i>is</i> reliably documented as having changed their identification. And <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Heche_8015.html" title="Anne Heche">Anne Heche</a> <i>is</i> reliably documented as someone who <i>hasn't</i> changed her identification even though she's commonly cited as someone who has. The list <i>is</i> monitored for problematic inclusions, and sources <i>are</i> available for every single name on the list. So there simply <i>isn't</i> any "BLP disaster waiting to happen" here. Accordingly, while I'm not <i>really</i> all that convinced that it's actually necessary, I'm going to say <b>keep</b> if only because the main reason being cited for deletion here is completely out to lunch. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:50, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>And a general comment</b> to those who fear a lawsuit because of this list: I am not an attorney but the last I heard calling someone a heterosexual was not actionable in any court on the planet. Calling someone formerly gay if there's reliable sourcing is not actionable. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:39, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> and susceptible to BLP. I agree with RGTraynor above. A person has there right to decide how he wishes to be labeled. If this list were limited strictly to those who had publicly announced something to indicate that they wanted this notified, it would be appropriate. I think most people would be just as offended to be put in the wrong category either way. The legal assumption you mention is an assumption of prejudice against homosexuals.
