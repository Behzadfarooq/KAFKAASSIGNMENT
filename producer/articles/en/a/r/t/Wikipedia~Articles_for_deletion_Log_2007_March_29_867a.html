<p>Somebody called this a hoax on the article's page. Checking it out I find no references to show this award exists. The web page looks like a email harvesting operation and the same user User: Andy Webster has only this edit and the addition of links to BCTA on other computer related articles. I think he is also the anon IP that has added similar links. I'm new and don't know how to track all this down, but it smells like bad fish to me. If I'm wrong I'll take my lashes. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilling_sparrows_c660.html" title="User:Killing sparrows">killing sparrows</a> 00:36, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

At best, the info should be included on each movie/director/actor page. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlavlin_78b5.html" title="User:Slavlin">Slavlin</a> 02:17, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Not sure.</b> Normally when I'm not sure I don't comment, but this time I really see both sides of the argument. I would imagine that these records matter to film junkies the way that regular-season standings matter to baseball fans. We do have articles on regular-season standings, but I don't know enough about film to judge the true relevance of these data. Without solid ground for deletion, I would submit a vote to keep by default. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 02:24, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>: The above is a poor analogy, actually. Sports regular seasons have occurrences and information in of themselves. This, however, is a compilation of awards won elsewhere. Like others, I question the rationale for including some of those awards. They're potentially useful and informative lists, as such things go, but without some acceptable criteria for deciding which awards to include, this is a <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> violation. Beyond that, what's this "Road to the Xth Academy Awards" nonsense? Is there a particular source for that term, or any reason to believe that the worldwide perception of each and every one of these awards is as minor-league trophies en route to the Oscars? I'd think much kindlier on List of 2006 major film awards etc. "These award presentations all lead to the 79th Academy Awards ceremony on February 25, 2007."

<li><b>Delete all</b>. This is not an official compilation; there is no consensus among film fans about which critics' awards are worth paying attention to and which are not. I understand what the article creators meant by "Road to the ... Awards" but that is not a commonly used name for what this is about. I could understand listing awards won under the film or person's entry, or listing the winners given for a particular year in the article about the particular award, but this article is <a href="../../../i/i/n/WP%7EIINFO_2579.html" title="WP:IINFO">indiscriminate information</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 02:33, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b> if this is a list of <i>every</i> significant film awards from each year.

<li><b>Delete all</b> as a list of data not really suited to an encyclopedia. Information should be split and put on the relevant talk page of the movie/directors/actors/other relevant pages. Also, there's no way to make sure data should/shouldn't be put on the page- authors choice, as Croxley said? Or another sort of criteria? Really, it could be anything- <b><a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECattleGirl_9ae1.html" title="User:CattleGirl"><font color="blue">Cat</font><font color="darkblue">tleG</font><font color="black">irl</font></a></b> <sup><i><a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECattleGirl_3ed2.html" title="User talk:CattleGirl">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECattleGirl_Autograph_Book_3a2e.html" title="User:CattleGirl/Autograph Book">sign!</a></i></sup> 08:31, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reading this article, I was struck that it reads more more like an original paper than an encyclopedia article. Both are similar (citations, relatively neutral and professional tone) and there's that line that's crossed when you're taking various sources and using them to make some kind of an original argument not found in those sources alone. The argument here just seems to be implied, but it's such a blatantly obvious implication that it's hard to say it isn't there. That was just the gist that I got... it's hard to classify this as definently being original research, because whoever created this seems to have been pretty careful, but I would lean towards saying it is. Funny comment on the article's talk page, by the way. Or at least I thought so. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 02:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article could stand some rewritting, and I am sure someone will place the appropriate tag on it soon. I did a quick reference check and found this <i>Whether or not prehistoric Native Americans were a significant ecological factor has been the subject of intense debate among generations of ecologists. During the latter half of the twentieth century, the pendulum of opinion has swung from the belief that American Indians had no influence on the composition and structure of plant and animal communities to the assertion that they were responsible for destruction of native habitats through over-exploitation of natural resources and widespread use of fire.</i> <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521662703&amp;ss=exc" class="external text" title="http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521662703&amp;ss=exc" rel="nofollow">Prehistoric Native Americans and Ecological Change</a> it is part of a book for $99.00 (American) on the Cambridge Catalog.

<p>The references provided to support these claims were subjected to some basic scrutiny (not particularly rigorous), and failed to stand up. Most were trivial, and did not support the statements they were being cited for; one was circular, and was effectively citing the list itself for a contentious statement; one cited a "special thanks" note to the list's founder for something entirely unrelated to the list itself; one turned out to be demonstrably false.

<li><b>Keep</b> We have been here before. Major institutions of world-wide stature do not make indiscriminate lists of resources, The selectivity involved in adding this to their lists is an endorsement of its usefulness. the references deleted were examples of this use--the battle to delete this list has been carried out on several fronts. I think most of the major researchers in the subject do use the list. There are many academic fields where the mailing lists are the main information sources--of course this requires a moderated list with significant editorial control. This is now the way the academic world--or at least large parts of it--now work. I would certainly have been here saying this without the least need of canvassing, by the way--I think it is not wise to do so, for it does arouse suspicion. I can thus understand perfectly well the reason why some might vote to delete. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:09, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

</li>
<li>DGG, again, you are not taking into account the difference between trivial, and non trivial mention. Does ANY notable institution give it more that a "that too" type mention? Do you see the real AMNH mention this in a non-trivial manner? Even a single paragraph of text focusing on how useful this list is not there. All we have is simple one line mentions. Other references are forged.</li>
<li>Also, you need to take into account "Trivial mentions". For example, research papers often have an acknowledgment section where there are similar one-sentence "Thank you" notes on various persons, that by itself does not make those persons "cited". As for the "Battle", no WP is not a battle ground, but we need to keep the random crap away, as WP IS an encyclopedia and NOT a fanblog. Until we learn to clean out fancruft and triviality, WP will simply degenerate into a spamblog. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 04:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - If we're scrounging through faxes and trivial lists of links, I think its pretty clear there are reliable sources at this point. No sources - even if a notable museum links to another website, it does not make that website notable. That is pretty much the definition of a trivial listing, regardless of who is performing it. Even if we granted the faulty assumption that being in a list of links makes it notable, there's no secondary information on which to base an article. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 04:49, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>: This article is about something more then a mailing list, it is often referred to as the "NATURAL HISTORY NETWORK" of India or South Asia, it also serves as WILDERNESS TELEGRAM SYSTEM of sorts, the subject of this article has become an NGO in itself helping its members many of whom are grassroots workers in the fields of Nature &amp; Wildlife Conservation, students, scientists, prominent members of other NGOs, many "News Makers" in these field report directly to the NETWORK, simultaneously or before commercial news channels report on the matter, discoveries, poaching, habitat encroachments, proposed government protected area notifications and the unfortunate de-notifications, illegal wildlife trade observed, wildlife trade seizures, Endangered Tiger &amp; Panther etc. etc. bone and skin seizures, proposed government policy changes affecting the environment before they come into effect, proposed dams which will submerge large chunks of the last remaining pristine forests etc are just a few things reported and debated by this NETWORK many a times bringing corrective action in time. This is a list dealing with issues faced by Indian Naturalists, conservationists, and NGOs who network on it thankfully, including members of related Government institutions, IT CAN ONLY BE COMPARED WITH OTHER LISTS OF THE REGION dealing with similar issues and it stands head and shoulders above the rest, most of the top people in the field in the region are subscribers or know of its reputability. It is a notable achievement in India in its field, please understand that before taking the argument around the world comparing ORANGES with APPLES i.e. with just other sundry mailing lists.

<ul>
<li>Argument 1: <i>The list is "Natural History Network", "Wilderness Telegram System", "NGO in itself"</i>: The claim that it is the "Natural History Network" is based on a book endorsement, where the creator of the mailing list <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7601.html" class="external text" title="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7601.html" rel="nofollow">mentions</a> himself as "Co-oridinator, South Asian Natural History Network". Other such assertions are based entirely on perception of the creator of the article. Even if such claims are assumed to be true, the subject of the article still fails <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>.</li>
<li>Argument 2: <i>The list has been mentioned on websites of notable organizations</i> or <i>the selectivity involved in adding this to their lists is an endorsement of its usefulness</i> or <i>the list has been "recommended" by <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecological_Society_of_America_fdb4.html" title="Ecological Society of America">ESA</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Conservation_Union_6f54.html" title="World Conservation Union">IUCN</a>, and people such as <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Noronha_ddb7.html" title="Frederick Noronha">Frederick Noronha</a></i>: All the "references" provided for these arguements are actually trivial listing among many other URLs. For eg., the "reference" being provided to assert that the list is recommended by the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Museum_of_Natural_History_8ac9.html" title="American Museum of Natural History">American Museum of Natural History</a> is a <a href="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc97html/wwwnh.html" class="external text" title="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc97html/wwwnh.html" rel="nofollow">fax message</a> that mentions some useful URLs including these: <a href="http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~ramakris/indiacons.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~ramakris/indiacons.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a><a href="http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/phylogeny.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/phylogeny.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a><a href="http://herb.biol.uregina.ca/liu/bio/idb.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://herb.biol.uregina.ca/liu/bio/idb.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a><a href="http://aw.users.netlink.co.uk/obchome.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://aw.users.netlink.co.uk/obchome.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/tax.html/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/tax.html/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> (many dead links) -- do all these pages become notable enough to deserve an article on Wikipedia? Similarly, <a href="http://www.indianbirds.in/download/IB2005%5B1%5D.1%20FINAL%20web.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.indianbirds.in/download/IB2005%5B1%5D.1%20FINAL%20web.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a> mentions the list among eight others (most of them Yahoo! Groups). <a href="http://www.apnic.net/mailing-lists/s-asia-it/archive/1999/05/msg00015.html" class="external text" title="http://www.apnic.net/mailing-lists/s-asia-it/archive/1999/05/msg00015.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> is a list of 100+ links that includes several tripod, geocities, freeservers, 8m.com pages -- do all these pages become notable enough to deserve an article because they have been "recommended" by a highly respected journalist (<a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Noronha_ddb7.html" title="Frederick Noronha">Frederick Noronha</a>)? Other such "references" are also trivial mentions of list in newsletters etc.</li>
<li>Argument 3: <i>The list members are employees of notable organizations such as <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wildlife_Institute_of_India_74b8.html" title="Wildlife Institute of India">WII</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service_4db6.html" title="United States Fish and Wildlife Service">USFWS</a></i>: The "references" provided for this are messages like <a href="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc99html/ecoendf241108.html" class="external text" title="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc99html/ecoendf241108.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> (a Reuters news item forwarded to the list by a USFWS employee). How does this make the list itself notable enough for an article? I work with a very notable organization and I subscribe to many lists -- that doesn't make those lists notable. I'd vote keep if many participants of the list were themselves very notable or famous, which doesn't seem to be the case.</li>
<li>Argument 4: <i>The list that produced a number of noteworthy predictions</i> (the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Natural_History_of_South_Asia_mailing_list_%282nd_nomination%29_99f8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Natural History of South Asia mailing list (2nd nomination)">2nd AfD nom</a> was closed citing this argument by <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a>) -- the article doesn't contain (and never contained) any information about "number of noteworthy predictions". It contained information about speculation that a subscriber to the list <i>may have</i> predicted the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10009225" class="external text" title="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10009225" rel="nofollow">The reference</a> doesn't assert notability of the list. It just mentions the list once, as a place where one can verify that the prediction was made before the earthquake occured.</li>
<li>Argument 5: <i>The list is hosted at Princeton/some of the list members are professors, so the list is notable in academic circles</i>: Just because some of the list members are professors doesn't make it highly notable in academic circles. All the "references" earlier mentioned in the article were trivial one-sentence mentions of the list. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 10:32, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>This does not need to be deleted.</b> The information is not complete, and is still under development.

It will be cleaned up. We have had problems with members from here deleting and adding profanity and nonscences, so that had to be dealt with as well. It will be better and work is being done slowly. If people complain about it,then they should contribute. That is the point of wiki. This is for others to add in information they want.

<li><b>Do not delete.</b> Gameinformer Online is a full website with a history to it, just let the wiki article blossom, it will take time so let build - <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApocalidiot_f541.html" title="User:Apocalidiot">apocalidiot</a> *do not touch*</li>

<li>The Game Informer Online wikipedia entry shouldn't be deleted. As said by another user, it's only the beginning of an effort to create a stable and useful page. There is an inherent difference between the Game Informer magazine and the Game Informer website. They both have their own culture, coverage, style, and impact upon the gaming community. While both may be Game Informer, there are enough differences and content for both entities to have their own page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Srkelley (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Srkelley_ede1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Srkelley">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_Informer_aab7.html" title="Game Informer">Game Informer</a>, if there is any information to merge. It's certainly part of Game Informer, and deserves a note in the article, but like the <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> boards, it probably does not deserve its own article. Maybe if the Game Informer article gets too big, it could be split out. <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesac_44a4.html" title="User:Kesac">Kesac</a> 22:27, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The issue isn't if it can be expanded. The issue is if it meets the criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia as set out by <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. It doesn't have multiple published works about it or any notable awards.

<dd><b>Response to above</b>. This article, while it may be messy ( as i have noted myself, I added the clean up tag) there is definatly enough info available to make an art. AND Nick and I are in contact, and he will be giving me info that can be added. Does that qualify as Original Research? I hope not... also, notablility can be established with web traffic and a link to GI mag, can it not?<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatreryukami_96f6.html" title="User:Quatreryukami">Quatreryukami</a> 15:33, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Hello! There is indeed a guild named "Entarian Dominion" in World of Warcraft, and I'm pretty sure it is related to Entarians (Koreanic ethnicity living nowadays in Russia and Kazakhstan), which are also falsely being refered to as "Koryo Sarami". This is an unacknowledged ethnicity, however I have met actual descendants of Entarians in the United States and in Kazakhstan. I studied Entarian from very few remaining speakers, and it resembles many word similarities with Korean. Please do not make false conclusions. Do not support if you don't have enough knowledge, but do not disprove the topic either if you don't have ample evidence to state Entarians (Hentarissarmi) have never existed as a group. Thank you. Vunvjorhimm 23:19, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, hopefully this article will draw attention of specialists specializing in anthropology/history, and they will contribute to impovement/correction of the information. HENTAR in Entarian means "one", in Korean HAN means the same thing. RIS is dominion/area/realm/territory in Entarian; best equivalent for this word in Korean would be Sino-Korean GUG, which means country, state. In Korean Entaria would be HANGUG, but it has little to do with modern South Korea. Please read carefully the history of Korea to make sure nothing is contradicting. If you are interested in more information and the sources of it, ask me, I am ready to answer all the questions to the best of my knowledge. Be more critical.

<li>If my article will get deleted, the only conclusion a reasonable reader can make of it is that the users and administrators of Wikipedia can only rely on something that's easily accessible via internet, and they don't want to acknowledge something that is out there... Or may be someone wants to venture forth to Eastern Siberia and search for material findings, make system of them, and objectively describe what was it, Entarian Dominion. Entarians were basically (if not completely exterminated) deprived from their identity, their culture was disregarded, and the research done in the area was most likely biased. No one knows that Japanese archaeologists were digging in the area and how did they view Koreanics? Were they interested in disclosing any data from the northern Manchuria? May be so that Entarians won't have legacy to be acknowledged as a group forever in the history, that is being written by... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Vunvjorhimm (<a href="../../../v/u/n/User_talk%7EVunvjorhimm_ff8f.html" title="User talk:Vunvjorhimm">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vunvjorhimm_91ff.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vunvjorhimm">contribs</a>) 01:52, 30 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>I do not believe this topic deserves an article. Putting aside the correctable issue of a misleading title, a "list of people" is inappropriate in this case. An article on the supposed phenomenon of persons entering heaven while still living <i>may</i> be notable and should contain examples but this is not that article and, as far as I know, that article does not exist. An online search for information reveals that there are plenty of sources about <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22elijah%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22elijah%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Elijah</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22serach%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22serach%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Serach</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22enoch%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22enoch%22+%22heaven%22+%22alive%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Enoch</a> that mention the aforementioned entry into heaven while still alive. However, that information belongs in the individual articles. So, I propose that this article be <b>delete</b>d because:</p>
<ol>
<li>The article does not prove the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> of the subject by providing at least one substantial or multiple non-trivial secondary sources, and I have been unable to prove the topic's notability through my own search.</li>
<li>The article does not provide clear standards of inclusion or exclusion, in violation of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a>. For instance, not too long ago, this list boasted <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheech_and_Chong_b5c0.html" title="Cheech and Chong">Cheech Marin</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_went_to_heaven_alive&amp;diff=111756796&amp;oldid=99156898" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_went_to_heaven_alive&amp;diff=111756796&amp;oldid=99156898" rel="nofollow">diff</a>).</li>
<li>Any listing of the handful of characters who supposedly entered heaven while still alive should be contained in an article on the phenomenon itself rather than existing as a stand-alone list.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I believe the problem to be endemic to the topic rather than the just the article, I am skipping the usual steps of tagging the article with various cleanup tags or requesting that the article's author (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Gausie" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Gausie" rel="nofollow">inactive for a month</a>) try to fix it. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:32, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In lieu of the changes made to the article within the past 20 hours (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_went_to_heaven_alive&amp;diff=118896092&amp;oldid=118692611" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_went_to_heaven_alive&amp;diff=118896092&amp;oldid=118692611" rel="nofollow">diff</a>), I am changing my recommendation to delete and now believe the article is worthy of being <b>kept</b>. The changes have made this a wholly different article that proves the notability of the topic, provides clear(er) standards of inclusion (as clear as we'll have with 2000 year old texts that are disputed), and addresses the general concept of ascension into heaven rather than merely listing persons who could fall in that category.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> because the list could be improved enormously. I take deep offense at calling this a joke. If you don't know enough about a particular religion, or religion in general, don't go calling subjects related to what people hold sacred a "joke". I'm no expert myself, but I know "People who went to heaven alive" is usually called "translation into heaven" or "assumption into heaven" or "ascension into heaven". From Christianity you could add <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_of_Nazareth_2b3e.html" title="Jesus of Nazareth">Jesus of Nazareth</a> and (at least in Roman Catholic doctrine) <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%2C_mother_of_Jesus_a284.html" title="Mary, mother of Jesus">Mary, mother of Jesus</a>. The day commemorating her assumption into heaven is a holy day of obligation for Catholics. See <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assumption_of_Mary_03d6.html" title="Assumption of Mary">Assumption of Mary</a>. It's also celebrated in art. See: <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assumption_of_the_Virgin_Mary_742c.html" title="Assumption of the Virgin Mary">Assumption of the Virgin Mary</a>. This hardly indicates that the "topic of people ascending to heaven is extremely minor within Jewish tradition, <i>let alone in the context of a general-interest encyclopedia.</i>" (Emphasis added.) Muslims might also beg to differ, since many believe that <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> also ascended into heaven at the Dome of the Rock. Wikipedia has a short article on it: <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitab_al-Miraj_5eab.html" title="Kitab al-Miraj">Kitab al-Miraj</a>. In Polynesian (or at least Maori) religion, there also seems to be a person (maybe more) who ascended into heaven, but I don't have time to read through <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/pac/grey/grey06.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sacred-texts.com/pac/grey/grey06.htm" rel="nofollow">Rupe's Ascent into Heaven</a>.

<dd>As a <i>subject</i> the list is certainly important enough for an encyclopedia. Since some explanation of which religion(s) consider certain figures to have ascended bodily into heaven is necessary to help a reader navigate through the topic, so a category would be inadequate. I haven't found any source that considers all bodily assumptions into heaven from all religions, but it seems to me it isn't origional research to simply state that the concept exists in various religions and describe how each religion treats the concept in theology and tradition. One day I expect we'll get individual articles on bodily assumption in Judaism, Catholicism, Islam, etc. Perhaps a fuller account of how assumption into heaven relates to how these people are understood is best left to the individual articles on these people, but something is needed for this concept, and I think a list with short descriptions is a worthy start. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 06:07, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><s><b>Keep</b>, as problematic but salvageable. Although not a fan of lists, the nominators first two points, I think, are not valid. #1...Most, if not all, biblical person's existence and actions are attested to only through that document, all other sources derive from that and they are abundant. #2...Vandalism to an article is not a reason for deletion of that article and standards for inclusion could be addressed through a more qualifying title for the article. #3 Raises the best point but could be addressed through renaming...<i>in Christian/Jewish/Muslim theology...</i>, or some such way.

<li><b>Comment</b> Since this article is undergoing some revision, editors in this discussion should take a look back later and see if their opinions still apply.

<li><b>Comment</b> This certainly isn't a joke, and there are sources for the individuals given. However, there are significant <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> problems not solvable simply by changing the title. One difficulty is that there are enormous differences between the degree of belief and sourcing for various individuals. In <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, for example, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah.html" title="Elijah">Elijah</a> is specifically mentioned in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>, while other figures are mentioned only in relatively minor <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midrash.html" title="Midrash">Midrashic</a> sources. Simply listing them creates an appearance of commonality of belief and importance which simply doesn't exist in the underlying religious traditions. A more fundamental problem is that the whole topic, as it stands, represents <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> -- it claimss a commonality among figures who have different stories. for example it presents them as going to a common, a place called "Heaven", which is impliedly represented as being common to every religion listed, even though not every religion listed has this concept. I'm not sure that changing the name would solve the problem. I'm not questioning that this could be a valid topic. It's the business of original researchers to identify common themes in disparate cultures and to provide explanations why regarding the themes as common is legitimate. But I don't believe it's the business of Wikipedia to do this sort of original research. And it's even less the business of Wikipedia to do it in a way that treats commonality as a hidden assumption which the reader is required to take for granted. The article should at least address the question of whether other religions actually have a comparable concept of "heaven" rather than fitting them into the framework of ones own worldview unquestioningly. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 01:18, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b> I've posted requests for editors to look at this article and deletion discussion at WikiProject talk pages for Bible, Christianity, Judaism, Islam and, I think, Religion hoping to get some useable insight of this general sort. But I have to respond that absolutely none of Shirahadasha's points show any reason at all to delete, only to further improve the Judaism section of the article (there's already a notice at the top of that section calling for improvements). There is a Wikipedia article, <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">Heaven</a>, which is linked to in the top paragraph of this article and where the Jewish concepts of the afterlife are discussed, and it would be proper to note some differences in the concept of heaven or note the absence of the belief in heaven in Judaism, if that's the case. Of course, that explanation would have to address the citations from Genesis and 2 Kings already in the article. I'm going to copy and cross post S's valuable comment above to the article's talk page and respond to other points about article content, which don't need to be addressed further here.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 19:05, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm under a bit of time pressure so I'll just drop a quick note. Noroton, can you discuss the pros and cons of just merging this article into <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">Heaven</a>? Does it really merit a separate article? --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 19:28, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sure. I think the only reason to separate one article from another related article is to keep article sizes manageable and help readers navigate. If this article and Heaven were smallish and couldn't be expected to grow more, then I think we could merge them. Heaven is 47 Kb long right now and, although I haven't looked closely at that article, I can easily imagine it could grow more (there's a lot of information out there). After Googling this subject, here are the areas where I know or have reason to suspect this article might grow: The entire Judaism section, which should show the significant viewpoints on ascension within Judaism, including, I assume, something on midrash; Christian views on Enoch and Elijah's ascensions; more information on Roman Catholic views, Orthodox Christian views and various Protestant views and how they differ and are alike each other; Islam's significant views on Enoch and Elijah; an adequate explanation on Islam's views on Jesus and ascension; the same for Muhammad; ascension in Polynesian religion; more information on Apollonius of Tyrana and ascension; possible ascension of Chinese emperors (I get intriguing whisps of this but can't find anything that really confirms it). All of these sections should eventually show similarities and differences. Ideally, every major part of this article would summarize better, fuller accounts in other, more specific articles, as well as discuss what reliable sources have to say about the similarities and differences of different religions and sects (this would be the best spot for that information and I'm frustrated that I haven't found it yet). This article is about ascension and belief, but it's not hard to imagine ascension in myth and ascension in fiction.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 20:35, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Articles can be and have been totally rewritten. What you need to justify a vote for deletion is a case that there shouldn't be any article on the general topic, under any title, EVER. I say that because 1) there is an ongoing discussion on changing the title 2) the notability is hardly going to change and 3) if this article is deleted any future article on the topic will be liable to get speedied. <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 19:29, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Springnuts, your comments are essentially incomprehensible because you offer no explanation for them and your citations are indecipherable. Give the specific reasons and citations your strong opinion actually demands. I'll be specific: (a) what precisely is inaccurate (a serious charge in an encyclopedia); (b) where is the confusion between ascension and assumption; (c) what is incoherent. If you're going to criticize the efforts of editors who are doing their best, then it seems to me that [<i>self edit to delete my comment. See</i> <b>Apologies</b> <b>comment below</b>].

<dd>Ouch! Well <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a>, not to waste a lot of time - (a) inaccuracy: the article lists Jesus as someone who entered heaven without dying, however it is a fundamental Christian belief that Jesus died on the cross. The article states "in Christian belief, the privilege of entering heaven without dying is reserved for those who are considered to have been without sin" - but most Christians do not consider Elijah sinless, yet he did enter heaven without dying ... the article states "Belief in the ascension of Christ is part of the Reformed churches tradition" but it is actually part of all orthodox tradition (b) ascension is after death (ie with dying), assumption is before death (ie without dying), (c) hence the whole thing is, imo, incoherent - and un-necessary.

<dd>Double-ouch! Those are valid points and I wrote one of the offending sentences so I cry "Uncle!", "mea culpa" and whatever else is appropriate. We should address the issues raised by Springnuts. However, those are just arguments that the article could be improved not that it should be deleted. As stated above, one argument for deleting an article is that there should not be an article on this topic because the topic is inherently unencyclopedic. A somewhat different line of argument would assert that the topic is encyclopedic but this particular revision is so hopelessly flawed that it would be better to throw it out and rewrite it than to attempt to save it. I don't think either of these arguments is applicable here. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 22:37, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> but <b>rename</b> - This is not a joke as claimed by a self-proclaimed atheist, but a seriously held subject in the three great monotheistic religions. However 'List of' should be dropped from the title. Since it is combining various different kinds of entry into heaven (Translation, ascension, and assumption), perhaps St Paul should also ne mentioned, as he claimed to have been taken up into heaven temporarily, though he did not know if it was in the body or out of it. Some one claimed the reference to Enoch is a minor literary reference - that is true but much has been written and preached about it.

<p><b>Strong Delete</b> for the reasons set out in detail over several posts in the article's talk page. To summarize briefly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mary did not go to heaven alive, her body was assumed after her death.</li>
<li>Jesus was not a 'person,' an ordinary mortal as is meant by all other persons in this list, and experienced death prior to ascension.</li>
<li>Elijah's status, although superficially qualifying, is subject to different interpretations as laid out in the WP articles, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah.html" title="Elijah">Elijah</a>, and <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosom_of_Abraham_09ea.html" title="Bosom of Abraham">Bosom of Abraham</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/r/a/Translation_%28Mormonism%29_3114.html" title="Translation (Mormonism)">Translation (Mormonism)</a> was added to the article, but this doctrine does not, as far as I can find, say anything about 'going to heaven.'</li>
<li>Enoch and Sirach, problematic for several reasons, not the least of which is the ambiguity of Judaism on the topic of heaven in general and these personage's fate in particular.</li>
<li>Appolonius of Tyana, not a part of Abrahamic tradition, thus use of the word 'heaven' really cannot be accepted.</li>
</ol>
<p>What we have is a list of disparate persons arriving at arguably different 'destinations' by various means. Assumption, ascension, translation, no commonly accepted terms or processes. I supported this nomination and have spent much time looking into the persons and processes and have to say that all are covered in specific detail in the relevant articles, a list of this type would have to say something like...'List of people/dieties who went somewhere either before or after dying.' I just can't see any way to tie it together in one article. Please, no replies to specific points here.

<p><strike>Non-notable band, only, cannot establish notability outside the province of Cebu. Also, sources are suspect.</strike> I'm retracting my nomination and is moving for a <b>KEEP</b> while giving editors time to cite sources. Apparently, <a href="../../../c/e/b/Cebu.html" title="Cebu">down South</a>, they do have a following, and unlike other Cebu-based bands, they do deserve their own place on WP.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> (Pasensya na ho kayo, Tito Pao). When I think of <a href="../../../b/i/s/BisRock_ddab.html" title="BisRock">BisRock</a>, Missing Filemon is the one that comes to mind. I think as time goes on, they will gain more notability. Their scope is limited to only the <a href="../../../c/e/b/Cebuano_language.html" title="Cebuano language">Cebuano</a>-speaking regions since Tagalog music has a grip on the whole Philippines. I'm not in the Philippines myself, but I have managed to download their songs (my favorite is Suroy-Suroy), which are available on <a href="../../../l/i/m/LimeWire_3013.html" title="LimeWire">LimeWire</a>. There are 59 fan videos of Missing Filemon on YouTube. BTW, there are 739 Google hits with about 17 mentions on the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.Star_Cebu_7626.html" title="Sun.Star Cebu">Sun.Star Cebu</a> website, so contrary to what Evergreens78 said, it's not a stupid garage band. I'd roughly consider Missing Filemon to be as notable as the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_catal%C3%A0.html" title="Rock català">Catalan rock</a> group <a href="../../../e/l/s/Els_Pets_459b.html" title="Els Pets">Els Pets</a>, whose fans are limited to Catalan-speaking regions in Europe and nowhere else. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Sundita_7a61.html" title="User:Christopher Sundita">Chris S.</a> 05:40, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Quite a lot of that rationale isn't relevant. That a band's songs are available for download isn't relevant. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Your own subjective opinion of what is and isn't important is irrelevant</a>. And counting Google hits is not research. What is relevant here is whether the band has been independently documented, in depth, in multiple published works. And research involves looking for such things. Please <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> to show that the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria are satisfied.

<ul>
<li>Yes, I was aware of that, but my rationales were basically in response to the above comment saying that <i>Missing Filemon</i> was a "stupid garage band." If someone makes a subjective comment I don't agree with, I think I should go ahead and do the same. Subjectivity aside, I thought the Sun Star link, which is a major newspaper in Cebu and other areas, I provided above was sufficient.

<p>This list defies NPOV, No Original Research, and WP's standards on Notabilty</p>
<p>First of all, the word "Unusual" is highly problematic as it is a very subjective word, on par with "good", "bad", and "normal". A death that may seem unusual to one person may not seem so to another, and even within different contexts of data may lose its seeming unusualness.</p>
<p>If we were to change this article's title to "List of deaths generally viewed/cited as unusual", we still would be doing original research, and this would still be only presenting a biased view.</p>
<p>If we were to change this article's title to "List of deaths refered to as unusual", all the remaining entries will be sourced, however, these will be hard to find, and barely representative of the subject, and be mostly lifted from published personal opinions. (Although this option will satisfy verifiability).</p>
<p>And if we were to change this article to focus soley on statistically unusual deaths, the whole article will have to be rewritten to include rare diseases, rare instruments of destruction, etc,etc. In addition, what aspect of the death and in what context will we look at look at to declare it statistically unusual? (Of course, this will violate NOR)</p>
<p>And lastly, the subject of the list itself, "unusual deaths" is hardly notable at all. It may often pop up in trivia books (which often repeat many myths and unverifiable factoids), but this subject, by itself, does not meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>.</p>

<li>“”Keep”” but perhaps with more specific criteria. The previous discussions are pretty comprehensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meets notability criteria for lists under WP:BIO: “Instead, the list should be limited to notable people: those that already have a Wikipedia article or could plausibly have one, per this guideline.” Re: Sensationalism. Listing Isadora Duncan’s death as “unusual” may be more emotionally-involved than listing it as “road accident.” That makes it more challenging but no less valid. Actually supports NPOV: “representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by reliable sources.” If the published sources perceived the death as unusual, the encyclopedia should respect and reflect that fact, just as is done with list of deaths by date or by cause. For instance, Toilet-related Injuries are real and the subject of medical research, and the article includes a section on Famous Toilet-related Deaths and as a theme in popular culture. Re: Litvinenko death. It's unusual because poisoning by polonium is not common and was perceived as a notable way to go. Canuckle 06:19, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, basically, you're saying we should change the article to be about Deaths refered to as unusual, of notable people? Although this will be verifiable, it still is a very narrow group defined by trivial criteria, and we would have to parse through biographies and text books and news pieces to find the authors' actual reference to the death as "odd", "strange", "quirky", "unusual", etc, as using anything else to gauge the authors' opinion would lean towards original research. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 07:06, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Specifically, "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not automatically mean it is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia." The list of deaths is interesting, certainly; I enjoyed reading it. But the information in it is collected together not because it addresses a topic that is itself notable, but rather because it has entertainment value. To me, this means that <s><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INFO</a></s><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> applies.

<li><b>Keep</b> The list has 35 references, and most of the deaths are certainly by unusual means. The normal editing process can via consensus delete any which are too common. There is no reason to limit it notable people who died unusual deaths. Since the persons share the feature of diying unusual deaths, the list is not indiscriminate. Similar lists have long enjoyed a place in such reference works. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 14:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you're saying that editors should decide which deaths are unusual and which are not? This would violate NPOV, because it would be declaring what's unusual from the perspective of ourselves. And our judgement of a death as usual/unusual would be original research. As I've said before, references would only validate an entry if the author expressed explicitly that the death was odd. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 16:09, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It is not too hard of an exercise to find a reference wherein a reliable and independant commentator will say the a British noble dying from the effects of a red hot poker being stuck up his rectum is an "unusual way to go." That would satisfy your worries about it being "original research" by a Wikipedia editor thinking that to be an unusual way to go. Googling shows that this particluar article has been widely and favorably cited on other websites, so readers of Wikipedia besides those arguing here for keeping it have apparently found it useful.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:17, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The only real problem with this article is the criteria for unusualness, which (like inclusion of items in hundreds or thousands of other list articles) is handled adequately by editorial consensus. A consensus of editors applying common sense does not equal <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> in the sense meant by the policy. (If it does, most of those list articles should be nominated as well.) Other than the inclusion criteria, the article is reasonably good in that it requires the subjects to be notable persons (including people famous for the specific manner of their death) with existing articles about them, and requires attribution of the facts involved. Alternatively, if the article is not deemed worth of keeping in article space (although reading this discussion I see no consensus for deletion), it could be moved to project space <i>à la</i> <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_unusual_articles_5196.html" title="Wikipedia:List of unusual articles">Wikipedia:List of unusual articles</a>. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 20:36, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>This is a weak argument. Name one other list where "editorial consensus" on someething as subjective as "unusualness" preceeds inclusion of an item. Remember, "common sense" is <i>not</i> as common as you think. What if all the editors were from Japan, and a notable person died of a heart attack? Or there was a famous Maori who died of infection from female circumsicion? Or if someone from Latin America died from an accident related to <i>Susto</i>, a psychological disorder primarily seen in Latin America? North American editors would definately agree that it would be unusual, because it's unusual to them.</li>

<li><b>observation, from my POV</b> at first, the arguments for delete outnumbered those for keep, and I think those were from people who frequent deletion discussions and are familiar with them... and now, there's a flood of keep votes from people who are attached to this article and just don't want to see it gone. Seriously.... look at how many people are basically arguing "I like it". <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 03:57, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>This one really bothers me, but I can't avoid the issue. It's one thing to say "nonnotable" about a minor league rapper who's just trying to promote his recent CD on Wikipedia. It's another thing to say "nonnotable" about a young girl who disappeared in the Great Smoky Mountains 30 years ago - especially when the article is 15 minutes old and was written by a good editor. Unless there's a basic assumption that all missing people are notable, I don't see a way to justify inclusion. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 03:59, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Personally, I would delete this sort of article even if the event is modern and there are national news stories.

<p>Suspected hoax. The list of references is impressive but I don't think any of them refer to Demeny, while at least some of the text has been plagiarised from here: <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB76/index2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB76/index2.htm" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> There are also no obvious Google results for anyone called George Demeny in the Revolt, which seems strange if he really was a top commander.

<dd><b>Important Note</b> I did indeed create the article on Dec 26th 2006 - but only in response to an AfC request from User:Phas3d (as you can see, I clearly noted this in the very first entry to the edit history) The original AfC request (and my reponse to it) is here: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-25_5f09.html#George_Demeny_.28Demene.29" title="Wikipedia:Articles for creation/2006-12-25">Wikipedia:Articles_for_creation/2006-12-25#George_Demeny_.28Demene.29</a>. I noted at the time that the list of references appeared to be copy/pasted and requested that the submitter fix that ASAP. I regret that I do not recall what background checks I did to ensure that the article was 'for real' - but I'm usually fairly sceptical so I probably checked something. In retrospect, it is a little unlikely that User:Phas3d would produce such a well-referenced article as his/her very first contribution...he/she hasn't produced anything else after that. At any rate, I have no personal attachment to the article - I don't really care whether it stays or goes. My profuse apologies if I allowed junk into the Encyclopedia - that was most certainly not my goal! <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 17:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - the hoax theory is quite likely. There is a French artist under that name on Google, but he does not appear to have any commonability with this article.

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. For one thing, the first half at least is a direct copy from <a href="http://www.taiwanadvice.com/fm2710_366.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.taiwanadvice.com/fm2710_366.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Also, a main thrust of the article is contained in this assertion: <i>"The Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions do not specifically define the terminology of "the occupying power," and many researchers are confused about this aspect. In fact the conqueror is the occupying power."</i> But is this true? Is the conqueror "in fact" the occupying power? Or is this just something the author of the article (lifting from the document at the above link) are asserting? No proof is offered that this is codified in the rules of war (in fact, the opposite is stated (<i>"The... Conventions do not specifically define the terminology..."</i>). I have to accept the arguments of the commentors that this a neologism and (partly) an opinion piece. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 16:30, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Poorly sourced means it needs to be sourced, not that it should be deleted. Notability doesn't seem to be an issue here; it is referencing an actual type of military occupation, and remember: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="meta:Wiki_is_not_paper">Wiki is not paper</a>. After reading the article myself, I can agree that that what it is trying to describe it fails spectarularly at. Nevertheless, it is in fact describing an actual condition specified by current laws of war, and deserves space in the wikipedia. It should definitely be heavily rewritten, both for ease of understanding and more sources.

I wasn't being aggressive, I was being assertive to make sure there was no possible doubt over my original nomination. Plasticbottle 03:27, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I was wrong on that point. Conceded and corrected; apologises for my error. He did say it was proposed as a merger. All the same, your language was <i>not</i> merely assertive. In talking about attempts to "alter the meaning", and to try "to discredit it" you were assuming ulterior motives, with no real foundation for doing so. That is quite aggressive language that you used, and hardly in keeping with the requirement to assume good faith. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 03:45, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Edit conflict) Plasticbottle, I'm sorry if it seemed I was trying to discredit you, this was not at all my intention. Your nomination is within the sphere of AFD. It did, however, read to some (myself included) like it carried along with it a merge proposal. Above, for example, Smerdis of Tlön has changed their&#160;!vote to keep after I made it clear that a delete result here <i>would not necessarily</i> result in the information being included at <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>. So it's probably good that I made that clear, at least from that editor's perspective. As to your proposal to delete, I do not oppose it. I have said keep or delete is fine; I am abstaining from that question. I am glad that you have also now made it clear that there is no merge proposal from you. I did misread your intention somewhat, but I think it's all clear now and I apologize for amplifying my misunderstanding. <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> — 03:35, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The problem is that there are parts of this article — at least, the use as a central character of two episodes of the long running and (in)famous cartoon <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a></i> — that are noteworthy in the highest degree and ought to be in the article in chief. Indeed, they ought to be there even if a separate "in popular culture" article is kept. Unfortunately, putting the words "in popular culture" in an article's title seems to be like waving a red flag at a bull, certain to attract unwanted attention. Since neither Dr. Dawkins nor some of his admirers were much pleased with his treatment on the cartoon. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:22, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is hard to see in what way a cartoon series is "noteworthy in the highest degree". Are we to use cartoons as a source on Wikipedia? Consulting Disney when writing natural histories of mice or deer, perhaps? I think it fair to say there are two groups of editors, those who edit the article and don't want trivia, and those who want to add trivia but do not otherwise edit the article. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 06:16, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

This article was created to provide information on S-TEC which is a well known entity in General Aviation. The only previous article with mention of S-TEC was about the Daewoo S-TEC engine. The parent company, Meggitt has an article in Wikipedia. I feel it is appropriate to create this article to demonstrate that there is more than just an engine called S-TEC.

<p>One non-independent reference is used to site where the company is located.

The other non-independent link is to support that the company is a part of the bigger company. Both company's websites make this claim. Why should this be disputed? Neither reference could be deemed independent.63.64.214.151 14:00, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Notability seems to be that he was elected to a slngle term on a local school board and then was a long-time respected professor. Admittedly was notable within the small town in which he university is located that his death was mentioned in the local paper and notable enough within his university that his death was mentioned in that university's alumni newsletter. Nonetheless, I'm not sure such local notability truly satisfies <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Article says he "published articles" but gives no indication of what articles/are they well know/etc. Note that the last two items listed as "References" are not actually references to Bennett at all. One is a reference to a different person, who is quoted in the article. The other is a reference to Bennett's church. Neither of these "references" mentions Bennett himself in any way. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 09:48, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article doesn't need deleted, it just needs work. The bulk of the man's published work was likely pre-Internet, so let's not jump to conclusions and assume he was nobody just because Google doesn't immediately turn up a ton of relevant citations. The article does read like an obit and needs to be rewritten. Also, the quote about being missed by his "smoking buddies" was vandalism and has been removed. --66.38.55.37 01:19, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Um WHAT?</b> What in the hell is wrong with you people?&gt;!?! It's just a bracket for a tournament that a very reputable wrestling website is doing. It's simply for people to get a visual feel of how the tournament is going. Frankly I could careless if it gets deleted. The tournament is almost over. Also, an explanation of the non-notable poll crap would be nice. The notice of deletion needs work. You need to explain more about WHY an article has been nominated. Also please show me where it says I can't have something like this up. MystiKalLimitz02 2:23, 31 March 2007</li>

<li><b>Wrong</b> As for those points, this is why they're wrong about my article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#SOAP</a> point 2 is about self-promotion. With this article, there is no self-promotion. I had nothing to do with the setting up of this tournament and had nothing to do with the results. I just posted them for the people who created it so they could have a visual feel of what was going on in the tournament. As for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> point 5; It does have merrit but in my defense, I'm a college student who has very little time and I did plan on updating the article to have more stuff about the website it came from. I just needed a little more time than what you guys seem to want to give. And as for the last thing about the notability. I think that's very subjective. It's all in what the user thinks is important. My article is non-biased. There isn't just one person deciding who wins what. I know I need to add more stuff to make it Wikipedia friendly and if given that chance I will. I didn't know a tournament would cause such fuss. It's not like I'm one of those guys editing other peoples stuff about important things and adding in immature sexual references to stuff.</li>

<p>Despite confident assertions to the contrary in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rajan_Sankaran_d416.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rajan Sankaran">the last AfD</a>, the article still doesn't assert notability, and no evidence for his notability has ever been provided. Indeed, it's practically at speedy delete level at the moment because of this. Certainly, if there's actual evidence that fits <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and so on that shows he's notable, and we can use them to improve the article, he shouldn't be deleted, but no such evidence exists in the article, and, even in the last AfD, none was ever provided.</p>
<p>Allow me to summarise the current article, because it might help anyone objecting to the deletion see why it needs improved:</p>
<p>Rajan Sankaran is educated as a homeopath, and has a business he inherited from his father. He developed a few theories about homeopathy, and self-publishes books <a href="http://www.thespiritofhomoeopathy.com/company.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thespiritofhomoeopathy.com/company.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> (note the company site is a subpage of his website) and has a computer program for sale <a href="http://www.thespiritofhomoeopathy.com/vquest/vquest.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thespiritofhomoeopathy.com/vquest/vquest.html" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>. He has learned an effective way to get information from patients - just like every new practitioner of any form of medicine, conventional or alternative, does after a time.</p>
<p>If there's more about him that makes him unambiguously notable, please, please, add it to the article. Because the current article is not showing it. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 06:49, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> A very notable homeopath. His books are widely distributed and influential<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22influential%22+rajan+sankaran&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22influential%22+rajan+sankaran&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. He lectures to sold-out audiences around the world. He is frequently cited in other publications in his field. His writings have been incorporated into the main homeopathic databases. Note that he's far more notable than <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Campbell_af7d.html" title="Anthony Campbell">Anthony Campbell</a>, a virtually unknown critic of homeopathy that <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinwalker_9c72.html" title="User:Skinwalker">Skinwalker</a> and others have supported in an AFD. It is especially fascinating that the points they used to support Campbell (i.e. editor of a homeopathic journal, prominent member of an association, author of a number of books) are, in Sankaran's case not given any validity. The only discernible difference between the two (other than Sankaran being obviously more well-known and respected) is that one has criticized homeopathy and one has promoted it. There has been an obvious effort to remove articles about extremely well-known and well-regarded homeopaths (the AFD for <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Vithoulkas_c798.html" title="George Vithoulkas">George Vithoulkas</a> was a striking, even breathtaking example) and to promote articles of insignificant critics. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 16:29, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. DGG has a good point in that we probably should be comparing notability to the notability of others in the field.

<p>This seems like nonsense or advertising, it is also biased as it claims that this company is "legendary" without providing any other information. The format of this page is a disaster, the writer seems to need some help if this is a serious article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I would like the closing administrator to take a look at the AfD of "Kurdish Genocide" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> - I think that it is shameful that so many Greek editors are showing up one after another in some sort of a pie-throwing contest. I completely second what Deniz said above. Closing administrator should also note that the real deal behind this is a debate going on at <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontic_Greek_Genocide_85b7.html" title="Pontic Greek Genocide">Pontic Greek Genocide</a> which has been going on for months. Come on guys, we have been over this and I felt that we had gone past this already, what is going on? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:05, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually the relevance of Greek opinion on Kurdish issues is well-known. Hell, Ocalan was actually hiding in the Greek Embassy in Kenya when he was caught. Cooking up conspiracy theories to discredit large numbers of opinions is more shameful in my humble opinion.--<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomitius_c4a0.html" title="User:Domitius">Domitius</a> 21:09, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Conspiracy theory? Vote-stacking was proven in that AfD - as I said, to keep this AfD focused, it was only a note to the closing admin to check the AfD of the article "KG" (this one was created afterwards, and as such this AfD is the first one for the one with the small "g") <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:40, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>What is truly shameful is the suggestion that Greek editors should not exercise their right to vote on any article they see fit. <a href="../../../k/%C3%A9/k/User%7EK%C3%A9kr%C5%8Dps_4c7f.html" title="User:Kékrōps">·ΚέκρωΨ·</a> 21:13, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Any editor of any nationality can edit here. Anyway, the (ir)relevancy of Greeks is not important. I think you guys should not vote with anything other than the article in your mind. Please once again take a look what you are voting for, a disambiguation page for Kurdish genocide with one of the items being Human rights of Kurdish people in X. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 22:38, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>(edit-conflict) Of course you can vote - but Domitius's suggestion and implication in his vote is also shameful, trying to discredit the Turkish users with words like "TR POV-pushing" and "we have seen this before", when the <i>original AfD was proposed by an admin who is British</i>. As I said, vote along - but I would like the closing administrator to take a look at the vote-stacking that was done in the last AfD and the debate at the PGG article. I invite any of the keep voters to show a press release from any major news organization or et al which refer to the human rights of Kurds in Turkey as "Kurdish genocide" - if not, it is WP:OR and undue weight.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:28, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Im sure the article will get a lot of attention if let be and thus improvement, but that is not a reason to delete it. Using euphemistic words is semantic games and POV and usually the intend of the aggressors.

<dd>But being a serious encyclopedia is. There are no "agressors" Aristo, as I have stated before, the original AfD was proposed by an admin who is British, not Turkish. That report you have just cited was the only one present in the article to begin with, and this was discussed before - it is not about censorship, but it is also making sure that Wikipedia is not a platform to propogate minority opinions. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, Undue weight and most common name are definitely applicable in this case. I have asked all of the keep voters to show even one major news media release calling the human rights of Kurds in Turkey as "Kurdish genocide", and it has yet to happen. And nobody is fooling anyone Aristo, the only reason why there is such a debate here and why certain editors are interested here are because of the debate at <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontic_Greek_Genocide_85b7.html" title="Pontic Greek Genocide">Pontic Greek Genocide</a>, thus my comment above to the administrator about this activity bordering on disruption and the turning of Wikipedia to a national battleground. Again, it is really not cool people. How many Turkish editors show up at Greece-related AfDs and consistently vote in a way that would be perceived as "getting one over the Turks"? Come on, I had really thought that we were past this between TR-GR editors in Wikipedia.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 14:30, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Baris, I really don't agree with the logic that it is not "cool" if Greek users vote here, and that Greeks are "getting over the Turks". I think we already had that discussion, and I really don't think it helps reopening it. I believe that we should focus on arguments and on the dab itself, which I see was also a subject of discussion <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_discussion_Log_2006_December_22_12f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2006 December 22">here</a>. Therefore, both the article's AfD and the dab's RfD have a long history where not only Greeks and Turks but other nationalities' users have been involved.

<p><b>Keep</b> - This is merely a disambiguation page at present, and can usefully remain such. I express no view as to whether the Turkish-Kurdish civil war was (or involved) genocide.

<dd>But by having Human rights of Kurds in Turkey in that disambiguation page, we are asserting that "Human Rights of Kurds in Turkey" is a "Kurdish genocide". That does not make sense, I guess what is meant is that there was a genocide against Kurdish people in Turkey. So there is an assertion about that. Also is this any different than making disambiguation pages "X genocide" with items like Human rights of X in Y, where X can be Indian, aborigines/natives in Y, many peoples in Africa and Americas, Y, you name it, US, UK, France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, etc? Do we have such disambiguation pages? Why do we have this? I am not saying that Kurdish people have had no problems in Turkey, but they had presidents, prime ministers, many ministers, many many MPs (probably overrepresented) in Turkey, as well. This is not true in the cases I just mentioned. The problems stemmed in earlier years because of the abolishment of caliphacy and sultanate. Nowadays, it's because of Kenan Evren junta and Turkey-PKK conflict, and also the prevalent feudalism in the region. I don't know much about Anfal campaign, I cannot state whether it can be called a genocide or not. Currently we have basically only Desmond Fernandes who calls what happneded in Turkey a genocide. Unfortunately he does not have a Wiki-article yet. A Google search shows us that "Desmond Fernandes is the Coordinator of the Institute of Tourism and Development Studies, De Montfort University, Bedford, England"</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Complete BS, this is a soapbox article, go to Turkish Republican Library (TBMM Kutuphanesi) and see primary, PRIMARY documents. Any person dying in Turkey is -for some reason- classified as genocide by western scholars. Actually, only 2 scholars just say that Turks killed kurds while the World Genocide Foundation (or whatever) does not recognize this at all. <a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorrybean_3c4f.html" title="User:Korrybean">Korrybean</a> 02:13, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> Clearly there is consensus that there was genocide under Saddam, but I'm not sure if it is appropriate to link Turkey to this. Turkey denies existence of Kurds (calling them Mountain Turks), but unless mainstream sources connect Turkey to actual genocide, it is inappropriate. Nevertheless the title is most often used in connection with atrocities committed by the Saddam regime, so a redirect is proper. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 03:37, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Turkey does not DENY existence of Kurds. As far as I know, Kenan Evren is the only (ex)government official who referred to Kurds as Mountain Turks, and he hasn't been a government official since 1991. I don't think there is a government policy of labeling Kurds as Mountain Turks. All the ethnicities are under one umbrella term, Turkish, which refers to being a citizen of Turkey. You might be referring to that. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 03:54, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are probably right about the lack of government policy on "Mountain Turks", but from what I have read (and I am far from an expert on Turkish matters) government of Turkey does recognise the existence of Kurdish (and Armenian?) ethnicity, so they are only "Turks". This would be similar to French policy in France for immigrant populations, with the exception that Kurds are obviously not immigrants. But also in France there is no official recognition of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breton_language.html" title="Breton language">Breton language</a>, but in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brittany.html" title="Brittany">Brittany</a> the French government does not stop the use of the indigenous language. But anyway, I am not saying that "Kurdish genocide" should be used in connection with Turkey. I only suggest a redirect to the Saddam genocide of Kurds. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 04:08, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I placed the initial speedy tag as this seemed to be a local band of little note. A google search revealed many hits, but upon closer inspection, these were mostly for <i>another</i> band named Phineas Gage. If this article is kept, it should at least be moved to Phineas Gage (death metal band) and replaced with a dab. Otherwise, the article needs to be <i>fundamentally</i> rewritten, hence deletion is appropriate for now. <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 05:48, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Believe it or not, there are many unsigned bands with the same name, this band name is not owned by any label in existance so that does not disqualify any of the bands who do use the name. This band you roadied for, is probably now defunct like the other one which was brought up. The bottom line is, this tab was not occupied, and now it is listed with the correct and accurate information about a band name Phineas Gage out of Orlando Fl. Thus there is no grounds for deletion.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> A detailed reading of the discussion page at the centralized discussion leads me to the conclusion that there was <i>not</i> consensus for stub articles for epsodes, but rather for only general articles until there was sufficient material to break it out into session articles, and then eventually into ones for each episode. These articles are none of them even approaching the stage of individual episode articles. The discussion frequently referred to school articles as a model, and I think its clear that discussions here are against individual articles until the material is sufficient. The bulk of the discussion was some months ago, and there were notes at the end that the consensus in the more generally interested WP community was moving against episode articles. At any rate, it behooves us to state our independent views here. I note that this particular articlew is one sentence long. Speedy as empty is my view. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:25, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> A detailed reading of the discussion page at the centralized discussion leads me to the conclusion that there was <i>not</i> consensus for stub articles for epsodes, but rather for only general articles until there was sufficient material to break it out into session articles, and then eventually into ones for each episode. These articles are none of them even approaching the stage of individual episode articles. The discussion frequently referred to school articles as a model, and I think its clear that discussions here are against individual articles until the material is sufficient. The bulk of the discussion was some months ago, and there were notes at the end that the consensus in the more generally interested WP community was moving against episode articles. At any rate, it behooves us to state our independent views here. Speedy as empty is my view. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:26, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There was <i>not</i> consensus for stub articles for epsodes, but rather for only general articles until there was sufficient material to break it out into session articles, and then eventually into ones for each episode.

<li><b>Delete</b> A detailed reading of the discussion page at the centralized discussion leads me to the conclusion that there was <i>not</i> consensus for stub articles for epsodes, but rather for only general articles until there was sufficient material to break it out into session articles, and then eventually into ones for each episode. These articles are none of them even approaching the stage of individual episode articles. The discussion frequently referred to school articles as a model, and I think its clear that discussions here are against individual articles until the material is sufficient. The bulk of the discussion was some months ago, and there were notes at the end that the consensus in the more generally interested WP community was moving against episode articles.

<li><b>Delete</b> A detailed reading of the discussion page at the centralized discussion leads me to the conclusion that there was <i>not</i> consensus for stub articles for epsodes, but rather for only general articles until there was sufficient material to break it out into session articles, and then eventually into ones for each episode. These articles are none of them even approaching the stage of individual episode articles. The discussion frequently referred to school articles as a model, and I think its clear that discussions here are against individual articles until the material is sufficient. The bulk of the discussion was some months ago, and there were notes at the end that the consensus in the more generally interested WP community was moving against episode articles. At any rate, it behooves us to state our independent views here. I note that this particular articlew is one sentence long. Speedy as empty is my view. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:23, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I placed the initial speedy tag as this seemed to be a local band of little note. A google search revealed many hits, but upon closer inspection, these were mostly for <i>another</i> band named Phineas Gage. If this article is kept, it should at least be moved to Phineas Gage (death metal band) and replaced with a dab. Otherwise, the article needs to be <i>fundamentally</i> rewritten, hence deletion is appropriate for now. <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 05:48, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Believe it or not, there are many unsigned bands with the same name, this band name is not owned by any label in existance so that does not disqualify any of the bands who do use the name. This band you roadied for, is probably now defunct like the other one which was brought up. The bottom line is, this tab was not occupied, and now it is listed with the correct and accurate information about a band name Phineas Gage out of Orlando Fl. Thus there is no grounds for deletion.</p>

<li>I have restored your cuts, added sources for the ones without sources and removed the only living person who is unsourced. If you don't like the name List of ex-gay people then move it to List of people who formerly identified as LGBT. I remain at a loss to understand how "For people who were once identified as LGBT but no longer are" is in any way vague. It requires editor to be able to answer and source two questions: Was the person at one time identified as LGBT? If no, then don't add. If yes, then go to question two Does the person now identify as heterosexual? If no, then don't add. If yes, then add and source. Not that complicated really. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:37, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - If a person makes a <i>public statement</i> that they are gay and then later makes a <i>public statement</i> that they are not, there is no implication of their privacy. And with all due respect, your ignorance about who is or isn't gay or who has or hasn't made an "issue" of their sexuality has no bearing on this discussion. The fact that you characterize the list as containing "actors and actresses" indicates to me that you didn't even bother to fully read the list before commenting. The list as it now stands consists of one actor/singer, two musicians, a professional "reparative therapist," an evangelical minister, a journalist, a writer and a retail heir. If you bother to read some of the linked articles, you would realize that their identification as formerly gay is notable, verifiable and important. Some of the people on the list made their careers denouncing homosexuality. Others make their living performing therapy designed to turn gay men straight and writing books and delivering lectures on the topic. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:24, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Cheerful Reply</b> Hey, have you read <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, specifically the portion I pointed out? Still applies. As has been pointed out below, most of the list don't mention it in the article itself, which makes it non-applicable here. Likewise, if they've formerly denounced or otherwise attacked the LBGT community in the past that makes it MORE important that this be examined very, very carefully. My comments about it being non-notable applied specifically to Anne Heche and Tatu, in regards to the fact that Anne Heche's sexuality is not former, and Tatu are on record as never having been Lesbian. If Anne Heche's sexuality can't be sufficiently covered in her own damned article, why does it deserve a full paragraph in a topic which doesn't apply per the established criteria?Cheers, <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> ○ <a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELankybugger_4866.html" title="User talk:Lankybugger">speak</a> ○ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lankybugger_113c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lankybugger">see</a> ○ 19:30, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete As-Is</b> - After reviewing the article in question, as well as the sources, I think the most responsible course of action is to remove the list due to possibly inaccurate material. Here are my concerns regarding the article, which need to be addressed promptly so as not to violate WP policy towards biographies of living persons:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. In most cases, the main pages for the individuals do not mention the past homosexuality. This should be a prerequisite to appearing on the list.</dd>
<dd>2. The title of the article (and proposed titles) imply that the individuals self identified (ie. came out) as an alternative sexuality. As noted below, this is not the case for most people on the list (at least according to the sources provided).
<dl>
<dd>-Robert Graves is only mentioned (and it is not sourced) for having "homosexual experiences in his youth". In my mind, this does not immediately make him gay, especially since no elaboration is given as to these experiences.</dd>
<dd>-Ted Haggard has never to the best of my knowledge identified as anything other than heterosexual. While it might be tempting to infer from his recent claims to be "completely heterosexual" that he once was something else, I don't believe we can make this leap.</dd>
<dd>-Russell Miller's "flirt[ing] with bisexuality" does not make him a bisexual anymore than my flirting with pot makes me a pothead.</dd>
<dd>-Lou Reed's supposed bisexuality is based around claims made by another, and was denied by Reed himself (based on what I can infer from the notes on the article in question and a bit of googling).</dd>
<dd>-t.A.T.u. "were never lesbians in the first place". This comes directly from the source given supporting their transformation.</dd>
<dd>-Worsthorne's article (when read carefully) does not state that the journalist ever identified as homosexual. It instead references how he and many of his peers preferred the simplicity of same sex company during the course of their education. Given the very abstract tone of the article, I don't feel comftorable labeling Worsthorne as <i>any</i> sexuality without corresponding accounts.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>3. None of the sources (aside from the t.A.T.u. article and Cohen's webpage) put me at ease about the claims they support. I mentioned me concerns with the vaugeness of Worsthorne's piece. I don't have information regarding the specifice passages in the Aldrich book or <i>New Idea</i> article which support the claims about Bowie and Miller (respectively). I don't fully understand the reference supporting the claim about Reed. Graves has no citation at all. Finally, news articles about Haggard that I have read do nothing more than print speculation regarding Haggard's previous orientation.</dd>
<dd>4. My final concern regards the "hot" nature of this topic. Without multiple reliable references for each claim, we put ourselves in serious risk of seriously offending and damaging the images of the individuals named. While I don't think we face any libel issues (so long as we are merely repeating what others have said) I certainly do not want to ruin any lives (or, in the case of Graves, memories) by giving rise to false sensationalism.</dd>
<dd>Taking the above into stock, the only individual who I feel comftorable leaving on the list is Cohen. Since his <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Cohen_%28author%29_5640.html" title="Richard Cohen (author)">page</a> already contains the information, I don't see any need to duplicate it here. Given that, I offer my suggestion of delete, as given above. <a href="../../../-/b/o/User_talk%7E-Bobby_2c83.html" title="User talk:-Bobby">→</a><a href="../../../-/b/o/User%7E-Bobby_56ae.html" title="User:-Bobby"><em style="color:green;font-variant:small-caps;cursor:crosshair">Bobby</em></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_-Bobby_0e62.html" title="Special:Contributions/-Bobby">←</a> 16:51, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Too many potential <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> issues here, plus it's very difficult to really verify what is truth and what is rumor, or whether certain individuals were ever actually gay to begin with (as noted above, TATU being a good example). <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:39, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> I know I'm rowing against the tide here, but I feel I have to say something. ALL biographical information is "prone to BLP issues," even the least contentious claims you could think of. That alone is not a reason to delete, being 'prone' to problems violates no wikipedia policy. IF this list satisfies <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> then there is no choice other to keep. I agree it's a mess in current form, so I won't vote keep, but if it is deleted, I would please ask that it be done without prejudice so that a fully-sourced version comporting to BLP and verifiability guidelines would not be simply speedied out of existance. This list is not POV, not OR and not unallowable so long as it relies on published information and reliable sources. The fact that, as 23skidoo noted "[...]difficult to really verify what is truth[...]" is not a real problem, Wikipedia is not concerned with empirical truth, only what can be verified through reliable sources. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 19:47, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In my mind, the article's content cleary constitutes unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material. As a result, it seems to me like the offending material should be deleted (as Samuel Blanning attempted to do earlier). I propose we set a time period by which time sources must be provided for any currently questionable claims. If community consensus is that the article does not meet BLP standards by the end of that time, I further suggest removing any questionable material, and continuing the AfD discussion based on a page history snapshot. If nobody objects, I'd like to set the deadline for 16:00 (UTC) tomorrow (Friday, 3-30). <a href="../../../-/b/o/User_talk%7E-Bobby_2c83.html" title="User talk:-Bobby">→</a><a href="../../../-/b/o/User%7E-Bobby_56ae.html" title="User:-Bobby"><em style="color:green;font-variant:small-caps;cursor:crosshair">Bobby</em></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_-Bobby_0e62.html" title="Special:Contributions/-Bobby">←</a> 20:22, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Jimbo's oft-repeated opinion that we can do without random "I'm sure I heard it somewhere" crap about living individuals.

<li><b>Delete</b>, this is just too much people.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, it needs sourcing: remove unsourced living people, and after you've done that, go to all the various lists of people belonging to (or formerly belonging to) various religious and political groups and do the same. If you think sexual orientation is "crap", others think that religion and politics are too, and membership in or adherance to certain religious or political groups is illegal in some places, and may not be very nice, so it could be defamatory as well. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 03:34, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>exactly</b> we are very careful about changed political or religious identification as a classification for living people who did not specifically so identify themselves.

<li><b>delete</b> As Bobby pointed out, this list is a mish-mash of people who have publicly <i>denied</i> they were gay, not renounced they were gay. I originally nominated this list because it is a nightmare to source, because it isn't really notable, and because of the BLP concerns brought up above. (btw, thankyou very much for not bothering to tell me it was at DRV) I'd like to comment on the subtitle of the article though - the list of actual LGB people is split by alphabet because of size, and whoever created this article must just have been following precedent. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 06:49, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Having found sources for a number of the items through a simple Google search, I contend that your claim that sourcing is a nightmare is a bit on the hyperbolic side. Given the amount of ink that's regularly spilled when someone comes out or when they go back in, contending that the topic isn't notable is ludicrous. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:12, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> because Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a collection of trivia about the suspected sexuality of a semi-random sampling of celebrities.

<p>This is an article about a living person with no notable accomplishments. Lubos Motl set up this article by himself (user Lumidek who created this article is identified as Lubos Motl). Then, the article was created on the Czech wikipedia based on this article. Lubos Motl claims to have published articles in Czech press, however his letters to the editors are of no or minor importance and are mostly published on web servers or by minor media.

His self-made claims to authorship of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matrix_string_theory.html" title="Matrix string theory">Matrix string theory</a> are not backed up by his authorship of the key paper that the article refers to.

<dd>"all PhDs are expected to publish articles" yes, and the N as an academic will depend on the number and quality and citedness. The necessary peer review of accomplishments is precisely that found in the peer review of the articles, and the later review of the body of work by academic peer committees.</dd>

<li>I am trying to put up as much information/sourcing as I can find so that people can make a deletion decision based on more complete evidence. Note that I have not voted. The text I added is sourced from the articles linked. There is no original research here. I have also seen the religion mentioned in published books, I just don't happen to have any of them on my desk at the moment. I would go look them up for you, but I have work that needs to be done offline. Did you check to see whether the article was verifiable/notable before you nominated it for deletion? What did you turn up? - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMae</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">t</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">c</a> - <a href="../../../w/p/n/WP%7EWPN_02d0.html" title="WP:WPN">wpn</a>)</sup> 13:39, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

Adding material from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">unrealiable sources</a> or just plain old unattributed material is not constructive in building an article.

<li>I understand that. Perhaps you would generate less antagonism if you would provide an explanation of why the sources are inadequate before deleting the information. Also, I believe that it is generally appropriate, when you come across unsourced text on Wikipedia, to make an attempt to source it before deleting it, and to accompany your deletion/deletion nom with an explanation of the avenues you pursued. There is a lot of verifiable information on Wikipedia that is just improperly sourced, so just the fact that the sources an article cites are inadequate isn't enough to justify deleting it. (The fact that the only information I can find on Religio Romana is self-published on the internet <i>is</i> enough, so <b>delete.</b> I can't find enough in books for a stub - it's not even mentioned in <i>Which Witch is Which</i>.) - <a href="../../../a/d/e/User%7EAdelaMae_b57f.html" title="User:AdelaMae">AdelaMae</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelaMae_cb14.html" title="User talk:AdelaMae">t</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AdelaMae_415e.html" title="Special:Contributions/AdelaMae">c</a> - <a href="../../../w/p/n/WP%7EWPN_02d0.html" title="WP:WPN">wpn</a>)</sup> 18:17, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The term "revisionist" in the nom, and the extremely aggressive behaviour of the nominator make me question whether this is in fact a good faith AfD. A quick glance at a few of the non-English wikipedias show that the entry is in need of a translation from another language, not deletion. - <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWeniWidiWiki_b655.html" title="User:WeniWidiWiki">WeniWidiWiki</a> 20:26, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I am reluctant to delete any page for something which might be a religion, but the sourcing is very weak. if this in in the other WPs, then perhaps there are some sources there. But it did not help for various parties to delete the admittedly pathetic external links during the course of the AfD. I've restored them. If they lead to any real sources, the article should be kept. External link as such do not have to be independent RSs--links to an organization home page and so on are acceptable there. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 22:01, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sure. articles get improved at AfD. I will sometimes say either weak keep, but I'll change it if nothing more is added when challenged, or the opposite, Delete unless something comes in.--and so do other eds. It's not a matter of the&#160;!votes. The criterion is <i>sourceable.</i> I do not advocate deleting articles where the author hasn't found the material, just of deleting them if there appears to be no material to find.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Google is only returning promotion or self-promotion sites, and clearly a lot of advertisement. Does the status of an <i>highly advertised athlete on the web</i> meets the criterion for notability? None of the big claims about him (apart from the fact that he has a fair web presence by virtue of the advertisement and promotionals) could be verified as fact so far. I have posted a lot of requests to get help expansion of the article. But, so far nothing came up, and there is no reason to believe that something will come up.

<ul>
<li>How so? The <b>Wiki standard</b> tells us that the notability criterion shared by many is - <i>A topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple non-trivial published works that are reliable and independent of the subject</i> (<a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>). And, that independent sources may not include <i>Self-promotion, autobiography, and product placement are not the routes to having an encyclopaedia article. The published works should be someone else writing about the subject</i> (amazon.com as vendor fairly misses to be an independent source). Besides, the specific notability guideline for biographies tells us that for a general bio the subject should have <i>a credible independent biography</i>, for athletes the subject may be <i>competitors who have played in a fully professional league or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport, or competitors who have played or competed at the highest level in amateur sports</i> (this was claimed of the subject by never verified), and for writers/journalists the subject may be <i>regarded as an important figure or is widely cited by their peers or successors</i> (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>).

But, that doesn't mean that I don't understand wikipedia notability standards, and I don't understand promotional sites. Unfortunately, I work in an advertising agency (affiliated with <a href="../../../j/w/t/JWT_1d1f.html" title="JWT">JWT</a>) and there is a possibility that while you may know everything about the subject, I may be more knowledgeable about promotional work (though not necessarily so). As long the wikipedia standards of establishing notability is followed I have no problems with the subject. This is not a personal vendetta against a person unknown to me (apart from the fact that he is well advertised). I haver already quoted all the guidelines that stand against the article, and none of the people who know much better than I do have been able to provide anything that meets those criterion (apart from more promotional stuff, including those of a vendor of the book written by the subject). May be I haven't noticed that wikipedia is a democracy now, and AfDs have turned into voting boxes. Sorry, again for all the trouble.

This cannot be compared to the Roy C. Strickland article. This is a mere stub. The Roy Strickland article is concise, thorough, and wery well-written. There is no comparison. Strickland ran for office in two states. He was a pioneer of the LA GOP. No comparison, as I see it. In addition, Strickland has an impressive business career.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. You've misunderstood me. I'm not saying the articles are directly comparable. <i>One</i> of the arguments posed by two of the editors in favor of keeping Strickland is that all major party candidates for U.S. Congress should be considered automatically notable, regardless of other notability criteria. If Strickland has other item of notability, then that's applicable in his debate, but it's beside the point that I'm addressing here. The point <i>here</i> is that if that <i>specific</i> argument gains traction and indeed seems to be a consensus among editors, then that sentiment does directly affect this one. I've started a new topic on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28people%29_07f7.html#Politicians:_Losing_congressional_candidates_automatically_notable.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)">talk page of WP:BIO</a> to solicit input there on the issue. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 06:14, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The 100 year test is not a generally accepted criterion--I think if it were formally proposed now it would be soundly rejected, as it makes no sense whatsoever. WP is not intended for the 22nd century, but is an encyclopedia intended for current use now, and whatever part is still relevant in 100 years will be of historical interest only.We are likely to have far more sophisticated reference sources by then.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is without any doubt encyclopedic information that could helps people who are interested about this tragedy to have exact numbers and names of victims. How old the victim were, how many fathers, mothers, preteen childred died there, how many family members died there. It's also useful for book writers or journalists who want to write articles about terrorist's attacks to have these exact information. And most important thing, it helps to fully understand extent of this tragedy. Without list of victims information about Beslan school hostage crisis is simply incomplete. And very last thing. The main article contains the list of terrorists. Is this OK&#160;? This is not 'memorial'&#160;? Because for some people those terorists are heros. So murders can have their memorial&#160;? <b>If there is the list of terrorists then what's wrong with the list of their victims&#160;?

<li><b>Delete</b> It is not necessary to have a directory of each person who died in a tragedy to appreciate the magnitude of the tragedy. Summary information in the main article is sufficient. Wikipedia is not a memorial.

The fact that he has written books and been in some DVDs does not automatically establish notability. Have his books/DVDs been reviewed? Has anyone other than IMDB written a bio for him?

<li>Yes, I see what you are saying and this is actually a pretty tough call. Josh is all over the place, but not in any <i>major source</i>. However, I give him the <i>benefit of the doubt</i> and think that he is notable enough to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> just by the skin of his teeth.

<p>Poorly sourced. One source merely warns of a <i>potential</i> new apartheid. Another looks at the influence Australia may have had on South African apatheid 55 years ago.

<p>I wasn't aware that notable information could be deleted within two days because it isn't well sourced enough. This is clearly notable article, because Australia's policies inspired those of South Africa-- this is in the historical record, too. Even if it was 55 years ago, it's notable for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Encyclopedias are supposed to cover the past in just as much detail as the present, when it comes to politics.</li>
<li>The allegation is still used against Australian society today, even though it's blatantly false in my opinion. (this is comparible to the allegation of economic apartheid in the United States. to me it is blatantly false, but it is a politically notable accusation given the history involved.)</li>
</ol>
<p>It is hypocrisy to delete this article and keep the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> article. So, because this is notable, the answer is to add to it, and source it, just like any other article. We shouldn't delete it because it stifles a potentially notable article from emerging. <b>Keep</b>.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 20:10, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Judging by Urthogie's comments, it seems the name is at least wrong. I'm not sure what the title of the article would be, but "Allegations of Australian apartheid" definitely seems odd, if this is basically a historical issue. I'm not sure what the sources are for any article though; I guess the question is whether a person should be able to make several articles and then say they'll source them later.

<dd>Which is why I said merge it back to where it came from. Not Delete. It should have stayed at Allegations of apartheid until it was bursting out of it's little section - not popped over to a new article as soon as you found one real reference and two tangential ones. It was a stretch for me not to say something along the lines of what Cyberjunkie said below.

<li><b>Delete</b> Fails notability.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>, while (IMO) one reference is enough for a barely-there stub (but definitely not for anything better), I do not see any evidence that this term is in widespread use.

<p>As explained at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Physics_a4a8.html#Physical_nullification" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Physics">WikiProject Physics Talk</a>, this page is an exercise in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Original Research</a> on a non-notable topic. Google returns 17 hits on "physical nullification", not including WP and mirrors, most of which don't refer to this topic (<i><a href="http://www.gilasvirsky.com/wib2007.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gilasvirsky.com/wib2007.html" rel="nofollow">e.g.,</a></i> "the physical nullification and conjugal rape experienced by many women in the West").

The same goes for the part about <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wormhole.html" title="Wormhole">wormholes</a> — it's OR because we have no evidence that Forward said any of it, and it probably just stems from the imagination of 66.16.45.2 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.16.45.2_308a.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.16.45.2">contribs</a>), trying to connect an old <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">SF</a> idea with something more modern.</p>
<p>If you cut out the OR, there's not enough left to merit an article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Seriously, these pages have been up for over six months. And if you want to delete them then go ahead. But you will never convince me that when one were to google "Mark Lind" + "punk" and "Ducky Boys" + "punk" and got 11,000 and 71,000 results respectively, there isn't some of notability out there. You also can't tell me that a band that has toured with major bands like Dropkick Murphys and Rancid doesn't have respect in the music community. I am in no way a member of the band, nor personally know any member of the band or Mark himself. I simply am interested in their music and their strong following within the Boston Area. But if it will delight the Wikipedia "Gods" to delete this article, please go right ahead. <a href="../../../a/x/y/User%7EAxYoung_09cf.html" title="User:AxYoung">AxYoung</a> 21:25, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I can't even believe this is being argued. Mark Lind is one of the most talented musicians Boston has ever seen. Considering the massive amount of talent that has come out of this city, THAT is saying something. To even consider removing his Wikipedia page is ludicrous. Same goes for the band's he has been in. - Kato (that's right, I said it) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.192.65.44_e4d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.192.65.44">71.192.65.44</a> (talk) 23:54, 30 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Through google searches, amazon searches, and a trip to the local record store, the original person that recommended these articles for deletion should have been stopped in their tracks. It's fairly obvious that each of these entries warrants a spot on the "highly regarded" wikipedia site. Quit wasting your time on these entries and move on to pages that deserve to be deleted.<a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkaTroma_c1cb.html" title="User:SkaTroma">SkaTroma</a> 08:49, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's absurd to think that anyone would want to delete an artist as important to the Boston Punk Scene as Mark Lind. As stated above... do a google search and take note of all the results. This also would apply to Marks band the Ducky Boys. Seriously, to delete this artist and his former band The Ducky Boys, would undermine the credibility of Wikipedia in general. This also would be a slap in the face to any and all artists who take a DIY approach to music. The fact that Lind has mantained C.D. sales in a very competitive market, even after problems with his label, is a testament to his "Notability". If Linds status as a "signed artist" due to a "hiccup" from Sailors Grave records is your basis for deletion, then you realy ought to re examine your policy. I would think that a 12 year recored of putting out succesful releases, not to mention influencing many other young Boston bands alone would warrent inclusion in Wikipedia. I won't even go into the other "notables" Mark has performed with. That would take up quite a bit more space. The staff of Wikipedia needs to reconsider this ill advised deletion.Skv260 21:17, 1 April 2007 (UTC)ssm <small>— Skv260 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Skv260_d968.html" title="Special:Contributions/Skv260">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

Maybe there's another article where it can go. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:31, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Look at <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlington_Public_Schools_3213.html" title="Arlington Public Schools">Arlington Public Schools</a>. Hardly any information there. People who want to create schools articles should first make them sections of school district articles unless they're going to bother to put in more than a few paragraphs of material. If the school district articles get too long, they can calve off "Arlington Public Schools elementary schools" or "---- middle schools". Start a school article when you've got the information. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:40, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Living writer with only one book and no other claim to notability. A <i>prod</i> tag has been removed three times, twice by different anons and once by the original creator of the article User:Giovanni.manganello (in his third edit ever since he created the article 7 months ago). All three gave similar reasons in the edit summary, and may be the same person. Side note: <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComplainer_fb25.html" title="User:Complainer">User:Complainer</a> claims to be Leonardo Malcovati, and has edited the article moderately.

<p>Non-notable theatre group. So they're pretty old, hardly a big deal. Just about every theatre group is going to be the oldest in some geographic location. All this really is is a list of people, 99% of them completely non-notable. A couple semi-famous people may have been associated with them over the years, but no one is famous <i>for</i> their association with the group. The bar where Tom Wopat washed dishes when he was in college is not notable from its association with Tom Wopat, and the same goes for this little group. <a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:47, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a directory. Some of our regular articles contain a list of names, but this usually occurs when all or most of the names are notable enough to have their own articles. If this one were ever to be made into a proper encyclopedic article, it would have to lose the list of names.

<li><b>Keep</b> ,<b>rebuild from the ground up</b>, and <b>she's not an academic so why is she listed here?</b>. It's unfortunate that she is listed as a mathematician because her enduring contibution seems to be a novel method for coming up with weaving patterns. As per the sources listed on the page she obviously had some math background, but her accomplishments are recognized primarily by weavers and her methods are still in use a half century later. The nomination claim that she is a "math crank" suggests that little effort was made to contextualize her work. This woman never made claims to revolutionize math, she simply combined her education with a hobby to design novel woven patterns. <a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIrene_Ringworm_a72d.html" title="User:Irene Ringworm">Irene Ringworm</a> 23:20, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As Irene Ringworm has said, this seems to meet the demand of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for multiple independent published sources. And I think the article clearly documents her notability as a pioneer of the connection between mathematics and weaving patterns; see e.g. <a href="http://www.jstor.org/view/0025570x/di021115/02p0114w/0" class="external text" title="http://www.jstor.org/view/0025570x/di021115/02p0114w/0" rel="nofollow">Grünbaum and Shephard, Satins and Twills, Mathematics Magazine, 1980</a> for a discussion of the sparsity of works on the mathematics of weaving (unfortunately ignorant of Dietz' work). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 21:53, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The others who've voiced their opinions here and those who've edited the article have pretty much debunked the nominator's reason pretty much word for word. Ada Dietz is a notable weaver with a mathematical background who is gradually being recognized by the mathematical establishment. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Happelberg_01a2.html" title="User:Robert Happelberg">Robert Happelberg</a> 22:15, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a good example of the AFD process working properly. I can see why the nominator was concerned, as the version proposed for deletion is rather dubious ("famous as a rebel" etc.), but the article has been substantially improved. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 05:09, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Like Chan-Ho said, the article has been corrected and improved since the deletion nomination. However, kudos to the nominator for behaving maturely in the face of disagreement. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECompositeFan_feeb.html" title="User:CompositeFan">CompositeFan</a> 17:26, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Having been president of the major professional association is strong evidence of notability. In most professions, the term is limited to one year, so there's nothing off about that. There are quite enough sources. It should have been obvious from even the first stub that the subject was clearly notable and that sources would be available. Its verifiability, not verified. 22:31, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, looks good now. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 20:52, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Important Keep</b>, ABA presidents <b>only</b> maintain office for one year, so the above is not unusual. Greco was the first American Bar Association President in history born outside of the United States. A friend &amp; professor at Yale Law School, Ron Sullivan, Jr., told me that Greco's work has been critical, particularly the commission on the Renaissance of Idealism in the Legal Profession, his Task Force on Domestic Surveillance, and the Task Force on Hurricane Katrina -- all are nationally recognized (can be Googled for further review). The blue ribbon task force on presidential signing statements and Commission on Civic Education and the Separation of Powers to which he appointed supreme court justices O'Connor and Ginsberg, and Theodore Sorenson, are now discussed in law school curriculums, including at Yale. Greco continues to tour internationally as a speaker on these and other issues and may be considering a run for office according to sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>However <b>more needs to be added to this article</b>, this Wikipedia article is incomplete; Google readings of Greco's background and activities reveal much more to supplement this article.<b>- Mitchell</b></p>

<p>Already nominated <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Boston_slang_fdd1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Boston slang">once before</a>, with no consensus. I outlined some of my concerns with the article earlier this month on the talk page. The entire article is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and completely lacks any <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EAttribute_6b35.html" title="WP:Attribute">citations</a> (it's been tagged as unreferenced since December <b>2005</b>), and <i>full</i> of useless entries like "Wake - Red Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield". <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DICT" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indescriminate collection of information</a> also apply here, I think. I don't even want to transwiki this, simply because it's so full of OR and, I suspect, inaccurate. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskwito_68c1.html" title="User:Miskwito">Miskwito</a> 23:33, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to delete it because it's unreferenced and almost entirely original research, both of which are in clear violation of Wikipedia policies. Other people have made good points here about massive cleanup being possibly better than outright deletion (I don't know that I agree, simply because I think this type of thing is likely to always have a lot of original research in it by its nature, and because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DICT" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>). But their arguments address the problem of lack of citations and original research fairly well, while I don't really see a clear argument against deletion from you. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskwito_68c1.html" title="User:Miskwito">Miskwito</a> 02:10, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>It would seem this article is more appropriate for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">wiktionary</a> than the current wiki, however I want to know what your source is for its supposed inaccuracy.

<li><b>Keep</b> The arguments for keeping given in the prev. AfD remain valid. Many of the objections raised there, which were mainly related to the inclusion or exclusion of certain entries, seem to have been addressed.

Its claims and <b>mention on two lists</b> does not mean it is wikiworthy. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 01:11, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I share Arbustoo's view that this organization is an accreditation mill. I created the article to provide documentation of the claims made by this outfit and the evidence for listing it as an "unrecognized accreditation association of higher learning." Several diploma mills claim authenticity based on accreditation by them (for example, see <a href="http://www.capitoluniversity.us/about.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.capitoluniversity.us/about.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a>), so an article about their status could be helpful to people who might otherwise be taken in by a diploma mill. Additionally, I do not trust <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unrecognized_accreditation_associations_of_higher_learning.html" title="List of unrecognized accreditation associations of higher learning">List of unrecognized accreditation associations of higher learning</a>, because I have found some legitimate organizations listed there with red links (for example, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Council_on_Education_8cc3.html" title="American Council on Education">American Council on Education</a> was listed there). In my opinion, it would be an improvement if every red link on the list were replaced by an article. <b>Minor issue:</b> I'm dismayed that several other contributors failed to notice the references in the article I created (they were displayed in the text in the format "[1][2]") -- many Wikipedia articles use this format to display URL references, and I thought this was an acceptable (albeit minimalistic) method of listing sources.--<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 00:54, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> it being put on list does not mean 1) it notable or 2) we have enough sources for a balanced article. Those two reasons must be considered when explaining vote or keep. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> says a notable article is multiple non trival sources about the subject. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 01:11, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I did notice the links you provided but, like Arbustoo pointed out, they cannot be considered "non-trivial sources". What we need is articles or books written about the subject. <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPax%7EVobiscum_3a44.html" title="User:Pax:Vobiscum">Pax:Vobiscum</a> 08:16, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Major diploma mills that currently claim this entity as the source of their authority to grant degrees include <a href="http://www.capitoluniversity.us/about.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.capitoluniversity.us/about.htm" rel="nofollow">Capitol University</a> and <a href="http://www.unw.ac/" class="external text" title="http://www.unw.ac/" rel="nofollow">University of NorthWest</a>. Some diploma mills that formerly claimed accreditation by this outfit now say that accreditation is irrelevant (for example, see <a href="http://www.unw.edu/Accred.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.unw.edu/Accred.htm" rel="nofollow">University of Northern Washington</a>).--<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 14:11, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> But that doesn't matter <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Reasons_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">unless there are sources</a>, and the current references are just mentions of the name.

<li><b>Comment</b> Orlady, 1) we need RS sources for write an article. 2) Those "major diploma mills" don't even have wikipedia articles. This article can be recreated when there is enough to write about. Until then it fails to do any parties favors.

<li>WP:CORP states "Trivial or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability." It belong on two lists is trival. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 23:37, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thats not a very good interpretation of the guideline. The government entities are authoritative and reliable sources on the matter of accreditation, and inclusion on this list is considered to be an official ruling. These lists (and these lists alone), are used by other institutions to determine the validity of credits - that alone makes these reliable sources. The <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> guideline was intended to prevent using directory like listings of companies as reliables sources. Thats obviously not the case here - <b>Keep</b> for passing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> as a diploma mill. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 01:52, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Just because it's true does not mean it belongs in Wikipedia. Inclusion on a list is trivial coverage. There's no notability here. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 06:12, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
