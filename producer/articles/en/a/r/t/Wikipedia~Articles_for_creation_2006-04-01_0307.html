<p><a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Logan_ae99.html" title="Bruce Logan">Bruce Logan</a> (1946- ) is a New Zealand conservative Christian political activist who has been involved in opposition to liberal social policies within his country for over a decade.</p>
<p>Logan was originally principal of Orewa College in <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auckland.html" title="Auckland">Auckland</a>, until he moved southwards to Christchurch in the mid-nineties. He became curriculum director at Middleton Grange School, New Zealand's largest fundamentalist Protestant private school, at the same time. While employed there, Logan also acted as Director for the New Zealand Education Development Foundation, which attempted to interest centre-right political parties in fundamentalist Christian-related education concerns, like 'school choice,' school bulk funding, the abolition of outcome-based education strategies and a deregulated post-compulsory tertiary education sector.</p>
<p>In Cutting Edge, Logan often reprinted articles from the Institute for Economic Affairs (United Kingdom), British tabloid journalist Melanie Phillips, First Things (United States, edited by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_John_Neuhaus_c88b.html" title="Richard John Neuhaus">Richard John Neuhaus</a> and other Anglo-American and Australian social conservative publications. Apart from this, he also became a list candidate for the short-lived New Zealand Christian Coalition political party (see Christian Politics in New Zealand.)</p>
<p>In addition, he wrote several booklets for NZEDF, including A Questionable Conception (1996), which opposed comphrensive sex education; A Level Playing Field? (1998), which advocated for school 'choice' for financially challenged conservative Christian parents; and Marriage: Do We Need It? (1998)which encouraged discrimination against unmarried same-sex and lesbian/gay couples.</p>
<p>In 2000, the New Zealand Education Development Foundation metamorphosed into the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxim_Institute_030e.html" title="Maxim Institute">Maxim Institute</a>. Logan served as its first director and also operated out of Christchurch-based offices, as the Institute had offices in Christchurch and Auckland. Middleton Grange provided premises for their Christchurch offices. Logan also published Evidence, the Institute's 'policy journal,' which ran for fifteen issues (2001-2005).</p>
<p>After the formation of the Institute, Logan wrote Same Sex Marriage? (2000) for Affirm, a Tauranga-based fundamentalist New Zealand Presbyterian organisation opposed to <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_unions.html" title="Civil unions">civil unions</a>,<a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_rights_in_New_Zealand_1204.html" title="Gay rights in New Zealand">gay rights in New Zealand</a> and lesbian and gay ordination within their own denomination. As well as this, he authored Waking Up to Marriage (2004), which repeated and supplemented earlier conservative social scientific research which encouraged promotion of heterosexual marriage against heterosexual cohabitation, solo parenthood and legal recognition of lesbian/gay couples, for the Maxim Institute.</p>
<p>During the lifetime of the Institute, Logan campaigned against prostitution law reform, voluntary euthanasia, lesbian and gay <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_unions_in_New_Zealand_e899.html" title="Civil unions in New Zealand">civil unions in New Zealand</a> and other contentious conservative Christian issues related to feminism, lesbian/gay rights, family policy and bioethics.</p>
<p>On October 17, 2005, Paul Litterick of the New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists used Copyscan, an innovative software package, to analyse Logan's published newspaper work, and published the results in Fundy Post (Issue 18), an online chronicle of the excesses of New Zealand conservative Christians and other faith-based illiberal elements. Litterick found that much of Logan's work was plagiarised from its original Anglo-American social conservative sources, which include the Mackinac Institute for Public Policy, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heritage_Foundation_f66d.html" title="Heritage Foundation">Heritage Foundation</a>, Institute for American Values and National Fatherhood Institute, Maggie Gallagher (a US social conservative journalist), Melanie Phillips, The Spectator (UK), Conservative Christian Fellowship (UK) and Digby Anderson.These revelations have meant that many New Zealand newspapers no longer accept contributed news items from the Maxim Institute as a consequence, as can be seen from the Institute's media columns on their website.</p>
<p>The Institute has erased all Logan's previous articles from their website, but many can still be referenced from the Index New Zealand database, which contains references to author and article or published paper details from many New Zealand newspapers, magazines and specialist journals.</p>
<p>In November 2005, Logan retired from the Maxim Institute, but is currently serving as a journalist for the New Zealand fundamentalist Challenge Weekly newspaper.</p>

<p>The art of hiding in the cupboard of T6 was once constrained only to St Stephens School. This art was established in the summer of 2005, and first fulfilled by child prodigy, Arun Isaac. This find was a revolution in school sports and his since hit the international stage, being competed in by students all over Australia.</p>
<p><b>The Art of Hiding in the Cupboard</b> Before one can freely hide inside the cupboard, he must understand the consequences of possibly being caught by the resident teacher at the time, Mrs Ibu Vanderplank. The first step of entering the cupboard is to leave your chair in which you are situated and roll along the ground, therefor avoiding being seen by the teacher. One must then open the cupboard and slowly enter, shutting the door behind him or her. Once inside the cupboard, the true challenge begins. The athlete must contend with various challenging, testing his wits, guts and all round talents. He or she must be able to withstand the cupboard for the entire remainder of the period, which may be up to 55 minutes. Once this is completed, the athlete becomes a champion of the sport and plastered into the hall of fame for eternity.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Arun Isaac</b></p>
<p>Arun Isaac is the founder of the sport now known as 'T6 Cupboard Hiding' and is now a well recognised athlete on the sporting stage. Mr Isaac first had the idea when his teacher at the time, Ibu Vanderplank left the arena to photocopy worksheets for the awaiting athletes. He is the current world record holder of the sport.</p>
<p><b>The Future of the Sport</b></p>
<p>The future of this sport is uncertain at this very time, but Mr. Isaac wishes for the sport to become recognised by the International Olympic Commity in time for the 2008 Olympic Games.</p>

<p>AKA Azizul Haque, Azizul Hacque, or Khan Bahadur Azizul Huq. Born in the village of Paigam Kasba in Khulna district of Bengal (now Bangladesh), was with the Calcutta (Kolkata) Police service, when Sir Richard Henry, had him and another Indian police officer, Hem Chandra Bose , involved in fingerprint classification project in 1897. Haque devised a mathematical formula to supplement Henry’s idea of sorting slips in 1024 pigeon holes, based on finger print patterns, and Bose, who besides working with Haque and Henry on the project, subsequently worked on the development of telegraphic code system for fingerprints. Henry, however, initially did not acknowledge openly contributions of the two Indian police officers to the development of fingerprint classification that he presented later in England, and for which he was recognized and the classification system was named Henry’s System of Fingerprint Classification. But years later, when Haque requested recognition and compensation from the British government for his contribution to fingerprint classification work, Henry then acknowledged publicly first Haque’s contribution, and he also did the same, when the issue of compensation for Bose also came up. The classification bearing Henry’s name became the most widely used classification system worldwide. Sodhi and Kaur published an extensive research paper on the issue of two Indian police officers contributions in their recent article in Current Science (Vol. 88, NO 1, 10 January 2005): ‘The forgotten Indian pioneers of finger print science. In their paper’, they quoted The Statesman, the eminent newspaper in India publishing an article dated 28 February 1925 entitled, ‘Indian affairs in London,’ which stated, “A Muhammadan Sub-Inspector played an important and still insufficiently acknowledged part (in fingerprint classification). Then they went to quote several sources to support the contention of Haque’s contribution to fingerprint classification. J.D. Sifton, Officiating Chief Secretary to the Government of Bihar and Oissa, wrote a letter (letter no. 761 PR, dated 15 June 1925): “Azizul Haque…allowed to start research work upon a method of classifying finger prints, and after months of experiment he evolved his primary classification which convinced Sir E.R. Henry that the problem of providing an effective method of classifying fingerprints could be solved. Thereafter the secondary and other classifications were evolved and the Khan Bahadur (Haque) played an important role in their conception.” Sir Henry, when contacted to endorse a grant of honorarium to Haque, wrote in a letter dated 10 May 1926 to P.H. Dumbel, the then Secretary of the Services and General Department, India Office, wrote, “ …I wish to make clear that, in my opinion, he (Haque) contributed more than any other member of my staff and contributed in a conspicuous degree to bringing about the perfecting of a system of classification that has stood the test of time and has been accepted by most countries.” At the time of final approval of the honorarium, the Home Department (Government of India) noted, “It appears from the information now received that he (Haque) was Sir Edward Henry’s principal helper in perfecting the scheme and the he actually himself devised the method of classification which is in universal use. He thus contributed most materially to a discovery which is of world-wide importance and has brought a great credit to the police of India.” On subsequent request to comment on Haque’s fellow Indian police officer who also worked on the project with Henry, Rai Hem Chandra Bose (Bose), Sir Henry wrote in 1930, “The Rai Bahadur (Bose)…has devoted the whole of his official life to perfecting the methods by which search is facilitated and as his labours have contributed materially to great credit.” Sodhi and Kaur, based on the evidence they gathered, is proposing that Henry’s System of Fingerprint Classification should be renamed Henry-Haque-Bose System of Fingerprint Classification.</p>

<p>A Tundish is a recepticle used in metal foundaries to hold molten metal, typically in a continuous flow process. I can also be used in filling moulds.</p>
<p>The tundish allows a reservoir of metal to feed the casting machine while ladles are switched, thus acting as a buffer of hot metal, as well as smoothing out flow, regulating metal feed to the moulds and cleaning the metal.</p>
<p>Metallic remains left inside a tundish are known as tundish <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skulls.html" title="Skulls">skulls</a> and need to be removed, typically by mechanical means (scraping, cutting)</p>
<p>Historically, a tundish was a flat funnel used to fill a <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tun.html" title="Tun">tun</a>, or barrel.</p>

<p>simple websearches in google show no good single definitional site in the first 2-3 returns and this makes me suspect a single wikipedia entry for tundish would be useful.</p>
<p>the macquarie dictionary defines a tundish as a funnel. No mention of metallurgy. I find that a bit odd, given the usage being so clearly related to the metals industry now.</p>

<p>Zentenism: Contemporary religion founded by Zente. The self proclaimed Son of Lucifer.The Holy messiahs Zen and Zon represents human emotions and intelligence respectively. Zente being the advent born out of imagination by Zon/Zen.</p>
<p><b>Some history:</b> According to records, Zen and Zon were twin brothers. Their origin unknown. Both orphaned at the age of six, rumour has it that they were responsible for the death of their parents. Some stories suggested that in a game of wit between the two children, Zen lost and the stake was the killing of both parent.How true this is remains unknown till date. They then lived off the inheritance. While Zen later became a religious teacher in a church, Zon exhibited extraordinary talent with his linguistic skills and intelligence. He held a PhD in human psychology together with Masters in MetaPhysics, Mathematics and Religion. At the age of 22, the brothers disappeared. The name Zon was never heard again. Zen eventually turned up at a research insitute, spending 3 years with "idiot savants" as a volunteer. Some suggest that Zon took over his brother's name, after he mercilessly paralyzed Zen and sent him into a state of Coma. Age 30, Zen/Zon set up the "Club of Kings" which was soon branded as a cult. Although the club managed to draw in a large number of followers, it never became an orthodox religion. Till date, Zentenism remains largely unknown.</p>
<p><b>The belief</b> Disclaimer: Content is purely imformative and the ideas involved may run contrary to major religions. No blasphemy or insults intended. Subject to reader's opinion.</p>
<p>Zentenism overrides all religion. It is the belief that religion is a matter of faith and that religious power is confined within the minds of the believer. It maintains that there is no one true God that exist in absolute terms. God only exist in the mind of individuals. According to the teachings of Zentenism, every human has the right to his own beliefs and no one has the right to impose his beliefs on anyone else. It denys the common existence of Soul, God(in absolute context), Creation and Creator. Instead, God only exist when one believes in a specific God or Religion. Like in Atheism there is no supreme being. So to say, Man creates God in his own image within his mind based on his beliefs. Because of this, Zentenism denies the overruling value and power of the Koran, Bible and Buddisht Scripture. It states that "God, and religion is all in the mind, never beyond it". The christian God still exist, but it only exist in the mind of that one christian. In the minds of believers of differnt denominations, God is different. The same applies for other major religions. It claims that God is not omni-potent, but rather multi-existent in individual perspective. In other words, unlike other religions, Zentenism is not exclusive. An individual can be a Zentenist-Christian or a Zentenist-Buddist for example. The only differece is that the context of a supreme being and a creator no longer exist. This explains why the founder Zente proclaimed himself to be the Son of Lucifer. He saw it all in terms of fiction. On top of that, in Zentenism what he believes in becomes true.</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/r/e/Crescent_Town_0c92.html" title="Crescent Town">Crescent Town</a> - Crescent Town is a neighbourhood in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_York_427f.html" title="East York">East York</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. It is located near Victoria Park ave. and Danforth ave.</p>
<p>Crescent Town can trace its roots back to 1887 when Walter Massey - the son of Hart Massey, Canada's first major industrialist - purchased a 240 acre (1 km²) country property centered around Dawes Road and Victoria Park Avenue. The Massey farm was named Detonia after Mrs. Massey's family whose surname was Denton. The Massey farm sold fresh eggs and poultry as well as fresh trout which was caught in the many streams and rivulets that criss-crossed the farm. The Massey farm was also the home of the City Dairy Company which produced the first pasteurized milk in Canada.</p>
<p>In 1933, Susan Massey generously gave 40 acres (160,000 m²) of Detonia to Crescent School where her grandsons were educated. Crescent School operated at Detonia until 1969 when this property was sold to the developers who built the present day Crescent Town neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Hollywood actor <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kiefer_Sutherland_21d0.html" title="Kiefer Sutherland">Kiefer Sutherland</a> from the hit fox television show 24 was among the first Crescent Town residents. He spent part of his childhood in Crescent Town and attended the Crescent Town Elementary School.</p>
<p>It is a very multicultuaral place where mostly jamicans pakistanis tamils and bengalis live. In recent times gang violence and drug dealing has become big factors. Many cops were sent to the area to stop all the violence but nothing has been done. 3 people in year 2005 have been killed and still counting in the street of crescent town.</p>

<p>The Quinto Real was the policy used by the Spanish and Portuguese conquistadors in their adventures in the America's, Africa, and India by which one-fifth of all the riches and revenue exacted from those areas would go straight to the Crown (i.e. the State Treasury). This may have originated during the days of the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconquista.html" title="Reconquista">Reconquista</a> of the Iberian Peninsula from the Moors.</p>
<p>Generally as long as the Crowns of either country received their <i>quinto</i> (fifth) share from the new conquests they let the adventurers do as they pleased with the new lands. The titles and grants they received from the Crown merely served as appearances that the new lands were under royal prerogative.</p>

<p>This is a seed-page submission so that you create a family rights page which fairly represents the millions of parents of both sexes seeking their family rights, rather than having this presented purely as a fathers' rights issue, which it is not.</p>
<p>The idea that family rights can be relabelled fathers' rights and then presented as such in the wikipedia is absolutely a distorted agenda. These issues need to be written up on a family rights page. Rights to family or their absence affect all those in weak and separated families. The effect of calling it "fathers' rights" as opposed to civil rights in the family actually debilitates the movement. Fathers-4-Justice made their breakthrough on the back of demands for equal civil rights in the family - it was this which distinguished them from earlier men's rights groups which often wished to bring back marriage and militate for men's interests rather than those of the whole family, placing them in an extreme minority position in the population and making success far less likely.</p>
<p>Family rights are also what it is about because it is very clear that different cultures may use the same erosion of basic family rights to attack mothers in one country with one culture (ie the Lebanon and denial of mothers' rights) or fathers and mothers in cultures which are particularly interventionist.</p>
<p>In this sense, family rights/equal parenting initiatives are founded precisely on the desire to abolish the sexual politics which has done so much damage to our families - exclusively fathers' rights groups included.</p>
<p>What is happening on the father's rights pages is good evidence of the way organised groups can distort the facts. Weakly argued feminism of the type advanced by Michael Flood in Australia is not the real argument against fathers' rights. The real argument is from fellow parents and children who are absolutely fed up with all the sexism, sexism which is destroying their families. Family rights apply to women as well as men and children, they are equal between parents. They are not just there to protect fathers in dispute with mothers, but to protect either parent from state usurpation of parental decision-making.</p>

<p>Formed on 15th April 1943 at RAF Hinton-In-The-Hedges, Northamptonshire, flying Armstrong Whitworth Whitley Mk V's as part of No. 26 (Signals) Group, under the command of Air Vice Marshal O. G. W. Lynwood CB,CBE. Some of the Flight's Whitleys were packed with radio equipment, their bomb bays being fitted with long-range fuel tanks, operating over forward battle zones to maintain radio contact with ground assault forces. The Unit moved to Honiley in Warwickshire at the end of July 1944.</p>

<p>The main purpose envisaged is for the simultaneous detection of electrons scattered from surfaces and having energies between a few tens of eV to greater than 2000 eV. A prototype has been constructed that approximates a hyperbolic deflection field for the electrons entering an entrance slit. It exhibits an energy resolution of a few eV and a collection efficiency of 0.05% of 2 sr. Useful Auger spectra can be acquired in a time of less than 2 s. The significant improvement in spectrum acquisition time that this represents offers many possibilities to further Auger and photoelectron spectroscopy.</p>

<p><b>Sam 'Gentleman Jim' Morgan</b> (born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_30.html" title="July 30">July 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>) is one of the two co-founding members of the S.O.D Network along with his best friend Duncan Melville. The S.O.D Network is a network of video shows and mainly at the present time a radio show named S.O.D Radio which is hosted by <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morgan.html" title="Morgan">Morgan</a>, Duncan Melville and Mark Whiley.</p>
<p>At the present time the S.O.D Network is fairly unheard of away from the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">internet</a> but Morgan claims that it is a matter of years before S.O.D hits the big-time. Morgan is well known for his 'I don't care about anything' attitude. This has often been the cause of much controversy and has also been named a catalyst in the result of the S.O.D members unknown relationships with the opposite <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a>. However, it is a now known fact that Morgan has recently began dating a girl named Maisie Noble and both are very happy together.</p>
<p>The S.O.D Network is known for their parodies of real-life people whether they are celebrities or non-celebrities. These characters include: <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kane.html" title="Kane">Kane</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Naysmith_1205.html" title="Gary Naysmith">Gary Naysmith</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Awesome_77f1.html" title="Mike Awesome">Mike Awesome</a> and Athletic Ref. <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Morgan_5907.html" title="Sam Morgan">Sam Morgan</a> is also known to be a huge fan of the finnish band <a href="../../../h/2E/i/H.I.M_9f73.html" title="H.I.M">H.I.M</a> and often says how much they have influenced his life. Morgan is known to be very cautious of what he tells people as he knows that his number of trustworthy friends are limited. This is also the case with his best friend <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melville.html" title="Melville">Melville</a>. Both of them like to keep their personal issues between the two of them or within the S.O.D Network. Morgan often makes comments about the group Live Now, Die Later saying that 'their making it for all the wrong reasons' Morgan's comments have now started a feud between the two networks, but Morgan also says 'I'm glad, we're getting the deserved fame off their asses'</p>
<p>Morgan also claims that he finds how funny many people threaten to do things about S.O.D and threaten violence towards the S.O.D cast, but never actually do this. Rumours have been circulated that Morgan has received <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_threats.html" title="Death threats">death threats</a> but this is unlikely and unconfirmed. Morgan has been known to be very caring at times even though he has an 'uncaring' reputation. Morgan gives examples 'Well, I'm always here for <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melville.html" title="Melville">Melville</a> and Marko (Mark Whiley) and of course Maisie. I love all three a lot, and I'm always here for them' The reason that this is a very limited number of people is because Morgan claims 'People aren't really there for me, but tose three are and their my life and I live for them whereas I don't feel the same about others' Morgan has given examples of these people before but they cannot be named as a wish of Sam Morgan's.</p>
<p>The S.O.D Network is very anti-<a href="../../../d/r/u/Drugs.html" title="Drugs">drugs</a> and they say this a lot. Morgan is often criticised this as close friends of his know that his girlfriend has been involved with drugs. Many also think that the S.O.D Network are very heavy drinkers but this has been denied by the group. Some of Morgan's words are 'I like a drink or two ya know, but I think getting smashed in every night is completely stupid' The group however has never commented on nicotine as rumours also circulate that <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morgan.html" title="Morgan">Morgan</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melville.html" title="Melville">Melville</a> smoke <a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigarettes.html" title="Cigarettes">cigarettes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/o/r/Morgan.html" title="Morgan">Morgan</a> is also known to be very "in love" with music. He says that 'music keeps me going' and that his favourite bands are <a href="../../../h/2E/i/H.I.M_9f73.html" title="H.I.M">H.I.M</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Misfits_7283.html" title="The Misfits">The Misfits</a>, <a href="../../../c/k/y/CKY_124a.html" title="CKY">CKY</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_69_Eyes_be49.html" title="The 69 Eyes">The 69 Eyes</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cradle_of_Filth_99df.html" title="Cradle of Filth">Cradle of Filth</a>. It is also known that he and <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melville.html" title="Melville">Melville</a> formed the 'joke' band Metal Plate and that composes and writes the songs along with <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melville.html" title="Melville">Melville</a>. He also plays 'joke' music as the S.O.D Network character <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kane.html" title="Kane">Kane</a> and writes the shocking lyrics too. Morgan is also a member of two serious rock groups as a drummer in one and a vocalist in another.</p>
<p>Morgan claims that when the S.O.D Video Show starts, it will be focused on him and <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melville.html" title="Melville">Melville</a> mainly and says that 'no one will be telling us to do as its our own show and no one should be allowed to try and take out limelight'</p>

<p>The "Gentleman Jim" nickname was created by <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melville.html" title="Melville">Melville</a> originally as "Cousin Jim" as a name for Morgan's cousin. Then they both say that they randomly put <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentleman.html" title="Gentleman">Gentleman</a> in there instead and gave it to Morgan.</p>
<p>Gentleman Jim says that he is a huge fan of hidden messages in songs and backwards messages. He claims that it is something that he and <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melville.html" title="Melville">Melville</a> plan to use in future Metal Plate songs.</p>
<p>Gentleman Jim is known to be very creative and imaginative. Constantly having ideas for S.O.D and <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movies.html" title="Movies">movies</a>. He also plans to write a <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book.html" title="Book">book</a> on S.O.D and a book on himself in the future.</p>
<p>He and Melville are also known to be willing to do anything for S.O.D and that they will put their bodies on the line as a sacrifice for the success of the show.</p>
<p>Gentleman Jim also says that he has a hidden list of people that he will get revenge on by all means necessary. This includes all the people that he claims as 'traitors' and 'enemies' of the S.O.D Network</p>

<p>Tetsuhiro Hokama 9th Dan Hanshi, President of the Okinawa Goju-Ryu Kenshi- Kai Karate-do, Kobudo Association and founder of the first Karate museum in the World. Although not as well known in North America compared to other Okinawan Goju-Ryu teachers, Hanshi Hokama is one of the most knowledgeable Goju-Ryu Karate masters. He has a deep understanding of the "Old Ways" of Karate.</p>
<p>Born in Taiwan in 1944 of Okinawan parents. Hanshi Hokama began Karate as a child in 1952. His grandfather Seiken Tokuyama taught him the fundamentals of Shuri-te Karate. In 1961 his formal training began at the Naha Commercial High School Karate club. That same year he began training with the legendary Seiko Higa (1898 -1966) a student of Kanryo Higaonna (1853-1915) and Chojun Miyagi (1888-1953). It was at Higa's Dojo where he met Shinpo Matayoshi (1922-1997 Kobudo teacher) and began learning Kobudo, Hakutsuru ken (White Crane fist) and Kingai-Ryu (a martial art that his father, Shinko Matayoshi 1888- 1947 learned in Manchuria). Upon the death of Seiko Higa in 1966 Hanshi Hokama continues his training with one of Higa's top student Seiko Fukuchi (1919-1975) who was Seiko Higa's assistant instructor. It was both of these great masters that taught Hokama the Kakushite (hidden hand) referring to the secret techniques in Kata. A young Tetsuhiro Hokama was not convinced with the bunkai he was first being taught, he kept asking questions and even doubting the Kata applications. They saw the young Hokama eagerness to learn that they began to teach him the "Old Ways". Higa eventually gave a copy of the Bubishi, an ancient martial arts text and told him to study it deeply.</p>

<p>Eduardo Montealegre is a presidential candidate for the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance (ALN) in that country's November 2006 political contest. He is a former member of the Constitutionalist Liberal Party (PLC) who removed himself after the party became overly corrupt, and formed the new ALN party.</p>
<p>PLC members loyal to former President Alemán and the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandinista.html" title="Sandinista">Sandinista</a> party have formed an alliance, known as "the pact," which is led by <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Ortega_ced4.html" title="Daniel Ortega">Daniel Ortega</a>. The Pact now represents a large controling and manipulative influence over the majority of Nicaragua's political institutions, and has been widely criticised by Nicaraguans for overwhealming the current President of Nicaragua <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enrique_Bola%C3%B1os_16d7.html" title="Enrique Bolaños">Enrique Bolaños</a>, whose original campaign was anti-corruption.</p>
<p>Because of Montealegre's stance against the old regimes, he is often cited as an assured candidate for the Nicaraguan Presidency this year.</p>

<p>Dave Bennett (born 11th July 1959) was a top-class British soccer player of the 1980s and 90s. He played in two FA Cup finals, initially losing with Manchester City in 1981, but later starring as Man of the Match in the 1987 final for Coventry City against Tottenham Hotspur. After Coventry conceded an early goal he immediately pulled one back. In what is still considered to be one of the greatest finals - from an independent's point of view - of all time, Spurs again took the lead, before Dave crossed for a spectacular equalising goal (<a href="http://exodus.interoutemediaservices.com/deliverMedia.asp?id=7a129f84-f594-4b96-91c3-0b90855606e4&amp;delivery=stream" class="external text" title="http://exodus.interoutemediaservices.com/deliverMedia.asp?id=7a129f84-f594-4b96-91c3-0b90855606e4&amp;delivery=stream" rel="nofollow">Watch goal here!</a>). Coventry went on to win via a Gary Mabbutt own-goal in extra time. After a brief spell at Sheffield Wednesday, Dave moved on to Swindon Town, but broke his left leg in only his second performance. Returning to fitness over a year later he was sent out on loan to Shrewsbury to get some match practice, unbelievably breaking the same leg again in his second match for the club. Between media appearances, Dave now plays in various testimonials and 'Masters' tournaments, still dazzling the fans with his tricky footwork.</p>
