<li><b>Comment</b>. Timtrent/Fiddle Faddle came in after RK canvassed six users and a Wikiproject page complaining of persecution. A rapid nomination for deletion is hardly bad faith when the article is of such low quality, obvious bias and exaggerations, and given the author's past history. It did not take me more than a few minutes to find that this "group" is nonexistent on the web and that its "journal" is not present in major university libraries. 20K website hits goes more to show obscurity than to show notability. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 15:29, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's kind of you to wave some sort of accusation at me. However the fact that I came here after I had my attention drawn to the article has no bearing on my views. I see nothing wrong with RK's drawing my attention to the article. I had no need to take any action - I could have ignored his note entirely. I am sure he felt I might be interested. I was. And I have placed my thoughts here. I have also placed thoughts in the article's talk page. I looked at the author's past history. A 12 month thing in April 2005 expired, surely? So raking that up now seems to me to be rhetoric. Please stick to the article, not the personalities. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 15:39, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I accused you of nothing, I only pointed out the fact that you were canvassed—you on the other hand accused me of bad faith. And yes, it is considered problematic for users to spam talk pages in order to "save" their articles from deletion. I personally avoid voting on nominations I have found out through canvassing, especially when it is the author or the nominator who is canvassing. As to the parole issue, you will note that 12-month period is reset every time it is violated, and in any event personal attacks are <i>never</i> permissible. ArbCom rulings are hardly irrelevant, especially given that this user has previously been banned from editing Judaism-related articles for an entire year. To ignore that would be to make ArbCom toothless, and ArbCom is the one tool, if sometimes ineffectual, to protect WP from persistently abusive editors. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 15:47, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I would point out the section in <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> on internal spamming. RK is clearly pushing it here.

<dd>It's cool. I know you aren't casting aspersions. I'm simply still learning, so I asked&#160;:) The main thing I have learnt is that consensus is a good thing. And sticking to the article (assuming the topic is itself notable) is the very best thing to do with AfD etc. If we none of us had differing views then the world would be a very regimented place. I tend towards a view "the greater the rhetoric the worse the point being made".

<p>I have repeatedly offered to set up interviews between Wikipedia editors and people at the <i>Shefa Network</i>. Tellingly, <i>not a single person</i> trying to delete the article has accepted this offer. They also refuse to read the sources that were given. This total refusal speaks volumes. It is especialy bizarre that while people who know nothing about this group are trying to delete it, members of all of Conservative Judaism's organizations are now working with Shefa. At this point it is no longer a matter of personal opinion. It is a now a <i>fact</i> that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Members of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_on_Jewish_Law_and_Standards_b696.html" title="Committee on Jewish Law and Standards">Committee on Jewish Law and Standards</a> are now contributors to Shefa</li>
<li>Members of the faculty at the movement's rabbinic seminary (Jewish Theological Seminary of America) are now contributors.</li>
<li>A growing number of rabbis from the <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbinical_Assembly_6c41.html" title="Rabbinical Assembly">Rabbinical Assembly</a> are now contributors</li>
<li>Faculty from Conservative Judaism's <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_Schechter_school_6589.html" title="Solomon Schechter school">Solomon Schechter schools</a> are now working with Shefa.</li>
<li>Shefa Newtork has already held two conferences, and two more events are already being planned, as well as yet another journal.</li>
<li><b>At this very moment</b> people from the Rabbinical Assembly are preparing for a tele-conference with multiple people from Shefa about the new Shefa websites, and coordinating with the new Conservative Judaism websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is clearly obvious that this group is far more influential than dozens, perhaps hundreds, of other groups that currently have articles on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The history of the delete attempt is even more telling: A handful of people started an attempt to delete this article <b>within minutes</b> of its creation, based upon their personal dislike of me. (These people have repeatedly refused to even discuss the issue, and have refused all attempts to give them interviews.)</p>
<p>It is obvious that a few people are trying to delete this article in bad faith; they are not applying that normal Wikipedia standards that we apply to all of our other articles. And they are egging on others to do the same, when those other people know literally nothing about the issue. Voting on whether or not to keep this article is of no use if some people voting are violating traditional Wikipedia standards. This is now a matter that Wikipedia administrators need to look into. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 14:11, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
