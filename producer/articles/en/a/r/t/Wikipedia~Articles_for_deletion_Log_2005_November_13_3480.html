<li><b>Comment</b> ∾ Years ago there was a series of commercials here in USAia touting (IIRC) compilation CDs of '80s music. They had the same indefinable air of quality that permeates infomercials and commercials for <a href="../../../g/i/n/Ginsu.html" title="Ginsu">Ginsu knives</a>. In the commercials, a man sitting at a desk, surrounded by '80s paraphrenalia (<a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubik%27s_Cube_6ec5.html" title="Rubik's Cube">Rubik's Cubes</a> and the like), announced that he was the President of the '80s Preservation Society, and that he was offering the CDs as part of his efforts to "preserve" the '80s. I seem to recall that, somewhat later, there were very similar commercials touting the <i>'70s</i> Preservation Society. I've always presumed that these "societies" were completely fictional, but I can't say for certain that they're not. → <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extreme_Unction_b4bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extreme Unction">blah</a></sub></font>} 19:13, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> well after the nomination I wanted to say something funny here but alas this will be much more dry... the lack of a presence on AMG/Amazon is possibly explained by their underground status and extreme views.

<p>The group had appeared on a Vh1 special about hate music--talking in variuos interviews about their views and underground music. They are one of the most controversial bands that has been popular within the white power music genre. They grew up in Detroit as the article states. When old enough, they made a rational decision to move out of the ghettos into safer northern suburbs.</p>

<p>I confess to being mildly torn on this one. Can there be an encyclopedic article about the "basics" of a language? My initial instinct is "Yes." But how is "basic" defined? How is that definition verified with outside sources? Can the article ever be more than an attempt at a language instructional course, and should language instructional courses be something Wikipedia should include? In any case, the specific article in question is poorly formatted and possesses minimal information about the subject, so even if the answers to the above questions are positive, the current article doesn't qualify. → <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extreme_Unction_b4bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extreme Unction">blah</a></sub></font>} 13:09, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do not Delete</b> I am the founder of the website, so I assumed it would be ok to cut and paste, if this still needs to be sited then I will make the change. I was trying not to sound like an advertisement, this is why I've only included the defn of the word Batipi, which I created myself. I figured the best chance in havinig this new word included in a dictionary would be the wikipedia. As for the link, I thought this would be useful to the reader, we plan on adding much more content to our website, on the topics of knowledge sharing and "ba", ect. 5:23, 18 November 2005</li>

<li>Weak <b>Keep</b> (and it should be expanded). Considering that we have articles on examples of Cyberbegging (savekaryn for example), and the number of hits, I feel that this is a word that will continue to exist. It's a social phenomena, much like the freeipod.com crazes, and as such, should likely have an encyclopedic analysis. The phenomenon predates Save Karyn, and thus should not be integrated into her page... her page should likely be integrated into Cyberbegging?

<dd>No, don't redirect. Really, the site has enjoyed widespread media coverage, largely on account of the "people more annoying than Mick Hucknall" thing.

<li>That's why I specified "Harper-Collins". Due to the nature of the book industry, it is a given that 5,000 copies of ANY book from such a major publishing house will be sold to stores that pick it up (even though the majority of them may end up returned for credit and/or remaindered). If this was a self-published chapbook, local imprint, or vanity press, then of course, no way. However, there's no mention of her on the Harper-Collins website, so it would appear that whoever posted the article is misinformed at best. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 01:04, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Total nonsense and all but <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. "Engineering Ivy League" gets a very few Google hits referring to groups of universities in Japan (apparently University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, Kyushu University, and Hokkaido University?), and India (apparently to "the six Indian Institutes of Technology and other top tech campuses,"). China is hoping to <i>develop</i> an "engineering Ivy League" <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3797/is_200504/ai_n13617989" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3797/is_200504/ai_n13617989" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. In connection with Japan and China, there's little Google evidence that is is anything more than a personal coinage of Lucille Craft of ASEE, who wrote both articles. If there were enough good, well-sourced, verifiable information on the Indian, Chinese and Japanese "engineering Ivy Leagues" to write a stub, I'd do so, and recommend that this article become a redirect to that, but I don't think there is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to the U.S., <i>the phrase is not used,</i> except as a nonspecific adjective for "very good school." This article is just academic boosterism, a pretext for listing what someone thinks are the best engineering schools.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The phrase "Engineering Ivies" could just as well refer to Cornell and Princeton, two Ivy League schools noted for exceptional engineering schools. (Harvard almost deliberately encouraged people <b>not</b> to think of it as an engineering school by refusing to use the word "Engineering" in connection with their excellent Division of Applied Science until very recently, but methinks I recall some rather stellar work done there in the development of computers...)</dd>
<dd>I hate using U. S. News as an authority, but will nevertheless point out that schools listed don't even bear a good relationship to <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/eng/brief/engrank_brief.php" class="external text" title="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/eng/brief/engrank_brief.php" rel="nofollow">the U.

Look. We should not have an article about "Engineering Ivies" in the U. S. unless someone can find a good, verifiable source that defines that the phrase means and gives a reasonably objective list of what schools qualify. Maybe someone can find something that says being a member of the Ivy League disqualifies a school from being an Engineering Ivy, but I'd really like to see a <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">source</a> for that.

<li>I'm for complete deletion, and no redirecting, since the article title really doesn't apply to the main <i>Avatar</i> articles. I've seen all the aired episodes of <i>Avatar</i> thus far, so I could probably go through the article, integrate anything I think is noteworthy into other Avatar articles - after that, the article could be deleted. However, since I don't follow it too much outside of its episodes, I might not be the best source for this, but I can do it if no one else volunteers.<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirogtheconq_2809.html" title="User:Virogtheconq">Virogtheconq</a> 17:42, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I see 'environmental shift', I expect geograhical information, not a theory in the change of director's vision or whatever it is. After a quick read, I doubt that there anything much worth merging into another article, so call for <b>delete</b>.

<li>I went and reread the article, and the only information that seems applicable would be the bit regarding the show time. However, this is minor at best, and if it's really that noticeable it probably would have been written into the main <i>Avatar</i> page already, so it's probably doesn't need to be moved. Otherwise, this page is ready for <b>deletion.</b><a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirogtheconq_2809.html" title="User:Virogtheconq">Virogtheconq</a> 06:37, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>According to the Census Bureau, the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Clair_County%2C_Illinois_da24.html" title="Saint Clair County, Illinois">Saint Clair County, Illinois</a> article, and the Sheriff's website, Glenview is not a city or village in the county. I corrected this statement in the Wiki article. Rand McNally's website shows Glenview in Cook County when one types in Glenview, IL for an online map. Glenview in Saint Clair County appears to be a small area in Saint Clair County when one examines it at Mapquest. The US Postal Service also shows that <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenview%2C_Cook_County%2C_Illinois_047f.html" title="Glenview, Cook County, Illinois">Glenview in Cook County</a> is the only place in Illinois that uses "Glenview" as the city name with respect to postal addresses. Also, Mapquest sometimes shows names for unincorporated neighborhoods that are not used and not heard of by local residents.

<li><b>Delete</b>: The article's title has nothing to do with its content. The content never addresses a "Golden City" in any form.

I'm not sure why we'd even want to consider the merits of the Oneness Project, as it's not the subject under consideration, but, if we did, we'd be left with a non-profit that has not achieved very much significant effect at this point and would probably be a deleted topic. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:56, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Warships are notable because they fulfil the same primary notability criterion that we use for people, companies, web sites, and other things: Multiple separate people, independent of the subject, have written and published works of their own about them, demonstrating that <i>they find the subject notable enough that they have gone to the effort of creating and publishing works of their own about it</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> — Most valid military warships of cruiser class or larger are highly notable. If this was a patrol boat, for example, you might have a good argument.

<li>Perhaps HMS Duke of Edinburgh (cruiser) might be more appropriate?

<li>See <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28ships%29_60e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (ships)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (ships)</a>. The name, were there another ship article by this name and disambiguation were needed, would be <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Duke_of_Edinburgh_%281904%29_0ef9.html" title="HMS Duke of Edinburgh (1904)">HMS Duke of Edinburgh (1904)</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:35, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This rename would be akin to "President of the United States George W. Bush (US President)"; it's clumsy and unneeded, since a vessel noted HMS is inherently a "UK ship"... However, some reading suggests it was later used as the proposed name for a cancelled carrier, so I'll move and disambiguate the page to (1904) per convention when this AFD closes.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've tidied the article up a bit, we may need further discussion about which warships are inherently notable, but I've seen a lot of articles on warships. In the light of this, I suggest that, at the very least, all cruisers and larger in the world's major navies which saw active service in 1 of the 2 world wars are inherently notable. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 01:36, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that there's a need to formulate a specific criterion. The multiple published works from independent sources criterion is a relatively general criterion that works for ships as well as it does for people, bands, companies, products, software packages, and web sites. The criterion that you describe is a simple and direct consequence of its application. "All cruisers and larger in the world's major navies which saw active service in 1 of the 2 world wars" are notable <i>because plenty of people independent of the subjects have published works of their own</i> (written books, produced documentaries, created web sites, and so forth) <i>that cover that very set of ships</i>. (See the very sources cited by this article, for example.) The set of what is notable is already established by the world at large, and the multiple published works from independent sources notability criterion simply reflects that.
<p>What <i>is</i> needed is for the editors who are creating these ship articles to <i>cite sources</i>. None of the ones that I looked at cited any sources whatsoever. In practice, it is very rare for articles that <i>have</i> citations of multiple published works from independent sources to even come to AFD in the first place, let alone be deleted. Indeed, the simple act of citing such sources has on several occasions changed people's opinions from "delete" to "keep". I strongly urge the editors of these ship articles, and indeed all editors with pet projects, to <i>cite sources in all of their articles</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:04, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well said.

<dd>I'm surprised, shocked, and dismayed at the community's reception to this article's content. Has anyone in the community actually <i>tried</i> to contact authorities in Ontario to see whether they would use this information? I actually raked up a large long distance bill doing so to find out that people in the transportation sector, law enforcement, truck drivers, government agencies, postal offices, delivery services, long term care facilities all use this information - on a regular basis, and for their livelihoods. Sometimes we need to go a bit further than our own intuition to determine whether something is encyclopedic or not - and certainly, this is material that is of utility for a large sector of people - many of which can conceivably find it here on Wikipedia. Simply put, if this is deleted, this is one AfD where I feel the community failed in doing its full due diligence in evaluating content worthiness. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 17:44, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, nor is it an informational garbage dump. As Gamaliel said in a different discussion (and note particularly the last sentence and clause:
<ul>
<li><i>Wikipedia is not paper, but it is also not the Library of Babel, nor is it an endless and tedious compendium of every bit of trivia and gossip and useless, insignificant "facts". It is an encyclopedia, not a dumping ground. That means we have a duty not to mindlessly compile facts but to present them in a concise and usable manner, making judgments about which facts are important and which are not.</i>

I'm not arguing that in a paper encyclopedia there would not be enough space for the info (trees will keep growing) but that it would be almost impossible to organize it sensibly.

In the course of Time, these Extensive maps were found somehow wanting, and so the College of Cartographers evolved a Map of the Empire that was of the same Scale as the Empire and that coincided with it point for point. Less attentive to the Study of Cartography, succeeding Generations came to judge a map of such Magnitude cumbersome, and, not without Irreverence, they abandoned it to the Rigours of sun and Rain. In the western Deserts, tattered Fragments of the Map are still to be found, Sheltering an occasional Beast or beggar; in the whole Nation, no other relic is left of the Discipline of Geography.</i> --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:29, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>While I think this information is useful, I agree that it may not be displayed in the best way, here. Perhaps create a map with the information and store it as an image?

Then the user will have to click on the graphic and wait a possible eternity for it to load.

<li>A list of freeway interchanges is not something that merits its own article. Roads just are not <i>that</i> inherently interesting (and I'm speaking as a self-admitted map junkie here). An interchange list is reasonable enough in the highway's article, but it <b>never</b> deserves its own distinct article.

<p>The article may read like a joke, but then like they say the truth is far stranger than fiction. I have been doing research on this guy for the past six months and I can verify every word. I'll be adding some of his most memorable quotations soon. Not sure who wrote the article but the guy's done his homework! (Professor Port Talbot Ma Bsc Phd Phd Fag)</p>
<p>It is written in a rather facetious manner, but then again Mr. Wellington is something of a figure of fun in South Wales and especially Port Talbot. I cannot verify the quotations attributed to him but as far as I know everything else on here is true. They can be verified by checking back copies of the South Wales Squirrel newspaper, the newspaper of the regional South Wales Anarchist Group (SWAG) who have hailed Wellington as a paragon of local democracy and free speech (Anarchism is still a living creed in some parts of the South Wales Valleys, although Wellington denies any political affiliation with SWAG). His performance on 'Question Time Wales' is nothing short of legendary in these parts. Max Boyce was reduced to a seething wreck by Wellington's continual jibes about his height.</p>

<li>Thanks for point out the flaws of my google search. You are right in stating that there aren't that many unique hits. There are plenty of organisations too cheap or unaware of the process of buying their own servers. And maybe that is an indicator of just how notable this group is.

I used to live down the road from someone who created his own micronation. His house, the people that lived in it, a few of his friends and neighbours were all members of a country. There were 11 residents, and he printed his own currency and did the whole thing associated with being your own country. I never found out why he did it though. I think he disagreed with Australian laws or something like that. People who do this kind of thing have various reasons for it, but yeah, its legitimate. 203.122.218.47 17:11, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

The same applies to purported organizations of micronations. Researching the League of Micronations, I can find no news coverage, no independently written articles about the League of Micronations, and indeed nothing (outside of what the League of Micronations claims about itself) except one-sentence mentions with hyperlinks. The article cites no sources at all, either.

<p>This article is dreadful. It features on the list of most-revised articles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Mostrevisions" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Mostrevisions" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, which is pretty bad for an article which is a list of supposed facts - 2928 revisions suggests something is wrong. It is pretty much permanently erroneous - fans put bands such as Led Zeppelin at the top of the list, then someone else puts The Beatles there. There is one user who simply replaces the band name with Cher.</p>
<p>Most of the sales figures are pretty much worthless guesses, based on original research - a quote by some lazy music journalist saying so-and-so has sold 100,000,000 albums in 1996, so let's randomly add 100,000,000 to an arbitrary guess at how many singles they have sold.</p>
<p><br />
The article is unstable, constantly changing. It is original research, and largely worthless as a reference source. The 'facts' in it change all the time. It undoubtedly excludes popular artists from areas where sales figures are poorly collated. Delete!. 87.74.12.83 11:38, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article is very useful for people wanting to find out artists' total record sales. It is quick and easy. Most artists' sales on the list are accurate. Expecially Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Elvis Presley and Led Zeppilin who, if you go to the discussion page you will see, have been thoroughly researched and argued out until a very, very accurate record sale was found. Most of the top ten has been looked into and my opinion is that those artists have accurate record sales totals beside their names. You can't find an exact worldwide sales total for any artist, but you can get pretty darn close and this list, as it stands now, is pretty darn close. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_walker_7556.html" title="User:Street walker">Street walker</a> 12:31, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If some of the information is wrong, wouldn't it be easier to just fix it rather than delete it?

The figures don't exist for a perfect article, but this is currently the closest thing there is to it, and hopefully it will continue to improve. Of course it attracts a lot of misinformation from fanboys, but provided that sources are checked, this isn't enough to provide cause for deletion. Hopefully we can reach a consensus on this.</li>

While all you politically-correct sheep are jumping off a cliff, trying to outdo one another (without actually having visited the main-page list), you failed to realize that this was but one of a series of lists of Jewish notables. It appears to be maintained by Jews and is well-organized, and the persons in the list are "bankers of notabiliy," such as founders of historic firms like Salomon, and most from the 1800's. If it were a conspiracy list, wouldn't it be targeting present-day bankers?

<li><b>Comment</b> Obviously mine was a protest vote, because I don't think many people stop to see what the article is about, before deleting it. I can accept that you don't want a list of Buddhist surgeons, fine. It should be noted, however, that sometimes people form their own preconceived notions: was the list of "Jewish bankers" singled out BECAUSE of the stereotype, while other lists, such as List of Jewish superheroes (actually exists!!!) was NOT because it was seen as a positive portrayal? So the point was not to win the vote, but to get others to think before forming an opinion.131.96.15.39
<ul>
<li>Being quite serious for a moment, yes I did read the article. I'm not at all sure whether this is intended to honor or stigmatize. There are fair arguments either way. I certainly wouldn't jump to the conclusion that someone who did find this offensive hadn't read the page.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is the saying, "assumptions make asses of us all." We should not "assume" bias without first checking the facts. Checking the facts finds that the list was created in a context of a myriad of occupations, by a person who identifies themself by a Jewish name. No actual evidence of an "attack" is offered. Arniep,on Nov 18, nominated all the "list of Jewish.." for deletion; not surprisingly,those such as "List of Jewish superheroes" were being "kept" while "List of Jewish criminals" was being "deleted." A computer would not have known the difference. Also, by itself a "list of Jewish bankers" might be "sinister," but this list was not by itself, it was with a collection of lists. Thus, what we have here is nothing more than an exercise in political correctness; the bias is caused by the lens we choose to view the list in, not anything that the list "gives" us. 131.96.2.208 21:20, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just proving my point, someone (Arniep) nominated a whole "list of" Jewish. Not surprisingly, the "List of Jewish Criminals" is going down in flames, while most of the rest are "speedy keep." In fact, one person who voted against "List of Jewish Bankers" voted FOR some of the other lists. This merely proves my point that reactionary politically-correct bias is operating here...I'm sure a court of law would find that since these lists were created by the same user, who has shown an intent not of anti-Semitism but Jewish identity (being Jewish), taken as a whole the lists should be equal. Remember, DISCRIMINATION is picking out one thing and applying different standards.<a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 09:36, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

In American English it is the main term used to designate places that might be of interest to tourists - the closest equivalent to visitor attraction in British English. In British English the term is less used and only refers to things that are truly visible due to their height or size. &lt;snip&gt; Examples of landmarks include the Taj Mahal in Agra, Eiffel Tower in Paris, Big Ben in London, Mount Fuji in Japan, Stone Mountain near Atlanta and the CN Tower in Toronto.</i> I don't think any of your examples qualify as a landmark.

<li>Maybe if we're going to keep it, the name should be changed to the "Mark Curtis Case". It seems that two different sets of leftist activists have argued over whether he is a rapist or the victim of a frame-up. Aside from that, he seems an utterly unimportant person.

<p><b>Delete</b>, Not sure on this one, but I doubt a contributor to three open source projects is notable - the projects are notable, but he is not.

<p>I have heard the term many times here in Europe and despite google has few entries on the subject the article should not be erased, I think. Besides it is a fact that the socalled mexipop is a huge phenomenom in many parts of the planet. And erasing the article won't stop people from using that term.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Mention of this article, and questions of the authenticity of its information, are fine for inclusion in Wikipedia. But Wikipedia isn't for just copying (either verbatim or through translation) a text from elsewhere and pasting it in and calling it a Wikipedia article—plus, there are questions of copyright violation. I personally doubted the whole thing; but my doubts about the truth of an article aren't reason enough: the nature of what a Wikipedia article should be, and questions of copyright violation, are exactly enough. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreslethe_e6c4.html" title="User:Preslethe">President Lethe</a> 16:01, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Not that I consider this article to be any good, or that I am not in support of its deletion, but the fact that a source is not written in English doesn't itself make it less reliable. A majority of the people on this planet doesn't speak English, that doesn't make them untrustworthy. That said, I'm in support of its deletion for the reason that the sources seem to be of dubious accuracy, but that does not have anything to do with the fact that I can not read the language in which it is written. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Sources_in_languages_other_than_English" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Have a look here.</a> <a href="../../../k/d/e/User%7EKdehl_5112.html" title="User:Kdehl">Kdehl</a> 20:33, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

In my opinion, a list should contain intrinsically useful information on its own, or serve as a useful navigation resource for Wikipedia. The information inherant in this list seems to be a negligable value (it's just a group of people who found in a war and survived to this day), and indeed it is dated (and thus transient) information, which, in my view, makes it less encyclopedic.<br />
On the other hand, there do happen to be a number of people on this list who are indeed notable for other things (and thus have WP articles), so this article does have some (albeit somewhat idiosyncratic) value as a navigation aid. If this were rewritten to be a list of people who have or need their own articles, with brief summaries of who they are, then I think I'd find myself abstaining from voting, on the grounds that this would be a useful but somewhat idiosyncratic list. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Black</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:59, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article is NOT POV. If Iran or Russia have living WWI veterans and put them in the news, then we'd surely add them to the list. Clearly, the English-language Wikipedia has 800,000+ articles, some languages have less than 100,000. Is that POV because the other languages aren't adding material? It would only be POV if we "refused" to accept, for example, German WWI veterans...clearly, that is not happening. Also, when the last survivor dies, the article could be renamed "last WWI veterans," so it doesn't necessarily have to be deleted. Civil War histories of the last Civil War veteran claimants (Walter Williams, John Salling, Albert Woolson, etc) are still read, and included in newspaper and encyclopedia alike.<a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 21:27, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not entirely that surprising. For a start, war rolled over European Russia and the Balkans repeatedly since WWI, whereas France had two comparatively short periods of combat and an occupation, and the UK was essentially untouched bar some bombing, after WWI. In addition to these higher mortality rates through warfare - a lot of those young enough to fight in WWI and still live today would have been called up in WWII, especially in the German or Russian militias in 1941/5, or gone into various resistance organsiations - there's the massive death rate of the early USSR to consider, or the high Japanese civilian deaths of 1944/5, the occupation of Poland... and after all that, there's the simple matters of bureaucracy (if no-one in the country knows you fought in WWI bar your family, it won't be known to the world), which is understandably worse in countries where documentation has been damaged or lost by war or political upheaval, and of medicine - medical care in the West is substantially better than in most other countries, suggesting that a higher proportion would survive to an advanced age (100-110 without good medical care is pretty unusual). I'm not saying they're all listed, but I do think that it's fair to expect some skewing... come to think of it, Japanese participation in WWI was low numerically, pretty much only the navy, so you'd not expect many veterans there, and I suspect Western Europe had higher conscription rates than most other participants generally. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 16:34, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. OK, let me try THIS discourse instead. It's something called "commemoration." IF you were a history major, you'd know what that is. Some people become notable as witnesses to history (oral history). As commoners, they may not have been important individually in 1925 (instead as a group). However, by 1998 (80 years later) the French government decided that it was time to commemorate and honor the surviving veterans of WWI. And don't tell me about Vietnam. We all know about Vietnam. Do you realize that more than 10 million died in WWI, far more, but for many young people today, they know nothing of the "Great War." Even among US soldiers, the war dead (118,000 in less than 2 years) far exceeded the less intense Vietnam conflict, which saw 58,000 deaths over the course of 11 years. Hence, from a historical perspective, this becomes important as "living history." With the current number of worldwide surviving veterans less than 100, and with the major news outlets deciding that their deaths warrant inclusion in obituaries, this becomes encyclopaedic. In fact, the article helps because although not everyone in the list is important enough to get their own article, together a little can be said about each one. This also helps to balance out the media tendency to "pick one person and run with it." I'm not saying that Lloyd Brown deserves his own encyclopaedia entry, but clearly a list of 80-odd surviving veterans is not too much to ask.<br />
Also, this is an educational tool: it teaches younger people about cohorts, generations, and demography.<br />
As for maintenance, that is a non-issue: many people have maintained it. And for ephemerality, you're missing the point: when the person dies, their death is recorded and moved to a separate list. I note that during the 1950's, "surviving Civil War" veterans was a popular topic. Several were featured in news publications such as the NY Times. Beginning in 1949, the NY Times included dozens of obits for "surviving Civil War veterans." If you want to re-name the article, "last veterans of the First World War," then one could divide the list into those who are still living, and those who died in the last 5 years or whatever criterion is used.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b>. Our basic policy is that if someone is notable, we have an article on them.

These people were not only witnesses to events of great historical importance - they were also participants. Their actions helped enable the events to unfold that have given us the lasting legacy of those people, places and impacts that are now deservedly ensconsed in the pages of history.<br />
These living links, to what is for most of us is a distant past, are invaluable - just by living and being acknowledged - in their ability to bring that history alive and relevant. The list of real, living participants in these key events that directly lead to the modern western world, cannot help but pique the interests and curiousity of those who otherwise may have had limited awareness or interest in this key historical event.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b> Some thoughts on what is being said in here. There are claims that someone is notable because his or her death is reported nationally. My first wife's death went out on the national wire services, and was printed in newspapers all over the country. Does that make her notable enough for a Wikipedia article? I don't think so, as her chief claim to fame was that she was the first woman "of color" to be elected a national officer of <a href="../../../n/o/w/NOW_3dce.html" title="NOW">NOW</a>. Her death was "momentarily newsworthy". What is notable is that only a few veterans of World War I are still alive. Their individual names are not notable for the purposes of Wikipedia. It has been claimed that these people are notable because of the conjunction that they are veterans of WWI and still alive. By that reasoning, can I start a List of veterans of both World War I and World War II? My grandfather would qualify for that. An encyclopedia is not supposed to include everything imaginable.

<li>There just seems something wrong or disrespectful with this article. Its sort of like the comment above "ensure this valuable resource is updated regularly" which pretty much means crossing people off as they die. So its like you hear over the news that a wwI vet passes away - ok better go cross him off the wikipedia list. There is some policy I believe here that you should use the date rather than terms like "now" and "surviving" - I read it somewhere, cant find it now. It sets a bad precedent too, lets start: Surviving 1920s jazz musicians, Surviving athletes from the 1904 Olympics and be sure to keep an eye out for the news so you can cross them off as they die, and eventually delete the article completely.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have suggested that this article could be re-named "Last Surviving Veterans of WWI". That word construction is ambiguous enough that it could include living and recently deceased WWI vets (since if they died in 2004, for example, they'd be "one of the last surviving veterans of WWI). In that case, the question becomes, what is the cutoff point? Someone has suggested Jan 1, 2001 (start of the 21st century). The alternate plan is to leave it as it is, and th deaths are being migrated to lists such as "WWI veterans who died in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005...)<a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 09:51, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Good Morning, all, I have made a some changes in line with my suggestions (see some things we need to decide?) I have moved Orin Peterson to the WW1 era category, as this seems to be the direction the evidence points. I have moved the Romanian and the anonymous French Vet to the Unvalidated category - with a note on whats "missing" as it where. My understanding of the Unvalidated category, is that unvalidated does not mean false (though some of them, noticeably the 13 year old veteran almost certainly are)rather they do not have full verification, by a sanctioned body, and none of these cases would appear to have such a verification. One final note is that I would suggest we create some sort of "pending" category for new cases, and I received a bit of support for this: thoughts anyone? SRwiki 10:49, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am just wondering why 3 of the French vets, have suddenly moved into the unverified category? After much discussion, in December I thought we had come to a reasonable consensus, about who was listed where, and my understanding was that all 3 were recognised as vets in our definition rather than the stricter (and western front orientated) French definition. The moving of the Italian vet who is living in France suggests that who-ever has taken it upon themselves to do this, doesn't understand how the page is laid out. If this vet has been moved because he has not been verified by the French Government, then there is no reason why he would be, he is a veteran of the Italian army - people do move around. Can whoever has done this moving please explain their reasoning? thanks SRwiki 18:44, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for replying, but I think you are using a different definition of a vet to the rest of us. As far as I can tell the official French definition accepts only those with more than 3 months service, on the Western Front. The definition we are using here, is service anywhere, for any length of time up to 11/11/1918. I suspect the official French definition, is for the purposes of who gets a war pension, rather than who is a veteran.</dd>

<dd>In the case of two of these Vets 1 served in Syria, and one for less than three months, so although not on the official list, are still veterans. The Third vet you moved is an ITALIAN, who just happens to now be living in France, he is never going to be classed as a French Veteran, because he was never in the French Army. But he is an undisputed Veteran of the Italian Army.SRwiki 07:55, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Finally I notice that Charles Brunier, was awarded service medals for World War 1, but was stripped of them when he was convicted of murder, so another reason he may not be on the official list is that it would be very embarassing for the French Government, if they ended up giving a full state funeral to a convicted murderer.

<p>Shouldn't Tuveri be included as a veteran of Italian army?</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>There are several issues here. First, Tuveri moved to France and is a French citizen even though an Italian vet. There is also the issue of a Canadian living in the U.S., Brits living in Australia, etc.</p>
<p>That is a separate issue from the 'official' French government list. For one, I don't give much credit at all the the 'official' list. As someone mentioned, it seems designed to exclude (and thus to possibly save money by denying a pension). Second, the 'official' listmakers didn't do any research (but claimed credit for 'discovering' Rene Riffaud and Francois Jaffre, who appeared on the Wiki article months earlier). Third, the Italian list also doesn't include 'official' vets, either. I think the issue of 'verification' is one of existence and service, not government sanction. Fourth, the official lists changed the rules to include Rene Riffaud (and thus the rules don't seem so important as their marketing efforts). As noted, there is at least one anonymous French veteran not yet releaved. So, the French gov't may be embarrassed if the anonymous vet outlives the three 'official' veterans.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 20:46, 18 January 2007 (UTC) _____________________________________________________ Why is it that when we get the list in pretty good shape, someone comes along and does something totally off the wall. I was for removing the "unverified" French Vet. until a name was released. However, to remove a vet because he has not met the french requirements of so many months service is confusing and does not make sense. Please put them back in the list. As a person stated above, if you will read the comments of the other members you should understand why this is not the correct thing to do.

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Media reports have Charles Brunier joining in 1918, aged 17, and wounded in combat in Syria. However, I'm certain he will NOT get a state funeral. His military honors were stripped in 1923 (after being convicted of murder), why would they be restored now? Further, the French gov't only recognizes "Western front" veterans (a sort of Euro-centric bias, yes). Third, because he was wounded, Brunier served only two months (less than the three-month requirement). Let's not forget that the information on Brunier came from independent sources that were not aware of this Wiki article.</p>
<p>The bigger question is: if the French gov't gives a funeral for the 'last' veteran and then another one emerges, what then? As stated, there is at least one remaining anonymous veteran (alive this month). However my contact dropped contact Jan 16 so I can no longer vouch for the continued existence of this person. My contact did report, for example, Rene Riffaud months before the French gov't noticed, as well as Louis Jaffre.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 19:53, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting Character Charles Brunier, as far as I can tell, he enlisted with the French Navy, towards the end of WWI, the war in Syria, was I believe actually fought in 1919, and was more of a land grab, in which France carved the nascent states of Syria and Lebanon, out of the defeated Ottoman Empire, jailed for murder on Devils Island, and more relevantly for the purposes of this discussion - stripped of his military honours. Claims to be the basis of Papillon, escapes from Devils Island, fights in WW2, is arrested, and sent back to Devils Island, but is finally pardoned for his role in WW2. It's quite a story, and I imagine there is a reasonable amount of paperwork to back this up.</dd>
<dd>But whether ever makes it onto the list, depends on whether the pardon, trumps the honors being stripped. My guess would be no. I really can't see a coffin carrying the body of a murderer, being paraded down the Champs d' Elysee.</dd>
</dl>
<p>One other thing that has occured to me, is that the French Navy was one of the biggest in the world at the time. I just wonder if in the focus on the Western front, some of these sailors may have been overlooked. SRwiki 08:19, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A while back, a poster here (I forget the name) attacked me for the "vandalism" of removing Stephen Butcher's name, from the living veterans list, even though he was deceased (and I had seen a local newspaper's obituarys section) and demanded proof.</p>
<p>Aside from confirmation from Dennis Goodwin, the UK veterans "guru" as it were, then I repeat below what is held at the London Births, Marriages &amp; Deaths Index for 2005.</p>
<p>Stephen Graham Butcher b. 2 Jan 1904 d. Dec 2005, Portsmouth. (volume Bon-Col Deaths 2005 p 577, entry 4971e)</p>
<p>I hope that now satisfies as enough proof (as I can hardly make up all that information), and with the above information a death certificate can also be obtained should there be any need.</p>
<p>Very shortly, the online versions of these indexes will be updated for online verification as well.</p>

<p>The Ancestry website reveals no Matthew Engh living in North Dakota or any history of a Matthew Engh. Me thinks it is a hoax........</p>
<p>I couldn't find anything either - no newspaper article, Ancestry listing, anything. There are 5 hits for Mattew Engh on Google but none of these could conceivably be a Vet.

<p>SRwiki why bother saying that? There are higher forces over here on this page. As long as they don't agree with you, Engh's name will remain on the list and people like Mr. Young will bash at you for wanting to make the list shorter</p>
<p>Re the above unsigned comment, the fact that you failed to sign is an indication that what you said is just 'sour grapes,' and without merit.

<p>Bart, you 'cry wolf,' writing 'vandalism' for every change you don't agree with...for example when someone deleted the redundant 'oldest woman' box from the Maria Capovilla page. Yet that was not vandalism, it was a difference of opinion.</p>
<p>Also, I never said it was a real case, I said we need to give time to investigate first...and a little investigation turned up no evidence of existence, so deleting was the proper recourse.

Definitely 105, but there's nothing in that news report that signifies that he is a veteran of World War I (or indeed, any war). Not every man now alive over 100 fought in WWI after all...</p>

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I have been told by a German colleague that calls to a nursing home were made, but they wouldn't release the date. This is not confirmed but it seems likely that Mr. Seim must have died recently. Notably, he would have been named the oldest man in Germany on Jan 29 2007 if still living. → <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 00:40, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Robert, I must respectfully disagree on this point <b>"Far more than we saw people do with the Polish cases" .</b> I have made continued written enquiries about Solinski (previously, and recently again) to his local town asking for more information about him. I'm not sitting on my arse deleting Solinski &amp; saying "I think he went in 2005", I'm trying to do something about it. I accept, and have done so from the start, Seim is dead, but please don't belittle other people's efforts simply because you don't like them.</p>
<p>I AM working on it &amp; hope to produce the evidence one day to confirm it. Please give it time and please have some patience, and less of these little "asides", hmmmm?</p>

Should this be mentioned somewhere on the page, either in the header or in the Canada section right above that table? --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 16:30, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What if Mr. Babcock ends up being the last? He was born in Canada. Did his training in Canada. However, not only has he spent most of his life in the USA. He is a United States citizen. Will this bother the Canadians? I Imagine he will wish to be buried in the USA. 209.240.206.209 11:15, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>He served in the Canadian military during WWI, so he'd be honoured on behalf of all the members of Canada's WWI military, regardless of where he lives now. Anyway, I didn't bring this here to discuss if it was right or wrong, just whether or not we should mention it on this page. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 13:30, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is an interesting tidbit, but does not belong on the main page. If so, we could probably add another 50 or 60 more interesting footnotes and so on. By the way, the three Canadian veterans say they are not interested in a state funeral. I guess they can be honored, but it sounds like all three want a private funeral... No it shouldn't be listed in the main section. 209.240.206.209 02:53, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Original research. I cannot find evidence that the term "The Great Scandal" is significantly connected to the rôle of the Roman Catholic Church in the rise of Nazism. Whether or not the rôle of the Roman Catholic Church in the rise of Nazism is sufficently presented in Wikipedia, the idea of this article is flawed. We have several articles on this epoch, events, organizations and actors (<a href="../../../e/n/a/Enabling_Act_39b1.html" title="Enabling Act">Enabling Act</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichskonkordat.html" title="Reichskonkordat">Reichskonkordat</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centre_Party_%28Germany%29_5e13.html" title="Centre Party (Germany)">Centre Party (Germany)</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_von_Papen_6b6e.html" title="Franz von Papen">Franz von Papen</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_Kaas_3696.html" title="Ludwig Kaas">Ludwig Kaas</a>). --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 20:03, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cleanup</b>. Digging a bit, the title actually refers to a hypothesis that Christian religious figures both Protestant and Catholic were involved in the Nazi rise to power. Broadly speaking, Germany is Protestant in the north and Catholic in the south. Thus none of the existing articles cited could properly address this issue. This is not original research. The term comes from an article by Gregory S. Paul in <i>Free Inquiry</i>. <a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;page=paul_23_4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;page=paul_23_4" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. In terms of notability this is a close call. It's been cited among some secular humanists as an argument against Christianity. Given the weight of the subject and the scholarliness of the accusation, I'd say this deserves a balanced article. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 21:41, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as another soabox article. If this title deserves an article it should be about the article in question (analogous to <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler%27s_Pope_311e.html" title="Hitler's Pope">Hitler's Pope</a>) and not used as a soapbox. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 22:04, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please check my link to the original citation. This article misrepresents the scope of the original. The original is not analogous to <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler%27s_Pope_311e.html" title="Hitler's Pope">Hitler's Pope</a>. My college courses on German history support at least this much: there was no great outcry among the Christian clergy in Germany against Nazism or the Holocaust. Heroic exceptions of course exist, yet the overall picture is indeed a worthy subject for discussion. To cast this in purely anti-Catholic terms is unfair to Catholics. Taken as a group, Lutheran clergy were equally silent. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 03:02, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'd consider your college sources to be mostly right, but this shouldn't result in separate article but be addressed in the relevant articles. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 11:52, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What relevant articles would those be? I checked every one suggested and none fit. The <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> <a href="../../../e/n/a/Enabling_Act_39b1.html" title="Enabling Act">Enabling Act</a> is inappropriate: that was a legal device the Nazis used to gain power. This doesn't fit into a biography of any specific Nazi figure. The <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichskonkordat.html" title="Reichskonkordat">Reichskonkordat</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centre_Party_%28Germany%29_5e13.html" title="Centre Party (Germany)">Centre Party (Germany)</a>, and <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler%27s_Pope_311e.html" title="Hitler's Pope">Hitler's Pope</a> are all <i>specifically Catholic</i> discussions. Germany has a roughly equal proportion of mostly Lutheran Protestants. NPOV cannot be maintained when three separate articles cover Catholic collusion with the Nazis and none discusses Protestant collusion with the Nazis. When a thesis appears that actually treats both equally, one editor erases the Protestant component and rather than restore balance you prefer to merge it into slimly related matters or a Catholic article? Consider the gravity of the subject. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 15:01, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, the issue is grave but this is not the proper article. If you want some article on non-Catholic clergy and the Third Reich, they could be created. Also, judging from my experience, the starting editor of this article will not talk much about the things you ask for, focusing solely on <b>specifically Catholic</b> discussion (apart from a bit on Industrial magnates on the side). I'm sorry to say that but that's how it is. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 14:21, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep,Clean up and expand, possibly rename</b>. Does the funny name justify deletion of the widely expressed allegation? Who says it does? Why? Have <i>they</i> tried balancing the various articles , I ask. How could they not repeat the necessary back-ground and links into each such article. Is it not artificial , and does it not obscure . The reference here to the WWII veteran proves my point at the start of H's Pope- that the term was commonly understood by earlier generations, or is , at best , the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Pope_d240.html" title="Nazi Pope">Nazi Pope</a>. Because this was hazily understood by such generations, should we continue the haze obscuring it&#160;? Do we not , in fact require editors to obtain the plethora of recently published books concerning this subject both <i>pro</i> and <i>anti</i>, and write the article better? The presentation of the subject of how the dictaorshop took legal hold at the Nazi/Hitler pages is minimal in understanding, and only I included the Communist arrests. Before that, it was written in WP that the Communist party <i>had been banned</i> from the Reichstag , for chrissakes . Keep, &amp; invent true name.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Just because the home page for Clear Channel states it is partnered with Garageband to showcase unsigned artists is irrelevant...Does that mean every artist listed on Clear Channel is unsigned? NO! Google "Tim McGowan" He is all over the place, get your facts right 1st! Overly illustrated!! Because someone showed the initiative to brighten the page up and be informative at the same time with album cover pictures and logos? This artist deserves to be listed. Have any of you heard of Kitaro or Arkenstone either???

<li><b>RE: Kill it with fire</b> "Blatant self-promotion" would be the case if I was indeed Tim McGowan but, Tim McGowan I am NOT!! What do you find offensive about this page? The CD Cover artwork? The Logos? or his promo picture? #1 When Reading about any artist many people like to see the cover artwork...it adds to the collective information about the artists and tells a story in itself. #2 Many people like to see what the artist looks like. #3 Logos are as much a part of an artists identity as #1 &amp; #2. #4. Permission was granted for inclusion of all materials used. Who knows their career history better than the artist himself. You are assured 100% accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really don't see what the fuss is all about here. Other than being unfamiliar with the artist in question...Maybe you should broaden your horizon and listen to different genres. New age is a small selective market but thousands of music lovers do appreciate it. I am sorry you don't particulary find the information interesting but many fans do. McMusic</p>

<li><b>Criteria Met</b>. It says in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">criteria</a> "is notable if it meets ANY one of the following criteria:" He definately meets several of them, (#1, #2, #3 and #4 immediately jumps out just by visiting his website), if you want you can do the research...The article I wrote is neutral...I did not say he was the best thing since chocolate. I merely described his music for the reader who may never have heard any and wondered what to expect, as in style, if they did. His bio tells the story of what he has done in his musical lifetime so far. How is that an ad? There was no personal attack on your name either, as you put it "Draw whatever conclusions you wish from my choice of username" It was merely a conclusion such as yours on mine. Albeit a wrong one! You say you don't have a problem with Mr McGowan being listed, you can see he meets the criteria, therefore, if you have indeed become an administrator, please put an end to this nonsense and remove any notices and allow this page to be accessed directly without any further obstruction.
<ul>
<li>The article indicates that McGowan's <i>former bands</i> meet criteria #1 and #2; this is an article about McGowan himself. McMusic does not appear to be a major label, so #3 is out. I see no indication of meeting #4. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 20:36, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Mr McGowan being the writer and copyright holder of the songs for previous bands he has worked with still entitles him to be considered to the meet the criteria of #1. regardless of who else played an instrument along side him in the recording. As far as #2 goes. I can also confirm that McGowan has toured the UK, several times, and I presume you will agree would be considered a medium size country. #3 and #4. are moot points, one does not have to meet all criteria listed...it states "ANY" should be met.</li>

Counter to this is the reason to keep because it is a companion to another page, which I don't feel is an adequate reason enough to keep.

<li><b>Comment</b> To qualify, the person had to serve in France during WWI and still be alive in Nov 1998 or later. The number is likely 2,000. I feel this is an 'example' of commemoration, but should not be the criteria for inclusion. I prefer another choice: perhaps those whose deaths made the AP wire?

<li>I think there is also a problem with most of the individual articles on the survivors. For the one's I looked at, the only reason they have articles is because they happen to be alive.

<li>Slighty off topic but why is it OK to honour Generals but not average soldiers? Most Generals, certainly in the UK and certainly at the time of WW1, did a darned sight less than the average soldier and yet, because they were born into the right family and thus became Generals, they are considered more readily notable!!

<li>No I didnt mean Wikipedia honoured Generals. Countries tend to honour the well-born and ignore the rest. Here in France there are streets named after Generals, likewise in the UK. Few if any are named after Privates. Its seems rather unfair. However, on a very closely related subject Wikipedia AfD's do tend to claim that "all nobility is notable" - which is just about the biggest load of t**s I've ever heard. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 17:14, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I for one, do not think Generals are inherently encyclopedic, but let's face it, many who fought in wars very are significant historical figures. And MiB is right, we're not honoring anyone. Certainly in terms of heroic deeds, many enlisted men did much more than any general; count the number of congressional medals of honor given to privates and comapre it to the number given to generals. But it is a simple fact that <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Patton_6b36.html" title="General Patton">General Patton</a> is an encyclopedic topic. The private who stood next to the guy General Patton slapped is not. Some guy who fought at the Second Battle of Ypres and and lived to be 102 is not any more encyclopedic than the guy who fought next to him who died of cancer at 67. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:44, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes I agree re: Patton and that's a fair point re: the chap at 102 and the chap at 67. I suppose my problem is that in instances such as these, it seems to me that it is recognition which confers notability and not vice versa. (Hence Generals are more typically notable because they are recognised; even though they do not do necessarily do anything in order to become notable). That recognition, in turn - as is the case with nobility - owes a good deal to the fact that they form a much smaller and more prominent group. Precisely what these Veterans form by virtue of their longevity and relative uniqueness. Hence keep! Phew...

<li><b>Delete</b>. The whole concept is un-encyclopedic. When I was a kid <i>Life</i> magazine would have an article for every Civil War veteran who died, but those deaths were current events, news-worthy because of their rarity, but not historical.

<li><b>Keep</b> Or <b>merge</b> into new article, "Last Surviving Veterans of the First World War." France decided in 1998 to honor all veterans who served in France AND were still alive 80 years later with the Legion d'Honneur. Of course, the number may have been about 2,000. The real question for me is at what point does the number remaining become significant? No one even bothered with 1998 and 1999, so the starting point seems to be Jan 1, 2000...those who survived to the new millennium. I note the 2005, 2004 lists are much better maintained; 2003 and 2002 have some use; 2001 and 2000 are thinner. So, each article should have been nominated for deletion separately.<br />
Also, this is not a "category" list of people with articles: the idea is that while a few of them (Emiliano Mercado Del Toro, Henry Allingham) merit their own articles, the majority do not; hence the list becomes a way to note a few small tidbits about each one.<a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 21:39, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The point was, this was ALREADY a compromise. Some fanatics went around, trying to create articles for all these people. Having a list in one place with a small mention seems rational. There are many instances in which lists are made, and not everyone on the list is notable, but the list itself is. For example:<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_elements_named_after_people" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_elements_named_after_people" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_elements_named_after_people</a><br />
Wikipedia does not yet have a page called Colonel Samarski.<br />
Colonel Samarski may not be notable, but "samarium" is.<br />
However, if you want to belabor the point, nearly everyone in the lists came from an AP wire story (that is, I found out about Kansas's last veteran from another state, not Kansas). Also, several of them have seen extensive media coverage, and so it makes sense to have an article that lists them, together with the others who may not warrant a separate article.<br />
Consider, for example, that France currently has six remaining WWI veterans who served 3+ months, and plans to make paintings of them. Henry Allingham of the UK has his own museum exhibit. Also, newspapers tend to mis-inform the public. In Jan 2005, it was claimed that Carlo Orelli was Italy's last WWI veteran (but there really are more still living).<br />
Finally, because what defines a veteran or significance varies,we see for example in Australia, "last Gallipolli survivor," "last digger," "last active-service," "last enlisted," etc. Clearly, a page with all of them together helps to educate and disambiguate what tends to be a confusing subject.<br />

<li>As it looks like we're not really moving towards consensus here, a merge, along the lines of what myself and Ryoung122 proposed, might be worth pursuing. Obviously we need a cutoff here (we're not going to have a page for every year), so the 21st century might be a good point (that will involve losing the year 2000 deaths, however). SimonP makes an interesting point. He says that the Canadian War Museum "are constantly being asked about how many surviving veterans there are". I'm sure that's the case. Many people are curious, and I am a bit too. The answer, however, is not several pages of information, but a 2-digit number. I'm sure almost no one is really curious about what their names are, except their families (who obviously know), and some historians (who don't use Wikipedia as a source). And Zoe is quite right, almost all of these are not notable, and do not deserve their own articles (with few exceptions). -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:37, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I know Wikipedia is not a memorial, but listing those World War 1 veterans who died in a certain year is not a memorial. It should be kept because it can be a reference for people to see how many world war 1 veterans were living in a certain year.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> as proposed above. For justification see my comments on the AfD on the surviving veterans. I think the 80th anniversary of the ending of the war, when France awarded the Légion d'Honneur, or January 1, 2000, or the beginning of the 21st century, are three possible options for an objective time at which to begin noting the deaths of those who experienced this war.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Whilst this is not the sort of information one would find in a paper encyclopedia, it is, in my opinion, useful, and worth keeping. I followed links to this page having seen a documentary on surviving veterans, and was curious to see if Wikipedia had any further information on the individuals featured, and those still alive in other countries.
