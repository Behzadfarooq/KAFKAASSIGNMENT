<li><b>Comment</b> - First of all I would just like to make clear that I am not Jennifer Hassum nor do I have a personal relationship with her, so this is not a vanity article. I created this article to connect two other articles in which she is mentioned and to provide extra infomation about her to readers of those articles. Jen is notable in both Canadian and toronto-area politics and I wrote a extensive rationale as to why I feel this way, which can be found on the discussion page of the article in question. As far as the issue of sources, I would be happy to add sources and expand the content if the article is allowed to remain. --Carrottop 79 02:36, 16 November 2006</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, both Toronto <i>and</i> Canada! Sometimes articles like this come up for politicians that are <i>just</i> notable to make it and this is one, I don't think it's deletable <i>yet</i> but if she falls from the public eye we can delete it then, conversely if she becomes prime minister of Canada we can flesh it out. <b><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElomis_0932.html" title="User:Elomis"><span style="background:#008;color:#fff">•E<span style="background:#206">l<span style="background:#504">om<span style="background:#702">i<span style="background:#a00">s•</span></span></span></span></span></a></b> 02:50, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I have added some sources for you guys (and any gals), any more input in that regard would be helpful. As far as the notablity, as I mentioned in the discussion page, Jen is currently the president of Canada's largest student union with forty-one thousand members, at one of Canada's top universities and she is the youth wing co-chair of one of Canada's major political parties (and will be for about 2 more years) which at last count had support of 22% of Canadians and in the last election received over two and a half million votes. --Carrottop 79 03:14, 16 November 2006</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> sourced article with some what established notability. Simpleerob 05:13, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The subject is not notable. She may have lobbied for a cause, and have supplied quotes, but she has not been the <b>primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works</b> whose source is independent of the person. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Ohconfucius.

Being an official of a political party organization does not necessarily mean that a person is of sufficient interest to the general public as to warrant an encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 07:39, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This woman: 1) was/is active in party politics 2) demonstrated against the Iraq War 3) serves in student government. None of these activities, each a quintessential activity of college students, provides a basis for notability. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 08:46, 16 November 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> She may be the head of the largest student union in Canada - but I would not, for example, consider the student body president at the University of Texas (which has, like, what - a gazillion students?) notable. The rest of it doesn't really add up to notability for me, either - the mention of media coverage helps, but doesn't put it over the top, so I'm a weakish delete.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 17:36, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> These student activities are admirable. But the best objective test of notability is independent published sources, per the great discussion in <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> It was mentioned that the an official with the Young Democrats or Republicans wouldn't deserve an article but Lauren Wolfe president of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_Democrats_of_America_649b.html" title="College Democrats of America">College Democrats of America</a> has an article about her and her role with that organization as do other party officials in gerenal. To suggest that an official of one credible political party of worthy of an article mention and one of another credible party is not, is extremely partisan and if I am not mistaken Wikipedia is not a partisan body user Carrottop 79 14:55 16 November
<ul>
<li>True - but in fairness it looks from the discussion page of that article that it was marked for speedy deletion at one point, and for some reason just slipped through. So maybe it should also be deleted.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 21:02, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I set out to find ten other examples of existing biographies for youth wing presidents (chairs, co-chairs or directors) of various political parties, if anyone wants more I would be happy to spend more time researching for more, however I feel I have made my point and have demonstrated that there is precedent for articles of this type on even less noteworthy subjects. If you want to go on a delete frenzy, I also saw a great deal of party official in other party wings with articles Carrottop 79 23:54, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> FYI two of these has been considered for deletion, with result no concesus in both cases and three others are supported by the Wikipedia Politics and government work group Carrottop 79 23:54, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you want to keep looking for them, please do. This is a good start for preparing AfD's for non-notable bios. Your point -- that the encyclopedia sometimes accumulates articles that really should be deleted -- is well-taken. But I think you're wanting to go the next step and say "and so we shouldn't delete any particular one of these articles." Nah - we should delete them all (assuming they really are all non-notable, which should be decided individually.) What you are showing is that we need to be more active in deleting articles about people who are not notable. What you <i>need</i> to show is that this one particular artice is about someone who <i>is</i> notable, and therefore shouldn't be deleted.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 00:22, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
