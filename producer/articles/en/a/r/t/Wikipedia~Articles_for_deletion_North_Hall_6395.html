<li>Laura, why don't we "ignore all rules" (as your bio suggests) and let the page remain. Another article in Wikipedia about a material subject advances the objective of Wikipedia. Look up "encyclopedic." It means, inter alia, "comprehensive." --Dexter Speare 05:59, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete.</b> North is no more notable than any other dorm. At this point, I don't think we want an article on every dorm at every college. <a href="../../../l/i/z/User%7ELizardWizard_a997.html" title="User:LizardWizard"><sup>L</sup><sub>W</sub><font size="3">izard</font></a> <a href="../../../l/i/z/User_talk%7ELizardWizard_e172.html" title="User talk:LizardWizard">@</a> 07:30, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think that the page is no less useful than articles such as the one on <a href="../../../b/e/x/Bexley_Hall_%28MIT%29_1c1e.html" title="Bexley Hall (MIT)">Bexley_Hall_(MIT)</a>...</p>

<ul>
<li>North is one of the oldest buildings on campus, and has a lot of unique history (more coming soon), including several members that became major donors to the college. I created the page because I think that it will be of use to a sufficiently large number of people...
<ul>
<li>The entire HMC community, especially newcomers, who want to understand our school's unique traditions and dorm histories</li>
<li>Dorm Alums, of which there are around 1000, will definitely want to know the current status of the dorm.</li>
<li>Prospective students want to know more about the college than can be explained in a single article. I know that I used every internet resource possible when looking at HMC, and I'm sure that current prospective students are doing the same.</li>
<li>I wish that there were more detailed information about graduate schools that I'm currently looking at--not just cursory generalizations, but in-depth information about the schools' institutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How is the page harming Wikipedia? Only those who want the information will go to it, and the number of students interested in the dorm will keep it well maintained.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that the page enhances the depth and usefulness of wikipedia. But, I would like to improve it... how could I change the page to make it more suited to Wikipedia? Changes that I plan to incorporate soon include:</p>
<ul>
<li>notable alumni</li>
</ul>
<p>other suggestions are welcome.</p>

Thanks for the feedback. Rdchambers 08:01, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I do not accept the "George Washington slept here" concept of notability that other users apparently do. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 08:12, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It would be an outrage to have this page deleted. Several wealthy alumni who have contributed to the college and the human condition are greatly anticipating the permanence of this page and how it honors their legacy they left during their time here at our humble college. Harvey Mudd College may be small, but that does not exclude it and its rich history from being represented in Wikipedia. In the words of Margaret Mead, "Never doubt that a small, group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Move'</b>
<ul>
<li>North is substanially more notable then most other dorms at other campuses. This is probably revealed in the fact that someone bothered to write something about it in the first place. North Dorm along with East Dorm and West Dorm at Harvey Mudd are regularly sites of study for anthropology and sociology students and faculty at the nearby colleges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>As to not wanting an article on individual dorms at colleges I see no reason why not to allow people to write them, provided their is enough information to warrant it. These articles could provide a wealth of information to both prospective and current students about campus life. As noted before, there are already several out there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I see no specific criteria for deletion of this article in the offical policies beside it being a "Such a minor branch of a subject that it doesn't deserve an article." However, the North page is already of a size that it is entirely reasonable to give it its own article. Merging this article would decrease the current quality of both the Harvey Mudd College page and detract from the information contained in North Hall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I do propose changing the title to North Hall (HMC) so as to avoid confusion if any other North Hall's (there has to be some) want to write articles. <a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETopkai22_3cdb.html" title="User:Topkai22">Topkai22</a> 09:04, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not a particularly interested party, but I say move, because why not have more detailed information available about colleges, etc? Just not on the main college page, where it distracts from the main article. And, after all, certainly other colleges have dorms or halls named "North" that are of no doubt of equal interest to them.</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> This page appears to have been made by current North Dorm residents, possibly by one of the dorm presidents (see Talk:North Hall). Guys, there's a reason that the "create new page" screen says not to create pages for your own groups - it's because you're not detached enough to be able to objectively determine whether the subject is in fact notable. In this case, it's not. Also, many of the facts are kind of volatile - while I was at Mudd, West was definitely the most "boisterous" dorm, and North had no particular "athletic" reputation. (I was in South Dorm 91-95.) <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenisMoskowitz_1bb7.html" title="User:DenisMoskowitz">DenisMoskowitz</a> 14:53, 2 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The funny thing is that when I was there (00-04) West had the highest GPA on campus despite vying for most "boisterous". I also venture that North's athletic reputation is primarily self-promulgated. — <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurascudder_7cfd.html" title="User:Laurascudder">Laura Scudder</a> | <a href="../../../l/a/u/User_talk%7ELaurascudder_bd8d.html" title="User talk:Laurascudder">Talk</a> 00:14, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't live at North Hall and I don't go to HMC. However, if the problem is that the boys aren't objective enough, I am more than willing to create the page for North Hall. It deserves an article in Wikipedia.
<ul>
<li>Funny that someone who doesn't go to HMC should be using a 134.173.*.* IP address.

<li>The point is not that the dorm always was what it is now. The point is that now the dorm has a certain reputation and that there is no need to strike its entry from Wikipedia because some people think it's silly. The dorm has been a part of this school almost as long as the rest of the school has and there is just as much validity to having a page for all of the other dorms as there is for having a North Dorm page. Nobody fabricated what is in the entry and nobody exaggerated what is in the entry so what real reason is there to delete the entry? NorthJesus 12:58, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>None of the other dorms has a Wikipedia page. The reason to delete the entry is that Wikipedia has standards - otherwise we get flooded with people putting up pages for themselves or the club/language/handshake they've made up with 3 of their friends. North Dorm is not notable outside the Claremont Colleges community, so I don't think it's notable. (Some dorm information may be relevant to the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvey_Mudd_College_d435.html" title="Harvey Mudd College">Harvey Mudd College</a> page, but none of them really deserve their own page.)<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenisMoskowitz_1bb7.html" title="User:DenisMoskowitz">DenisMoskowitz</a> 21:16, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In fact, at least four of Mudd's eight dorms match North's assertions of uniqueness: definitive character, annual parties, and traditional named suites (i.e., Nevada, Who Wants Jack Daniels, Atomic Bar, etc.), so North isn't even alone in this within Mudd. True, <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a> paper, but everything that is unique about North could be effectively conveyed within the HMC article, and I would say this about my own dorm, too. — <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurascudder_7cfd.html" title="User:Laurascudder">Laura Scudder</a> | <a href="../../../l/a/u/User_talk%7ELaurascudder_bd8d.html" title="User talk:Laurascudder">Talk</a> 00:09, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Move and redirect</b> I maintain that dorms and dorm life are an important part of information about a college. However, putting such information on the college's main page would detract from the academic aspects of the college. Having looked through some other cases, it seems the appropiate thing to do with the article is to move it to a central 'List of Harvey Mudd College Dorms' and include entries for the other dorms on campus. While I still support just renaming and allowing seperate articles for dorms, aggragation seems to be more standard. <a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETopkai22_3cdb.html" title="User:Topkai22">Topkai22</a> 04:34, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
