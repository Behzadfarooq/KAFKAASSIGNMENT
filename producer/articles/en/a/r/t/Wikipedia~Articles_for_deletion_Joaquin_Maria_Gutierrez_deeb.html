<li><b>Delete</b>. The maths prizes are not a reason for inclusion, winning national grade/high school music competitions aren't either in my opinion.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is the kind of problem I am talking about. The article is so poorly written that the importance of his achievements don't come through. He did not win a school competition, it was a <i>nationwide</i> competition, in all instances. What constitutes a prodigy, may I ask? Is it Google sources? If you want some more evidence, may I direct you to <a href="http://www.news.ops.gov.ph/archives2005/dec02.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.news.ops.gov.ph/archives2005/dec02.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which is a government archive. It clearly states in one section that President Arroyo awarded Gutierrez an Achiever Award. Personally, I think that for a single person to attract the attention of a president, in whatever nation, he has to be quite talented or skilled or notable or whatever word you'd like to use. I do not think this is a vanity article or anything similar. This kid is fast on the rise, and sooner or later, somebody's going to write him in here, whether you like it or not, so what's the use in deleting it? <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_Diego_3829.html" title="User:Don Diego">Don Diego</a>[[User talk:Don Diego|&lt;sup&gt;(Talk)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:09, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Then perhaps you could be <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> and rewrite the article, as you are clearly well informed on this young man, and so would be well-placed to reshape this abhorrence into something that can convince people the article should exist. His being 'fast on the rise' is not going to convince anyone that an article should exist on him now.

For every one page of promotion the Philippines disseminates in the international media, the United States puts out at least 20,000.

<li>I don't see what's so racist in saying that I don't believe that a 15-year old can do math and music and come from the Philippines at the same time. It's a fact of life that even competent adults, much less teens, cannot balance their time so that they can study two entirely different fields and still be good at it. And I do not know anybody talented from the Philippines, which I think is currently embroiled in a corruption scandal, correct? I simply cannot begin to comprehend how a "prodigy" can come from such an un-nurturing country. And even with proof of his "achievements", I'd still be very skeptical. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJake013_0fc9.html" title="User:Jake013">Jake013</a> 13:26, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> per Deaththoreau. Sp@rkplug 13:15, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b>. I happen to know Master Gutierrez personally, and I think he does deserve an entry, after all he's done (though it is in dire need of rewriting). I don't think it would be fair to cite a lack of sources as proof of non-notability. After all, some of the articles written in the Philippines aren't online, and some are real old or have been erased from archives (which happened to some reviews I've been looking for), so it wouldn't be fair saying that a lack of Google sources justifies his non-notability. While it is true taht he still has much to achieve, it is also true that so far, he has already achieved much. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChosen_One_4db9.html" title="User:Chosen One">Chosen One</a> 16:12, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
