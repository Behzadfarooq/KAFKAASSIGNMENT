<li><b>Keep</b>: This program received major news attention (including television coverage). <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=iphone+cease+and+desist&amp;sa=N&amp;start=0" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=iphone+cease+and+desist&amp;sa=N&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a Google News search with at least 25 different news stories about the software. This rattled a major corporation's cage and resulted in the creation of multiple non-trivial published works from news organizations. Per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> (and <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> (proposed guideline)), this software is notable. By the way, the software is released (I have it on my phone right now), but was smothered within 12 hours of its release by Apple lawyers making it more difficult but not impossible to find the distribution sources still hosting it. There are announced plans for a larger resolution version from the creator as well.

<ul>
<li>Let me put it this way, so far it's only notable because Apple is taking legal action. If Apple wasn't taking legal action and the article was just about the software itself then ... and that's hardly a major achievement or .. well.. notable. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> might help to explain the general view on notability. It is a bit of a grey area for some topics, but I think it's rather clear for this piece of software. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 20:08, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, that is what we are saying, that the <i>legal action</i> is notable. We should cover the topic of the legal action, with some note on the software itself for context, but not a whole article. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 20:59, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Considering it was 12 hours between announcement/release and Apple legal action, it's pretty much impossible to know if the software would have been notable solely in its own right or would have been ignored until Apple tagged it (and no respectable source is going to mention one without the other at this point obviously). That still does not remove the fact that the software is the focus of a number of the articles (titles similar to <i>How to have an iPhone early</i>, etc). I don't want to fill the AfD with back-n-forth, but I just want to make sure it's clear that the criteria are met for the software per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. I agree the legal action is notable and should be introduced to the appropriate article(s)...which would also help de-orphan the article under discussion, too. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 21:08, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When I said "slightly notable," I should have used better language. I should have said that it's notability is tenuous. It barely reaches the level of notability in my opinion, and *only* because of the cease-and-desist from Apple. I also suspect that it's notability will quickly fade in the next few months. That's what I meant (in my mind, at least) when I described it as "slightly notable." I'll make an effort to be more clear in the future. <a href="../../../b/j/_/User%7EBJ_Nemeth_b3f9.html" title="User:BJ Nemeth">BJ Nemeth</a> 15:38, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I took another look at the software itself, is it actually ANYTHING more than a simple Palm OS launcher screen skin?

<li><b>delete</b>, it would be odd if Apple had not taken action in something like this, given the name. I can't even see how its controversial. It would be more notable if either the application or the maker's justification had any merit.
