<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I believe that this "list" article merits deletion due to Wikipedia's policy that it is not an indiscriminate collection of information; specifically, that it is not for "lists or repositories of loosely associated topics." The policy seems to indicate that if the list itself (not the entries <i>comprising</i> the list, but the actual list itself) is famous on its own standing, or contributed to the fame of the subject, it is acceptable to keep; I do not believe this list satisfies that corollary. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">contribs</a>) 17:10, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Unclear what a "device" would consist of, at any rate.

<li><s><b>Keep</b> originally, I merged these into a list to get someone else to nominate it for deletion. However, we need to make sure that these <b>do not get their own articles in the future</b>. If someone can create an eneyclopedic article on star wars technology (or devices, in this case), then I would support that. Think of it this way; having one semi-guideline violation beats having 150 major guideline violations. The lesser of two evils is that this list remain as a "cruft dam" to provide potential for an encyclopedic shift and also to save on process, time, and lost ambition by new users with potential. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 18:39, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</s> <b>Weak delete</b>; not as many items on this one as some of the others, so not as significant of a deal. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 01:56, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> That might work for some, but we may still need something to keep devicecruft sealed away on this encyclopedia. Fortunately, it isn't paper, so these lists serve as prime devices (no pun intended). So yeah, if this gets deleted, that could be a great option. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 01:50, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Voting against policy is the same as saying, "Hey, who cares about this encyclopedia?" Sure there are other lists with old strong factions behind them saying "we own these articles and you can't do a damned thing about it". Maybe that's true, but it doesn't change my vote for the integrity of the policies they violate. All they do is set a precident for other new editors like myself to become confused, misdirected, and shown that the policies simply don't matter. And if the policies don't matter, then you might as well just say consensus dosen't matter either. Ste4k 22:28, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> I actually created this page with the intention of trying to cut down on the <i>Star Wars</i> stub articles by keeping them in one handy spot, but I believe my intention, while honest, was wrong. I'm a huge fan of <i>Star Wars</i>, but I, too, like to try to cut down on the cruft. This article in particular is a rather random, arbitrary collection of other articles; I think it might be best to delete this article. The same material likely exists on Wookieepedia, and I think the Wikipedia and <i>Star Wars</i> communities could be best served by being redirected there for articles about things such as devices and items that are not relevant outside of <i>Star Wars</i>. – <a href="../../../m/i/p/User%7EMipadi_1585.html" title="User:Mipadi">Mipadi</a> 01:52, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If I was allowed to endorse you as the other major merger of this list, it could be speedy deleted.

<li>Or <b>Create</b> a well-referenced, rounded, out-of-universe perspective, and encyclopedic article called <b>Devices in Star Wars</b>, which will assert the significance of devices to the various events, provide a brief synopsis (history) of the major ones, perhaps a section on their design for the movies, and so on. It beats a list of random devices, and it can still contain cruft to an extent. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 02:03, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. These are an extremely important part of the Star Wars universe.

<li>Delete. This is merely adding to the marketing hype of these films which wile novel when first filmed are little more than feeble rehashes at this stage acting as massive clothes horses for the associated merchandising.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't agree with Mike's canned nominations much as it might be appropriate to some of the articles subject to his AFD-spree, as it is not a list of links to other articles, but the articles themselves. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 23:07, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> A lot of the content of this article could probably be moved into other articles. For example, the gravity well projector stuff could easily be put into the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interdictor_cruiser.html" title="Interdictor cruiser">Interdictor cruiser</a> article; stuff about hyperspace-related technologies could be merged into the <i>Star Wars</i> section of <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperspace_%28science_fiction%29.html" title="Hyperspace (science fiction)">Hyperspace (science fiction)</a>. Tiny little pieces of information, such as datapad, could just be put inline where relevant (example: "…a datapad (the <i>Star Wars</i> equivalent of a portable computer)…". – <a href="../../../m/i/p/User%7EMipadi_1585.html" title="User:Mipadi">Mipadi</a> 16:54, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is always a very good idea; I was talking to Jedi6 about doing that for the minor creatures. We can create a general encyclopedic article about "devices" and "creatures" in the future (turning the lists into an article), and bring details into the context. More on this idea on the WikiProject page in the near future. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 17:03, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
