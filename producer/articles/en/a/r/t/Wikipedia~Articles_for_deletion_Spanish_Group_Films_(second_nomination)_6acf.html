<p>This article keeps getting recreated. I nominated it previously for deletion (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Spanish_Group_Films_997c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Spanish Group Films">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Spanish Group Films</a>) and it was early closed with a speedy delete. It was recreated and eventually protected, but then the protection page was deleted, and now it's been recreated again. Let's settle this by giving it the full AfD run. It is a borderline hoax, as the "company" appears to be nothing more than a few high school kids. <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day</a>. --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 04:12, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks for visiting the site. Obviously you liked it, and hopefully you watched some of the movies. That is the updates page, and is not a "claim to fame." It is simply a place for our fans to see what is new with the site. Oh, and I think it's pathetic when an adult man edits and deletes wikipedia articles. Especially if the group is working their way up, because you clearly don't know what that's like. So instead of going out and being with people, you edit an encyclopedia.

<p>This is not a hoax in any way. This is simply noticing a WORTHY group, as they have put much energy and work into these projects. If what you are saying below is true, then you are discriminating articles by the age of the writer. Check IP adresses for visits to the site. There are many visits to the site from different places. How come this is not a valid article? What could make this company recieve "accreditation" from your super educated administrators so that this group can be realized? I guess I can understand how this could be a way for you people to make up for the fact that none of you have ever done something notable in your life, but lets be reasonable. Why don't you delete the 20th Century Fox article? Because it's a corporation and makes millions? Or because they have made hundreds of films? Isn't that unfair descrimination? If this article is continually recreated, what does that tell you about the will of this group and how important it is to others around it? You should understand that this was not thought up in one school day, nor is it a joke. It is a legitamate company on the rise, but all you see is amateur filmmaking, and that is what you base it on. By continually deleting this article, you are smashing the dreams of the founders of the company, and are disappointing everyone in the town of Somers, CT. And you should realize that you can continually delete the article, but the it is always going to be recreated. Because that is how important this group is to people that have dreams, something you should learn from as you sit on your couch and laugh at other people's work. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.209.25.80 (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.209.25.80.html" title="User talk:72.209.25.80">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.209.25.80_c1a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.209.25.80">contribs</a>) 14:51, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>Keep Spanish Group Films. It seems to have lasted a long enough time on wikipedia anyway. You would save your sorry selves time and energy blocking all the people that add refrences to the group, and deleting all the articles that are made about the group. Think about it. It's completely understandable that a group wants to get proper recognition. And the site is in no way advertising. It is giving the facts about the founders and controllers of the company, which is wrong how? <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustfor52_944c.html" title="User:Justfor52">Justfor52</a> (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJustfor52_d87c.html" title="User talk:Justfor52">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Justfor52_15f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Justfor52">contribs</a>) 15:01, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So what if it was made up by a couple school kids? Does that make it any less real? Does it make it any less credible? And it is certainly not a hoax, as the company has clearly put up several movies and has a significant fan base.

<li><b>Comment</b> So what you are basing this entire argument on is the fact that Spanish Group Fims is not online through a valid source. Which means that the only way a topic can be included into Wikipedia is to have it be online. So what you are implying is that everything worth mentioning can be found online, which you know as well as I do, is certainly not true. If public popularity and mainstream is a necessity of topics, then mention that somewhere in your fance guideline articles. But there are things out there that don't need to be writen about online for them to be important or worthy of mention. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.209.25.80 (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.209.25.80.html" title="User talk:72.209.25.80">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.209.25.80_c1a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.209.25.80">contribs</a>) 15 November 2006 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> No. All our articles must contain only material that has been published by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Those reliable sources need not be on-line, however we must still <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite</a> them. If we were to investigate a topic ourselves first-hand and write up what we had found, that would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. We must therefore rely on the information gathered about a topic by reliable sources. This allows us to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> the information in an article by <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citing</a> those reliable sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> Spanish Group Films. In response to the above comments, I would like to add, what is needed for a topic to be "worthy of mention"? What I understand from reading the above comments is that Wikipedia is not the encyclopedia for topics that are <i>important</i>, but rather for the topics that get the most promotions. This is not how the system should be based, and I am sure that Spanish Group Films is not the only one who has pleaded this case. However, I would also like to ask how much of a limit is put on Wikipedia? Is there a limit to the amount of articles that can be put on? I understand where your administrative views are coming, but I also believe that an encyclopedia presents to you facts on whatever you would like to know about, and I know of many people who would like very much to kow about Spanish Group Films. Isn't that a reliable enough source? 72.10.100.204 19:37, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Guys, I'm really sorry, but there's only so much advice we can give you. Please take your time to read and re-read the policies <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> has directed you to above. They explain things fair better than we can, that's what they're there for. The one last thing I can suggest you do is to take a look at some of the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured articles</a>. Pay particular attention to the "references" or "footnotes" section. These <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite</a> sources such as books, scientific journals, respected current affairs websites and newspaper and magazine articles. There is no way that any of these will have covered <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=SpanishGroupFilms" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=SpanishGroupFilms" rel="nofollow">your home movies</a>. Finally, yes, there <i>is</i> a limit to the amount of information that can be stored on Wikipedia. Wikipedia exists on very real computer servers, that are paid for by <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising" class="external text" title="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising" rel="nofollow">real money</a>.
