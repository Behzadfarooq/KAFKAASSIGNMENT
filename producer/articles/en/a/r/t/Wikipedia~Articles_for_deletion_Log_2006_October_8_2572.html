<dd>That's not logic to keep. People are interested in Mario, should Tatanga get an article? If this site is give an article because people are interested in the subject matter, then that opens the floodgates to say that any site about youkais is notable because people are interested in the subject matter. People were interested in the article about Bizarre Uprising, a webcomic that used to have an article, but it failed its second AfD despite having around 300k Alexa Traffic Rank. That is not logic to keep, and it should not be given an article for the sole reason that a handful of people want an article on the subject - rather, it should not be given one because the cold hard facts say beyond any shadow of a doubt that it is not appropriate on Wikipedia. Alexa and Google are commonly used in factoring a site's notability on Wikipedia, and both paint a clear picture that it is not that big of a web site. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 01:13, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I do not think this article should be deleted. It's not a spamvertisement, it's actually quite the opposite. It has extensive information about the flaws of this website and the controversy there. The only reasons this article was even filed for deletion was because the website's creator didn't want the article posted because he didn't like what it was saying about it; he accused the article of being slanderous and a violation of his copyright, neither of which are valid claims. Please do not delete this article. Shikino 17:09, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The only reason? That's funny, I seem to recall nominating it with the argument that it's not notable on the basis that it does not pass two of the biggest tests of notability. Additionally, you yourself admit that there is extensive coverage of the flaws of the site. But this is the only way any of the site's content is discussed, through the controversy section. This is most certainly not a case of NPOV; if it were, you would not be so focused on the criticism section (your focus giving power to the argument that you are using this to attack the site). If you were not biased as Hushicho says, then you would have added sections about the article's content. There can not be a controversy section before there is any actual content. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 19:49, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How is it non-notable? With that article, I could say half of the articles on Wikipedia are non-notable. This is a major debate in the online Japanese folklore community. And the article <b>is</b> NPOV. It does actually discuss the site's content. Did you even read the article? It even veers toward the positive side at the beginning, when discussing the site's history. Plus, this isn't a question of negativity or positivity. It's a question of fact. Factuality, I think, should be the main question in a discussion of whether or not to delete the article. The fact that the main question here is "notability" (who decides what's notable or not, by the way?) is unbelievable to me. This is supposed to be an encyclopedia, not a celebrity magazine. Of course, that's just my opinion. Shikino 01:53, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's unbelievable to you that we draw the line about what should be? So basically, it doesn't matter that it has next to know notaiblity and thusly doesn't deserve to be on Wikipedia, as long as it's factual? And the positivity of the article is a blurb compared to the controversy section, which is more or less the only content of the article and the only way content of the site is dicussed is discussing how it's controversial. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 03:01, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You did a good job showing that you are NPOV, since you clearly refer to what the criticism of the website says as the truth and fact. In fact, the fact that you clearly show dislike towards this site makes me question why you would even want it to have an article. In fact, you yourself was the one who created this article, and are the one who inserted any mention of controversy in the first place. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 05:21, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I never tried to hide that I wrote the majority (if not all) of the article. As for the criticism of the website, it is fact. And it is fact that is easily proven and well-documented. Saying that a fact is a fact doesn't mean I'm not NPOV. I've never condemned the website or even said anything slightly disparaging about it. On the contrary, I've repeatedly stated my opinions concerning its right to exist. I'm a bit mystified that this argument has anything to do with NPOV. I thought (although I admit I could be wrong) that Wikipedia was an encyclopedia that prided itself on things like completeness and factuality (although factuality is something that can be easily changed, I'd have thought that it would be valued by those who run it). As for why I want the article, I believe the nonfactual aspect of this website should be known; this is why the article <b>is</b> notable, because Youkaimura is a major issue in the online aspect of Japanese folklore. The "information" there is frequently presented as fact in places online where people might not be as immersed in Japanese folklore and can't tell what's real and what's made up. As I've repeatedly said elsewhere, folklore is folklore. It's an area of study, and is not anything similar to the genre of fantasy where "anything goes" is the rule of thumb. The vital importance of factuality in the field of folklore studies, specifically Japanese folklore, is why I believe this article is both necessary and notable. Personally, I think importance should trump popularity, which is why I think some random internet rating is irrelevant in this case. Shikino 23:28, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So you created the article for the sake of putting up a criticism section? Odd, what you have stated contradicts this! So it would seem that you were lying. And you're right - since this article is not important, it should be deleted. Anyhow, one of the editors that has contributed to the criticism section is also a member of the forum sourced. As I see it, Youkaimura has never referred to itself as an academic resource. And from what I've seen, members of the cited forum have harrassed and threatened members of the Youkaimura forum, which - as you would guess it - invalidates them as a source, because they are naturally biased against the web site. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 23:39, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Man, this is so ridiculous it's not even funny. I never lied about anything. And please, if you're going to be making decisions on deleting an article, please bother to do some homework. You said, "I see it, Youkaimura has never referred to itself as an academic resource." Well, you're wrong. The owner has repeatedly claimed this; in fact, he's gone as far as to say that he's the best source, and that all other academic sources on the subject are flawed and/or poorly researched. A claim which is easily disproved if you bother to look into the subject at all. And as for harrassing and threatening, this is another claim which you'd do well to put a minutia of research into before believing it. The forum in question hasn't harrassed Youkaimura; on the contrary, it's the dictatorial owner of Youkaimura that's thrown most of the people on the forum in question out of Youkaimura simply for questioning the factuality of his content. If anyone's the perpetrator of harrassment, it's the owner of Youkaimura. Anyway, so, basically what you're saying is that Japanese folklore is unimportant. As I've said that this article is important to Japanese folklore and you've said in reply that it's therefore unimportant, that's pretty much what you're saying. Well, if Japanese folklore is unimportant, then anime is twice as unimportant. Looks like I'll have my work cut out for me nominating some anime and video game articles for deletion. This is such bullshit it's not even funny. Shikino 18:51, 11 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You know why I say it's unimportant? Well, why don't you go the extra mile and ask why I think the sky is blue? It is an undeniable fact that this website has no place on Wikipedia. It is not even covered by Alexa, and it has very few Google hits. You've stated that the only reason you want this article is to inform people that the site is incorrect. The sole reason you wish for this article to exist, as you have stated, is so that you can give a POV. If the website's content were correct, would you then want it deleted? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a>
<dl>
<dd>So you're hung up on the POV thing, when I keep telling you it's not a POV. It's fact. Or, wait. Maybe the difference between a true POV and pure, unbiased fact is that it's only "fact" if no one thinks it is! That's you're logic. To use your example, "the sky being blue" is fact. But if I make a Wikipedia article about the sky, and say in this hypothetical article that the sky is blue, it automatically becomes POV, and thus worth deletion on those grounds (nevermind, for the moment, the issue of notability). I restate what I've been saying all along: Folklore is folklore, there's no "anything goes" in folklore. Folklore inaccuracies can easily be researched and disproved as NON FACT. That doesn't mean there's POV involved, just because someone believes something that happens to be true, to be true. On the issue of notability, I give you the message the IP "213.172.234.208" posted below. To say this article is non-notable, given its notability within the field of Japanese folklore, is to say that Japanese folklore is non-notable. I notice you keep dodging that issue. If this article is to be deleted, I'd say you have to delete the entire Japanese mythology project in order to be consistent. Shikino 01:00, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Just an opinion from a non-wikipedian enthusiast for Japanese folklore. While the point about non-notability may be completely valid, there is one thing most of you are failing to see. Internet sites in English centering on Japanese folklore are a very rare find. So, while in the larger scheme of things, this site might actually be non-notable and irrelevant, it is certainly not such through the optic of Japanese folklore research. Me, I had to find out the hard way that the site in question is at times slightly inacurate, and at times ridiculously flawed. And even if this might seem like a low blow, some of the wikipedians in the Japanese mythology group have had the same problem - see the talk page for <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamaitachi.html" title="Kamaitachi">kamaitachi</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>So, eventhough my opinion doesn't count towards the ballot, I'd recomend to at least keep the article in it's original, short version - i.e. before the vandalism and the desperate attempts to remedy that turned into the article it is now. It could help a serious enthusiast like myself save some time in the future. 213.172.234.208 17:14, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At first I was just simply gonna put down my view and leave it at that. But you, sir, are starting to sound rude. I believe there was some rule or other about a certain level of civility here? I gave my view as to why I don't think this article should be considered "an indiscriminate addition to Wikipedia". I gave an example of how the website in discussion can be misleading even to people that, unlike me, are regular contributors in the Japanese Mythology Project. Do you seriously believe your response was anywhere near the level of my civil display of opinion? And please, don't think I am a sockpuppet or anything. I'm not. I am, as I said, a bystander, somebody with an interest in the subject matter, who noticed this discussion and felt compelled to add his two cents. After all, that's what Wikipedia is about, isn't it? People with a particular knowledge and insight sharing it with those without? 213.172.246.121 07:05, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Allow me to explain my reasons. Firstly, there is no doubt that this article meets <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">verifiable</a> standards, which is a <i>key</i> policy of Wikipedia. In this <a href="http://press.arrivenet.com/technology/article.php/676180.html" class="external text" title="http://press.arrivenet.com/technology/article.php/676180.html" rel="nofollow">website</a>, it is stated that the subject in question <i>received public recognition for designing the official seal for Bensalem Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania in a city wide juried exhibition</i>. Moreover, it is stated <a href="http://www.24x7updates.com/FullStory-News-Philadelphia_Artist_Christopher_Wajda_s_Provides_Illust-ID-33098.html" class="external text" title="http://www.24x7updates.com/FullStory-News-Philadelphia_Artist_Christopher_Wajda_s_Provides_Illust-ID-33098.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> that <i>he has won many awards and competitions for his graphic design</i>. His graphic design and fine art has also been featured in regional and national venue and has also receieved public recognition for his work. There is no doubt that the subject's work is widely recognized. However, on a side note, I am not sure whether he would achieve an enduring historical record for his work. Thus, in conclusion, this article barely touches the surface of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. This is the reason why I have the opinion of <i>Weak Keep</i>. --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 03:29, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

But "fails <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>" can mean other things as well, most of which are not reasons for deletion. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 17:27, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> the fact that an article exists in another language is not a reason in itself to keep or delete. Someone may have innocently translated the original article into another language. The articles in another language may be subject to the same manipulations, prejudices, and flaws as the first article, or it could be a <a href="../../../w/a/l/WP%7EWALL_5398.html" title="WP:WALL">walled garden</a>. However, one potentially has different sources, which could be better (or worse). In JWW's case, the French article more informative (for example, how he claims to be in exile as the FBI has labelled him a terrorist and banned him from air travel), but still no less verifiable, as its main source appears to be a magazine interview with the subject. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:39, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Good point. I wonder whether that works in practice though. I am sure the individual language Wikipedias have articles that would be deleted if translated and copied across. I guess what I am saying is that the article is more likely to be accepted and expanded at the Brazilian wiki. Having said that, I can only find a Portuguese-language wiki, as that is the official language of Brazil. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 20:16, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Do you actually have a concrete example of an English-language article that would meet notability requirements being deleted in a foreign Wikipedia? If not, then you're just speculating. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 22:55, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am just speculating, but your challenge prompted me to investigate a little bit. I thought of looking at the current articles nominated for deletion and seeing if any have interwiki links. Not many do, most being obscure and/or recently created. But <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_W._Walter_3a2d.html" title="James W. Walter">James W. Walter</a> (looking likely to be deleted) is also on the French Wikipedia <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Walter" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Walter" rel="nofollow">here</a>. So is the interwiki co-ordination good enough that we will notify the French if we delete the article, and do we expect the same sort of notification when they delete stuff. I would say not in both cases. So I suggest that it is quite likely that deletion policies are not uniform across the wikipedias, which is as it should be, as they are written for different audiences (different languages), and are independent anyway (though all are hosted by the Foundation). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:47, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason I ask is there have been a few AfD nominations that have been bandied about saying that we should delete an article on the English Wikipedia because it isn't popular enough in English countries (without checking at least if it's notable in its own country/language). This seems extremely <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">biased</a> to me. Walter is from the United States (and a large portion of his time is still spent there) and therefore it's easy to prove if he's notable in English. From what I read in the article, the Walter article was transwikied from an earlier version of the current article as well, so it might not be that relevant if somebody does decide to delete it. I'm not saying that notability is having an entry in a foreign language Wikipedia, but I am saying that the interwiki could be used to find notability links, something that doesn't always happen when an article with an interwiki is nominated, and people cite the nonexistent "a person must be notable in English or in English-speaking countries" criteria (which is actually contrary to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 21:18, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

This student who “invented” this 2 month ago, is only trying to cash in on the fuzz.

<dd>Comment to Carcharoth. Unfortunately it is not this simple. In fact redirect should never be used in such cases. If redirected two things happens, I indorse Hans island = Principality of Tartupaluk, which I absolutely don’t. But much more important wiki, the worlds largest encyclopedia, is now propagating that Hans island = Principality of Tartupaluk. That simply is wrong. You come to wiki because you are notable, wiki does not make you notable. <a href="../../../t/w/t/User%7ETwthmoses_5da0.html" title="User:Twthmoses">Twthmoses</a> 17:51, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep</b> User <a href="../../../t/w/t/User%7ETwthmoses_5da0.html" title="User:Twthmoses">Twthmoses</a> has repeatedly removed all mention of the Principality of Tartupaluk from the "Recent events" section of the Hans Island page and attacked people who have objected. Just check the article's history. He/she seems to be of the OPINION that the Principality of Tartupaluk is a "satirical" exercise, but he/she doesn't seem to have any evidence to back this up. Unless he/she has some special knowledge not available from the primary sources, his/her arguments appear to be pure conjecture. Why is he/she now also pushing for this page's deletion? Its content is verifiable, appears to be neutral, and has appeared in several reputable news sources--not "obscure online outlets" as he/she claims. What's the rush to suppress it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ahh, User:Tartupaluk yet again as a “new user” whose first action just happened to concern this issue. Hehe. Never mind. I have neither removed nor attack anybody, and there is an entire history log for anybody to see if they wish. On the issue however, “Principality of Tartupaluk” is an un-notable fun “project”, the likes that 10.000 students make in the parents basement each year. 9999 of them never sees year two. That simple does not belong in “Recent events” on a serious article on a serious encyclopedia. It should not be necessary to explain why this is so. You inserted it; I catapulted it to the satire section, cause there is no other place for it on the Hans Island article. This is btw not the place to discuss this; it goes on the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Island_6c1d.html" title="Hans Island">Hans Island</a> page. <a href="../../../t/w/t/User%7ETwthmoses_5da0.html" title="User:Twthmoses">Twthmoses</a> 02:24, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Googlebombing? Please at least do me the favor of any type of search. The prominence on Yahoo, Google and other sources is due to the large volume of content I have produced and the amount of links from notable media sources including National Review, Time.com, CNN, Salon, AP and many others. I will endeavor to make the entry more encyclopedic and simply ask indulgence for a day or two, as this entry was posted today. I was honest about my use of Wikipedia and that can certainly be verified by examining my postings, and I hope the community will not succumb to Jaco's incorrect and unresearched allegation.

<li>What's an "in-context Google search"? I did a Google search for that phrase but didn't get a hit. I don't think looking for Google hits on "uncle jimbo" and "jim hanson" together proves anything, since he's often cited as just Uncle Jimbo or Uncle J. Milbloggers are often cited in the press, inlcuding Jim Hanson, so it would make information about him a lot more useful than a lot of crap Wikipedia has extensive articles on. Is there just some irrational fear of bloggers here that makes it harder for them to prove notability than any other type of person? <a href="../../../f/f/l/User%7EFfleming_86b6.html" title="User:Ffleming">Frank J.

<li><b>Keep</b> While I do realise that precise search engine rankings probably shouldn't go in a blogger article, the people who scream vanity likely do not know the reason they were posted. If you look at the page history, this is the third attempt to create this article. The previous two entries were simply reverted by a certain *user, not admin* without any sort of discussion. It is my understanding that these search results were posted as a simple way to confirm notability while the article is still fledgling and will be later removed. And look, it worked, at least we are having a discussion this time. Also, I have added this article to the proper category of American Bloggers. IMO a lot of articles in there could be deleted for lack of notability. But somehow noone argues that. Wikipedia has set a precedent and now we should follow up. I mean geez, there's a guy who has an article because he's a <i>prominent figure in the community of podcasting</i>. Please don't make me comment on this. Uncle Jimbo writes for - what I understand is - the top American military blog, Blackfive. He appears on radio interviews. On posters. He seems to be very widely recognised in the so-called blogosphere, especially it's military segment. And it's not like he started yesterday. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshanthalas_089b.html" title="User:Ashanthalas">Ashanthalas</a> 12:06, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>My comment does hold water, as it adresses the issues raised previously (accusation of vanity and explanation of overall notability). Second: right now, Wikipedia is a telephone book, to be in which you have to win a lottery. As for the criteria for inclusion of biographies, Uncle J is likely to meet this one <i>Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field</i> in the field of independent journalism or something similarly worded, although since he's around, I'd prefer if he commented on it personally. As for <i>Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work</i>, see <a href="http://weblogawards.org/2005/12/best_military_blog.php" class="external text" title="http://weblogawards.org/2005/12/best_military_blog.php" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://milblogging.com/index.php?entry=entry060101-144533" class="external text" title="http://milblogging.com/index.php?entry=entry060101-144533" rel="nofollow">here</a>, look for "Blackfive" (the blog that he co-edits in addition to his personal blog). <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshanthalas_089b.html" title="User:Ashanthalas">Ashanthalas</a> 12:47, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I see absolutely nothing in this article that suggests this individual will become a part of the "enduring historical record of that field". Since when was "blogger" a <b>professional</b> occupation? Especially compared to a painter, architect or engineer? As to your earlier comment, if the only notability an individual can show in his article is google search results, then he is <i>not notable</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> The reason to keep the entry is based on the notability of the author of Madison.com and BlackFive.net. First, BlackFive published a book "Blog of War" and authors of books are notable. Secondly, Uncle Jimbo is one of five authors on BlackFive and there should be an entry of BlackFive, as well as its published work, "Blog of War." Thirdly, Uncle Jimbo should have his own entry within the confines of a BlackFive entry and "The Blog of War: Front-Line Dispatches from Soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan" entry. He is notable by affiliation of authorship through another blog that published a written work on the testimonials of soldiers in Iraq/Afghanistan. Still, the Uncle Jimbo entry needs to be Wikified and cleaned up. There does need to be neutral entries into his article, as well as the aforementioned entry requests to put in context his notability. MRMKJason 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, the author for Blog of War is listed as Matthew Currier Burden. Jim Hanson is no more notable by association than the random child of a President or Prime Minister is. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 16:17, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Matthew Burden is BlackFive from BlackFive.net and he has made guest appearances on news shows. Also, there are entries of people that are associated with other people and Jenna Bush has an entry as the daughter of President Bush. Therefore, there are entries in the context of someone or something more notable. The book written by BlackFive and his blog is notable as testimonials of soliders during war. It is also notable as a book that publicizes military blogs and www.counterterrorismblog.org is a very reputable military blog for research on terrorism. Still, the BlackFive blog also contains other authors and are notable under the recognitiion of BlackFive's notoriety as the result of Matthew Burden aka BlackFive's work. MRMKJason
<ul>
<li>Matthew Burden is not Jim Hanson, however, which is entirely the point. You have argued the notability of Matthew Burden (published author), and of the website blackfive.net (top military blog on the net<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>) Yet you have yet to show a single argument on why Jim Hanson himself is notable. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 16:57, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Jim Hanson aka Uncle Jimbo is notable as one of the five others of BlackFive. Much like <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenna_Bush_0825.html" title="Jenna Bush">Jenna Bush</a>, who is only notable for being a sibling to President Bush, Jim Hanson is notable for his authorship at BlackFive that is a top military blog and was implemented by a published author, Matthew Burden aka BlackFive. In addition, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle_Malkin_6e09.html" title="Michelle Malkin">Michelle Malkin</a> a blogger, has her own published works and entry into wikipedia. On the other hand, I do not think that the Jim Hanson entry should be alone. At least, there should be a BlackFive entry with all of the bios of the authors and the published work of Matthew Burden. Therefore, the Jim Hanson/Uncle Jimbo entry would be unnecessary if there were a BlackFive entry that had the bios of the authors and the BlackFive book. Without association to BlackFive than the entry by itself would not stand. Hence, there requires a BlackFive entry in order to give credence to its entry. MRMKJason
<ul>
<li>Also, a BlackFive entry with Uncle Jimbo would be good for those that want to research military blogs. For instance, Wikipedia is for the purposes of research and the BlackFive entry would serve the purposes for those that would want to research military blogs as a primary source into the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan or past/present/future wars. MRMKJason
<ul>
<li>Well, I made an entry for BlackFive, so if any of you are interested, please make your entries. MRMKJason
<ul>
<li>Right now the BlackFive entry has a speedy deletion, but can be removed by other users and not by the person that created. Therefore, for those that support the BlackFive entry on its merits of being historical and newsworthy than remove the speedy deletion entry and update the article if you can. MRMKJason</li>

<li>I appreciate the fact that you folks are considering ths article, and I just wanted to clarify a few things before a final decision is made. I did this because in researching my writings Wikipedia is the most useful tool on the internet for checking facts and I have been using it more and more. I work for madison.com selling online advertising, but I was writing my blog there for almost a year before I joined the company. They had shown support for citizen journalism and I wanted to help make sure the field would grow. Recently I had a row with the editorial board of the larger newspaper hosted on madison.com about the military commissions and prosoner interrogation. I did almost all of my research about the Geneva Conventions, Hamdan decision, and other related topics on Wikipedia and <a href="http://www.madison.com/post/blogs/militarymatters/100852" class="external text" title="http://www.madison.com/post/blogs/militarymatters/100852" rel="nofollow">cited them in my piece</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
While anyone who attaches their name to a piece of writing and believes the public ought to read it has an element of vanity, my purpose was more to join the community and hopefully add to the credibility of Wikipedia for more people. There is a perception that the editorial voice of Wikipedia is left of center, and while that is not by design, the perception certainly exists. I have two very distinct audiences, the one at Blackfive is largely pro-military while the one at madison.com is just as largely progressive. I have received positive feedback from the madison.com audience for my use and acceptance of Wikipedia and I have introduced it to a skeptical, but more accepting over time, audience at Blackfive.</p>
<p>I have not been active in editing other articles here yet, mostly because I am unfamiliar with the etiquette. I believe that the addition of myself and the other authors at Blackfive would be a positive thing for Wikipedia as it would aid in it's acceptance as a definitive non-partisan source of information. If this survives the deletion process I will add info to the article on myself in the proper format as well as one detailing Blackfive and it's authors. Obviously then the Wiki process will take those and build them into articles reflecting the community's perception.</p>
<p>Regarding the book "The Blog of War", The author is Matthew Burden "Blackfive" and although my work was included in the proposal that won the contract, it is not included in the book as the focus was tightened to active duty personnel and their families.</p>
<p>Citizen journalism and the blogosphere are having a larger effect on how the public gets information. Small as our contributions have been thus far, we are affecting changes. Thanks for your attention and hope this resolves in a positive manner for all of us. --Unclejimbo 17:14, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Uncle Jimbo is one of the prominent bloggers out there and to me it's perfectly okay because he's outspoken about his military views especially regarding Galloway. He would be most known in the blogging community just like User:Dailykos who works on his own biography as well sometimes. At least he worked his reputation up before the establishment of this article. He's not out to promote himself because he's already done that job. <i>Uncle Jimbo</i> is a reference I always attribute to Blackfive.net, not Madison. Googlebombing is a stupid excuse for this as he is already #1 &amp; #2 on the search engine for Madison. Especially other blogs talk about <i>Uncle Jimbo</i> ie: <a href="http://www.punditreview.com/2006/09/17/uncle-jimbo-from-blackfive-on-pundit-review-radio/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.punditreview.com/2006/09/17/uncle-jimbo-from-blackfive-on-pundit-review-radio/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.reload.ws/blog/2006/09/uncle-jimbo-foreign-policy.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.reload.ws/blog/2006/09/uncle-jimbo-foreign-policy.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://milblogwire.com/2006/04/uncle-jimbo-radio-audio-from-show.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://milblogwire.com/2006/04/uncle-jimbo-radio-audio-from-show.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<li>'Re: Note:' The number of my edits is irrelevant. The issue is whether the subject is worthy of entry. The notoriety of James Hanson as a Milblogger of repute has been established. What I attempted to draw attention to is the efforts by some to make a political statement, including your own "strong delete" below. The simple fact of the matter is that a personage who has established himself as a pre-eminent milblogger, including being referenced in the Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/19/AR2006091901291.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/19/AR2006091901291.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> is of significant relevance for a wikipedia entry. Surely he has contributed more, and is more influential and recognizable than a random sample entry for a AAA Basball player who has 1 major league game to his credit. Example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Komine" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Komine" rel="nofollow">Shane Komine</a> Furthermore, your intimation that my number of edits is somehow relevant smacks of of the sort of elitism that is counter to the spirit of wikipedia and I take offense.

<dd>Voter fraud but not a vote? I thought we were supposed to argue the contents and not each other (at least, that's what I got yelled at for), and if a new user can add inforation on the content, I don't see how the number of edits is relevant.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I rewrote to be more stub-like. Jimbo is less notable than some bloggers who've been deleted from Wikipedia, but I agree with the point made about Wikipedia being too blog-hostile. Arcane television characters on cancelled shows get their own articles with the smallest minutiae (e.g., <a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Ellen_Mischke_e5fc.html" title="Sue Ellen Mischke">Sue Ellen Mischke</a>) while IMAO.us and the like get repeatedly deleted (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_IMAO_07dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/IMAO">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/IMAO</a>) in spite of being repeatedly referenced by virtually every right-wing blog and blog-like entity out there. Yes, Jimbo started this article and yes, it was badly written (partially in response to the RfD!), but I'd like to give it a chance before killing it outright. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 19:12, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> After reading the stub it seems its apparent this persons views are regarded to some extent, they have had media appearances, host a popular blog and program. I am not sure what more you can ask.

<li>Um, it has that information because the author of <i>these</i> articles put it there.

<li><b>KEEP!</b> I am the author of this article that has recieved so much attention for what reason I know not?! I have edited the article several times and feel that the present version is not like the original. For those that wish to delete it, why don't you edit it, change things to your liking, instead of just saying 'delete it'?? That's cheap, take the easy way out why don't you?!The whole point of this site (from my understanding) is that it is a public project, anyone can contribute in whatever way they feel would be useful. So step up and contribute- change what you don't like, make it into a better article than it currently is. I have seen articles on this site that don't qualify as articles, they are only 5-10 words, a sentence at most but they are still up last time I checked. Why are other articles about Porn channels still up and this one is slated for deletion?? I am still awaiting an answer on that one but so far nothing but silence. Based on the subject matter (adult channel) I have done what I can with the article, you don't like it- fine then delete it. It descibes a PPV service that is available in the United States, according to the corporate site, to over 100 million households. I mentioned that it consists of 7 channels, 3 are on Dish Network and 2 were just added to DirecTV. It may also be available on cable but I have no information on that. It is one of 2 major adult PPV services in the U.S., the other being Playboy/Spice Network. I think that makes it deserving of being on the site but I have no final say so my opinion means nothing. As a result of this current action with this article, I am seriously re-considering my future contributions to this site. It seems I don't know how to write a good article, just spam, so no point in writing anything else. I will no longer write any more articles and may just stop contributing all together. It seems that this site like alot of other sites on the net is now 'controlled', so much for free speech. I guess the internet as the last bastion of freedom is slowly coming to an end. Keep it or delete it, its up to you, I have said my piece.<a href="../../../h/e/m/User%7EHeMan5_0832.html" title="User:HeMan5">HeMan5</a> 19:27, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: HeMan5, people aren't personally against you or the article. Wikipedia has minimum standards for articles, which is why this Articles for Deletion section exists. Discussion deletion is one option for handling an article that doesn't meet those standards. We hope htat you will learn a bit more about what is acceptable on Wikipedia and why.

<p>This article is highly unnecessary - I doubt there are enough wikis about St. Louis that it needs its entire article.

So far, all the article is is an external link. I don't think there are that many wikis about St. Louis that meet WP:WEB. And if it is the intention of the article to be a collection of external links (as opposed to wikilinks), <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP is not</a> for that purpose. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 04:49, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Unindenting</i> With all due respect, those links confirm that a band called PT's Revenge exists. I don't argue that. I also don't think the editors of this article created it in bad faith. The only issue I'm bringing up is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, and I don't mean verifying that "there is a band called PT's Revenge," because I've yet to claim there isn't. What I can't find are sources that indicate that PT's Revenge has done the notable things claimed of them. I did read your sources, and both of them simply refer to it as "Kevin's old band." That's not enough. GassyGuy 04:01, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But it IS enough. I know that the band is notable, but I can't prove that to YOU without some internet link. So, I have to fall back upon the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria of this being the project of a notable musician. The links I provide do that. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 17:31, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You could offer me a citation from a print reference or some such if one exists. I actually prefer book references to Internet ones when they're available. But, yes, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect proof of notability. For what it's worth, the musician in question isn't really notable outside the context of other bands (which still makes him notable by WP:MUSIC, not arguing that) but all that seems to justify is a notation in other articles that mention him that he is "formerly of P.T.'s Revenge," as is already done in the <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teen_Idols_a65f.html" title="Teen Idols">Teen Idols</a> article, because that appears to be the only verifiable claim to notability. Even if this article were to stay, most of the information would have to be excised as unverifiable, which would leave it of very limited utility. GassyGuy 19:10, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Can't anyone see that the vril article has virtually nothing except for a brief explaination about it and then goes straight to talking about the vril society that does not even have anything to do with the plot of the story(Vril:The Coming Race). Also there is the link in the coming race article which leads straight to the vril article that doesn't explain about this but instead talks about conspiracy theories. By the way if you have read the book you should notice that the plot and vril is not even about conspiracies or nazis. Anyway it would be dissapointing if you can't even diffrentiate a plot element from a conspiracy. Asarhapi 10:13, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I suspect the theory that this was just a surrender, and not a battle, is correct, but I would suggest contacting an expert in the field who can verify this. Also, the website <a href="http://www.tngenweb.org/civilwar/crosters/cav/cav8r/cob.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tngenweb.org/civilwar/crosters/cav/cav8r/cob.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> that Uncle G quoted mentions two people wounded in this battle, so maybe there was a skirmish before the formal surrender? Those reports of wounded men need to be explained before we can say for sure that there was no battle at all. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 18:08, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The two soldiers who were wounded had no military record and no official report was filed for them. That is probably why they aren't mentioned in any books. If only two people died/were injured then I don't think it was much of a battle and therefore isn't notable even if it did exist. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinosaur_puppy_8f46.html" title="User:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:yellow" face="Verdana" color="darkgreen">T REX</font></a><sub><a href="../../../d/i/n/User_talk%7EDinosaur_puppy_fe12.html" title="User talk:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:darkgreen" face="Tahoma" color="yellow"><b>speak</b></font></a></sub> 20:14, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

True, Bennett House near Durham Station was the site of surrender, but no hostilities appear in the standard sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> Intereesting and useful: provides a quick at-a-glance way to compare various sci-fi series by length. I think our definition of "original research" is starting to get overly-broad. It was supposed to protect us from crackpot theories and "<i>Dude, what if the whole universe is just a hair on an ant's butt?</i>" silliness. None of this article is original research. If one wants to find out how long, say, <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_Runner_090c.html" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a></i> is, there's a thousand different places to find it: the IMDB, the DVD, countless video guides. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 10:01, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> as per Markeer. It's not an indiscriminate collection of information as it provides an actual context and criteria for the information. Maintainance is not really an issue because there are obviously people willing to maintain it (and it gives counts up to whichever episode it mentions, so again the context - and the limits of the information - is clear). As for cruft, it really depends on your definition, although I would say that it's a step above most cruft insofar as it is actually <i>interesting</i> to see how long certain series have lasted and the breadth of fictional universes. I, too, would err on the side of keeping it. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 01:37, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Yes, that's the way it works. Per WP:RS: "The responsibility for finding and adding references lies with the person adding material to an article, and sources should be provided whenever possible." Per WP:V: "Unsourced material may be challenged and removed." So a lack to cite sources is <i>very</i> valid grounds for deletion. Just asserting that sources exist somewhere isn't a valid remedy. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 17:22, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you're misreading WP:V. The criterion isn't whether information is <i>verified</i>, it's whether it's <i>verifiable</i>. Yes, it is important that we cite our sources on Wikipedia; but that's not a deletion criterion. The criterion is whether such sources <i>can</i> be provided. An article on my cat Maggie is unverifiable, because no reliable source <i>could</i> be provided. Sources <i>can</i> be provided for the information in this article (and, indeed, Arctic Gnome has begun to do so). This article isn't original research, but a collation of widely available data. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 17:48, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was not arguing this article fails WP:V; I'm arguing that it fails WP:OR by default because it has (or had) no sources. But strictly speaking, it does fail WP:V, because I think <i>you</i> are misreading WP:V by stating that "The criterion is whether such sources <i>can</i> be provided." Quoting from WP:V again: "'Verifiable' in this context means that any reader must be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, because Wikipedia does not publish original thought or original research." It also says that "The burden of evidence lies with the editors who have made an edit or wish an edit to remain." Read together, this means that, in case of disputes, the criterion of WP:V is whether sources <i>are in fact</i> (not: can be) provided. The same is true, <i><a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutatis_mutandis.html" title="Mutatis mutandis">mutatis mutandis</a></i>, for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> compliance. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 18:50, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unsourced material is not the same as original research. In this case, any reader can in fact check the information against reliable published sources. The error lies in the fact that the citation isn't (or wasn't) provided -- which is not in itself a reason for deletion. If the material were questioned, and such sources were not (or, more to the point, could not be) cited by editors, <i>then</i> there might be reason for deletion as OR -- however, since the citations can be (and are being) provided, this meets WP:V criteria. Ideally, of course, all articles would be both verifiable and verified -- but the fact that a given article is not yet verified is grounds for cleanup, not deletion. Deletion of verifiable material is simply counterproductive when cleanup is a possibility. (This is also, I believe, why the policy states "unsourced material <i>may</i> be challenged and removed," rather than "<i>will</i> be... removed." Babies, bathwater, you know the drill.) <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 20:29, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are joking, right? This article is <b>not</b> trying to turn Wikipedia into a genealogical database, it is merely showing family relationships between notable people.

<dd>This is not about being a geneological site. There is already a <a href="../../../h/u/x/Category%7EHuxley_family_1adc.html" title="Category:Huxley family">Category:Huxley family</a> and this family is significant as a family. It's not just a family that happened to produce some famous people. For many to most of the people named their being Huxley's had some impact on their history. For example many Leftist critics of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brave_New_World_b07b.html" title="Brave New World">Brave New World</a> cited that <a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldous_Huxley_db2b.html" title="Aldous Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a> was of the "Huxley family" and therefore dismissed his criticism of a future that was dull/overly-clean as the whinings of a child of privilege.

<li><b>Keep</b>. They are not <i>notable</i>, they are a very important family. I can't think of a more noteworthy family in science and literature. It also shows relation to Arnold fam.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - the alternative is to have a family tree template in each of the articles on the notable members of the Huxley families. This article should be considered a sub-article of each Huxley article, and it survives on the notability of the individual Huxleys. As T. Anthony pointed out above, family articles are acceptable, as shown by <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin_%E2%80%94_Wedgwood_family_fd83.html" title="Darwin — Wedgwood family">Darwin — Wedgwood family</a>. Having said that, the family tree image is at some of the Huxley articles, and is at <a href="../../../h/u/x/Category%7EHuxley_family_1adc.html" title="Category:Huxley family">Category:Huxley family</a>. However, there is massive precedent for family articles on Wikipedia. See <a href="../../../e/n/g/Category%7EEnglish_families_4452.html" title="Category:English families">Category:English families</a> for other examples, such as <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redgrave_family.html" title="Redgrave family">Redgrave family</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mander_family.html" title="Mander family">Mander family</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pease_family_%28Darlington%29_8bab.html" title="Pease family (Darlington)">Pease family (Darlington)</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keynes_family.html" title="Keynes family">Keynes_family</a>. This article needs improvement, and the notability needs to be made explicit, but deletion is not the answer. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 19:06, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Returning to the present day, this sort of geneaological information allows people browsing <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keynes_family.html" title="Keynes family">Keynes family</a> to see that one of the child actors in the recent <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lion%2C_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe_6b9c.html" title="The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a></i> film (<a href="../../../s/k/a/Skandar_Keynes_2a97.html" title="Skandar Keynes">Skandar Keynes</a>) is a great-great-great-grandson of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 19:25, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>You are right. Subjective opinion as to what fails to interest different people is not a good way to decide what should be in an encyclopedia. Master Keynes (a namesake of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> incidentially, for the trivia fans) when asked about this, said <i>"yeah, but there are a lot of them"</i> (great-great-great-grandsons of Charles Darwin, that is).

<li><b>Keep</b> per Carcharoth as having half-a-dozen closely related notable individuals calls for such an overview article. Genealogical information of non-notable persons is one thing, this is showing the relationships. It would be cumbersome and confusing to point out all these relationships in the individual articles, but here we can include a family tree and show the relationships. This is not possible merely with a Category (theoretically the tree could go on the category page, but who would look for it there?). --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 21:17, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is essentially a <b>List of members of the Huxley family</b>, only presented in non-list form. How many lists are inherently notable?

<dd>I got confused by Dhartung's comment. If this stubby article is doomed to remain "just" a list of the notable individual members of the family, well, then for this case I don't see an advantage in the list form over the category.

<dd>My reply was to Dev920, not Lambiam. Sorry for the confusion -- I thought the indent was enough! To clarify my point and this unintended tangent: I believe it is a potential article, which is why a category is insufficient.

<li><b>Delete</b> I would argue that "from bad to worse" and "good but not great" are <i>stock phrases</i> - commonly used groupings of words that mean exactly what they say. This is different from sayings like the "crack of dawn", which might need to be explained to those unfamiliar with the language.

<dd>Mike Kaiser went on to more controversial things (I'm rather surprised there's no article on him, in fact, it's an oversight which is on my "things to help with" list), but I'm not sure even that amounts to notability for the club. Realistically, I think it's only outfits like Cambridge Footlights which are almost an assembly line of notable alumni which move beyond the "university club/society" heading and become worthwhile inclusions here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:46, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Notable or not. Isn't the purpose of wikipedia to be able to find information about just about anything?</p>
<p>I think it's a grave mistake to start deleting valuble resources like this simply cause they aren't in the front page of the newspaper. It's a extremly well written article that offers up excellent information about this group. Had I not chanced upon it be looking for law regarding herp breeding, I would have not known of it's existance.</p>
<p>Thanks to wikipedia, I was able to find this group, and now I will be able to join them. I might not have found them otherwise.</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - In the <a href="../../../u/s/c/WP%7EUSC_1ca1.html" title="WP:USC">Project Congress</a> article scheme, I understood the scope of the AfD articles to be the current delegation and the articles in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUnited_States_Congressional_Delegations_by_state_ec2d.html" title="Category:United States Congressional Delegations by state">Category:United States Congressional Delegations by state</a> to be the historic delegation articles. It's true that the historic delegation articles are indeed large and detailed -- and that is my fear: they are already too big and could not adequately absorb additional information that focuses solely on the current delegation. When the current delegation information is developed, it will most likely have to be split out into a separate article anyway. On the other hand, <a href="../../../u/s/c/WP%7EUSC_1ca1.html" title="WP:USC">Project Congress</a> has expended alot of effort to standardize and conventionalize article names for each state and territory and be comprehensive for each and every state or territory. Since the article names in this AfD series of articles don't fully comply, it may be best to delete all of them and then, when we are ready to expand the 'current delegation' information, we can start over.--G1076 17:46, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>&#160;: This page list only the "current" members of congress. This is a very relevant piece of information. If a person is interested in finding this the only other resort he/she has is to go to the page with list of congressmen from the last 200 or so years and scroll through the pages looking for the details. Also, I believe this page is a frequently used and linked page from other websites. If you search for say, 'U.S. Congressional delegation from Arkansas' in goggle <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=u.s.+congressional+delegation+from+arkansas&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=u.s.+congressional+delegation+from+arkansas&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> this would be the first page to show up.

<p><b>Keep or Merge</b>: These pages allow to hop conveniently from say, a senator's page, to the delegation list of another state. This is particularly helpful if you are interested in identifying a member of Congress. If you do not know a Congressman in question, these pages let you easily identify him or her. Because of its inherent convenience, these pages should remain on Wikipedia Another option is to merge all of these pages into one, but keeping the same template which appears on Congressmen's pages currently. <a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorvida_9bd8.html" title="User:Porvida">Porvida</a> 22:53, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Isn't it a little risky to keep a page that says "current" but not the year? What if once the year roles over somebody forgets to update it? I think if would be easier to just merge it with the other years that state the date, then people don't have to worry about whether the page is actually up-to-date or not. I don't think it's too difficult to scroll through, and also you can see if the past history of the delegation. If it gets too unwieldly perhaps the pages can be broken down into half-centuries. --134.174.21.2 23:28, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> In the past these templates / pages get updated within minutes of changes in congressmen / senators. This has happened when people like Duke Cunningham and Mark Foley resigned. Lots of editors are actively keeping track of these pages. So I do not see any risk in these pages going out of date. Also, if you think that way any page in wikipedia could go out of date. For example if you say ABC is the current governor of XYZ. The day somebody else is elected this statement becomes outdated. <a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDuKot_a5c7.html" title="User:DuKot">DuKot</a>----</li>

<li>Okay, there's basically no satisfactory way to close this at this point, no one is willing to touch it.

<li><b>Delete all</b> - this is a case where the categories do a way better job. Not only to they provide the same information as do the templates, they provide chronology and history. A concern expressed above is that you have to scoll through 200 years of history to establish the current incumbents. This can be dealt with, <i>if</i> it is considered to be a pivotal problem, by putting the categories in descending order. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 21:21, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Care to show how they can be reasonably expanded? Will we be getting "development" sections or anyhting of the sort?

<li>With that sort of attitude about it, it makes me less compelled to, for sure. But there's no episode information other than the title yet, no sales figures or chart information. I don't know where to look for much of that, and I try to keep from editing articles on subjects I'm unfamilar with, as is the case with Thomas. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Did you just suggest mathematical proofs are equivalent in importance to Thomas the Tank Engine video tape episode listings? These articles aren't expandable. What can you say about them that's distinct from articles about the episodes? You'd be reduced to describing the video packaging. Unless these were major major video successes, sales figures are very unlikely to be obtainable - this kind of data would be banal and unencyclopedic as well, even if you had detailed data (oh look, this video with episodes X,Y,Z sold better in the US market in 2001 than this video with episodes Y,Z,A,B did in 2003) <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:56, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strongly Keep</b> One of the most problematic issues with cultural history of Perth Western AAustralia on wikipedia is the preponderence of editors less than 30 years old who have little or no understanding of the perth of their parents generation - for example the Capitol Theatre in William Street is where Bob Dylan first played Perth , or the Mayfair Movie theatre in Hay Street where the first Monty Python movies showed in Perth- there is nothing in the current cultural heritage 'fads' from academics or 'keepers of the community history ' that adequately map what is otherwise a difficult to trace heritage less than 50 years old, it is usually bulldozed or erased. I consider the existence of what was a sustainer of otherwise diificullt to find music shop which beccame a cultural institution within its own time deserves an article -If it has derivved info from its own website - the article needs to be cleaned up so that it can be kept. <a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">SatuSuro</a> 14:17, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Then why not wait until after the elections to delete this article? Right now he is a candidate, he matters to people, and they should be able to read about him. If/when he loses, and people stop caring, then delete it since you are so eager to delete it. It isn't harming anyone having it here, it has been cited to prove that it isn't a lie (the link to the global tv spot for him), and it isn't breaking any rules. He is running, there is proof, what else do you want?</p>

I have read all the rules and regulations of Bios on wikipedia and haven't written more because it should be left open to the public to add more to his page. My only argument is that he is being covered in all the major Toronto news sources, as well as some national news and therefore is a credible candidate who deserves a page.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> First off, I just searched for articles relating to unemployment in major cities (NYC, Paris, LA, Tokyo) and found nothing. This does not mean that an article about such a topic could not be created, just that they haven't been. But even still, I would not mind this article if not for the fact that it made absolutely no sense. It is, as Deet stated, incoherent. Most of the article, if not all of it, is completely unrelated to unemployment. All of the references (none of which are actually <i>referenced</i>) refer to unemployment in general terms, not in regard to Montreal, nor even Canada. The article has been tagged for seven months, and has only been edited about a dozen times since then (and many of these edits were further tagging and linking). Put simply, this article is a train wreck. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:17, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's incoherent, and there's nothing inherently encyclopedic about analyzing job market statistics on a city-by-city basis.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Canada is a very, very fractured country when it comes to societal matters such as unemployment. Reasons for unemployment in Montreal are as different from those in Calgary as reasons in Lesotho would be from those in Slovenia.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Let's for a moment remove all info that is not directly link to unemployment in Montreal (as opposed to out-of-place demographic info or some blurb on the general social ills of unemployment). The entire article then reduces to:</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Canada has the highest per capita immigration rate in the world with a significant portion settling in Montreal. Canadian landed immigrants have an 37% unemployment rate, putting upward pressure on Montreal's employment rate (see related article, Economic impact of immigration to Canada). Figures were obtained for each of the 1996 census tracts and then aggregated at the police district level. The 1998 survey included individuals residing in 182 different census tracts. The proportion of persons unemployed was computed as follows: numerator = number of unemployed individuals (&gt;15 yr old); denominator = number of individuals (&gt;15 yr old) in the labour force. Community unemployment varied from a maximum of 30% to a minimum of 5% across the 49 police districts of Montreal.</i></dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> Income-tax protest film that fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28films%29_a836.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (films)">Wikipedia:Notability (films)</a>. Article carries extensive POV concerning legality/constitutionality of the federal income-tax system that goes beyond what is needed to describe the film. Notable director, but only showed on 10 screens during its theatrical run according to IMDB. Was shown “at Cannes” not that it was part of the Cannes film festival; “Russo actually rented an inflatable screen and showed the film on the beach at the town of Cannes during the time of the film festival.” Did get a NYT article titled “Facts Refute Filmmaker's Assertions On Taxes” But that hardly meets the criteria of: “The film has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the film and its creators/producers.” Page is really being used as a soap-box for someones political views. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_6849.html" title="User:Brimba">Brimba</a> 14:15, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Post script:</b> I took a quick look at the article as it stands now, and I didn't see any NPOV changes to make, certainly nothing so bad that we have to abolish the article entirely. I expected to see editorializing in the article, and what I find is description. The article also has mention of the Portland Mercury review I mention just above (and the fact that it pans the film), and of a New York Times article. I now think it would be absolutely wrong to get rid of this article: the nominator's reasons are factually incorrect, at least the way the article now looks.

Unfortunately, the article was created as (or shortly after its creation became) a dumping ground for blatant POV regarding the wacky, extreme minority viewpoints reported to be promulgated by the filmmaker. I and other editors have tried to maintain some balance by pointing out the counter-viewpoints and removing unverifiable statements, etc. An article like this should stay in Wikipedia only if the article continues to present <i>both</i> sides of the debates which are the subjects of the film. This is a tough call. I think if the article meets the Wikipedia criteria for notability for films, it does so just barely. If I had to vote, it would be a reluctant, weak "keep" -- but I am just going to abstain from voting.

<p>This case does not establish why it is important. There is no comment about precedence or much evidence of coverage. As far as I can see there are three reasons for including a legal case on wikipedia - (1) it sets an important legal precedent, (2) it generates media interest or (3) it involves a notable party and has a profound influence on that party. This article on its face doesn't meet any of the three criteria.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see you went ahead and retagged this before I had a chance to finish my explanations on the talk page. You're obviously not from Chicago, otherwise you wouldn't have tagged this as not notable.
<p>In the first place, it's NOT a company. It's a chain of independently owned restaurants.</p>
<p>In the second place, it's one of the most recognized restaurants in the city of Chicago. For another example of this, see <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold%27s_Chicken_Shack_9c6f.html" title="Harold's Chicken Shack">Harold's Chicken Shack</a></p>
<p>Therefore, stating that it fails <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECorp_f6b3.html" title="WP:Corp">WP:Corp</a>, is irrelevant, as it's not a corporation.</p>
<p>Here are my comments from the talk page.</p>
<p>I object to the deletion of this article for the following reason: Tagging this as spam is misguided. I'm not associated with any of the restaurants, and if the person who added the template lived in Chicago, they would not have tagged this article. The restaurants are notable in local Chicago culture. I see MANY articles about other restaurants.</p>
<p>Therefore, I disagree with the deletion of this article. I have deleted the "suggest delete" template in accordance with the specifications IN the template. Please read the following, which I have copied directly from it:</p>
<p><i>You may remove this message if you improve the article, or if you otherwise object to deletion of the article for any reason.

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b>.</s> This is a chain of significant interest to Chicago culture and this article was, I'm sure, written in good faith.

Unfortunately we have scared off the author by AfDing his article while he was still dealing with the prod, so it is unlikely to be fixed up.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I'm from Chicago. Everyone who's lived here has certainly <i>heard</i> of Golden Nugget*, even if there is nothing terribly interesting about it. And since Chicagoans are particularly enthusiastic about their local restuarant chains, I say keep. Wikipedia is not paper.&#160;:) (*This isn't the sort of thing I can actually verify, but I think the Yelp comments do suggest that some people feel strongly about this place.) <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 05:46, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It appears that the restaurant used to be called Yankee Doodle Dandy (<a href="https://securesite.chireader.com/cgi-bin/Archive/abridged2.bat?path=1997/970704/DAMSKI&amp;search=%22golden%20nugget%22%20%22yankee%20doodle%20dandy%22" class="external autonumber" title="https://securesite.chireader.com/cgi-bin/Archive/abridged2.bat?path=1997/970704/DAMSKI&amp;search=%22golden%20nugget%22%20%22yankee%20doodle%20dandy%22" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>) , and based on a look through the Chicago Trib archives, Yankee Doodle Dandy once had 27 locations. Give me some time to look into this before pulling the trigger. I think 27 locations would be large enough to confer notabilty. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 06:20, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, if you play around with the search terms, you should be able to read that entire article. (Keep running searches for the last phrase per excerpt.) And I think this article is another step to conferring notability, as the place seemed to have been an important place for certain Chicago subcultures in the 1970s. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 06:30, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b> I think this article raises the issue of "known" versus "notable".

<dd>Well, I think they would cry, and I think that's part of the issue. Usually I stay away from these kinds of arguments because of the risk that I'm biased; here, that's not the case. The article simply doesn't assert the notability that the restaurants have, and that's unfortunate. I'm still voting for delete. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 22:23, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I do think broad familiarity represents a <i>kind</i> of nobility. And I'm not sure if it's fair to compare a restaurant chain in Chicago with one in Berkeley -- there are almost thirty times as many people in the former than there are in the latter, and thus many more potential customers. (Although I don't think it would be egregiously bad to have an article on LaVal's, too. But I'm an inclusionist.) <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 18:17, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, weakly. Golden Nugget is only in Chicago, but is a restaurant chain and formerly had many more franchises than it does today-- there are numerous "Golden ____" restaurants in Chicago, like the Golden Angel on Lincoln and Montrose and the Golden Apple on Lincoln near Foster that were once Golden Nugget restaurants (many still have the iconic mush of yellow lights on top of the sign). It's also been featured in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Reader_c674.html" title="Chicago Reader">Reader</a> more than once as a Chicago "icon", but I don't have refs handy. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 18:35, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> Contrary to what was stated above, I was able to locate 7 Golden Nuggets in Chicago with a <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;hs=3mg&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official_s&amp;q=golden+nugget&amp;near=Chicago,+IL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local&amp;ct=title" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;hs=3mg&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official_s&amp;q=golden+nugget&amp;near=Chicago,+IL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local&amp;ct=title" rel="nofollow">cursory google search</a>, not just 6. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariable_3b71.html" title="User:Variable">siafu</a> 18:41, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I'd clean it up if I could, but it might take a while, as there are a lot of facts I'd like to get straightened out. After doing some searching through the Chicago Tribune archives, I have to admit I'm no longer sure about the connection between Golden Nugget and Yankee Doodle Dandy. I found an advertisement listing all of the Yankee Doodle Dandy Restaurants in Chicago, and only one corresponds to a present-day Golden Nugget (or "Golden restaurant", in general). Thus, it seems likely that a Golden Nugget just happened to take over the spot of a Yankee Doodle Dandy, and is not part of the same restaurant chain with a different name.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, I did find some evidence from Tribune listings to support siafu's comments about the other Golden restaurants in Chicago having once been Golden Nuggets. For example, there was a Golden Nugget listed at the same address as the present day Golden Angel (4344 N Lincoln Ave). I also found an ad for one Golden Nugget dating back to 1966, which means the chain is at least 40 years old. (That advertisement also referred to Golden Nugget as a "national chain," so perhaps the Dayton restaurant <i>is</i> somehow connected.)</dd>

<dd>So, overall, I think there's some potential for an article here, but we might have to do some digging to verify all the facts. I think it's best to give the article a few months, as suggested below, and then bring it back to AfD to see if it passes. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 15:04, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>I will admit the picture was totally unreliable and not having to do anything with the subject, but all jokes aside this article should not be deleted just based on the fact that it is unsourced. Every reliable source at one time are another was an unknown source beforehand, as previously stated don't delete just because it is an unknown subject with little to no information based on the subject at hand. I mean what makes a realiable source a reliable source? If it's shown on tv or is spoken about on the media. We all know that media can print or talk about things out of context on purpose just for a sake of a story, which make it just as unreliable as one's words.

<li>This branch of Hadassah is not as similar to Hadassah national as other branches are. This is a larger and more together group of Hadassah. While other branches feature a newsletter and other mail, Glastonbury Hadassah has monthly member meetings, community events, and a large website. Wikipedia is a great place to show ourselfs to the public as the large religous community that we are, even though some may not understand.

<li>Think of Hadassah like a TV Show and glastonbury hadassah like an episode of the show. Hadassah gives general information, while glastonbury hadassah gives more specific information.

<li>Pointless comment. Your link contradicts your statement. Most recent AfD's for primary/elementary schools (since September) resulted in <i>no consensus</i> or <i>merge</i>.

<li>Fughettaboutit makes a good effort but he really hasn't established notability. Please note that <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> is a proposed guideline, not policy, and in the opinion of many it is way too inclusionist. 221 libraries out of 10,000 is still next to nothing, probably millions of books fit that criteria. I noticed the editorial reviews at Amazon, they all seem to be from within the 9/11 conspiracy community. Same with many of the google scholar hits. I see 99 books listed as those made available to the 9/11 commission - I'm guessing the national archives included every book on the subject of 9/11 in this list regardless of notability or quality. The Vanity Fair article is a one-line mention. That leaves what, the Missoula Independent? <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 01:13, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Fughettaboutit makes a strong case <b>and</b> demonstrates the weakness -- indeed, the outright falsity -- of the case you made for deletion. Nitpicking about the number of libraries is a bit absurd at this point. I have seen this book cited in numerous other works; it is certainly notable enough to meet the criteria we have at wikipedia. I sense this was nominated for POV reasons (and there seems to be a pretty organized movement of the same group of editors to delete books on this specific topic, something very problematic in Wikipedia terms, I think).--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 00:43, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

We have been struggling against a tide of inclusionists railing that the criteria are <i>too stringent</i> and suffer from a lack of feedback. Okay, back to the matter at hand. Discounting everything else I posted, the Vanity Fair article, while it is not a detailed treatment of the book itself, is a very reliable source indicating that the book won Italy's highest literary prize. Do you dispute the reliability of that fact? If not, isn't a book which wins a country's most prestigious literary prize notable on that basis alone?

<li>It's a good idea to review the article up for deletion before commenting, as one of your above statements is easily provably false. Regarding the Naples Prize, if you search for <i>"Premio Napoli" -ahmed</i> (to get hits not including this author), you get 28K hits, approx 700 unique. Searching on <i>"Fondazione Premio Napoli"</i> (a more precise name) gives 133 unique hits. Even <i>"Naples Prize" -ahmed</i>, a more restrictive search than what you state above, gives hits beyond just the Institute's Chicago website. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead"><b><font color="green">*Sparkhead</font></b></a> 12:21, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: Sparkhead, it's a good idea to read comments before replying, to avoid making yourself look foolish. My point is not about the (non)notability of the Naples Prize. Do you deny that there are a lot of English-language pages which mention that prize and are apparently intended to promote this conspiracy theorist and his book? This is called <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine_optimization.html" title="Search engine optimization">Search engine optimization</a>. There are professional <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine_marketing.html" title="Search engine marketing">search engine marketers</a> who can make money by getting their client's stuff into Wikipedia. There are also amateur Search Engine Optimizers who desperately want to promote various conspiracy theories and will happily abuse Wikipedia to do so. Our rules about notability etc are (among other things) designed to ensure articles don't get created just for SEO. My point is that someone has put a lot of effort into SEO for this book, and that people should take that effort into account when assessing its (lack of) notability. I assumed that everyone reading my earlier comment would understand this; clearly I was wrong. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Chittleborough_4a64.html" title="User:Chris Chittleborough">CWC</a><small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_Chittleborough_55c1.html" title="User talk:Chris Chittleborough">(talk)</a></small> 18:32, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Note the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palm_Beach_Post_410a.html" title="Palm Beach Post">Palm Beach Post</a> review, easily verifiable, and the Playboy one, which is less so. Regarding search engine optimization, I ran a more restrictive search than you, and came up with hits from the Italian Cultural Institute's websites for Chicago and Los Angeles, hosted at the <b>Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs</b> web domain. Not talking about fringe websites, these are institutions created by the Italian government.

<li>The only copy of that column we who do not subscribe to the <b>Palm Beach Post</b> have comes via <a href="http://www.waronfreedom.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.waronfreedom.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.waronfreedom.org/</a>, run by people who <i>just might</i> have an agenda.</li>
<li>That <i>Palm Beach Post</i> column is an op-ed, <b>not a book review.</b> Real book reviews list the publisher's name and usually the ISBN. They do not spend several paragraphs describing the publisher, nor do they give helpful hints on how to purchase the book.</li>
<li>The <i>PBP</i> op-ed itself says explicitly that the book got only one review.</li>
<li>The Playboy article (again, not a review) was titled "A Roundup of Ridiculous Theories". 'nuff said.</li>
<li>I did ask Sparkhead a question; he did not even try to answer it.</li>
<li>Nor has Sparkhead addressed my point about SEO. Whether some Italian bureaucrats have set up some websites about the <i>Premio Napoli</i> is <b>completely irrelevant</b> to my point: someone has done a lot of SEO for this book. Implication #1: Google searches etc will inflate the book's significance, and we need to take that into account when assessing the results of such searches. Implication #2: whoever did (or is doing that SEO) will greatly desire Wikipedia to retain this article, and may well participate in this debate.</li>

<li>Again, check the article. There was a link put in there to the PBP archives before you posted that contains the opening paragraphs, which validates the article exists at PBP. Semantics aside it's an article that talks about a book - i.e. a book review in a mainstream paper. A reference from a reliable mainstream source, regardless of how you wish to label it. I addressed your point about SEO by noting it's irrelevant. Note in some of my searches I took out the author's name to reduce hits. It's also irrelevant that the Playboy article called it ridiculous. What's relevant is the mention.

I think some of the stuff they have been successful in removing needed to be removed, but a lot of it appears notable, and was nominated for AfD only because of the topic. I think this is especially problematic, as the reasons given for deletion are usually items that should be addressed in editing -- things like POV and WP:RS, better addressed through tags and discussions than deletion votes. I think an organized attack on articles about a particular topic like this is totally inappropriate in Wikipedia, even though I tend to agree with the group about these conspiracy theories being false.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 21:30, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It;s not an issue of big brother - it's an issue of an organized campaign against articles about these theories (which, I agree, are bogus). Look at the AfD on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_William_Christison_%28CIA%29_853c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/William Christison (CIA)">Bill Christison</a> - it's likely to be deleted because of a horribly misleading "google" count thanks to an organized crowd of deletionists engaged in what appears to be a form of groupthink. While there are plenty of articles on this topic that should be deleted, there should not be a group of editors systematically targeting specific pages just because of their POV on the topic. It is especially troubling that several of the pages have been deleted for reasons that are better addressed as content issues -- citations, POV, etc. Personally I agree that any claim that the Bush Administration was behind 9/11 is totally false and probably easily disproved. But the 9/11 conspiracy theorists are a notable and growing phenomena, and for Wikipedia to pretend they don't exist because of a handful of editors is ridiculous.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 23:23, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I said groupthink, not bad faith. I don't think there is a cabal operating in bad faith. I think there is an organized effort to target certain articles. It's not a cabal; it's operating pretty openly - look at Morton's and GabeF's talk pages. And I support some of the goals of it - I too think there are a lot of dumb things on Wikipedia (why does <a href="../../../e/v/e/Every_time_you_masturbate%E2%80%A6_God_kills_a_kitten_3af5.html" title="Every time you masturbate… God kills a kitten">this article</a> keep surviving AfD, for example?) and I don't have a problem with public attempts to delete such pages. But I do think it is problematic if it is being done solely based on POV issues. I also think the bandwagon approach that some people take supports my point about groupthink.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 06:03, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> One of the first and best researched books on the subject of 9/11 as inside job. This AfD is more POV campaigning by editors targetting anything that claims 9/11 was an inside job.

There are subjects much less notable than this book that exist on wikipedia. If you want to be part of a civil online community, why don't you stick to improving content rather than policing (or repressing) it.

<p>Article was prod'd and prod removed and restored (a common misapprehension). To my mind this is an article which would now be dealt with by {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-spam_4537.html" title="Template:Db-spam">db-spam</a>}} speedy deletion as it was created specifically to generate interest by <a href="../../../m/s/b/User%7EMsbjustice_c902.html" title="User:Msbjustice">Msbjustice</a> (<a href="../../../m/s/b/User_talk%7EMsbjustice_48bc.html" title="User talk:Msbjustice">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Msbjustice_9f8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Msbjustice">contribs</a>) [i.e. M. Bragg]. As the case has not yet come to court and lacks much third-party reporting, I fail to see any encyclopedic value in keeping it (which means that <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">Ignore all rules</a> applies here).

<dd>If there is no criticism, that implies the non-notability of the book. The inability to write <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> articles in the absence of multiple independent reports is why <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is a core requirement. One could argue that a stub article would be NPOV (in making no claims beyond the trivial ones of the book's existence, authorship, &amp;c), but Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of bibliographical cruft, so that wouldn't be an improvement. For books to have articles they have to be notable ... but we've been here already. There's no way an article on this book can meet the core requirements, whatever a proposed guideline like <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> might say.

<li>Strongly <b>oppose</b> deletion. At one point or another in history Schliemann and even Homer himself would have been "deleted". Snodgrass too... political correctness knows no bounds... I expect Prof. Snodgrass himself would be horrified by the idea of censoring Wilkens: not of criticizing him, certainly, or of dismissing his ideas -- but the notion of <u>removing</u> the ideas of Wilkens or any other non-conformist, "nut" or otherwise, so that they might not even be read, if only to be dismissed, runs against the grain of the Western free-thinking tradition of which both Homer and now Snodgrass himself are parts. I've just read Wilkens' book, myself: greatly entertained, if not convinced -- it has motivated me to re-read Snodgrass.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> The book is junk, yes, but I think it's notable junk. One, arguably not so reliable source, <a href="http://www.nycwritersgroup.com/v2/blog/archives/2006/01/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nycwritersgroup.com/v2/blog/archives/2006/01/" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> mentions it as a highly sought after book. There's a review apparently here <a href="http://www.epigraphy.org/All_Abstracts.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.epigraphy.org/All_Abstracts.htm" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>. Anyways, I distinctly remember that theory being mentioned at the time the book was published. Some respected people have taken the time to explain how unreasonnable the theory is<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pENNH446VGgC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;vq=%22where+troy+once+stood%22&amp;dq=%22where+troy+once+stood%22+&amp;hl=fr&amp;sig=ywcHRYEGwgpEmrGPQudPa8vZefo" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?id=pENNH446VGgC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;vq=%22where+troy+once+stood%22&amp;dq=%22where+troy+once+stood%22+&amp;hl=fr&amp;sig=ywcHRYEGwgpEmrGPQudPa8vZefo" rel="nofollow">[33]</a></li>

Still it has some sort of cult following and this is exactly what the article should discuss. That being said, it probably falls somewhat short of <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> but not dramatically so either.<a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 23:53, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm not a meatpuppet, I'm a person (I think). I am not in favour of Wilkens' theory, not by several light years, but I believe Wikipedia readers need references on such material. I advised one other user to vote because I know of his interest in the subject. I don't suppose he even knows what a meatpuppet is. Since he asked me how voting was done, I told him, and said he could recommend others to vote so long as he didn't push them one way.

<dd>This is debatable. It depends on whether the vote should be made up of AfD regulars, people who have the article on their watchlist, people who are interested in the subject (some WikiProjects are organised enough that they have pages acting as group watchlists so they can contribute to deletion discussions for pages edited by their WikiProject), people who are expert in the subject (probably need someone to ask them to contribute), random passers-by, other random groups of people rounded up and herded over here to vote. I think if you know of someone you know would want to contribute to the debate, then telling them about it is OK. Of course, it would help the closing admin if everyone voting admitted their interest, and revealed how they found out about the debate, but that is never going to happen, is it? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 14:46, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, Storkk. I'm certainly not one of those, thank goodness, and don't ever want to be one.

It would have been rude, I think, to have this AfD and not let him know about it. Similarly, this AfD follows upon a discussion at <a href="../../../o/d/y/Talk%7EOdyssey_ef5e.html" title="Talk:Odyssey">Talk:Odyssey</a> about whether Wilkens is a reliable source, which many of the commenters here participated in; obviously, people who participated in that discussion have an interest in this one. CaveatLector referred to this discussion in the initial post of the AfD, so it's not as if any of this is a secret. Furthermore, CaveatLector, Andrew Dalby, and myself are members of the <a href="../../../c/g/r/WP%7ECGR_c1b8.html" title="WP:CGR">WikiProject Classical Greece and Rome</a>, so this discussion is of obvious interest to us. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 15:25, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> How about a "Disputed" template, for this case? That doesn't require deletion or correction, as I understand it, but simply notes disagreement on article substance and directs readers to the article's Talk page for discussion &amp; debate. Seems to me that might be the healthiest solution, here: using Wilkens' far-out ideas perhaps to shore up but at least to question received opinion -- nothing worse than the latter unquestioned. The "Disputed" label, at the top, might attract attention but at least would alert the truly innocent. --<a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKessler_5a20.html" title="User:Kessler">Kessler</a> 00:10, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Personally, I check out Afds every once in awhile for fun, because there's often an interesting dispute like this one to be found, and I end up reading articles (and learning about non-mainstream theories) I might never otherwise have encountered. I have told one other member about this one -- not because I knew how he would vote, but frankly because I was curious about his reaction. He's had none (in fact, I've subsequently discovered he's been inactive for two months). I've also mentioned this article and the Afd on my blog, cfaille.blog-city.com, but doubt that will stir much reaction. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a> 15:04, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Just came out of an AFD, extraordinarily bad form to keep renominating an article when you don't get the delete result you like.

<li><b>Comment</b>- "keep renominating" makes it sound like I have renominated it more than once. In fact, I only renominated it one time, but that renomination was immediately closed by a non-admin citing <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. Someone else reopened it at that point. According to a Wikipedia policy article that I am too sick of repeating, it is a common practice for a quick renom if it is due to non-consensus. If there was a consensus to keep then I would not have renominated the article. It is not bad form. In the end though, Wikipedia is not a democracy and all articles should conform to policies and standards set up to keep Wikipedia at an academic level...notability and verifiability criteria should not be neglected or placed at lesser importance to subjective opinions about an articles worth. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_hornet_0ed2.html" title="User:Green hornet">Green hornet</a> 02:45, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hey guys, guess what? They release an album next year and all this bickering will be moot. There are lots of bands on Wikipedia with only one album to their name, and you guys aren't arguing about them, but they're all notable in any case. For a group that wants to be the biggest encyclopedia on the web, you're sure putting down a lot of ridiculous restrictions on who or what can be included. I would think you'd be happy that someone took the time to add a new article to your collection. And before you jump to any conclusions, I did not write the article in question, but I know a stupid debate when I see it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.33.193.105_e99d.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.33.193.105">65.33.193.105</a> (<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User_talk%7E65.33.193.105.html" title="User talk:65.33.193.105">talk</a>) .</small></li>

<li>65.33.193.105, you need to sign your comments. You also need to stop vandalising AfD tags and then arguing with people about WP policy regarding notability standards until you understand what WP requires to meet those standards. The appropriate policies have been noted. Independant releases do not neccessarily meet the requirements. If you have references then it might be a legitimate argument. Also be civil because a lack of civility makes me cease being civil. Also Strata are most likely not releasing their second album at the expected time as a large portion of their output was rejected by the label. They were supposed to be finished with it, but it was largely scrapped. They are starting to record and rewrite again and <b>might</b> squeeze out another album on Wind Up by late 2007. At that time they would meet the minimum notability standards and can have an article. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_hornet_0ed2.html" title="User:Green hornet">Green hornet</a> 20:28, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The only valid vote is one made according to a honest appraisal of WP policy. Please vote keep or delete based on this rather than your concept of whether it is in bad taste to renominate.

<ul>
<li>Strata themselves have noted that the current recording sessions will not affect their planned spring release. They scrapped only a third of the album and probably some of those songs will only be reworked, not totally thrown aside. There is absolutely no reason why they cannot have an album out by April or May and therefore no basis for your assumption that they "maybe will have it out by late 2007". Furthermore, your attitude leads me to suspect that you might hold some kind of bias since you are the one who keeps asking for the article's deletion and will not let it go. There are several bands on Wikipedia with only one or two albums to their name that could be viewed as "non-notable" and yet you are not fervently attacking those articles. Therefore, I see no reason to be civil to someone who is spending all their time begging for the deletion of a perfectly good article, especially someone who is part of a group dedicated to the very goal. I find your cover of "keeping the Wikipedia pristine" laughable. It seems more like your goal is to eradicate the articles that you don't like. Yes, Wikipedia has standards, but the standards should be working toward expanding Wikipedia, not dissolving it.<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlah_b498.html" title="User:Blah">Blah</a> 11:40, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Of course Strata are going to say that they are reworking the songs and it won't affect the release date, assuming that a new album really will be released. That's not relevant. The planned release is far enough in the future for no verifiability. It is irrelevant to the discussion. So are the self-released albums. Anyone anywhere can put them out. Self-released albums do not have sufficient notability to have their own articles, nor does it take Strata from being a one album band to a three album band. Wikipedia shouldn't just be a ragtag group of articles expanding to include every little bit of fandom and every local band and endless lists of trivia and whatnot. It should be ever-improving in quality more importantly than endlessly expanding in content- unless that content is truly encyclopedic...otherwise wikipedia should drop the -pedia in its name and go by wikispace or something. Furthermore you have no grasp of what deletionism really entails. Your perception of bias fails to take into account that I have participated in many AfD's, and even have voted <b>keep</b>! Many of the AfD have been on diverse subjects as I often have run across them on the Articles for Deletion page. Whether they had to do with bands or not is irrelevant. I oppose articles for any band with less than the <b>required</b> two! I don't think it matters whether you think that is important or not because it <b>IS</b> policy! Wikipedia claims to not be a democracy, which it shouldn't be since knowledge is not democratic but rather objective. It doesn't matter if every WP editor votes that 2+2=5 because it certainly does not. WP needs to enforce its standards more thoroughly. Nearly everyone else other than 65.33.193.105 on this debate has been very civil. First you said that this is a stupid debate, which it is not. You also said that there is no reason to be civil to me. Go ahead and do whatever you want with this article, give everyone everywhere anytime their own 40 page wp article. Whatever. It is sad that anytime I do a web search...yahoo, google, whatever, several links are wikipedia pages that have glaring editorial errors. This is a major problem. Editors constantly writing and editing non-notable, unverifiable, POV, and unreferenced information here. Now I cannot even find relevent information on a search engine because of the shortcomings deriving from a lax enforcement of policy here. And finally, I am not <b>pushing</b> for a delete. I am nominating for it. I am not trying to force anyone else's vote. I am asking for honest votes per policy. Vote according to your conscience, although I hope my points are understood. I'm done defending my reasons for nomination, and think I'm going to leave the debate to finish on its own so I can clean up some religion of India articles.

<p>Hardly notable aspect of the Bleach series. even though it does have some significance, it's just one of the items/things used in Bleach and is therefore almost inherently non-notable. Moreover, it's hard to create good Bleach-related articles when info about the series is split into nearly 100 articles and new users are creating new articles like this one fairly often. A precedent is the redirection of Shawlong Qufang (move of article's content), Hiyori Sarugaki, etc. The info from the gigai article can also be found in <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinigami_%28Bleach%29_7c48.html" title="Shinigami (Bleach)">Shinigami (Bleach)</a> -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 19:16, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm nominating this for deletion as it's a <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factoid.html" title="Factoid">factoid</a>.

This as part of a paragraph on <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustav_III_020c.html" title="Gustav III">Gustav III</a> which is generally exaggerated and distorted. I find no such description in any account of <i>Swedish</i> history and doubt anyone ever will because what's actually being referenced is <a href="../../../../sv/r/o/s/Rosenkammaren.html" class="extiw" title="sv:Rosenkammaren">Rosenkammaren</a> ("the rose <i>chamber</i>"), which was merely the torture room at Nya Smedjegården prison. It was short lived (1740s-1772) and rarely used even before the 1772 abolishment of torture. By no account were snakes or reptiles used; cold water was the instrument of torture.</p>
<p>I don't think the historical reality here is notable enough to warrant mention outside of an article on Smedjegården (which en-wikipedia doesn't have). And as a myth, it doesn't seem notable enough either - Google books finds the term mentioned in only one <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC22189869&amp;id=D9o_KCwvrvQC&amp;q=%22cave+of+roses%22&amp;dq=%22cave+of+roses%22" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC22189869&amp;id=D9o_KCwvrvQC&amp;q=%22cave+of+roses%22&amp;dq=%22cave+of+roses%22" rel="nofollow">place</a> outside Rambaud, a US congress hearing.

<dd>Unfortunately it can't though, since there's no source describing it as a myth.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - That was largely the issue around which the first AfD revolved and a number of reliable sources were suggested. The fact that they have not been incorporated 18 hours after the previous one closed is perhaps less than surprising. If they haven't been incorporated sometime later - whether due to neglect or the intransigence of one or more editors - then we have more of an issue here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This may not be the correct way to view unsourced material; the reason for the failure to incorporate reliable sources may well be that they do not exist. I believe I saw Jimbo quoted as warning specifically against this line of reasoning, and may return to share this quote. I for one have never heard of any of these people, and am not clear that they are even notable, much less reliable. Faisal is more than welcome to work on this essay in his userspace and recreate it <i>if and when</i> there is something real here.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 03:21, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We may be talking at cross purposes here. There were a number of reliable sources suggested over the course of the original AfD, most of which have been sitting on the article's Talk page. Failure to incorporate same into the article in 18 hours is hardly a hanging offence, regardless of motivation. If the only thing that's preventing the incorporation of the sources suggested (and any others anyone can find) is the intransigence of a particular user, the problem is with the <i>user</i>, rather than the <i>article</i> and should be dealt with via other channels. Again, however, there's the time interval: I find it hard to believe that 18 hours of intransigence indicates a usage pattern that will continue ad infinitum. If it does, however, it's intransigence by the user rather than by the article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 08:40, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is not <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. The article is not "worthless except to Muslims proselytizers," since I think it is worth and I am not a Muslim proselytizer. Second the edit reversions issue is not a problem with the article but perhaps a problem with an editor, so an AfD is inappropriate. I don't even know how to respond to your reference to the Zakir Naik speech since I think it is completely irrelevant where the inspiration for the article came from. <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatherhaveaheart_e6da.html" title="User:Ratherhaveaheart">Ratherhaveaheart</a> 03:58, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It should be clear to everyone from the facile analogies and silly captions that this article is more like a book you would give little Muslim children in third grade than it is an encyclopedia article.

Arrow740 needs to understand that it is part of Islam's reformation and Enlightenment for Muslims to go through the exercise in futility of showing the correlation between the Quran and Science. To me it is a template for what is not science so let them play with pseudoscience as eventually (and it will be a number of generations) they will realise the gap between what is faith and what is science can't be closed.

<dd>There he goes again with his "dichotomy". But as to the recent AfD, since then at least one of the people behind this article (Aminz), having made a good faith effort to find sources, has come to the conclusion that there is no academic source for any of this material, pro or con. He quite reasonably suggested that we wait until such sources surface before proceeding with the article. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 08:02, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is inaccurate that Aminz came to that conclusion? See above. Also I meant since the previous AfD, but she might have written that on your talk page before it closed, I don't know. As regarding the sources itaqallah found, one is Maurice Bucaille's book, one appears to be published by the Saudi government (it is probably propaganda), and the third, Peter Hodgson's book, actually claims that Muslims go too far "by attempting to find detailed adumbrations of scientific knowledge there [in the Quran]]". It discusses Muslim scientists, and does not go into any of the wonderful detail that Ibrahimfaisal has.

<dd>no, i think Aminz's observation is inaccurate, read the comment in context of what you said. first: show me where i linked to Bucaille's book. i didn't. second, do you see where it says Bridgeview, Illinois? thirdly, Hodgson discusses the issue of Qur'an and Science, his own opinions of it, as well as notable Muslim opinions on it. that is certainly material which can be included in the article, esp. in the first three sections, and proves that the topic of qur'an and science is notable to merit inclusion in contrary to your claim that that "there is no academic source for any of this material, pro or con". so maybe it is you who needs to read a little more closely before rushing to respond with aggressive rhetoric. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 23:39, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Regarding Hodgson's book, he does not address what Faisal is trying to address with this article, which is the subject of coincidences between science and the Quran. He doesn't address the other side either, which this article should address. Regarding the book that I suspect to be Saudi propaganda. Publisher: Makkah, Saudi Arabia&#160;; Bridgeview, Ill.&#160;: Islamic Academy for Scientific Research, 1990. The fact that there is a front company in the US does not give the Saudi publisher and legitimacy; Saudi spends loads of oil money in the US funding mosques and <a href="../../../d/a/w/Dawah.html" title="Dawah">Dawah</a>, so their involvement in publishing here is to be expected.

<dd>so Bucaille's book isn't "one" of the "sources" i "found", is it, Arrow? it's on a list, along with other notable books. "not much else"? try going through the several pages, a notable book pops up once in a while. don't forget the other books i mentioned which you did not comment on. "a book only owned by one library in the western world", a lot of books on that site which are notable or even reliable contain no library info at all. the categorising is, understandably incomplete, and your conclusion may be untrue. Hodgson's analysis is entirely relevant here, in the light of Aminz's objection ("I haven't been able to find even a single academic source either supporting or denying, <i>or even explaining the issue of the Qur'an and Science</i>"), unless you misunderstood what he said. Moore's book is also notable, and again his analysis is certainly relevant here. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 00:22, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't care who wrote it, if a book (Moore's book) is only published by the Saudi government it's worthless. I don't know about the Journal of the Islamic Medical Association, though. I would say that if something is on a list you are citing as proof of your point then yes, you found it. I entirely agree with that sentence of Hodgson's that I quoted, however by my standards it should not be included in the article, as he does not try to justify his opinion. However by the standards of this article it should be featured quite prominently. I will reiterate that if his book were to be used for any article that article would be called "Muslim science", as he does not attempt the point by point correlating that Ibrahimfaisal has been doing, and in fact dismisses it, as we should do.</dd>
<dd>Would you support removing quotes from Bucaille's book? You keep distancing yourself from it. It is not reliable. It is published by American Trust Publications, which is owned by the <a href="http://www.nait.net" class="external text" title="http://www.nait.net" rel="nofollow">North American Islamic Trust</a>, not an academic publisher, and probably financed by the Saudi government.</dd>

<dd>whether you "care" or not is irrelevant, what matters is if it is suitable for use on wikipedia, and it is. again, your "standards" are not relevant here. so you are saying i "found" 300+ publications? why then focus on Bucaille to the exclusion of the rest, including some that i explicitly mentioned from the list? you are clearly trying to shift the discussion by introducing red herrings, as you seem to do frequently. the issue was about whether there are actual sources which even discuss the topic of the qur'an and science, and there are. accusations of saudi govt backing are pretty meaningless, pointless, and merely an attempt to poison the well. i am not distancing myself from Bucaille, you keep trying to misrepresent my position by making it a debate about Bucaille, as you clearly feel more confident about criticising it than you do backing up claims that there is "no academic source", which is exactly what this particular discussion is about. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 13:02, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep; Overhaul</b> There is potential with the article, based on the title alone. But, the article is currently in a terrible state.

Citing <i>Blessed is He Who made the constellations in the heavens and made therein a lamp and a shining moon</i> as a prophecy of the fact that moonlight is a reflection from sunlight seems quite dubious; the connection is a far stretch. These juxtapositions throughout the article are presented in a manner that is not encyclopedic and neutral, but rather a manner that appears to imply that the Qur'an is a scientific marvel. We, as an encyclopedia, should be trying to avoid the appearance of promoting one holy book over all others as well as trying to source interpretations of holy texts.

<li><b>NOTE TO CLOSING ADMIN:</b> Meaning no disrespect to any particular user, there is an unmistakable correlation between religous persuasion and recommendations on this issue of an article which alleges that the sacred scripture of this religion may be proved to be the words of God himself by references to contemporary science. Furthermore, it it clear that users of this persuasion significantly outnumber those who don't share it on the majority of matters related to this subject, certainly including this AfD. It is difficult to see how, in these circumstances, Wikipedia's consensus-based procedural policies can be expected to yield encyclopedic results. The possibility of a vigorous open-minded <i>non-predetermined</i> debate is, with only a few exceptions, almost entirely absent here. I strongly urge you to consider the precedent that would be set by the "community"-based retention of articles like this one. Without a change in approach, or the involvement of a large number of editors who aren't particularly interested in these subjects (but how, when RfC's are nearly useless?), it is virtually guaranteed that we shall see a good deal more of the same. Please take a long hard look at this article and ask if this is the direction we should be taking; no gentle recommendations to follow source policies in the future will speak nearly as loudly as the fact that this nonsense was allowed to continue without check or sanction.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 06:16, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Your "correlation" claim is <b>entirely false</b>: If you'd look at the comments, A large number of editors have voted Speedy Keep or Keep on the basis of the nomination itself being <i>way</i> too early after the previous AfD closed, with no bearing whatsoever on their religious inclinations. Or are you supposing that MARussellPESE, BigHaz, Indon, Alecmconroy, Ratherhaveaheart, Pablo D. Flores, Storkk, Ttiotsw and Irishpunktom are all Muslim? Really now. - <code><a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValarauka_53df.html" title="User:Valarauka">Valarauka</a><sup>(<a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValarauka_0f66.html" title="User talk:Valarauka">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valarauka_1a71.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valarauka">C</a>)</sup></code> 07:25, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>At least three of the editors you've named are in fact Muslims. The correlation is not, however, that non-Muslim editors "vote" as a bloc - they do not, as you observe - but that <i>every</i> Muslim editor has "voted" to keep (though one subsequently changed his mind). 100% is a non-random and notable correlation, or would you disagree?<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 07:33, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, ok. That correlation does exist, I agree, but I don't see how that makes the votes suspect, unless you're assuming bad faith on the parts of all the Muslim editors involved. I personally agree with most of the objections regarding OR, etc., and I think that removing them all to a subpage is a good first step; however, the fact is that the "Quran/Science" debate itself <i>does exist</i>, and is a valid topic for Wikipedia. The fact that the article isn't up to par yet isn't grounds for deletion, as was amply demonstrated in the previous AfD. - <code><a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValarauka_53df.html" title="User:Valarauka">Valarauka</a><sup>(<a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValarauka_0f66.html" title="User talk:Valarauka">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valarauka_1a71.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valarauka">C</a>)</sup></code> 07:46, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Re good faith, Take a look at some of the usernames we see here, Truthspreader, Truthpedia, Islami…They've not attempted to desceive you, have they? If you nurture the possibility that they mean to be neutral, it is not their bad faith that is to blame. Similarly, consult the userpage and contribution history of the editor who created this article. They are admirably upfront about why they participate; no assumption of "bad faith" is warranted or necessary.</dd>
<dd>"that the article isn't up to par <b>yet</b>…" - "yet" is projection of a future outcome we've no reason to believe will ever exist. Such logic can support the retention of most anything on the grounds that reliable sources don't exist <i>yet</i>, when in fact this article <i>should never have been created</i> without them.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 08:14, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> I changed my vote while writing out these thoughts: I <b>might</b> be leaning towards changing my vote to keep as some of the edits have addressed some of the problems. I do not think its fair to say that this is a waste of time since the debate has definately improved the article in ways that might not otherwise have been accomplished. AfD often force a editor to take charge of the situation to improve an article that they want to see kept. I really feel like there should be an expansion of the criticism portion. I want to see an even balance between alleged proofs and alleged disproofs. I would like to see lots of references for both sides. I imagine that some of the references for each side could be the same as for Creationism in general even though much of the lit on that more directly addresses Christian claims. I think it would be nice to expand the article to include extra-Quranic sources such as the Peak of Eloquence. Perhaps then the title Quran and Science would be inaccurate though. Someone else can deal with that. No one's argument has affected my possible vote, but I am seeing an article that is sincerely trying to opt a less POV style, and incorporate more references. My main concerns are mainly the alleged history of revert wars to keep criticism out (<b>please</b> allow all sides into this article, otherwise it is not encyclopedic) as well as the extensive original research and unverifiabilty and non-notability of references used in the article as it stood when I first made my vote. I'm also sore about the lack of civility of Aminz to me, but that has nothing to do with the article. There is a general lack of civility here, and it is on both sides. You should not harshly criticize someone who renominates for AfD even if it is soon, since the renom was in good faith, made valid points and caused vast improvement on the article. OK I'm changing to <b>keep</b> so that I can see how it turns out. But I think we should keep an eye on it, and bring it to the crucible again in a month's time <b>IF</b> it doesn't continue to improve.

Sometimes it's just easier to do it yourself, I guess. Nonetheless, process should have been followed by those who wanted the article: why did *I* have to be the one to write, reference and clean up all those articles? As for process, I wonder if the article will really be deleted is she loses? These guidelines need to be examined: Farrell now has an article, while two other candidates in the same election who haven't achieved notability don't, and one was AfD'd. There is still nothing notable in Farrell's own article, which can't be covered in the election article, so I don't really understand why we bother with process, guidelines, AfDs, and so on.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think people are missing the point. She gets lots of local coverage, apparently, which is often sufficient for inclusion. But the fact she's repeatedly been on the front of the NY Times, one of the 1) most highly circulated newspapers on Earth; 2) distributed globally, and at the least available in virtually every corner of english speaking North America; 3) merits her article to stay. Lets not also forget that the NY metro region is one of the most populated areas of the entire country/world.

<li>On the contrary, the amount of coverage typically garnered by a competitive house candidate is significant, as in this case.

It is not worth worrying about the extra electrons necessary to keep this page open, nor is it worth using up neurons worrying that a page might exist on Wikipedia that is marginally ambiguous about whether it merits inclusion. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangali_5158.html" title="User:Malangali">Malangali</a> 14:44, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>: For the sake of clarity, I have in principle no objections against this article being deleted or redirect, but going against AfD consensus, even if the main author of the article was banned for being abusive, is not the way to go. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li><b>Comment</b> Changing the article to a redirect is within the bounds of reason subject to the AfD (2). If one were to count "votes" (most of which have reasons, which I won't try to weight....)
<ul>
<li>delete or userfy</li>
<li>redirect</li>
<li>keep (3)</li>
<li>delete (3)</li>
<li>delete or merge</li>
<li>keep or merge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Noting that, for the purpose of the AfD, keep, merge, and redirect are all counted as "keep", but for the purpose of deciding whether a merge is in order, "redirect", "merge", and possibly "delete" would be considered favorable, I would say that a merge "vote" probably would have succeeded. I'd lean toward merging the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> parts of the article (back) into <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a>, but I'm not sure there are any. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 00:51, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Extended discussion of the merge/AFD issue should be taken to <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)</a>. Suffice it too say that a merge proposal followed by a possible RFC are the appropriate options for getting input. AFD is not the place to discuss merges. Merges are potential compromises that come out of an AFD but an AFD should not be created when the intent is to merge.</li>

<dd>That said, the answer to JASpencer's question is that it would appear that Bakke does NOT have notability of his own outside the case. The title should redirect as many sources will refer to the "Bakke decision" without necessarily mentioning the UC Regents. The fact that Bakke hs gone on to a "quiet career" as an anesthesiologist rather than becoming a leading, notable anesthesiologist suggests that most people would never have heard of him were it not for the case.</dd>

<dd>That rationale would exclude most <i>notable</i> people at WP; people who are only notable for one thing, should we delete <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirhan_Sirhan_4378.html" title="Sirhan Sirhan">Sirhan Sirhan</a> and redirect the link to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_F._Kennedy_assassination_ca6b.html" title="Robert F. Kennedy assassination">Robert F. Kennedy assassination</a>? should we delete all the various survivor contestants who haven't done anything notable besides their all-too-brief walk in the spotlight and redirect all them to the appropriate show? Should we delete all one-issue famous people to the event that made them famous? A delete here would signal that the answer is "yes", and IMHO would be a mistake. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 01:11, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree that a "Delete" vote would have the wide-ranging implication that you assert it would. Nonetheless, your general point is valid: my argument was perhaps badly stated. There is obviously a need to document the lives of notable people even if there was only one event that made them famous. However, if the article on person A does not provide more information other than A is notable because of his/her involvement in event X and the article on event X contains all the information that is in the article on person A, then there should be no article on person A but rather A should redirect to the article on event X. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 17:19, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But the continued assertion that he has gone on to a quiet career that supposedly nullifies his notability is something beyond what the lawsuit was. Look at the article on <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Armstrong_5dd2.html" title="Neil Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a> and tell me if the academic career was of Joe Blow instead it would pass <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>; that's what he's done since his notability was established. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:27, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

For example, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Texas_Longhorn_football_team_0b8b.html" title="2005 Texas Longhorn football team">2005 Texas Longhorn football team</a> has 80 independent sources cited, which is far more than many featured articles. I suggest this nomination be summarily rejected. If the nominator beleives some seasons to not meet notability requirements, then I think it might be fruitfull for them to discuss the matter at the relevant wikiproject: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_College_football_296d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College football">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College football</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 23:40, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm not nominating these articles because I think they are bad articles, or are poorly referenced, I'm nominating them because its silly to have a unique page for each season of each team for one sport for each school in Division 1. Any easy fix for this would be to <b>merge</b> them into one article for each team, with a different section for each season/year. If you all don't agree, then you're blind to your own bias, and life will go on. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesertsky85451_dbb2.html" title="User:Desertsky85451">DesertSky85451</a> 00:20, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b> - I am a member of the College Football WikiProject. College football has more average game attendance than all other sports in the world except the NFL. Failure to include information about College Football would not lend credibility to Wikipedia being a complete and useful encyclopedia. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sports_attendance_figures.html" title="List of sports attendance figures">List of sports attendance figures</a> for attendance stats. College isn't "pro" so it's not listed in the same table, but if you put that 46,000+ average into the pro table, it's #2 <b>in the world.</b> Completely inappropriate AfD. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 03:07, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> - <s>This is stupid</s>. Just because the guy does not consider the information that important to HIM doesn't mean it shouldn't be important to others. It definately does NOT meet the criteria set out for an deletable article in Wikipedia. It is both <i><b>verifiable</b></i> and <i><b>notable</b></i> in the sense that the information contained in these articles can be found in multiple outside sources. Notability should not be subjective to an individual editor. Secondly, these articles are part of an ongoing project, with dozens of participants. The person who nominated these articles is in essence putting an entire WikiProject on AfD. That is unreasonable.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>- While some may not agree that these pages should be deleted, I think it is very unfair to call this nomination stupid or bad faith. I believe DesertSky has a truly valid point, but perhaps just went a little too far with it. I'm not sure if every single season of every single college football team is encyclopedic, especially if it is not a notable season in some way (for example, the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Texas_Longhorn_football_team_0b8b.html" title="2005 Texas Longhorn football team">2005 Texas Longhorn football team</a> that Johntex mentioned is notable). Many such pages can probably be merged into larger articles. However, in the mean time, my recommendation is that we keep all these, have a long discussion about such things at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_College_football_296d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College football">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College football</a>, and all have a <a href="../../../t/e/a/WP%7ETEA_9830.html" title="WP:TEA">nice cup of tea</a> and a large serving of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>.

<li><b>Apology</b> - OK. The use of the word "stupid" was inflamatory on my part. I make an unqualified apology for the use of that word. But that does not belie the fact that this AfD nomination is inappropriate. There may be a valid point that EVERY season is not necessarily worthy of an individual article, but likewise there is an equally valid point that SOME seasons ARE worthy of individual articles. Discussion of which seasons are notable or non-notable should be made within the scope of the relevent Wikiproject, and addressed in talk pages there. Simply marking an entire <i><b>class</b></i> of articles as <i>prima fascia</i> unworthy is unfair. If there is something SPECIFIC about a SPECIFIC season that makes it unworthy, than that SPECIFIC article should be AfD'ed. A 2-10 season may qualify for non-notable status (or it may not, especially if it happens to a normally excellent team.) But teams in contention for conference and/or national championships in any given year SHOULD be notable under even the most strict definitions. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 04:14, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> To my knowledge, no one from the WikiProject on college football has ever said that we need an article for every time for every season.</dd>
<dd>There are many teams, such as <a href="../../../b/a/y/Baylor.html" title="Baylor">Baylor</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke.html" title="Duke">Duke</a> that we have not even contemplated making individual season pages regarding. It is quite possilbe that some of these teams need only a team article, or that an article could cover a specific period of time for the program, like the tenure of a specific coach, for instance.</dd>
<dd>However, one of the articles up for deletion is <a href="../../../l/s/u/LSU_Tigers_football%2C_1893-1899_2cd5.html" title="LSU Tigers football, 1893-1899">LSU Tigers football, 1893-1899</a>, so it seems the nominator is not content to merely nominate pages related to signle seasons. The WikiProject is just a few months old and already we have 27 participants who have established a system to help us focus on the articles that are likely to be of the greatest interest to the most people. I think the project should be given some space to continue to refine criteria and bring articles to a consistent standard of quality. I have already called for us to "Kep all", now I am wondering if this AfD be closed as a Speedy Keep. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 04:26, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

They were last year's national champions and certainly an article appropriate. How can this nomination, covering articles that are not even listed on this page, be in process? If an editor comes across this nomination from the main AFD page, it would appear that a vote to delete was only for the 1902 LSU team. At the very least, the nominator should list all of the articles considered under this nomination at the top of this afd section. — <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/c/User_talk%7EERcheck_91c5.html" title="User talk:ERcheck">talk</a>) 11:19, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep All</b> - As part of the CFB WikiProject, I feel these pages contain valuable information that many college football fans can use.

<dd>The best place that I can refer you to for your answer is found at this link <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. It basicly needs to be noteable to a encylopedia entry and not just of local interest. It looks as if you have a fine local group however, as your example with the S.S. Badger that is of interest to both the local cities it stops as well as the traveling public as a whole. I have used google and found no newspaper or major media coverage at all for your group, the only sites were your group site and the city of West Bend site and very little on that one. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRanger_6fb8.html" title="User:TheRanger">TheRanger</a> 03:07, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
