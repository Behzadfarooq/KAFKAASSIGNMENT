<p>Declined speedy. This article was created by the self-styled "dark lord of inclusionism", so I decided to forego an inevitably contested prod. The single <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/14/magazines/fsb/pirates.fsb/index.htm?postversion=2006091810" class="external text" title="http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/14/magazines/fsb/pirates.fsb/index.htm?postversion=2006091810" rel="nofollow">external link</a> and <a href="http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061122/NEWS/611220363/1026/FEATURES12" class="external text" title="http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061122/NEWS/611220363/1026/FEATURES12" rel="nofollow">this</a> are the only press coverage, but neither contain the <s>subject</s> person as the primary <s>source</s> subject, as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> requires. There's almost no important information not already in the article about the business, so there's no point in merging. <a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 21:08, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Withdraw</b>ing my deletion nomination, though there seems to be a merge proposal below.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 10:28, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as the article creator. One, Ehrlich is a primary subject of many of the sources between the business and <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate%27s_Booty_4bb6.html" title="Pirate's Booty">Pirate's Booty</a>, thus actually meeting WP:BIO. Part of the reason for the disambig was to reduce confusion between this subject and the governor, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Ehrlich_fe3d.html" title="Robert Ehrlich">Robert Ehrlich</a>, who this was improperly linked to at <a href="../../../d/y/k/WP%7EDYK_3118.html" title="WP:DYK">did you know</a> and caused a major factual error on the main page for a short time. Certainly, the creator and CEO of one of the better known snack food vendors is worthy of an article, and plenty can be said - it's only a stub and I haven't had the wiki-time to sit down and do research on anything past that since I put this article up. Plenty of references available, plenty to base an article off of, I'm not sure I see the problem. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:12, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Yes, it's a stub, but ironically the references that demonstrate subject notability takes up more space than the actual article content. The article certainly can expand. The additional article that the nom provided just adds to evidence of notability. And I'm very troubled by the nom's opening <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> comments. This might be a bad faith nom. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 02:30, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>No no no. Check my userpage, it's a perfectly okay term, I kinda like it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 03:44, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do know that the title is a good-natured jest that nobody objects to. But using the article's creator's reputation as a reason to not include the article is nonsensical to those of us outside the "WP clique." I'll try to be less serious about it next time I see it. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 04:15, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, Jeff got it. The reference was included only to explain why I didn't bother with prod (and, honestly, to poke a bit of fun at Jeff, which he thankfully took well). It's not intended as a reason to delete the article. Perhaps it was in bad taste; I'll try to avoid it in future.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 11:49, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Tons of sources are available, from just about all major business magazines. Based on my perusal of them, though, it may be somewhat difficult to create an adequate article for this businessman separate from that for his company. However, that issue should be worked out in the articles' talk pages once a little more development occurs, rather than at AFD. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 08:51, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> from nominator. I'm not trying to be a stick in the mud, but after reading all the keep&#160;!votes, I still don't see it. The two articles I linked to give the most coverage to Ehrlich, but they both talk about him for a few paragraphs then veer into other, related subjects, so I don't think Ehrlich is the primary subject. I don't see these business magazine articles in the google results or listed at <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate%27s_Booty_4bb6.html" title="Pirate's Booty">Pirate's Booty</a>, unless those are the ones you are referencing. (My Lexis access is down, unfortunately, otherwise I'd be checking that, too.) Finally, I don't think his company ranks up there with Frito-Lay, Planters, Keebler, etc. Anyway, consensus is obviously trending to keep, and I'll accept that even if I disagree with it.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 11:49, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. BBC News (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/394676.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/394676.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), <i>Entrepreneur</i> (archived <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_1_29/ai_69238239" class="external autonumber" title="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_1_29/ai_69238239" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>), <i>Fortune Small Business</i> (via CNN Money <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/14/magazines/fsb/pirates.fsb/index.htm?postversion=2006091810" class="external autonumber" title="http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/14/magazines/fsb/pirates.fsb/index.htm?postversion=2006091810" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>), <i>Orlando Weekly</i> (<a href="http://www.orlandoweekly.com/columns/story.asp?id=921" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.orlandoweekly.com/columns/story.asp?id=921" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) and a couple of widely-reprinted wire service articles, among others. There is also some discussion of the FDA's reaction to his labelling and ingredients (they sent him a letter, nothing changed). I'm uncertain whether he could be considered the <i>primary</i> subject of this material, but he is certainly well-discussed media-wide in general. As I noted, I'm not at all certain where the balance should be between the articles on the businessman, the company, and the products. I imagine there will be at least one merge, but it seems that would be an editorial (i.e. content) determination that is difficult to make while founder and company are both stubs. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 13:04, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the links. There were several there I hadn't seen. I'll give this some thought and probably withdraw the nom if there's no more participation after a day or two.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Qualifies for inclusion based on those references. Having said that, the creator of the article is irrelevant. AfD is a mechanism for discussing the merits of a given article for inclusion here. It is not a forum or outlet for bile directed at other wikipedia contributors, even if they "self-styled" lords of the flies, rings or inclusionism. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:08, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Please spare me the moralizing lecture.

<ul>
<li>I didn't "get it" and had to check Jeff's page to understand what your intent was. Jeff should not have that sort of comment on his page - it is divisive and serves no encyclopedic purpose - and AfD noms should not be used for jokes. Call me a moralist. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 11:50, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
