<p>under the definition given, <i>all</i> non-toxic gases except oxygen are asphyxiant, which makes the term fairly useless, and dooms the article to be either forever a stub or a huge, pointless list of gases <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Clark_9084.html" title="User:Sam Clark">Sam Clark</a> 13:35, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep and expand</b> - in its current form, it looks like a list which can obviously never be complete as per the intro dicdef.

<li>This is what we get when editors don't cite sources. An asphyxiant gas has a specific definition, in the worlds of medicine and safety, distinct from a respiratory irritant gas, a flammable gas, and a toxic gas.

<dd>The main reason for deletion is WP:WINAD. I've rewritten the article now, and the definition is basically an elaboration of <b>a gas that causes <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a></b>. Despite my and your efforts, the article remains a stub (as predicted), and if you now compare with <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a>, it's mostly duplication. Further, if we were to remove all <i>asphyxiant gas</i> from <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a>, it becomes weak. <a href="../../../w/i/d/User%7EWidefox_7e44.html" title="User:Widefox">Widefox</a> 12:05, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>also, just fixed <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">Asphyxia</a> page, and while re-putting in link to this page, made me realise that article is also incorrectly named <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxiant_gases.html" title="Asphyxiant gases">Asphyxiant gases</a>. <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxiant_gas.html" title="Asphyxiant gas">Asphyxiant gas</a> as per guideline.

<dd>I've rewritten whole article, and while it has some merit, the more I researched it, the more I can see that the only way to grow the article is to list examples of types of <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxiant_gas.html" title="Asphyxiant gas">Asphyxiant gas</a> deaths. These are also repetition of <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">Asphyxia</a>.

It is a misnomer that this is some category of gas, but rather defined by what causes <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">Asphyxia</a>.

<dd>Expansion for expansions sake, or to justify an article is not warranted as far as I can see. Already, this article is misleading people into thinking this is a separate issue to asphyxia, a property of a gas, which it isn't, <b>the definition is asphyxia</b>, the <b>article should be in <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a></b>, else it is misleading (like thinking that it is some kind of toxicity).

<p>I have expanded the article to include sections on handling and the history of asphyxiant gases. As can be seen, the article is about much more than simple asphyxia and would simply not be appropriate as a subsection of that article, which should have much more accurate information than it does now. The recognition and identification of asphyxiant gases goes hand in hand with the history of <a href="../../../r/e/s/Respirators.html" title="Respirators">respirators</a>, mine safety, and OSHA regulation of industry.

<dd>No. It's still stupid. An article whose subject includes every single gas in the universe but one is too broad. If the definition of asphyxiant gas in the first sentence is wrong, then by all means, fix it so we can end this stupid debate. But if it isn't, any information in this article belongs <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">Asphyxia</a> or <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas.html" title="Gas">Gas</a>. We do not need a page for gases not called oxygen. What's next, List of Asphyxiant Gases? -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">babble</a></sup> 04:00, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Here's my take on things - first of all, it sounds like we need a rewrite of the definition if you are coming away with this understanding. Many gases that are not oxygen are toxic to humans and are not the subject of this article. The number of gases which truly are asphyxiant risks is actually quite small - in practical terms, only gases which occur naturally or are concentrated and used in industrial/scientific purposes have a chance to cause asphyxia. No one is asking for a list of asphxiant gases, so let's please avoid straw men. And, whether it makes sense to everyone or not, asphyxiant gas is a medical and industrial concept which is the subject of both medical research and industrial oversight. Opposition to an article on such an established concept should automatically, IMHO, lead to opposition to many of the pages linked to the <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a> main page such as <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erotic_asphyxia.html" title="Erotic asphyxia">erotic asphyxia</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positional_asphyxia.html" title="Positional asphyxia">positional asphyxia</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breathing_gas.html" title="Breathing gas">breathing gas</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulmonary_agent.html" title="Pulmonary agent">pulmonary agent</a>, etc. Take a look at <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breathing_gas.html" title="Breathing gas">breathing gas</a> - it is the exact opposite of this article. In essence, the definition is simply a mixture of gas which contains oxygen and inert gas. The same arguments could be used in its deletion. Yet, as you can see, a nice article discussing the common breathing gases (as opposed to every single possible combination in list form) and their uses. I believe that the expansion of this to include governmental policy vis a vis asphyxiant gases and the history of asphyxiant gases now added to the article are not likely to fit well into either the <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas.html" title="Gas">gas</a> or <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a> article. In short, I think that redirection/deletion is misguided. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 10:00, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please <i>do not rewrite the definition</i>. That definition is the best one I've seen, combining partial definitions from a handful of sources (encyclopaedias, gas suppliers, dictionaries). In the end, the article has no merit in itself - <b>It is just a gas that causes <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a>!</b> but has merit in <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a> - <b>Some non-oxygen gases will kill you before that, so it is not all gases but 1!</b> <a href="../../../w/i/d/User%7EWidefox_7e44.html" title="User:Widefox">Widefox</a> 12:00, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I will just use <i>italic</i> today! block-capitals = shouting (per norm), and emphasis vital (for brevity) - see the line below this text box as example. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a>'s new definition is fine, although the toxicity is a distraction (but correct in term of a verifiable definition). <i>I bet there's a load of toxic gases that kill you slower than Asphyxiation!</i> That's why it's such a bad article - <i>it has asphyxia at it's core</i>. As to the number of gases, you're not narrowing it down by saying natural or man-made! So, just because you've got me going now, is a vacuum an asphyxia gas? (or part-vacuum) it's non-toxic, not enough oxygen. See what I mean, it's not a property, but more a lack of life-supporting property. There's a borderline case which is interesting that I don't know the answer to - exhaled breath - does that count? <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> - you included a ref about this - about avalanches - and directing exhaled breath away from separate air intake pocket. There wasn't enough info in the online ref, and I wasn't sure if that counts, so I removed it as discussed before. Surely it's asphyxia (not gas), because it's using the oxygen, not displacing/replacing the atmosphere. I'd like to know the answer. OK, back to your comments above... as to the other articles, I'll check them tomorrow. You've done a good job justifying it, but you must know yourself it's a bit speculative, what with the overlap. regards <a href="../../../w/i/d/User%7EWidefox_7e44.html" title="User:Widefox">Widefox</a> 02:34, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Exhaled breath in a closed space actually creates a gas mixture which can be considered an asphyxiant gas. The same is true of other chemical processes in an enclosed space (such as rusting!) I'm going to be adding references soon about the oxygen and carbon dioxide amounts which are inherently dangerous in gas mixtures. I have a different (and more to the point) reference on avalanches that I was looking to add back into the article. As for a vacuum - no it causes trauma in a separate way. There are obviously always gas molecules in any vacuum, so I can see where it might be confusing. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 09:50, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(exhaled air) - sure creation, but it's also using the oxygen up (same as a fire), so it's not a displacement or dilution of the air, but a selective processing of it, hence not fitting the wording of definition (or the spirit of it), and is a borderline case. There's 2 separate cases - 1. using up the oxygen (asphyxia) vs. 2. displacement of air due to gas flow in situation (CO2 from a. fire sinking into a basement one may be sheltering in, b. porous (snow with small breathing holes) with the exhaled gas. This 10% CO2 ref I put in also comes into it - not sure why 10% lethal as logically if CO2 is an asphyxiant gas the % is irrelevant (cf. Nitrogen 78%!). This is a question for the interaction of CO2 with body that is not for me. <a href="../../../w/i/d/User%7EWidefox_7e44.html" title="User:Widefox">Widefox</a> 13:44, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
