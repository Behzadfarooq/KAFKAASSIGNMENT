<p>Peter Georgiev Lilov (Jan.5 1929) is a Bulgarian poet who is famous for his verses, such as "My Father". He was inspired to writing by author Edgar Wallace. He created books to fit all his tons of poetry. As a child, he was a poor schoolboy, always working. He born during the Great Depression, and was a boy during World War 2, nearly dying if it wasn't for his sack he was carrying that took a hit from American troops. He is not very known, but still is famous for a lot of his verses.</p>

<li>It's a vanity page. Lilov is the grandfather of Tyar/24.167.173.38. If you read the current page on Lilov, you'll see that note at the bottom. The requestor apparently didn't like the fact that the page was nominated for deletion, so (s)he posted a request for someone else to make it here. So far, Tyar/24.167.173.38's contributions include nothing but attack pages, page blankings and other nonsensical vandalism, and 2 vanity pages, both of which are up for deletion. (Most other things were speedied). --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 17:58, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>A group of teenage boys from The Woodlands High School compiled of unique personalities and deep friendships.

<p>Rumors concerning the origin of the group's name are abundant. One such rumor is that Gerard named the group after the fact that women never came between their friendship with each other. Others have argued that it was invented when the Clique was returning from a social event and Derek declared, "We need to call our group something. Something classy, something that rhymes. We should call ourselves the Dick Clique!" These theories have since been disproven however. The new, most widely accepted belief is that Geoff actually thought up the name in a dream.</p>

<p>It is an acronym for 'Laughing My F**king Ass Off Barbecued'. It is an extension of the acronym LMFAO. LMFAO is commonly used in online discussion forums, or Internet Relay Chats. LMFAOBBQ is also used in the same environments, but it indicates an even more exaggerated state of mirth than LMFAO. It is usually used after an extremely funny joke was told.</p>
<p>The growing usage of this BBQ extension seems to indicate a need to express the varying amounts of laughter. Facial expressions is obvious in a face-to-face conversation, but lacking in text-based communication. This acronym fills the need to convey expressions in an otherwise expressionless medium.</p>

<p>The need for distributed applications is growing. Some quick and easy solutions now exist which will help a developer generate such an application right out of the box. These shrink-wrap solutions, however, often fail to provide the power necessary to build a truly robust distributed system. The following pattern is presented for use in projects that require a custom built solution.</p>
<p>Goals The distributed application framework is a pattern for developing a suite of applications that share data. The goals of this pattern are as follows:</p>
<p>Application integration, both at the data level and the business level: Data integration means that the user does not "export" or "import" data to cross application boundaries. Instead, the data is immediately available, even when both applications are running simultaneously. Business integration means that applications may share common business logic and user interface components, promoting both a common look-and-feel and code reuse. Distributed application development. Different parts of each application may reside on different machines if appropriate. This framework also scales back to a single workstation solution. Insulation of data storage. When the inevitable changes occur to table structure, file format, or other storage issues, the repercussions are localized to a handful of objects.</p>

<p>The Challengers were an instrumental surf rock band in the 1960s, located in Los Angeles. They started early in the game and helped make the genre popular. Their debut album <i>Surfbeat</i> is the biggest sellign surf album of all-time and almost single-handedly brought surf from California to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The band was formed out of the ashes of The Bel-Airs. The Bel-Airs were just high schoolers at the time (the bassist was in 8th Grade), but had a hit with "Mr. Moto." Their potential was cited by many, but parental intervention led to their breakup.</p>
<p>Soon afterward, Bel-Airs drummer Rick Delvy (b. Richard Delvechio) decided to form a new band. He brought other Bel-Airs members Jim Roberts (keyboards) and Randy Nauert (bass guitar) in and they became the Challengers. For guitar, Glenn Grey was brought in for lead and Don Landis for rhythm. They played at high school and local dances and such, and eventually got earned enough pay to rent a jazz studio to record. Nick Hefner had just joined on saxophone; he plays on only one track. In about three and a half hours, they had an album. Surfbeat was released in January of 1963 and quickly went up the charts. Just months earlier, The Beach Boys' and Dick Dale's collective debuts had ben released. The surf culture was becoming a national phenomenon and The Challengers helped put it in full gear. The album contained songs that were early influences on surf rock, including numbers by The Fireballs and Daune Eddy.</p>
<p>The Challengers moved on and continued to record albums. During the recording of <i>On The Move</i>, Hefner, Grey and Landis all left the band. Hefner was replaced by Phil Pruden, while Art Fisher and Eddie Fournier filled in the guitar spot. In 1964, they released the album <i>K-39</i>. The title track became a big hit and is their best-known song. The group continued their career, recording several albums a year, shocking by todays "one album every two years" pattern. They also had their own TV show, <i>Surf's Up</i>. LA cartoonist Rick Griffin, who later designed posters for groups during the psychedelic period, drew several cartoons for the band featured on the LP sleeves.</p>
<p>In 1965, as music changed, so did The Challengers. They began recording more pop-oriented music, like an instrumental version "Kicks" by Paul Revere &amp; The Raiders. By 1966, they had gone the way of all other surf bands, into history. A 1970 release of the band was titled, fittingly <i>Where Were You In The Summer Of '62</i>.</p>

<dd>I disagree with this move and would like to discuss the reversion back to three separate pages on the grounds that each tournament combined into the page is a separate tournament that only shares the name "X Cup" in it... <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContagiousTruth_ff41.html" title="User:ContagiousTruth">Clint</a> 06:27, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dare To Believe is a surreal <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy.html" title="Comedy">comedy</a> television programme that was shown on <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV1_cc0b.html" title="ITV1">ITV1</a> in the UK. The programme was shown during the early hours of Sunday mornings for much of 2003, and ran for two series. It had the motto "Fly like a mouse, run like a cushion: be the small bookcase!", which was repeated in a hypnotic voice at the beginning of each programme. The show gained a cult following amongst students and insomniacs with it's unusual humour.</p>
<p>It was written &amp; directed by Tim Scott, who also acted in the show.</p>
<p>Popular characters included The Aguamoose Man, the Twarb Coffee Woman and a lady who presented a weather style mini-programme that gave warnings on the size of elks to be expected in various parts of the UK that evening. Another bizarre yet memorable sketch that reoccured throughout the series was various multicoloured screens containing an object, for example a spoon, whilst a man and woman's voice alternated saying "What's this?" and then what the object was, occasionally replacing the name of the object with a random phrase, for example "Osprey Housing".</p>
