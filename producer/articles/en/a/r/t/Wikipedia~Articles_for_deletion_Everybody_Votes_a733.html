<dd>I was asked to reconsider my&#160;!vote, in consideration of recent article development. I do agree that the basis for this AfD seems to no longer apply, however, I still fail to see the notability of the subject. Since I am unfamiliar with computer games, game consoles and the associated culture, I am choosing to abstain from&#160;!voting on this one. Please disregard my whole participation in this debate.

<li>Protected redirects are used when one or more editor(s) believes it should be an article and keeps changing a redirect into a full article on the subject.

<li>That's kind of the point, there's no reason to assume that there's going to be an entire article's worth of information yet. At the moment the article is stubbly. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 13:25, 14 February 2007 (UTC)]</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - It seems that somebody's removed the deletion notice. However, they've also added some significant content to the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>: There is going to be more info. I have just added a Results part which is going to tell the winning votes in a poll.<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPendo_4_d0b6.html" title="User:Pendo 4">Pendo 4</a> 20:51, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect and Protect</b> as the nominator. The results section is just cruft. Remove all the other cruft and the instuctions on how to use the channel (which is not allowed) and you have info that can be (and already is) covered at Wii Channels. Also, this is a discussion and not a vote. So votes like Purplepurplepurple won't carry much (if any) weight when deciding what to do with this. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 22:44, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If all the Wii Channels simply have all their information on the Wii Channels page, then eventually that page will be crowded and hard to read and manage, very un encycolpedic (if that's a word). Also, information will have to be limited due to space constraints, and this will result in poor quality information. All in all, every Wii Channel that has some significance (Minus Virtual Console channels and built in wii channels, and any trivial channels) deserves it's own article, as this is the mission of wikipedia, to be a global knowledge repository, to provide the masses with an easy to use, and reliable encyclopedia, to give the gift of information, even on something so trivial as a ballot. That's my take anyways. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif902_387c.html" title="User:Leif902">Leif902</a> 23:16, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Another short comment (Sorry)... If This article deserves to remain undeleted, then the <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everybody_Votes_6640.html" title="Everybody Votes">Everybody Votes</a> article surely does, just give it stub status and people will respond and fix it up. Already it's been given references, etc. This discussion is rather out of date.

<li>It doesn't deserve an article, and that's why I just prodded it. Also ,the "so and so article exists, so this one should too" argument doesn't work on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 23:31, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'd actually like to vote "postpone the AFD for 2 weeks", but Keep means the same thing. Deletion is always very drastic. Let's see how it evolves, then vote again. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 01:05, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>So you are forfeiting your vote? Because you have not given a reason for your keep vote (so your vote probably won't be counted). Also, I am proposing to turn it into a redirect, not deletion. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 01:20, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>My my my, aren't we aggressive today?&#160;:-) What I'm saying: 1 day after something has come out, the implications on society, life, gaming history and the legacy of the Wii cannot be seriously addressed, and therefore it is too early to give a definite answer whether to delete or keep the article. Since I do not wish for somebody to create the article again in a few weeks when we can address this question more clearly, I want to preserve the article now. And since we cannot foster a proper article by killing it prematurely, my vote here is keep. Cheers. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 11:22, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge. Protect if neccesary.</b> I really would like to say keep, but I don't see how this couldn't be covered in a paragraph or two in the <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_Channels_ef15.html" title="Wii Channels">Wii Channels</a> article. Also, its just simple opinion polls. If they had some serious voting, like on characters to add to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Brother_Brawl_ce66.html" title="Super Smash Brother Brawl">Super Smash Brother Brawl</a> or anything else that could affect future development, then it would probably warrant its own article. And I don't see how it would start cluttering the main channel's article. We do have something known as a table of contents with jump-to-here links. -<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwilightPhoenix_556d.html" title="User:TwilightPhoenix">TwilightPhoenix</a> 04:30, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Just look at the article, damnit. There's nothing wrong with it at all. Deleting it because 'it could also just be written in one paragraph on the Wii Channels page' is dumb. We could also just write one paragraph of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Channel_6f14.html" title="Internet Channel">Internet Channel</a> on the Wii Channels page, and delete that article. Why don't we? Because Wikipedia is meant to provide information. Why can't Wikipedia provide more than just one paragraph of information on the Everybody Votes channel? <a href="../../../v/d/z/User%7EVDZ_2dcf.html" title="User:VDZ">VDZ</a> 11:52, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Internet Channel has potential to be expanded since the current version is a trial and its very likely many more features, and thus more information, when the final product is released. This channel is pretty much in its final form and, unless we start listing polls or something significant is polled, very little, if any, more information will become available. Most of the information not found in the <a href="../../../w/i/i/Wii_Channels_ef15.html" title="Wii Channels">Wii Channels</a> article is about how to use the channel. The two or three lines could easy be merged to the Wii Channels article. If any of the articless channels deserve one, it would be the Mii channel in my opinion. -<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwilightPhoenix_556d.html" title="User:TwilightPhoenix">TwilightPhoenix</a> 19:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems that this article was nominated for deletion far too quickly! Good information on the page and a worthwhile expansion of the Wii Channels article. <a href="../../../x/e/v/User%7EXevious_21d0.html" title="User:Xevious">Tim</a> 16:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>My opinion may not carry much weight since I just registered, but there doesn't seem to be enough to warrant an article yet. The Wii Channels page seems to say all that is needed about the channel. <a href="../../../l/r/r/User%7ELrrr_IV_0800.html" title="User:Lrrr IV">Lrrr IV</a> 07:45, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: This provides information, and will quickly become a very good article. I think maybe every Official Nintendo channel (excluding the default channels such as the News and Weather and Photo channels) merits its own article just as every individual piece of software in a series merits its own article. You wouldn't just make one article for every game in the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend_of_Zelda_2f46.html" title="Legend of Zelda">Legend of Zelda</a> series would you? No. So don't just make one article for all of the Wii Channels. They are individual items, and information on them will be needed and easier to find if they have their own articles. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif902_387c.html" title="User:Leif902">Leif902</a> 22:19, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Haha. I guess this page <i>did</i> kick off! This is what I was talking about when I said more information would be added! I now think this article has enough info to have its own page. Oh, and for the interested (and if you didn't realize it), I wasn't entirely serious about all my revisions last night (Check my userpage for proof). Late night boredom is a terrible thing. I am glad to see the page got more information, though! <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_HP_c829.html" title="User:Steve HP">Steve HP</a> 00:37, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: This is my third time that I say to keep and I am continuing. This boat load info is to big to not be an article. Even though it started small it grew massive.65.10.162.29 02:40, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I read the arguement against it and none are legimet. For example "not every channel needs its own article" this is true, they don't NEED an article but WHY would it hurt to have one. I think it would increase the amount of information o wikipedia and therefor be helpful. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenubag_bfe0.html" title="User:Penubag">Penubag</a> 08:05, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So far there has not been any reason why this article should exist.

<li><b>Keep</b> : Sure, the article may be limited in information, and I suppose it could be merged with another article...however, there are no articles I can think of that would be a good merging-platform other than the Wii Channels Article. If you must move it, merge it there. Otherwise, let it grow. Introbulus 15:10, 17 February 2007 (EST)</li>
