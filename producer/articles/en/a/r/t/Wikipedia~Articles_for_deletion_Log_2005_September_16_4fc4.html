<li>770 hits is nothing for an <i>internet</i> <i>phenomenon</i>. Plus, like I said more than half of them are repetitive. Note that this applies particularly to things with fewer than 1000 hits in the first place: Google reports unique hits in the first thousand, so Wikipedia starts out with millions, but appear to finish up with a few hundred. This is because Google isn't checking through the other 113 million. If a topic starts out with fewer than 1000, then the unique search finds them all. This has 320 useful Googles, and that is nowhere close to what an <i>internet</i> phenomenon should have. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 13:05, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>You are correct, it is only 320 hits. My mistake! However, since it is surviving the test of time, and has (slightly) more merit than most nonsense sites, I'd rather keep it.

<li>To say it's surviving the test of time is a bit of a misnomer I think, the only thing it's done to "survive" is not get AfD'd again until now. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Ëvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 15:59, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, a whole TV season is even more notable than a single episode. "There is no reason why there shouldn't be a page for every Simpsons character, and even a table listing every episode, all neatly cross-linked and introduced by a shorter central page.

<p>FROM V. Molotov to user GADUGI:</p>
<p>Concerning Jeff Merkey</p>
<p>You have no right to post disgusting lies about me. I have never contacted you personally until now...but you need to know that your articles on Jeff Merkey and Cherokee_same_sex_in_history are not notable and you have caused a terrible Wiki Editor wars due to your selfishness. If you continue to lie I can only promise dire consequences And yes, I said your article was Bullcrap...only after YOU refused to give in to that article. DO NOT LIE ON ME AGAIN. I DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT LITTE VENDETTA YOU HAVE AGAINST ME. STOP NOW OR I WILL REALLY GET ANGRY I WANT TO SEE WHATEVER DOCUMENT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT CONCERNING ME "CUSSING YOU OUT." I DON'T LIKE YOU. PRETTY SOON I WILL START HATING YOU IF YOU KEEP THIS CRAP UP. Molotov (talk) 01:36, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comment: I'll wait to see what happnes with the article. This is not a speedy, since being Britney's baby is an obvious *claim* of notability. Also, it's against the rules to put a re-direct in the midst of an AFD. Finally <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9358081/" class="external text" title="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9358081/" rel="nofollow">msnb</a> is reporting "The couple has chosen Sean Preston as the name for their new son". So, that's slightly more than speculation.

<li>Wikiproject Numbers says "the careless creation of number article stubs is to be avoided." If this isn't a carelessly created number stub, I don't know what it is. The guideline is that <i>before</i> creating an article, "you ought to know at least three interesting properties of a number. (What constitutes interesting can be debated..." The current examples are strained. I don't believe for a minute anyone "knew" at three interesting properties of the number before the stub was created; they've been inventively added after the fact by another editor. If you had asked that editor a week ago to name an interesting fraction, I doubt that he or she would have said "Five-eighths." Now that they've been concocted, it's still very "debatable" whether these are "interesting properties."</li>
<li>None of the examples given (approximately equal to kilometers/mile; Unicode code point; spanner size) is a property <i>of the number</i> at all. These are <i>examples of use</i> of the number, not <i>properties of</i> the number.</li>
<li>The approximation of kilometers/mile is hardly interesting. It is not surprisingly <i>close</i> approximation in the way that 355/113 is a surprisingly ckise approximation for pi. If approximations to kilometers per mile are interesting, should also have articles for 31/50, 621/1000, 6133/10000, 61337/100000? The fact that it is a spanner size and that it has a Unicode code point are better documented in list form in the appropriate articles, if they are not already. No change in vote. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:48, 21 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On the contrary, the approximation of kilometers per mile is a "surprisingly close" approximation in <i>exactly</i> the same way that 355/113 is a surprisingly close approximation for pi. 355/113 is a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuant.html" title="Continuant">continuant</a> of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continued_fraction.html" title="Continued fraction">continued fraction</a> expansion of pi, and as such, it is the best possible approximation without using a fraction with a larger denominator. In the U.S., one mile is defined by law to be exactly 15625/25146 kilometers, and 5/8 is indeed the fourth continuant of this number.

<ul>
<li>Sorry, I was mistaken. There is an important sense in which 355/113 is a "surprisingly close" rational approximation to pi that is not shared by 5/8. The next term in the continued fraction expansion of pi is 292, which is unusually large; it's this that accounts for the fact that the next-most-accurate approximation for pi has a six-digit denominator. For 15625/25146, the next term is 1, which isn't unusually large, and so the next best approximation is 8/13.

<p>I move for a <b>deletion</b>, this is a poorly editted plea aiming to promote the plight of the Falun Gong. Wikipedia is NOT a forum for propaganda! If you notice the article is about a specific location of an PRC organization. Why is a specific police station on a specific street within the city of Shijiazhuang is beyond me. The author is trying way too hard to disguise this stub as a legitimate article. The article has no significance whatsoever, it tells nothing except for the names of two police stations! Again, this is tragic if this is verifiable but Wikipedia at this point should not be used as a forum for venting out propaganda. I did some checking, apparently the author, <a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarcelles_eb7c.html" title="User talk:Sarcelles">User_talk:Sarcelles</a> has had a history of using publishing pro Falun Gong propaganda disguised as poorly editted stubs. Please refer to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Chinese_cities_da9a.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Chinese cities">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Chinese cities</a>, where he was warned for putting up over 100 poorly editted on Chinese stubs which told nothing about the cities but rather about the plight of the Falun Gong. Topics like this can be discussed on the proper forums but NOT Wikipedia, for this same reason mentioned earlier, Wikipedia is NOT a means of publishing propaganda, that is NOT the purpose of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../1/2/9/User%7E129.2.237.44.html" title="User:129.2.237.44">129.2.237.44</a></p>

<li>I think it has to do with the "unique" factor. Sure elementary schools are important to early development, but they are also a dime a dozen. Most elementary schools don't have anything that makes them special or worthy of an entry.

<li>After a great deal of researching, I have come to the conclusion that this school does not exist, and the article is a hoax perpetrated by Gateman.

<li>His mission is accomplished, if the school doesn't exist. Are we certain this isn't confused with a school of this name in Oxnard? I assume from reading the link that Clovis is somewhere in Northern California, whereas Oxnard is near Simi Valley. A quick google search shows this school in Oxnard. In any case hoax postings do not make elementary schools any less notable. The nominator claims to have visited the school in question (perhaps a sock/meat puppet of Gateman) but I am <b>perpetually</b> reminded to assume good faith.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 08:54, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>NOTE</b> - This AFD was conducted for the fictional (HOAX) school titled Oceanview Elementary School, Clovis, California.

Although, I see no great harm if it is deleted now, since a new stub can quickly be re-created, and will be. The creator of the hoax article changed the article title, to that of a real school, and edited the article, to put real info, just before the AFD closes, so that a real (not hoax) school is deleted.

<li>You had a perfectly good chance earlier to claim that. Days ago, you were told there was proof the school didn't exist, and you didn't respond (while you were busy trying to delete other schools). It was obvious people were deleting, including me, because it wasn't real. Read the reasons for the last delete votes. Now, you suddenly come and claim it was a mistake only *after* I cited the hoax example in other AFDs. After AFDing countless elem schools, we're to beleive you suddenly voted to keep an unverified elmentary school. You even said "If it lacks a website I consider that more reason to keep in this case.", but suddenly, at the last minute, you find the web site for the school you meant. Others found the same web site, and rightly assumed it didn't apply. Plus, you changed more than just the title, you also changed other information at the same-time, to fit the real school. Anyway, everybody just needs look at the history of the article creation, information *originally* put in, edit comments, comments in AFD, and they can all make their own decision. It's pretty obvious. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 03:17, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I guess it's nice to have a scapegoat, but Schoolwatch is now basically defunct, owing to Tony's conviction that school articles are now being created and surviving the AfD process at such an incredible rate, that even mass deletions will not stop the organic growth of school articles (even primary schools). Frankly, the numbers show he is right - even deletionists will be forced to bend to inevitability. In any event, how can Schoolwatch possibly be to "blame"? Simply because Tony kept track of VfD and AfD for school articles? Schoolwatch isn't the only place that is done, and it isn't as though it is a serious challenge to simply read the daily AfD nominations in order to see which schools have been nominated today. Schoolwatch hardly constituted anything other than a summary of nominations - not some organized secret society to stop AfDs against schools.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 08:08, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I strongly disagree with Gene's comments. Notability is precisely what we have encyclopedias for. Without some form of notability/significance test, encyclopedias degenerate into directories. I think of an encyclopedia as "all the stuff that a well-educated person would be familiar with, had he but the time to learn it". Put it another way: Wikipedia should supply you with all the information that a good and learned friend would. You don't expect your good and learned friend to know all the complex details of every subject - for that you go to a university professor - nor do you expect him to be familiar with every school in the world. But you do expect your friend to have heard of schools whose contribution is above average in some way. So Wikipedia should have articles on ( for example ) Groton, Columbine, Eton College in England, and so on, but not on schools ( however worthy ) that don't stand out.

<li>The ability to Google Jesus TM certainly does not indicate the relevance of a film, as my attempt to google it brought about 2 million hits back. It is obviously difficult to discern the importance or lack thereof of the lesser-known entries, but I think this article should be kept. In the outline for wiki articles, the criteria lists that artists who have sold 5000 cds or more are included, as are people who have written articles read by 5000 or more. Jesus TM, though difficult to google, is certainly a relatively well-known film, and has been seen by more than five thousand people. Likewise Sabrevision. <b>Keep</b>; . Muract 4:01, 19 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You clearly have a vested interest in the article. "Jesus TM" brings up about 2,500 hits, <b>not</b> 2 million, and I was unable to find a <b>single</b> hit about a film with Joshua Hellyer in it -- everything I found was either an irrelevant book title in which Jesus was the final word before the trademark symbol, or a joking reference to corporate trademarking of religion. Likewise "SabreVision", which mainly brings up references to an airline reservation system; I could not find <b>one single solitary hit</b> for a television show hosted by Joshua Hellyer. Proof by "because I said so" is not valid; you need to provide sources to back up your claims. Also, I note that this was your first-<i>ever</i> edit to Wikipedia under this user name; you need to be aware that such votes are normally disregarded. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:17, 19 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wasn't aware that making an informed comment on a topic on which I am knowledgeable is against Wikipedia policy. You may therefore disregard my vote if you would like. The two million number is searching for Jesus TM without quotes. The reason for this is because the actual title of the film has the trademark in superscript beside the Jesus, and therefore the film could appear under many variations of the name (the film is a satiric view of the media). I think we could agree that Jesus is a word that appears somewhat often on the world wide web. The ability to not find the correct Jesus TM in two million hits seems a poor excuse for deletion. I came across this site while googling Joshua Hellyer, whom I know. I have also seen Jesus TM. The indie film world, especially the short film world, is a world where "because I said so" is often as good as you can get. Short of providing pictures of the many screenings of the film, there's little way to back my claims, but this is the case with most short films that haven't won academy awards. I don't believe that because of this unfortunate reality successful short films, or the actors who appear in them, should be destined for obscurity. Muract 19:17, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, well, unfortunately, the bottom line on Wikipedia is <i>verifiability</i> of information, meaning that the inability to find an independent reference about the film <i>is</i> a reason for deletion. So far, this article has no verifiable details whatsoever. Googling Joshua Hellyer's name brings up a grand total of 13 hits: five that are either Wikipedia pages or mirrors of Wikipedia pages, two for an American university student, and five for a completely unrelated Joshua Hellyer who lived in <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> over 200 years ago. I can find exactly <i>one</i> web page referring to this Joshua Hellyer appearing in a film, and that film isn't even <i>Jesus TM</i>. In a nutshell: the onus is on <i>you</i> to provide proof of his notability, <i>not</i> on anyone to provide proof of the obverse. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:58, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

This is a page from a speech that the director, Jordan Hellyer, did, which mentions Jesus TM: <a href="http://www.rocknreelfestival.ca/indiefilmseminar.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.rocknreelfestival.ca/indiefilmseminar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rocknreelfestival.ca/indiefilmseminar.htm</a>. I know that articles about the film appeared in a few other newspapers, which I haven't been able to locate online. Because something is difficult to locate in the digital arena doesn't mean it should be earmarked for deletion. The onus shouldn't be on me to provide proof of it's notability, because it's implicit in the article existing in the first place. Wikipedia isn't a talent contest, it's an encylopedia for things that people might be interested in knowing. Joshua might get deleted because his accomplishments are not famous, but I could randomly search for any combination of names on Wikipedia and find people that I've never heard of. I don't try and have those people deleted because I cannot verify their accomplishments. The hit that you mentioned for a new film that Joshua is in would re-enforce my argument. Regardless of the descision made about this article, I wanted the perspective of someone who is knowledgable about the topic to be heard. Muract 00:32, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am at a loss with what to do with these kind of articles. Nobody with an academic background in archaeology has read these books and so there are no peer-reviewed journal articles stating why this man is wrong. I have looked. This is because no archaeologists take the man seriously. NPOVing this necessitates having a deeper knowledge of the subject than any current wikipedian I have encountered.

<li><b>EXPANDED</b> to explain significance somewhat, applying "sofixit" to myself. Still needs fleshing out, but less stubby and much less no-assertion-of-notability than before. The company's article still needs fleshing out. For a good historical source, search <i>Stock Car Racing Magazine</i> back articles from the 1980s for this name. I remember at least one article that was part company description and part bio of Vic Sr. and Vic Jr. If that magazine's archives aren't online, a good knowledgable source would be Dr. Dick Berggren, who was editor-in-chief for <i>SCR</i> then and publishes <i>Speedway Illustrated</i> now. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 04:49, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi all i have now put up the full text i was trying to when (i think) you first saw it as a very short piece. hopefully it's somewhat better now. This is the first article i've started here so if it still does not meet your requirements i would appreciate some feedback as to why. thanks --<a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.92.67.74.html" title="User:195.92.67.74">195.92.67.74</a> 15:07, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. allmusic has a decent bio on them. Maybe the article was in bad shape, but the subject appears to be notable. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:31, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>In response to Kertrats - i think the band does meet the requirements for notability; they have toured, they have released 2 full length albums. 1 of these was released on Jive Electro and extremely well known (in electronic music circles) label that is also home to Groove Armada and has released records by Tribe Called Quest and Stone Roses. The electro scene is a small one - i don't think that the popularity of a genre should dictate if it can or can't be included on Wikipedia. - thanks --MJW 15:38, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Doesn't meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> "2 full length albums" criteria that they must both be on a major label or a prominent indie label - Only 1 of their albums meet this criteria. However, If I'm not mistakent DGP did embark on a world tour and play extensively in Europe, which would satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Ok I'll have one last try to convince you all. This is the first article i have written, yes it could do with being better written but i thought part the aim here was to write what you can when you can and then come back and expand on it later - I do think i have recorded some note worthy facts in the article. As regards how notable they are, i think it needs to be kept in mind that electro is not a large genre and that the importance of an act should not be based on how many records they sell. There are loads of entries on Wikipedia for british 70's punk bands that only ever released a handfull of singles and one album on small lables but they are still notable as is an electro act such as DGP who are well known within their genre. Down to specifics both their albums are on well known lables, Poker Flat is a well known european independent label run by Steve Bug, they have been going for over 7 years and have released over 70 odd records. regarding touring and mentions in the press you may like to look here <a href="http://www.electronicpm.co.uk/epm__djs_performers.php?artist_pick=detroit_grand_pubahs" class="external text" title="http://www.electronicpm.co.uk/epm__djs_performers.php?artist_pick=detroit_grand_pubahs" rel="nofollow">Electroinc PM</a> who are their booking agent in Europe, also of note on this page is the following line "Since then, he / they've been mentioned in URB's next 100, Rolling Stone's 'Top Ten To Watch In 2001,' scored a pop hit in a number of countries and an underground classic worldwide." - thats the end of the 3rd paragraph. Lastly thier big hit "Sandwiches" has been relased on loads of different compilations world wide some of these comps have been released on major labels such as BMG, EMI and Universal check here <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Detroit+Grand+Pubahs" class="external text" title="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Detroit+Grand+Pubahs" rel="nofollow">Discogs</a> for details. Obviously i would like to add this new info to my article but i'll wait and see if it gets to stay first. Thanks for reading --MJW 11:29, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I placed a speedy tag on this, but someone removed it on the grounds that "0 google hits does not a speedy make - notability is asserted in the article (aren't broadcasters notable?). This isn't blatant advertising, either. It does desperately need verification though.".</p>
<p>While I see the reasoning, the article looks like an attempt to get listeners to his show. Also the only important links in this article (the radio stations on which he has worked) are red, something which doesn't help him in this case.

<li><b>Delete</b> but <b>don't speedy</b>. I undeleted this after it was speedied before, because it doesn't seem to me that it meets the criteria for speedy deleteion - it does, after all, assert the notability of its subject. Whether the subject is in fact notable is a topic which deserves discussion, and an AfD discussion is one way to do that.

<li>This is not strictly true. Imagine an article on X that said "X was a Prime Minister of Canada." No other info. Lets say you have no quick way of determining whether it is true or false (google not working). Will you put a speedy tag on it? Some professions are of sufficient importance and historical significance such that even the mere act of saying he was a member of the "prime-ministerial profession of Canada," if you will, is sufficient <i>assertion</i> of notability that A7 cannot apply. Likewise for, say, astronauts. But most professions do not have that characteristic. "X is an accountant", ...doctor, ...scientist, ...lawyer, ...porn actress — these all do not constitute assertions of notability. (It does not mean they can't have articles, but it does mean they must have done or become notable in some way that enough was written about them to satisfy WP:V, WP:N, WP:NOR, WP:RS).

<li>I disagree. Being the prime minister, president, etc isn't a profession, it's a position within the larger profession of politics . Though obviously, prime ministers are notable, the consensus is very strong that simply belonging to a profession isn't a claim of notability. Even the in classic notable profession, astronaut, this holds true: astronauts aren't notable just for putting on a space suit and being associated with a space program, they're notable for what they do: i.e. going into space. In other words, notability is not being part of a profession, but accomplishments within that profession. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:11, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Only well-established and existing things and notions described in reputable sources are allowed. The reason is simple: wikipedia does not have means for <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a> to distingusih crap fromm solid info and relies only on data published in proven sources.

<li>It's not the fact that this is not a "Hollywood" movie that makes it decidedly not notable; it's the fact that the only information available about it on the web is from the website I've listed, where they are trying to market the film. The awards they cite are extremely minor and many are misnamed or were awarded to the broadcaster of this film (HBO) and not the film itself. Notability is purely a judgement call, but based on the research I've done into Mr. Farrell and his film, there is simply not enough to make qualify him as a person of note. Making a documentary that aired on HBO a few times in the mid 90's before fading into obscurity is not enough in my book to establish one's notability.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 04:00, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

The fact that people want information about her makes her a noteworthy entry, in my view.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: there's no reason not to have an article on Didi Hill, not when we have articles on every other main character on the show.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Honestly, this is not the way to resolve content disputes on Wikipedia. If you feel strongly that your rumor should be in the article, then take it up on the article's Talk page. Abusing the AfD system this way does nothing to further your cause.</dd>

<li>Wiki articles are editable and removing fringe rumours is perfectly fine. It's not denial of information, it's denial of baseless accusations.

<li>Interesting criticism. However, I would like to know what is wrong with it. I do not know much at all about Benedict Arnold, but I tried to make the information fit.

<li>If you think length is the only factor important to article quality, you have much to learn. If that is not your thought, your argument is a presumptive attempt to build a straw man.

<li>As I said, it <i>can</i> be merged (and has been, and I even fixed it up), but I find this article useful to retain info after the BA V article gets edited.

<li><b>Comment</b> Ah. I didn't know about the other articles like this when I nominated this one for deletion. Guess I should have scrolled down to see the categories before I jumped to conclusions. Definitely a breach on my part. I still don't agree that an article that's just a huge list of where an airline flies to is encyclopedic, but if it's being accepted elsewhere then this airline shouldn't be treated any differently.

<li><b>Comment</b> That's my inclination, too. Anyone who needs to know because they're planning a trip should go to the airline's own website, or contact a travel agent. The only reason I can think of for keeping it is if it was a compromise to keep loooong lists like this off the main article page for each airline, and only then if it was done so larger airlines wouldn't be penalized, in effect, for serving too wide an area, whereas smaller ones could easily fit their handful of destinations in their main article without making it too long. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 21:14, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Phil argues that many of the people are not noteworthy. I actually see that as a reason why this page should exist: the people are not noteworthy, but their arrests are. For example, Thomas McCosker isn't very noteworthy, but his former jail sentence for sodomy most definitely should be. If Phil's proposal were accepted, then we'd only be able to post an entry about Thomas McCosker, rather than writing an entry in this page about his arrest.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The issue of Australians on overseas prisons is frequently and prominently in the news - how they are treated, what our governement is doing about repatriating them, why they were there.

<li><b>Keep</b> in a form similar to what it was before 8 September. Arrest/conviction of citizens on foreign territory is notable as a group, but each individual person or case may not be. The same would apply for lists of foreigners imprisoned in a country. (same people divided into different lists). Looking at this list it appears that Australians lack self-control with respect to drugs overseas. I don't know if that's a valid interpretation, or a systemic bias in creating the list.

The original article was solely about presentism (philosophy of time) and someone introduced a short section on presentism (literary and historical analysis) for the purposes of disambiguation. A subsequent reader edited the discussion page asking why St Augustine was relevant to historical interpretation. (ie: both types of presentism are so complex that readers can fail to distinguish between them if they are mentioned together).This means that at least two readers have searched Wikipedia for presentism (literary and historical analysis) and felt sufficiently strongly to edit the text or pass comment. Given that people are looking for presentism (literary and historical analysis) on Wikipedia I would vote to keep. loxley 08:40, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Article Author <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradspry_ec22.html" title="User:Bradspry">User:Bradspry</a>. A research class campus is the highest order of campuses.

All three of these have separate articles on Wikipedia.
<ul>
<li>Huh? All the examples you've given are of separate universities that have been around for quite some time. This is just a rather large business complex that hasn't even been built yet and without any sign of being associated with any established university. From what I can tell from the article, it just looks like a rather ordinary office and retail development with some laboratory space for private research companies. Has construction even started? Do they have funding for it? Is there a date for when it's supposed to be completed? / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 12:23, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>"Read the references"? You're the one who wants it to be an article. Note these things in the article if you want to convince anyone. I don't do people's AfD-homework for them. Now here's the beef:
<ul>
<li>It's not built. I would never vote to keep an article on a fairly non-notable construction project of a rather non-notable business complex <i>that hasn't even been built</i>. In this case, construction won't start 'til sometime near Christmas and won't be done for five years. There are thousands of these kinds of construction projects all over the world and I don't want to see all of them turned into articles.
<ul>
<li><b>Non-notable is your opinion, from your obscured view through the ether. This is the largest event in the history of my city.

Demolition of the Cannon Mills buildings, where the campus will be located, has been underway for a year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That it's <i>partnering</i> with a few universities doesn't equal it to a university. This is very obviously not even to be considered a campus; they've just <i>named</i> it that way to make it seem more educational than it really is. It's still just a commercial project like many others and I don't know why you're trying to compare this to established universities. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 08:55, 19 September 2005 (UTC)
