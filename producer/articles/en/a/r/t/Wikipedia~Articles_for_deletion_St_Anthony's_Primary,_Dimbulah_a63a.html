So have a short section on this primary school (and Dimbulah State School, founded in 1914) in here. I'd also like to point out that it appears this article doesn't even have the name right - it's St Anthony's School, not St Anthony's Primary. <a href="http://education.qld.gov.au/corporate/professional_exchange/edhistory/celebrations/dates/s.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://education.qld.gov.au/corporate/professional_exchange/edhistory/celebrations/dates/s.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<ul>
<li>Don't you mean no demonstration of notablity? Something doesn't have to demonstrate non-notability but does have to demonstrate notablity. But that's neither here nor there as notability was not the basis of the AfD.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 22:57, 14 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I meant exactly what I said. "Something" (as you put it) does <b>NOT</b> have to demonstrate notability. As per Wikipedia <b>Policy</b> at <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a>, Lack of Notability is not a listed criteria for deletion, nor is being obscure, nor is being "unimportant". Your AfD does have notability as a basis, as per your statement above: "no notable alumni or events". Non-notability of this school has not been established in any event (even if this were a valid criteria). Also I do not see you replying to other votes which state "no demonstration of notability" as a comment for their "delete" vote that "notability was not the basis of the AfD". --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 05:21, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Re: non-notability, regardless of whether the subject is notable or not, the article should attempt to establish notability, which this does not (unless one considers all schools inherently notable, which is obviously not agreed upon). This might be considered a vanity article, and would be deletable on those grounds (this is obviously my preference). Or one could say it is "Such a minor branch of a subject that it doesn't deserve an article" in which case we could "merge the useful content into a more comprehensive article and redirect." If we were to merge and redirect into <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimbulah.html" title="Dimbulah">Dimbulah</a>, consider how little content there is to merge. (Average Earthman noted that there is more info on the school in the Dimbulah article than there is in this stub.) <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmadler_e33e.html" title="User:Cmadler">Cmadler</a> 12:33, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for re-phrasing the entire debate about school articles. I disagree that an article should attempt to establish notability - this is not WP Policy - only your own assertion. Given the high number of schools (even primary schools) that survive the AfD process, it is clear that schools may be many things - however "vanity article" is not one of them. The entire ongoing debate exists because there is a disagreement over the premise that <b>schools are inherently notable</b>, in the first place. Simply restating that you do not think schools merit articles by virtue of being schools, is no more productive than my repeating that "schools are inherently notable" on each and every AfD. The point I was making the above response, was simply that "non-notability" is not a valid criteria for deletion as per WP Policy. Like it or not, that is a fact - your opinion that schools should "attempt to establish notability" notwithstanding.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 07:24, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>One could just as easily say "Delete, and stop creating school articles until consensus is reached." Permitting the addition but not the deletion of school articles would, in effect, be a decision in favor of inclusion, and one which would have the further effect of ending this debate (consensus would never be reached). <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmadler_e33e.html" title="User:Cmadler">Cmadler</a> 12:33, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Permitting the creation but not deletion of school articles is effectively what we do now.
