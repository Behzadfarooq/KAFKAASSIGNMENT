<p>I'm a bit new to this so I don't know whether this is the appropriate course of action, but I am listing this for deletion for four reasons. First, I can find no record of this artist at the listed site, which is allegedly the musician's main website. Second, the biography was ripped directly from two sites, songwriter101.com and cdbaby.com. Third, the article addressed the reader and told them to buy the cd and provided the link (I'm not sure but I feel like this is against policy. Fourth and least importantly, the article needed serious wikification if it was indeed a valid entry.--<a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizabeth_of_North_Carolina_7101.html" title="User:Elizabeth of North Carolina">Elizabeth of North Carolina</a> 00:11, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete, maybe merge</b>. This article is little more than a drawn out, pretentiously written dicdef, mixed with some original research. The subject merits a mention in a <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game_player.html" title="Video game player">gaming culture</a> article, but I don't think there's anything here worth using. Actually, I think most of the articles about gaming culture could use an overhaul/rewrite, since they suffer from unsourced original research and social commentary.

<li><b>Keep/Expand</b>, I think the title itself sounds funny and encourages people to think it is a pointless article, using the word "female" instead of "girl" will warrant a more serious look at the implications of the subject. I also think that there could be psychological issues to be looked at which could be very helpful to people.

<li><b>Comment</b> - If this distro was ever publically released it's a clear keep IMHO. But, as a long term Linux user (<i>well over</i> 10 years) I can't say I've ever heard of it.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. To be fair, with so many distros floating around, very few Linux users, experienced or not, will know of all of them. I've been a user of Linux for four years and haven't heard of it. Many are just clones of existing distros. The notability of this distro is questionable, but if it holds true to its security credentials, then I think this would just about pass. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamyskis_2c95.html" title="User:Jamyskis">Jamyskis</a> <font size="-3"><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamyskis_5b40.html" title="User talk:Jamyskis">Whisper</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jamyskis_a771.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jamyskis">Contribs</a></font> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title="Germany"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="Germany" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 19:22, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I am willing to accept that this distro is instructive regarding secure-computing techniques. Not to mention that there is such a proliferation of pages on minor Linux distributions (some possibly defunct as well) that it is unfair to single out this one. However, the article needs a lot of attention: it is haphazard in its choices of what or what not to include and contains about as much opinion as fact. I think that the article, as it stands, is not worth having; therefore if we will keep it, we should rewrite it. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 20:15, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<b>KEEP -- I AM THE ONE WHO NOMINATED THIS.</b> Before doing so I looked up "chair", for comparison. After nomination, someone added quite a bit. Although it is still fairly weak and needs additional reformatting work, my attitude is that the threshold for inclusion should be fairly low and I think it now at least comes up to the level of a legitimate stub.</p>
<p>I agree with ArgentiumOutlaw that this now should be expanded regarding things like Art History and Architecture. What are the oldest known examples of aisles? It should be mentioned that aisles often have signs designating the contents. Are the spaces between shelves in a library sometimes referred to as aisles? In dark places such as movie theaters, the edges of aisles are sometimes marked with rows of small lights. Etc. The wiktionary entry does not address any of those topics, nor should it. Those <i>are</i> proper topics for an encyclopedia article.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Ryan's Premises, as mentioned in the article, is a Canadian heritage site that deserves an article in itself (a future task I plan on tackling). The question is how you can have an article about a prominent and historical business without an article about its founder.

<p>OK, when this article started, I put a "mergeto" header on it, but now, this is getting out of hand. We're supposed to have an article on every single and every album she has ever released, for every chart in the world? To begin with, there is not a single cite for any of this information. For another, this violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, as it's a collection of unencylopedic information.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Jjay. It's very encyclopediec. Plus the page is going to be too long at the end of editing. It does not say "Redio" either. It's new Calton it will be edited better. So now is not a good time to determine. Give it a few weeks it'll look much better. Trust me. Oh yeah, Zoe this artist has had so much chart history she needs this page. Unlike some others. If every group had a page like this it would be scary. How about if the artist has 4 albums they can finally have their own chart page. If they have over 20 charts.<a href="../../../t/c/a/User%7ETcatron565_b125.html" title="User:Tcatron565">Tcatron565</a>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think that some here are saying she is not notable simply because she is not famous. There is a distinction and just because she is not as familiar to the general public as say <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cindy_Crawford_136a.html" title="Cindy Crawford">Cindy Crawford</a>, that does not mean she is less signifigant as a model worthy of an entry on this site. She has appeared in one of the world's formost men's magazines in Maxim, has been featured on many sites such as gorrilamask and ifilm and is certainly worthy of an entry here as she made a bit of a stir on the internet that has lead to her notarieity in many circles (evidenced by the fact that she was asked to pose for a magazine as popular as Maxim). <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriGold_7a2c.html" title="User:AriGold">AriGold</a> 18:30, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Someday maybe we will have notability standards for <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy_sports.html" title="Fantasy sports">fantasy sports</a> leagues. However, there isn't even a category for them now, which leads me to believe there are no other articles and thus they aren't considered notable <i>per se</i>. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 04:31, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Perhaps the HFL can set the bar and create notability for valiant fantasy sports leagues which have years of experience. This article isn't even 1/20 finished, as there is a lot of history of its hosts, Yahoo Fantasy Sports and ESPN.com Fantasy Sports which have yet to be covered in the article. I sincerely hope HFL will be given the opportunity to showcase its league and its hosts to the rest of the fantasy sports world.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I disagree with this article being deleted. While Damariscotta Maine and Newcastle Maine are towns, Damaroscptta Newcastle Maine is a CDP which does not cover the towns, but rather areas without a municipal government. The possibility is that Damariscotta-Newcastle Maine is an area between the two towns? Or perhaps it is just geographically located near both, and the name was decided upon becasue of this.

<li><s><b>Weak keep</b></s> There's a reference to Bisut in <a href="../../../g/a/k/Gakhar.html" title="Gakhar">Gakhar</a> and a few Ghits - so it does look like a real place. Tribes names would often be similar to place names and the Arabic lettering is also correct.

<li><b>Comment</b> the article is about the Bih-sut, "a small tribe of Pakhto-speaking Afghans". There is no evidence for this tribe, even with <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> admirable efforts. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 16:38, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's absolutely correct - I was hoping someone could source it but they haven't. I'm changing my vote to <b>Delete unless sourced</b>. I'd now vote keep an article entitled <b>Bisut</b> about the place but there's so little info available that it's not worth starting. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> 00:19, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I had a go at finding proof, but all I could find were maps that don't show the tribe, and so can't be used to prove or disprove the tribe's existence (since it can be argued that they are not detailed enough to show a small tribe), e.g. <a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/salrc/afghanistan/materials/maps.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/salrc/afghanistan/materials/maps.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_ethnoling_97.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_ethnoling_97.jpg" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 01:10, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

The group has had over 1700 members in the latest iteration of its message boards (which is I believe the third iteration). Its services have provided for tens of thousands of people (see BNLS, which I haven't checked to see if that's been marked too), if not hundreds of thousands, when one considers the wide distribution of <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blizzard_Entertainment_9ad7.html" title="Blizzard Entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a>'s vastly distributed software.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The claim of only "five Google hits" is silly and obviously untrue (probably meant as an exaggeration not to be taken literally). If the Google search is refined to "The Inalienable Right"+"blog" for instance, you can see a far greater number of hits (references to the blog in the search output are relatively easily spotted by all three words being capitalized). Better yet, if you <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=link%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalistjournal.com%2Ffedblog+-site%3Afederalistjournal.com&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=FP-pull-web-t&amp;fl=0&amp;x=wrt" class="external text" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=link%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalistjournal.com%2Ffedblog+-site%3Afederalistjournal.com&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=FP-pull-web-t&amp;fl=0&amp;x=wrt" rel="nofollow">search Yahoo for <tt>"link:http://www.federalistjournal.com/fedblog −site:federalistjournal.com"</tt></a>, you can see about 30,000 incoming links. There are a large number of links from other right-wing bloggers such as Michelle Malkin and Rathergate (not linked from the blogroll, but linked from within individual blog entries). The characterization of this page as self-promotion also seems inaccurate, it appears to be a straightforward description of the blog. We don't delete articles on political grounds just because of their right-wing politics; although this is hardly an "A-list" blog it certainly appears to meet the minimum notability threshold. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 01:20, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Not exactly, no. Yahoo truncates the listing after only 94 entries with the notice "we have omitted some entries very similar to the ones already displayed"; however they seem to do the truncation way too drastically and entirely omit entire sites. Just one example, well-known (notorious?) right-wing blogger Michelle Malkin links to them on at least two occasions: <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/002290.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/002290.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/002753.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/002753.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, but this doesn't show up at all in the above drastically truncated 94 entries. It's not clear why, but if you try an alternative search, <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=linkdomain%3Afederalistjournal.com&amp;prssweb=Search&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=FP-pull-web-t&amp;fl=0&amp;x=wrt" class="external text" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=linkdomain%3Afederalistjournal.com&amp;prssweb=Search&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=FP-pull-web-t&amp;fl=0&amp;x=wrt" rel="nofollow">searching Yahoo for <tt>"linkdomain:federalistjournal.com"</tt></a>, then you can discover many of those omitted incoming links (including the Malkin links). It's hardly surprising that the majority of incoming links come from fellow bloggers of a similar ideological bent, but that's true of pretty much every single blog in existence. Again, this is hardly an A-list blog, but it does seem to meet minimal notability and verifiability criteria and there is no indication of its article being self-promotion. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 02:40, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

It turns out I was editing Tapir's old version: see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FThe_Unalienable_Right&amp;diff=34443326&amp;oldid=34004893" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FThe_Unalienable_Right&amp;diff=34443326&amp;oldid=34004893" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, namely his 18:59 5 January edit, and I obviously missed the "You are editing an out-of-date revision of this page" warning. My apologies, that really sucks. They really ought to make the out-of-date warning a lot more prominent, maybe change the background color or something, it's far too easy to miss. <small><strong>[I have now done just that, see below]</strong></small> Here's what happened: after I noticed Tapir's "MUSHROOMS ARE NOT FUCKING VEGETABLES YOU IGNORANT AMERICANS" edit at <a href="../../../p/i/z/Pizza.html" title="Pizza">Pizza</a> and making an edit there, I checked out <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tapir_a1b4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tapir">his other contributions</a> and found the "war on blogs" contributions. I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Unalienable_Right&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34004893" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Unalienable_Right&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34004893" rel="nofollow">clicked on diff</a> to examine his edit, and then obviously clicked on "edit this page" at the top of the page and missed the "out-of-date" warning. By truly unfortunate coincidence, the last edit prior to mine turned out to be Tapir's second edit (22:19, 8 January 2006) to this page, so when I later clicked on the article history and found an edit by Tapir just before my own, everything appeared exactly as expected. Sorry about that, it was in no way intentional. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 23:53, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't have a good way to answer that. Podcasts are useless without a good aggregator, you see, and so many have sprung up in the podcasting world. This is one of those. Typically podcast writers will work to get their podcast listed on as many different aggregators as they can find. There are some really big ones, like Podcast.net and iTMS, and then the medium-sized ones, like PodNova. I'm just not sure how to vote. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 18:59, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Except one problem. If "Poscast Alley" is notable, where's entries for "Postcast.net", iPodder.org (got deleted/redirected, haha), "podcast bunker" and thousands of other shit sites which do nothing but reindex the same content over and over providing absolutely NOTHING NEW OR INTERESTING. Wikipedia is NOT an index of every damn website in the world. If someone wants podcasts, they can type "PODCAST" in google and find a pile of shit sites dealing with this stuff. The article is trash too, since when is tracking votes by "IP address" has been innovative, or even effective? Proxies anyone? I bet if the GNAA you really love actually decides that the GNFOS podcast is worth being #1 on that site, how long do you think would it take before thousands of "omg, unique IP address" votes will start to come in? Nice try though. --Timecop 09:23, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Disagree with “delete” arguments.</b> I don’t blog, and I don’t use Windows, but I disagree that this software is useless, and I see nothing here that’s blatantly subjective, so I don’t think it constitutes “advertising” any more than does, say, “<a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>.” The only thing that’s missing here is a comparison (or link to a comparison) to like software. For instance, Wikipedia is probably the only hope for a query like “show me a list of blog client software that implements the <a href="../../../m/e/t/MetaWeblog_3681.html" title="MetaWeblog">MetaWeblog</a> protocol.”<br />
To say this is an “advertisement” (in the sense of “marketing”) is tantamount to saying that this was contributed by a W.bloggar insider, is it not? (Don’t confuse “advertising” with an enthusiastic user’s testimonial.) Frankly I consider that a reckless assertion, not (evidently) <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">based on fact</a>.<br />
I don’t have any opinion on W.bloggar’s notability though. —<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFleminra_45b2.html" title="User:Fleminra">Fleminra</a> 19:51, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Freezepop is a very prominent band in the synthpop scene. And anyone who's played a PlayStation 2 game has had to have heard of them by now. They've been around for a while, they done a lot of work... the fact that this article is even up for deletion is, frankly, a little shocking. Freezepop is definitely a notable band. The article really needs to be cleaned up, though - starting by creating separate pages for each CD. --<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPele_Merengue_0fb8.html" title="User:Pele Merengue">Pele Merengue</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Freezepop is a relevant band to many groups of people. Not just am I a big Playstation gamer, but in Boston (where I attend college), Freezepop is absolutely one of the most popular local bands. I must admit that I am biased, as my favorite band is <a href="../../../s/p/l/Splashdown_%28band%29.html" title="Splashdown (band)">Splashdown</a>, but with that said, I don't think there's any reason to not have an article on Freezepop.

<p>Although this article seems to be written in good faith, I cannot find anything on the 'net to <i>directly</i> support this concept. <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoism.html" title="Taoism">Taoism</a> does indeed support a hierarchy of gods, so perhaps this "God of Village" is instead many many separate "Gods of Villages". In any case, unless the article can be cleaned up by someone with more indepth knowledge than I have, I would suggest a delete <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">Madman</a> 16:29, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - If this article is merged with <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoism.html" title="Taoism">Taoism</a> make sure it doesn't land in the Tao chia (or Daojia) section of philosophical Taoism, which has no gods. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Endomion</a> 17:27, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep &amp; cleanup</b>. Most English-language sources on religious Taoism refer to these local deities as a "Land God" or "Earth God." (Look halfway down <a href="http://www.taoarts.com/statuaryearthen.html" class="external text" title="http://www.taoarts.com/statuaryearthen.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> for an example of a statue of a Land God.) They fit into the Taoist hierarchy of dieties above the <a href="../../../z/a/o/Zao_Jun_37e6.html" title="Zao Jun">Kitchen God</a> but below the City God or Town God. Aside from the name-- which may well be a legitimate translation-- there is nothing wacky about the info in the article, though some of it might need sourcing. I agree that it should be cleaned up rather than being merged into the Taoism article. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 04:38, 28 December 2005 (UTC)<br />
--Oh, and it looks like the article originally had an image of "Tudi Gong" or "Tu Di Gong"-- I have no idea what picture was there originally, but it was probably something like [<a href="http://mi-le-fo.thetempleguy.com/figures/tudigong.htm" class="external text" title="http://mi-le-fo.thetempleguy.com/figures/tudigong.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>].

<li><b>Expand</b> List items should not be just links, as wikipedia is not a link farm. However, research items can easily have well formed citations, and they should. As of note, family seperation related links at times may seem like spam, but they are very useful and encylopediac. I suggest to review the links and see if they are spam, like if they lead to an ad-supported site with information that can be found elsewhere without ads. Family law related topics easily get unbalanced from npov because some wikipedians delete non governmental related information, which excludes one party of the two sides of the respective pov. — <a href="../../../d/z/o/User%7EDzonatas_e6e2.html" title="User:Dzonatas"><b><font color="#0000FF">Dz</font><font color="#3F50FF">on</font><font color="#5F80FF">at</font><font color="#77B0FF">as</font></b></a> 14:54, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Compare the top section to the bottom section. The top section should be more like the bottom section. The top section is mainly links as you have nom'd. Your nom is untrue for the bottom section. Either way, it can be expanded further for family law resource. Give more information like when was such report or citation made, the title of such report, why was the report done, and more questions one could ask if the link dissapears. If you still want to delete the article, then move such research back to their original pages. — <a href="../../../d/z/o/User%7EDzonatas_e6e2.html" title="User:Dzonatas"><b><font color="#0000FF">Dz</font><font color="#3F50FF">on</font><font color="#5F80FF">at</font><font color="#77B0FF">as</font></b></a> 01:43, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, "why was the report done" does have some encyclopedic value, but that makes the page sound like a References section in search of an article. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 01:56, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As mentioned at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_family_separation_research_articles_44ae.html" title="Talk:List of family separation research articles">Talk:List of family separation research articles</a>, it was the intention that each article should have a <i>précis</i>, though I don't think much has been done on that front. My feeling is that, whatever people say wikipedia is and is not, links to bona fide research are always useful. If this article appears as a list of references waiting for an article - and the list was originally moved out of an article following someone's comment a while back - then why remove information which could be useful? There are 6 other articles which link to the article, so presumably it acts as a list of references, or related material, for their benefit. It seems a pity to delete this for no particular reason. My other preference would be to move it. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 19:14, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Is the request to delete still valid if I go and change the article to make it different from what it was when the deletionist arrived? That's what I'm doing anyway, changing the list into a series of paragraphs, explaining a bit about each article - though in fact most of the titles are fairly self-explanatory - in the hope that it will invalidate all the other deletionists' votes above, since you wouldn't then be deleting that which had originally been proposed.</b> Down with deletionists!

<dd>This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use. This is the baseline consensus that I feel was reached at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 22:39, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think he's notable because many of the projects he has lead or made significant contributions to — not just Epinions, but the <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyc.html" title="Cyc">Cyc</a> project, and the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resource_Description_Framework_50a1.html" title="Resource Description Framework">Resource Description Framework</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantic_Web_d444.html" title="Semantic Web">Semantic Web</a> — are well-known enough within the computer industry to make him an "industry figure." On the subject of naming, he is often cited in the computer industry press and computer science academia as "R. V. Guha" and is otherwise referred to within the English-language portion of the industry via an "anglicized" name, as in the entry's title. This might be important for discoverability and linkability, though there could always be redirects to his proper or preferred form (whatever it may be). -- cmh 07:22, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Cleanup</b> - As indicated already, how can you question the noteworthiness of the create of RDF the basic foundation of the next generation of the Web. This is quite ironic where you also factor in the role that Wikipedia will ultimately play in the materialization of the Semantic Web vision (Wikipedia will soon become the Semantic / Data Web Poster child). I understand that outlines without the "Stub" notice can be misleading re. encyclopedic pages (I've been burnt by this myself across Wikipedia already), but we cannot have a true encyclopedia without its prime responsibility of knowledge creation and exposure compromised by inadvertent distortions. To remove this entry from Wikipedia is to distort extremely valuable history!

<p>Though this page was deleted back in August, I put it here rather than in speedy because this version is, if nothing else, well developed and goes back to September.

<li><b>Comment</b> If this article were to be merged into <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">Chav</a>, then it would need a rewrite, as it is less than neutral.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If this article were to be cleaned up, it would form an acceptable paragraph on the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">Chav</a> article.

<dd>Because I didn't call <b>you</b> nor antivaxers "Nazis". I never even used the word. I have visited Auschwitz, and I only used that abhorable historical situation as an illustration of why we preserve its history. The history of antivax efforts should be preserved for the same reasons. I could have chosen many other illustrations, but since both follies involve great loss of life, it came to mind.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This may look like complete bollocks in the context of Wikipedia, but in the context of a blurb for a sci-fi novel it makes rather more sense.

<li><b>Comment</b> It would seem to me that the people requesting deletion have little or no clue about the subject they wish deleted, they consider it nonsense even though the article is far from completion. I guess if I would have written the next bit and come here to add it and found my article deleted I would have not been happy at all. All because some people do not have the common to research thier complaint before action. Instead of voting for deletion why not just keep your ideas too yourselves or add relevant information if you have any. Planktune 15:18, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep it!!!</b> According to the Random House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary, an encyclopedia is “a book or set of books containing articles on various topics, usually in alphabetical arrangement, covering all branches of knowledge or, less commonly, all aspects of one subject.” Wikipedia must contain all the encompassing aspects of micronations. As to this subject, not talking about the Holy Empire of Reunion shall be unacceptable, because Reunion is the most famous among the Portuguese speaking micronations. It will be a shame for Wikipedia the deletion of this article.

My opinion is that if it would draw a general consensus of delete, then AfD should be avoided.

<li><b>Keep</b> All four years are now listed. Since the NFL refuses to recognize what went on during these four years of play, it is imperative that a web surfer be able to learn as much about the AAFC as possible. In conjunction with the regular AAFC page, I plan on including not only game summaries, but pages specific to each year, in order to include highlights and pertinent statistics. Deleting this page will only continue the myopia/ignorance about the AAFC. User:Histmaven 12:35, January 6, 2006.

<li><b>Comment</b> In an attempt at compromise, perhaps one page for each year such as "1946 AAFC Season" or "San Francisco 49ers 1946 Season", etc., with an analysis and week-by-week summaries would help quell the complaints. That way, instead of 56 different pages, you would have a limited number of pages. I do think, regardless, that the score page should stay--with no further updates. Feel free to comment.

<p>I question the importance and usefulness of a 38kb list of ships. The US ones at least have pretty obvious names anyway and I think that about 14 of this first section of 1070 links are blue at present. If anyone is interested in these vessels, I find it unlikely that they will search for this list specifically, as they will probably know the number of the vessel they are looking for. As such I am posting this on AfD, whilst myself <b>Abstain</b>ing (I am not an expert on list policies etc. and I'd rather let more experienced persons than myself decide.) <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwilke_d205.html" title="User:Dwilke">Dan</a> 20:14, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> this may be a list for a project, to "fill in" missing articles. If so, it should be kept or at least userfied. I have left a query on the page creators talk page concerning the purpose of this list. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 21:59, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It may be 'obvious' with the USN LSTs, but it certainly is not so with Royal Navy LSTs, and that doesn't even consider LSTs that other nations had which could perfectly well be put on the list. There might be a case for making it a disambig page with links to national LST lists, but certainly not for deleting it completely. The list is structured list so far as I can see so it does not come under WP:NOT in that respect, or in any other respect. AFD is used for those articles that come under the terms of WP:NOT or for those articles that are thought to come under those terms. I cannot see which term of WP:NOT applies to this list. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 22:33, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A ship used to deliver tanks (and other things) to a shore somewhere. Think of the famous Normandy Beach footage of soldiers poring out of those ships onto the beach. The military loves to be heirarchial and precise, so this is really a <i>landing ship, tank</i> which puts the most important noun first, followed by a qualifier. In a rational world, there would also be things like <i>landing ship, artillery</i> and <i>landing ship, troop</i> <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 00:36, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The first three paragraphs make sense, but really need to be rewritten to be more accessible.

<li><b>Rewrite</b> The author really needs to determine the audience for whom the article is to be written. It doesn't look like there is a detailed-enough discussion for theoretical physicists to engage with and there is not enough popular science exposition of the topic for interested amateurs. --&#160;<a href="../../../%28/a/e/User%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User:(aeropagitica)">(aeropagitica)</a>&#160; 23:07, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep:</b> I'm only a casual observer of physics, but the material seems to be legitimate, and Googling a couple of terms matches. I think the suggestion to <b>Rename</b> is good, but I'd suggest "Scalar-Tensor gravitation" as shorter and just as valid, since everything in physics is a theory. Some combination of adding and rewriting would help make an introduction that would make it more acessible. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 23:17, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>To me, "theory" distinguishes it from "experiments" and "empirical models", but it's probably not a useful distinction here. The shorter name would be fine. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManoaChild_4445.html" title="User:ManoaChild">ManoaChild</a> 23:45, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The format and information in the page was changed by now, so that it is more comprehensible than at the beginning. Moreover, the name scalar-tensor theory (maybe scalar-tensor theories of gravitation) should be the right one (such theories are found under that name in physical journals). The name describes a wide amount of different theoretical models that use these scalar fields along with tensor fields. I think, other kind of scalar-tensor theories, should come here, too.</li>
</ul>
<p>This theories (as models for nature) are surely used mainly on gravitation, but it might not have to be like that, although I don't know any Lagrangian of that form in other fields of physics. However, such Lagrangians (the basic of the theory) could certainly be used on other non-gravitational fields (I know, tensor calculus and metrica of General Relativity are used to work on sand and things like that), as part of phenomenological models (what would not say they are gravitational). However, it would be good if it is worked on the article... 141.70.111.178 15:40, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm the one who seperated it, and removed the movie info from the book page. The movie info has since been returned to the main page. It should be seperate pages, IMO, because the book and movie have almost nothing to do with each other. Robert Altman was attempting to make an Anti-noir film. Either way, it's two seperate things. Otherwise, why not just combine all books with movies, which it appears we aren't doing. This isn't a case of a book made into a movie, like say, the Big Sleep which was written for the film or the Postman Always Rings Twice, which follows the book closly. It would be like having the animated Lord of the Rings movies tacked onto the end of the LOTR book pages. Either way works for me. Just don't flame my talk page.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Eifert_8143.html" title="User:Steve Eifert">Steve-O</a> 03:56, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A book and movie typically go in one article if either (or both) lacks the notability to stand on its own, or if they're too closely linked to be separated. In this case, the movie isn't notable on its own, and its plot is extremely close to the book's. | Klaw <small>¡digame!</small> 04:28, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Keep</b> —If that was the case, then why does The Big Sleep have two seperate entries for the film versions? An interesting argument. I would like to know what people think that have read the book and seen the film.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> — both articles have sufficient content to keep them separate. Movie productions are rarely if ever exact duplicates of the novels on which they are based. So I don't have an issue with separate articles, as long as they are well-developed. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 18:06, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As long as the film article is well-developed (i.e. not a stub), it should stand on its own. I think Steve has sufficiently expanded the film information to merit its own article. I think the precedent was set long ago that film versions can be separate from their novel's articles. They should only remain attached when the film is an integral part of explaining the novel (not the case here by a long shot) or if neither article can stand alone (two stubs combined to form a decent-sized article). <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVolatile_6023.html" title="User:Volatile">Volatile</a> 00:52, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The book is one thing and the film is another. Both versions are cultural and artistic artifacts on their own merits. I've read the book and seen the film; Chandler does his 1950's L.A. literary thing, and Altman takes it and runs with it in a purely 1970's L.A. cinematic way. Perhaps some editing and clean-up is warranted, but outright deletion is not.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- The book and movie differ in notable ways. I can't imagine merging them into a single article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 07:52, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, this is my first article so still learning =) In fact, after people asked me about 'blooth', I did first do some google research. All instances were some form of typo, and therefore there was no directly citable source. Should I cite a specific usage? google? or general typo? Since there were so many indpendent 'mis'-usages, it would seem to be a relatively stable neologism. On the other hand, perhaps is doesn't belong in -pedia anyway, and should be in dictionary or urban-dictionary.
<p>I don't mind deletion, but a more verbose explanation would allow me to be a better contributor! Thanks! ektoric</p>

<li><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. Articles in Wikipedia are about the people/concepts/places/things/events denoted by their titles, not about the words in their titles. An article entitled <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blooth.html" title="Blooth">Blooth</a> would be about Blooth, or Blooths, whatever they are.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not a dictionary. We don't have multiple articles just because there are multiple words for the same thing. See <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatre.html" title="Theatre">theatre</a>/<a href="../../../t/h/e/Theater.html" title="Theater">theater</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color.html" title="Color">color</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/l/Colour.html" title="Colour">colour</a>, <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squash_%28vegetable%29.html" title="Squash (vegetable)">squash</a>/<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marrow_%28vegetable%29.html" title="Marrow (vegetable)">marrow</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a>/<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charva.html" title="Charva">charva</a>, and <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasoline.html" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a>/<a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrol.html" title="Petrol">petrol</a>. If Blooth is the same thing as Bluetooth, then we have <i>one</i> article about the <i>one</i> thing, with the alternative titles as <a href="../../../r/e/d/Help%7ERedirect_9b77.html" title="Help:Redirect">redirects</a>.</li>
<li>Having individual articles for individual words is what a dictionary does. See <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/theatre" class="extiw" title="wikt:theatre">theatre</a>/<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/theater" class="extiw" title="wikt:theater">theater</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/color" class="extiw" title="wikt:color">color</a>/<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/colour" class="extiw" title="wikt:colour">colour</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/squash" class="extiw" title="wikt:squash">squash</a>/<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/marrow" class="extiw" title="wikt:marrow">marrow</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chav" class="extiw" title="wikt:chav">chav</a>/<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/charva" class="extiw" title="wikt:charva">charva</a>, and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gasoline" class="extiw" title="wikt:gasoline">gasoline</a>/<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/petrol" class="extiw" title="wikt:petrol">petrol</a>.</li>
<li>For a redirect from an alternative name in the encyclopaedia, reliable evidence has to exist that that really is a widely accepted, or an authoritatively documented, alternative name. A handful of people making a typing mistake does not constitute a credible alternative name. Our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> official policy prevents us from proposing new names for things, moreover.</li>
<li>For an alternative spelling to be listed in the dictionary, the word has to satisfy the dictionary's <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion">attestation criteria</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If people ask you about the word again, point them to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blooth" class="extiw" title="wikt:blooth">blooth</a> in the dictionary. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:15, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No it's not a neologism. But this isn't what the word means. See the Wiktionary article for where the <b>redirect</b> should point. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:15, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
