<dd>Comment: The article was proposed deleted on the German WP and a clear majority voted to <b>keep</b> it. It was however unilaterally deleted, and the sysop Philipendula, who seems to have strong personal interest in the article, seems determined to delete a valid article about a well-known journalist and editor of one of the larger German newspapers at any cost. The German Wikipedia clearly has a problem with abusive behaviour from some sysops who delete articles in contradiction with community decision. The only argument for deleting I saw on the German Wikipedia was that he happened to be noble, and obviously some POV pushers with sysop access doesn't like nobles. Here on English Wikipedia we do however not accept such <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarian.html" title="Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> behaviour. There is no reason for deleting this article, but Philipendula should be desyopped at the German Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>For those interested in Google stats: The two used spellings of his name returns 216 Google hits.</dd>

<dd>I found the German vfd debate, and found it strange too as it indicated a keep to me too, but was wondering if my bad German language skills were tricking me. Since nobody has given a good reason for deletion I have removed the vfd template. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThue_a090.html" title="User:Thue">Thue</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThue_d7b8.html" title="User talk:Thue">talk</a> 21:45, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The Handelsblatt is a leading German newspaper and is clearly notable. The Wikipedia has articles about quite a lot less notable people than editors of newspapers like Handelsblatt, given that <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">m:Wiki is not paper</a>. The real reason for the illegal deletion on de: was something which looked like hatred against nobles. You have failed to cite a single relevant argument for deleting this page.</dd>
