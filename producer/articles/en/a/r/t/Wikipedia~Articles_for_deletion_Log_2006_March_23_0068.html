<dd><b>Comment</b>. The <i>technology</i> of microwave popcorn bags may be fodder for an article (though in its present incarnation I think it should be merged with popcorn). However, there is nothing notable about popcorn bags of the everyday variety. The entire focus should thus be on the history and technology involved with that topic; the article should not masquerade as a general article on popcorn bags and should be renamed "Microwave popcorn bag technology" or something similar. Think about it this way, would there be any reason to keep if the article was lolipop wrapper? Generic popcorn bags are still the analogue of lolipop wrapper. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 04:01, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Night Warrior is the U.K.'s leading independant comic book. It's a unique collaboration of over a hundered artists and writers from all over the world. That in itself makes it stand out above all the others and makes it a worthy inclusion to wikipedia.</p>
<p>It's had some big press attention already for example it's one of the few independant webcomics to feature on Comic-Con. At it's peak it gets over a thousand unique hits per day and later in the year it's going to print.</p>
<p>It would seem odd to have a list of British comics or Webcomics and not have Night Warrior on there. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.40.49.56 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.40.49.56_8871.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.40.49.56">contribs</a>) 10:11, 2006 March 24.</small></p>

<li>so, is my article still going to be deleted or not? If it is, tell me what rule it is braking or at least a specific reason so that I can try to fix it. Everything contaied in the article was used with direct permission from the author of the page (I also help create the site and desiged most of the graphics) including the logo and images. --Motumbis 23:30, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article looks very likely to be deleted simply because the forum isn't notable enough to merit an entry. With 122 members as of this writing, it looks unlikely that anyone who isn't directly involved in the forum would ever visit, or edit, the Wikipedia page. That means that the page would end up being forever POV and unencyclopedic (which, I submit, it is) and would be unlikely to ever meet Wikipedia's standards of quality. Get yourself a few thousand more users and a few mentions in major national or international publications and your forum may then become notable. Incidentally, I myself made the same mistake last year: I submitted a web forum I belong to with 298 users. The article was deleted. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 23:42, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Well if the guild had done something noteworthy, like been one of the first groups to organize an economy where one could buy and sell things for real world cash, that would be noteworthy. Or if the guild had a large number of noteworthy people in it, or was very large, or it got into some interesting legal dispute.

<li><b>Comment</b> Still trying to get my hands around it. If they helped usher in some unique aspect of a game or series of games (the economics suggestion above), then a mention in the description of the aspect would probably suffice, unless maybe they were consistant innovators that drove change in several games? The legal dispute one is interesting; but is the dispute notable or the guild?

<li><b>Comment</b> Twelve Prophets is not a great example; the information on their exploiting there is a bit inaccurate and not comprehensive, but I'm not in a good position to fix it, even if this guild was sufficiently notable. About the only WoW-related guild I can think of offhand that might deserve a page is Fires of Heaven but more because of their connections to several game developers, and for their well-known message boards, than for their accomplishments in WoW or Everquest specifically. But as you can see, they don't have an article (yet). <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKiti_1b42.html" title="User:Kiti">Kiti</a> 01:08, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't play, but I've heard that there are a few guilds known for using hacks and cheating extensively - I think that might be notable, as well, especially since that sort of behavior forces the developers to patch the game. -- <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillnotelf_81b2.html" title="User:Stillnotelf"><font color="#668353">stillnotelf</font></a> <a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStillnotelf_80d6.html" title="User talk:Stillnotelf"><font color="#FF4487">has a talk page</font></a> 22:04, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would consider a few guilds sufficiently noteworthy, but generally because they or their members have made a lasting impact on the development of the game and/or the MMORPG genre. There's some interest in seeing how developer X's experience in guild Y influenced what he did with game Z; but a page like this one which is just "we killed a lot of the big baddies in the game" isn't noteworthy or interesting to me despite playing WoW. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKiti_1b42.html" title="User:Kiti">Kiti</a> 00:14, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I first encountered this set of articles after seeing Cosmic Universe get unprodded. Although these articles appear in Template:Tycoon Computer Games, they are not Tycoon Computer games. These are not published software titles, instead, they are role playing gaming websites. I do not think that these forum games are notable. These articles are about the many iterations of a single game, the current iteration is The Other Film Tycoon. This game has <a href="http://game.film-tycoon.com/index.php?option=com_smf&amp;Itemid=39" class="external text" title="http://game.film-tycoon.com/index.php?option=com_smf&amp;Itemid=39" rel="nofollow">58 members</a> in it's forum, and <a href="http://www.game.film-tycoon.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=32" class="external text" title="http://www.game.film-tycoon.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=32" rel="nofollow">32 players</a> on their leaderboard.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm the creator of the page (so I guess my vote doesn't count), and no offense taken if it's deleted. But if it makes a difference, this is not just a resume dump, and I have no affiliation with the subject at all other than being a fan who found her work on the Internet. Minimal Google hits at present (as an above commenter mentioned), but she's only been modeling for about a year and she's already made MAXIM Belgium and the Lingerie Bowl. In addition, I didn't list her upcoming features, but she will be in the Playboy Lingerie Catalogue as well as several 2007 calendars. I didn't list her TV stuff (yet), but she's also been on CSI, The Office, an Icehouse Beer commercial, ESPN2's Cold Pizza, MTV's TRL, and other stuff I'm not familiar with. I predict that the Google count will surpass 1,000 within 60 days (the MAXIM feature is <i>just</i> hitting stands now) and will rise from there. If it'd be better to wait and create a Wikipedia article after that happens . . . like I said, no offense taken. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.105.140.121 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.105.140.121_d4cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.105.140.121">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>I'm always skeptical about the touring criteria. So they rented a bus and drove from Montreal to Portland, ME and then to Toronto - that hardly qualifies as a national tour IMHO, let alone an <i>inter</i>national tour. Any band that lives in Plattsburgh, NY and gets a gig at a bar in Montreal a half-hour away can be said to have been on international tour?! But I'm listening... I'm not completely inflexible on this questionable criteria. To me, the almost-total lack of recorded music speaks much more loudly though. That puts them on the same level as a couple of my cousins. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 16:04, 23 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, I'd be in favor of relaxing the touring requirement to regions as opposed to nations, but yes, that's <i>inter</i>national - they went on a tour and went to multiple nations. It's also not out of the question for tours to be able to help build up the credibility to have the ability to record. Regardless, whatever they've recorded has ended up on <a href="../../../m/u/c/MuchMusic_1884.html" title="MuchMusic">MuchMusic</a>, so they're probably at a higher level than your cousins. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 16:09, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: DKM got off the net about two years ago, so he can’t possibly be engaging in self-promotion.

If not, someone would need to contact him and get his permission to post this on Wikipedia. I’m a fan of the Continuing Time, and I'd like to vote <i>keep</i>, but I can’t as long as copyvio concerns hang like a sword of Damocles over that section.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The list of 7 items, the timeline, and the release were all written by DKM, all I did was format it to fit wikipedia’s style, and post it.

<li><b>Delete</b>, text that cannot be altered should usually not be posted to Wikipedia, especially when it makes up the bulk of the article's content.

<li><b>Delete</b> as copyvio incompatible with GFDL. Contrary to MJBurrage, the essence of the GFDL is that any author is allowed to alter any other author's contribution for any reason, so long as the various versions are properly attributed. DKM's self-imposed conditions are incompatible with the GFDL, meaing the article would have to be permanently protected (a bad precedent to set) or deleted. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 09:24, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

It sounds way too much like someone took something written in one of Kardec's books and created a character around him to write a bunch of books, but there no verification that the books or the character actually exists, and none's likely forthcoming. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> 21:30, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Are we giving any credence to this combination of statements: (1) "Ramatis is a spiritual entity"; (2) "Ramatis has dictated many books"&#160;?? Regardless of whether Ramatis is found in Spritism or not, these statements formulate a <b>belief</b>, which by its very nature cannot be verified. Therefore, delete as unverifiable (ever). This material could only be included as a description of some beliefs under Spiritism, and cannot be entertained as written. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 21:38, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Kardec was apparently a proponent of spiritism and wrote books dictated to him by mediums channeling spirits. Apparently Ramatis contradicts some of Kardec's other writings.</s> Ramatis is apparently a notable part of <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritism.html" title="Spiritism">Spiritism</a> as it is practiced in Brazil. An argument could be made to merge Ramatis into Spiritism but the Spiritism article currently contains little info on current Brazilian practics so there would be no context. Better as a separate article until somebody writes Spiritism in Brazil. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 00:42, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Worldcat has at least 10 books "written" by Ramatis, dictated to Brazilian spiritualists including Hercílio Maes and América Paoliello Marques in the 1970s. I can't tell you what they say because I don't have copies and even if I did I don't read portugese. While looking for info on Kardec I found a comment that <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritism.html" title="Spiritism">Spiritism</a> was gradually absorbed into <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritualism.html" title="Spiritualism">Spiritualism</a> in Europe but retains a separate identity in South America. The article needs an expert tag but should be kept as part of modern Spiritism. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 14:30, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There are also apparently 2 books about Spiritism that mention Ramatis including <i>Spirits and scientists, ideology, spiritism, and Brazilian culture</i> by David Hess published by Penn State University Press. My library has it and I may be able to review it in the next few days. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 14:50, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Looking at the references given in the article, the first is a press release that only mentions CommandN once <i>"...video blogs such as CommandN, MacTV and Rocketboom."</i> The superman references are on a blog of one of the hosts, and the other says <i>"Techtainment is a personal website"</i> <a href="http://techtainment.net/about" class="external autonumber" title="http://techtainment.net/about" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Obviously people have a very difficult time being objective about Rick's page. As he is directly associated with the most important event in 50 years of US History, it would be nearsighted to delete his page. The simple act of filming the events of 911 from such a unique vantage point merits inclusion on its own. Bpd1069 16:01, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Since my above comment, the amount of information on the page has been expanded and clearly shows a notable history. I have also read the the page re Deletion of pages. The only possible category this could fall under would be a user page but as this page was not created by Rick himself as stated below, even that category would be a stretch. I believe the problem is Rick's affiliation with the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories, and as such there is a knee jerk reaction to deminish his credibilty. Bpd1069 01:39, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

When he started videotaping the burning towers he had no idea they were going to freefall at the speed of gravity therefore proving controlled demolition and government treason. After the fact, his testimony and video/DVD are historical evidence that could and should be used in a court of law to bring the real masterminds behind 9/11 to justice.

While doing research for working on <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> I found an article signed by rick siegel about <i>agents efforting on wikipedia to silence the most provocative and authoritative documentary yet released</i>.&#160;::: Obviously the guy has no clue about what is wikipedia and how wikipedia works, but IMHO that doesn't make him a phony guy or a bad fellow, and I know very well how wikipedian can react in a stubborn closed-minded way, especially in case like this when one unhappy individual makes bad publicity to wikipedia and use wrong means to try to get what he wants. My guess is this is a typical case of <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">newcomers being bitten</a>, it is difficult to cope with a whole community when you are a single individual or a bunch of individuals.

<dd>The <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chessmaster.html" title="Chessmaster">Chessmaster</a> page was actually incorrect in describing SR Chess as "fictitious". While much of the commentary and purported history of SR Chess is clearly exaggerated and fictitious, and functions as a spoof and parody of serious chess commentary, the game itself is real, as can be verified from the website where it is actively played. Another user has since (correctly) emended the Chessmaster reference from "fictitious" to "humorous". <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorytopov_19e7.html" title="User:Gregorytopov">Gregorytopov</a> 20:26, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. First off, AfD is no longer VfD and therefore we are not voting to delete or keep this article. Second, I'm really not sure what to make of this. References to this "game" have already been inserted into the articles of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mornington_Crescent_%28game%29_7356.html" title="Mornington Crescent (game)">Mornington Crescent (game)</a> and elsewhere, yet I am very hard pressed to find anything on the internet about this game that has not been written by Mr. Topov. The author references a fan base that seems to include solely himself. I am going to hold off on a keep/delete decision for now, pending more information.
<dl>
<dd>Right, about AfD, but rather than "vote" perhaps I should say "traditional bolded one-word summary prepended to your argument (TBOWSPTYA)". I'm just pointing out that a TBOWSPTYA of (say) 5 Delete and 5 BJAODN can result in a closing of "No consensus, keep". <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>I agree that if the fan base only included myself, it would be nonsense, but that is not the case. Two supporting references from external web-sites, to verify the above information:</dd>
<dd>* 1. <a href="http://www.chessvariants.org/link2.dir/srchess.html" class="external free" title="http://www.chessvariants.org/link2.dir/srchess.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chessvariants.org/link2.dir/srchess.html</a> This chessvariants.org site only lists bona fide playable chess variants, and does not publish hoaxes. The historical claims of SR Chess are disputable and much of the commentary is cloaked in humor, but its playability and authenticity as a real chess variant is genuine.</dd>
<dd>* 2. <a href="http://www.schemingmind.com/games.aspx?variant_id=15" class="external free" title="http://www.schemingmind.com/games.aspx?variant_id=15" rel="nofollow">http://www.schemingmind.com/games.aspx?variant_id=15</a> This list gives the current games of Stanley Random Chess in progress at this correspondence chess server. Over 100 games of Stanley Random Chess have been played in the last ten days alone. In fact, an international tournament is currently in progress between ten players, as is evident here: <a href="http://www.schemingmind.com/minitournament.aspx?tournament_id=520" class="external free" title="http://www.schemingmind.com/minitournament.aspx?tournament_id=520" rel="nofollow">http://www.schemingmind.com/minitournament.aspx?tournament_id=520</a> This information can be verified with the webmaster of the schemingmind.com website, Austin Lockwood.</dd>
<dd>Two external contacts I can give: Tony Quintanilla, registered editor of chessvariants.org; and Austin Lockwood, webmaster of schemingmind.com. And dozens of schemingmind.com members who are actively playing the game.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can appreciate the scepticism, but in view of the above, the Chessmaster page is incorrect in calling Stanley Random Chess "fictitious." This is not the case, because SR Chess is in fact a real chess variant, admittedly inspired somewhat by the Stanley Random Chess personality from the Chessmaster software. By way of explanation, the game is a parody of chess in some respects, by featuring humorous commentary and analysis. But it is a real and serious chess variant, that is played actively online between human players, especially at schemingmind.com.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The game plays exactly like regular chess, but with some additional rules, as described in the wikipedia entry. The two main differences from regular chess are correctly described under the "Rules" section, i.e. approximately 50% of moves are randomly selected by a computer; and if the game goes beyond 30 moves, the game can apparently randomly end at any moment, the winner being the player with most material. If you try playing online at schemingmind.com, you will find these facts to be true, and that the game plays exactly in this way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In short, although some of the historical claims and some aspects of the game are subject to exaggeration and humor (as referenced in the link posted by Herostratus), the game itself is not a hoax, because there are players actively playing Stanley Random Chess at a real correspondence chess server. If deemed necessary, the content on the wikipedia page can be modified to clarify this. If items like <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mornington_Crescent_%28game%29_7356.html" title="Mornington Crescent (game)">Mornington Crescent (game)</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_%28game%29.html" title="Mao (game)">Mao (game)</a> can have Wikipedia entries, the same applies to Stanley Random Chess. The game has aspects of humor and secrecy, but it is a real and playable game, as any active member of the above-mentioned correspondence chess server can verify. I am quite willing to have the content modified or clarified to meet Wikipedia standards and satisfy those with concerns, but a valid entry for Stanley Random Chess is justifiable, especially since it is referenced by the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chessmaster.html" title="Chessmaster">Chessmaster</a> article (albeit incorrectly as "fictional"). Feel free to direct me with specific suggestions about how I should modify the content to make it satisfactory.<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorytopov_19e7.html" title="User:Gregorytopov">Gregorytopov</a> 05:38, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. That's a great lot of words which I'll look at when I can, but your argument is not aided by the fact that the "Historical origins section of the article includes passages such as <i>"Documenting historical evidence that dates back to the early English monarchy..."</i> which links, as reference, to a page which says <i>"Until recently, it was incorrectly supposed that Stanley Random Chess owed its humble origins to... the lowest rated personality in the world-famous Chessmaster software... [but] Following concentrated studies of the Stanley family in early Britain... Goldman and Morgenstern provide solid evidence that the name "Stanley" originates with Sir Thomas Stanley (d. 1459)... The first mention of the game itself is found in historical accounts of the Ferrers family in 1137... In 1892, the Stanley Cup was sadly donated by the rebel Sir Frederick Arthur Stanley, from which time it was used as a trophy for amateur hockey in Canada. Frederick T. Stanley, who in 1843 founded The Stanley Works... was responsible for popularizing SR Chess in America..."</i> The game may well be real, but mixing such faux history with the actual game is probably not a good way to get an article kept on Wikipedia. Perhaps a general cleanup of the article would solve the problem, assuming of course that the game itself <i>is</i> real. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:20, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b>. Good point. Even though the game is real (verifiable by the links above showing <a href="http://www.schemingmind.com/games.aspx?variant_id=15" class="external text" title="http://www.schemingmind.com/games.aspx?variant_id=15" rel="nofollow">current games</a> and a <a href="http://www.schemingmind.com/minitournament.aspx?tournament_id=520" class="external text" title="http://www.schemingmind.com/minitournament.aspx?tournament_id=520" rel="nofollow">current tournament</a> between multiple players), a Wikipedia article on the game should clear state that any claims about historical origins are exaggerated and intended to reflect humor rather than reality, even though the game itself is real. The same can be said about most commentary and analysis of the game, as described well below by another player of the game, <a href="http://www.schemingmind.com/plyrprofile.aspx?profile_id=58" class="external text" title="http://www.schemingmind.com/plyrprofile.aspx?profile_id=58" rel="nofollow">surfnsuds</a>. The paragraph on historical claims has currently been deleted by another editor - it probably should be reworked so that readers are informed about the wild claims, but made aware that while they are false the game itself is real, and that Monty Python style commentary is typically employed to accompany a real game, and is part of the attraction of the game. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorytopov_19e7.html" title="User:Gregorytopov">Gregorytopov</a> 14:21, 23 March 2006 (UTC)Gregorytopov</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Update</b> It's real, and it's fun to play! I have played many games of Stanley Random Chess on Schemingmind.com over the last year or so. I enjoy it very much. It is worthwhile on a number of levels.</p>
<p>The game itself can be played to win, in spite of (and even taking advantage of) the random aspects (which are accurately described above, though I think the percentage of random moves are less than 50% as stated above - more like 30% is my guess). This aspect involves an exercise of basic statistics. The game also is unique in that one may make moves which in regular chess would appear to be blunders. However, again by playing the odds, you can frequently obtain advantage by making intentional "blunders". With study, you can determine which "blunders" can reault in advantage and which are not likely to. This aspect of the game to mind resembles bluffing in poker and is unique among the many chess variants I have played.</p>
<p>However, the most unusual and to my mind, the most fun aspect of the game is the tradition of creative, humorous commentary surrounding the game. The process is as mentioned above, similar to "Mornington Crescent" and the result reads more like Monty Python.</p>
<p>These points are intended to show that the game is viable and enjoyable for folks who tend to enjoy creative gaming. But they are my conclusions and opinions. Surely, however, the hundreds of games played to date at SchemingMind.com by dozens of players over the last year are a verifiable fact that proves the game is as real as tic-tac-toe.</p>
<p>I am brand-new to Wiki and have not figured things out yet. Bear with me. I am NOT GregTopov, but I admire his creation.</p>

<li>YES - much of the commentary and history of the game is fictional, for the sake of parody; in fact this is precisely one attraction of the game for creative players who enjoy adding to the imaginary traditions surrounding the game, and this is now clearly described and admitted as such in the revised form of the article.</li>

<dd><small><i><b>Refutation</b></i>, the Krabbe article correctly portrays typical SR Chess commentary, which as already noted is highly exaggerated and humorous in keeping with the spirit of the game.

<li><b>Good point</b>. Stanley Random Chess is just as notable as most of the other <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_variants.html" title="Chess variants">chess variants</a> already on Wikipedia, if not more so given its active player base. As a matter of consistency, if it is not sufficently notable, then many of the other <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_variants.html" title="Chess variants">chess variants</a> should also be deleted, since several of them only reference a chessvariants.org page for verification, and are thus even less notable and less verifiable than SRC.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The first and primary reason for AfD was "hoax". This reason is objectively false. The game is real; it does exist. Enough evidence has been provided to prove that to someone willing to follow the source references.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the discussion turned to questions of notableness. It was compared(?) to a water gun fight in someone's backyard. I think the rhetorical comparison actually illustrates that the game is notable. Please follow my logic.</p>
<p>It's not exactly a water gun fight; but, could a tug-of-war contest ever make the Wikipedia? There is a famous tug-of war contest between two cities on the Mississippi River. While only the Iowa and Illinois city have direct interest in the contest, surely its relationship to the Mighty Mississip, to commercial river navigation (which is halted during the contest), and its uniqueness would give sufficient notoriety to the contest to justify a Wikipedia entry, n'est ce pas?</p>
<p>So, how do I justify that SR Chess is notable? SR Chess is discussed in at least two languages and on at least three referrenced independent websites (four with Wikipedia). Hundreds of games have been played -- by players around the world. This real and notable game has legitimate strategical value (for instance, the random elements are no obstacle to the good SRC player winning the majority of his or her games).</p>
<p>The problem is perhaps not irrelevance, but irritation. While the psuedo-serious approach to the game by its adherents (of which I am one) seems to bother some persons, their distress over behaviour is clearly no reason to eliminate the article itself. I do not know in what form the article first appeared; but, it looks objective and unoffensive at this point.</p>
<p>Stanley Random Chess is a legitimate part of the growing realm of chess variants. Please allow the article to remain in Wikipedia.</p>

In my ignorance, I was mistakenly of the impression that any Tom Dick or Harry could post their wild theories here (not that I counted myself among them). I'm finding that the method of peer consensus to approve and moderate content is very effective - I know that my article has already benefited from that, and rightly forced me to reshape its original form. I have learned from my experience with this that I can trust Wikipedia content to be quite reliable! Although I recognize that the article on Stanley Random Chess probably needs some further work, I have already made significant changes to the way it was originally submitted, and I now realize that in its original form, it was quite unacceptable and would (correctly) have raised many flags of alert. It should be noted that several of those who expressed themselves in favor of its deletion, did so in response to the article in its original form, not its present revised state. I hope that in its present revised form, with some further improvement and editing, can eventually be regarded as appropriate, honest, and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorytopov_19e7.html" title="User:Gregorytopov">Gregorytopov</a> 19:12, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

It looks like the system has been changed from "Votes for Deletion", so it's not about vote counting any more, it's about debate.

Just being a chess variant is not sufficient. If it is being played by 10 people (or even 100 people) that too is not notable. The question is, is it a well-known and significant chess variant or not?

<dd>Despite it being an article I submitted that's up for debate, it seems to me entirely reasonable that even if the original ground for proposed deletion turns out to be spurious (as in this case, since SR Chess is not a hoax), if other grounds are raised that potentially warrant deletion, a discussion and debate on these new grounds is entirely legitimate. Even though I don't find these new grounds convincing yet, a debate about them is quite fair. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorytopov_19e7.html" title="User:Gregorytopov">Gregorytopov</a> 18:55, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>See also a related discussion at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Julian_Darius_8323.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Julian Darius">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Julian Darius</a>. The site doesn't meet the guidelines at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and the article cites no references. The lead claims the site to be one <i>that publishes news, editorial columns, interviews, annotations, critical essays about the medium of comics, and the Continuity Pages, a hyperlinked study of families of characters by continuity rather than by title and date.</i> The critical essays aren't peer reviewed and the whole site can be regarded as Julian Darius' personal website, per <a href="http://www.sequart.com/about/index.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sequart.com/about/index.php" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, "Sequart.com began in 1996 in the form of various writings on comics by Julian Darius on his personal website". Neither the site nor Darius have, as of yet, established notability within the comics scholarship field. Contributors to the site mentioned in the article are not notable within the field. The controversies described in the article reads to me as no different to any other internet message board spat. The books the site publishes are published through <a href="../../../c/a/f/CafePress.com_e50a.html" title="CafePress.com">CafePress.com</a>. At this present time, I don't think the site has established enough notability within its field to warrant an article, since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not a web directory</a>.

<li>I'm on the fence but would tend towards inclusion. Site does meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The critical essays certainly are reviewed by site staff, which is no different than other sites. I don't see how the site's ties to its original creator or how it publishes its books are relevant here. I wouldn't call myself an inclusionist, but would tend towards including this one. Twenty or so staff members, a book line, convention presence, strong traffic, some coverage in press -- this qualifies for me. I agree about the controversies part, tho, which should go. 23 March 2006</li>
<li>The site's T-shirts are through CafePress.com, not the site's books. Esquire also uses CafePress.com. 24 March 2006</li>

<p>As I (William Oosterman)am no longer at Citywide both they and I would prefer that the bio is listed as seperate. It fits very well into the Canadian Clergy seciton. <b>Andyru</b> is a former Elder who resigned while at Westboro Baptist. If you check all his contributions he is on a campagin to discredit me and support Roy Lawrence the pedophile who snuck into our church under false pretenses and became Associate pastor, causing an incredible amount of damage. First Andyru posted a number of blatant lies about me on my page, now he is trying to have it removed. Take that into consideration during this "hearing". <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Williamo1 (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamo1_d526.html" title="User talk:Williamo1">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Williamo1_af15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Williamo1">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>If you are indeed Rev. Oosterman (and I have no reason to doubt that), your own edit history on this and related articles doesn't help your case, unfortunately.

<dd>Williamo1, I think a basic problem you have to realize, is that when people who are not famous, make articles about themselves, the only people interested in those article are people who either personally love the person, or personally dislike the person (with exceptions of course). This is one reason why we strongly discourage people from writing bios of themselves, and generally discourage articles on most regular people (or "non-notable" to use our lingo). I'm sure you don't like some of the stuff written about you. But, you can't, and won't be able to control it. Unsourced negative statements about you can be removed, but if somebody puts relevant sourced verifiable facts (or notable opinions), which aren't favorable to you, then you might have to live with that. You should seriously consider supporting deletion, and remove the problem. This is not your personal page, and it can never be what you wanted it to be. A better option would be to go make your own personal web page, at one of many web hosts (free or non-free). Then you can say anything you want, talk openly about your beleifs, and not have critics edit the page. Surely, that's what you truly want. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 16:25, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

More importantly, it does not demonstrate the notability of its subject. Oosterman's latest book gets a grand total of 12 hits on Google <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2005-40%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22Is+It+Well+With+The+Child%3F%22+oosterman&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2005-40%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22Is+It+Well+With+The+Child%3F%22+oosterman&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>; his other book, <i>Out of the Gutter</i>, gets four hits<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-40,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22Out+of+the+Gutter%22+oosterman" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-40,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22Out+of+the+Gutter%22+oosterman" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, of which three direct to non-working links and the fourth...er... comes back to this Wikipedia article. I cannot find evidence of Oosterman's national notability. The "achievements" of speaking at conferences, preaching in foreign churches and "<i>being involved in campaigns</i>" are not what I would describe as notability; ditto the directorship of a non-notable lobby group. And the Google test? Well, a search for "william oosterman" achieves just 76 unique Google hits <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-40,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22william+oosterman%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-40,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22william+oosterman%22" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> (my local vicar gets 321). So far as the "college professor" test of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is concerned, Oosterman doesn't even appear to be a blip on the radar. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 16:31, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Week Delete</b> as being vanity. Although, I might tolerate a new article in the future, by a neutral person. I would love to say Oosterman is totally non-notable. However, he does admittedly have minor notability. He is a minor author, he writes a little piece in a local paper on religion (or he did at one time), he's been quoted for his anti gay mariage views, and his effot to stop women baptist preachers, and given attention because his church had the same name as a more famous one. So, I could see neutral person making this article (if they provided reliable sources to the stuff I just mentioned). But, that's not happened. This article, at this time, is just being used for promotion and/or criticism. Maybe if/when he's more well known, somebody independent will write something. But, this is a tough call, and a fair arguement can go either way. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 16:59, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Bro, its not like i created this yesterday. And i did creat a family tree for them:</p>

<li><a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_tree_of_Ali_ff07.html" title="Family tree of Ali">Family tree of Ali</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I wasn't accusing you of creating them yesterday, but maybe you misunderstood my suggestion. What I mean't was a single family tree which highlights the Prophet and the Caliphs in bold, and around them as many of their relations as you want but keep it in line with <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_tree_of_the_Eighteenth_dynasty_of_Egypt_0fd3.html" title="Family tree of the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt">Family tree of the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt</a> or any of the other Family trees of Egyptian dynasties. That way a reader can look at the tree and see the way that any two particular individuals are related. Ibn Abbas did not exist in a vacuum did he? He was related to several significant leaders of the Muslims, so he should be part of a larger family tree to illustrate this. Does that make any sense? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_Giant_e03e.html" title="User:Green Giant">Green Giant</a></li>

<p>This page was created in response to the extended discussion on the old Jesus-Myth page. "Jesus-Myth" is a term commonly used by Christian apologists to refer to the concept that Jesus is a purely mythical creation. Aside from the title of a book, the term is not used by people who reject Jesus's historicity; about the only time one hears it is in a sneering manner from Christians. Discussion on the Talk page indicated general dissatisfaction with the title.</p>
<p>The Jesus-Myth page to a large extent reflected the Christian view of the idea and was mostly a jumbled, unorganized conglomeration of straw-man arguments until last week. After a great deal of often-heated debate, I re-wrote the page and offered it up for comment under my own personal page. A day passed with only a single minor comment, so I took the initiative to create the page.</p>
<p>It's my personal opinion that the RfD was made by a Christian who objects to the coherent presentation of an argument he passionately believes is profoundly heretical. As such, I believe that deleting this page would be a great disservice to Wikipedia.</p>

<li>It sounds like this is not a POV fork, but rather a combination of a rename and a rewrite. Perhaps the right way to handle it would be to first move the article to the new name, then rewrite it. Before each step, there should be a consensus in support. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 18:10, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge (with talk discussion first)</b> it is entirely a POV fork, as the content in it and in <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus-Myth_e22c.html" title="Jesus-Myth">Jesus-Myth</a> are nearly identical. The appropriate action would be to merge it back (with discussion) and propose a renaming on the talk page. One day on a personal page is not sufficient time to get any kind of organised feedback, and it is very inappropriate to simply replace links to a page with your own version, especially when the original page is protected! <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 18:59, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. TrumpetPower!, when you're involved in an edit war with another editor, and an administrator locks the article as a result, it is not appropriate to create an almost identicle article (with modifications that you like) under a new title.

<p>Followed almost the exact format of article <a href="../../../a/l/o/Alon_Cohen_704a.html" title="Alon Cohen">Alon Cohen</a> who shared the founding of <a href="../../../v/o/c/VocalTec_11d2.html" title="VocalTec">VocalTec</a> and the mentioned patent.

</li>
</ul>
<p>I would agree if not for the simple fact that this was copied from an existing article which shared both the founding of the company and the writing of the patent, and set the facts right. Should one hide behind a false name to do something like that to make it right? (as unfortunately probably is commonly done). This was just setting the facts right, which is what wikipedia is all about.</p>
<p>Regardless of the above - Vocaltec's articles are here because it totally changed the telecommunication scene and the economy behind it - you can expend on that forever, and the effect continues and will continue to shape it for the foreseen future. You're welcome to re-write these articles and actually expending them will probably serve them right.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>You have a point and I have some reservations about VP:Vanity myself. The history (FWIW) is that I came across Designfenzider, first, thought it clearly non-notable, found it referenced <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lior_Haramaty_1d1d.html" title="Lior Haramaty">Lior Haramaty</a> created by Liorhar and with few Ghits, then saw a stub for VocalTec. So it all looked like a typical vanity walled garden. On reflection, I agree that VocalTec should be expanded and I withdrew that from AfD once I realised it had a genuine history. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Thanks, I appreciate that. As for Designfenzider, - didn't have time to write much about it, and maybe I shouldn't because of conflict of interest (although I sometimes think I’m “too objective” when it comes to where conflict of interest is involved…), but the company, and its main designer (Ron Gilad, another article-that-should-be-written), deserve its own article(s) as it has and is influencing the design industry (you can find a lot of reference by googelign and see pages and articles in many publications including a recent one in New York Times’ business section).</p>
<p>Anyway, I believe I made my point(s) and appreciate your sincerity and common sense (always good to chat with someone who keeps an open mind and looks at for solutions that make sense), so at this point I’ll pull out of this issues, and let you take it from here.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> (I am the article's creator). Your arguments are fairly flawed in my opinion: if it is "too short" then it needs expansion, not deletion (you did only wait less than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=So_where_the_bloody_hell_are_you%3F&amp;diff=45133966&amp;oldid=45133727" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=So_where_the_bloody_hell_are_you%3F&amp;diff=45133966&amp;oldid=45133727" rel="nofollow">two minutes</a> after it's creation before nominating for deletion which didn't give me or other editors long in which to expand it). If it uses "profanity" then <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors</a> (note that <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloody.html" title="Bloody">bloody</a> on it's own exists as an article). Your only argument which would stand up, if valid, is that it is not sufficiently important to merit an article. I would disagree with that since it has received <a href="http://news.google.co.uk/news?hl=en&amp;ned=uk&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=where+the+bloody+hell+are+you&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external text" title="http://news.google.co.uk/news?hl=en&amp;ned=uk&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=where+the+bloody+hell+are+you&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">plenty</a> of media attention recently. <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 18:06, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per TheKoG. I have argued here many times that it is not at all inappropriate to tag an article for deletion immediately upon its creation in such cases as the article is altogether insufficient to demonstrate the notability of its subject (see, e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FRick_Barnes&amp;diff=44721308&amp;oldid=44670849" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FRick_Barnes&amp;diff=44721308&amp;oldid=44670849" rel="nofollow">here</a>, noting that, if an shoddy/short article is deleted, it can always be recreated in a more evolved form), but this article now is sufficiently expanded as to merit its being kept. I fear that Alethiophile, in view of this nomination and her nomination of <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_North_%28porn_star%29_23b0.html" title="Peter North (porn star)">Peter North (porn star)</a>, does not fully appreciate that <i>Wikipedia is not censored for minors</i> and that a determination as to the article's "offensiveness" (to him/her, for example) is no way relevant to a determination as to its worth or the notability of its subject. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>Alethiophile has suggested on my talk page that this was a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. I thought that I properly critcized (albeit stridently) the rationale underlying the nomination but did not write pejoratively vis-à-vis the nominator; to have written that perhaps he/she did not fully appreciate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, I thought, was not to criticize the nominator but, instead, to suggest that he/she familiarize herself with policies reflecting a general consensus.

<dd>First, apologies for not signing above. I heard that he was added to the IMDB, as you can add to it in a simmilar way to the way you can add to wikipedia (so I heard). The wikipedia article for <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDB_38d9.html" title="IMDB">IMDB</a> seems to imply this as well. This archive also makes me suspicious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Cutmore&amp;oldid=44386235" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Cutmore&amp;oldid=44386235" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> "Simon as the face of KFC in Bulgaria"!?, but maybe I'm just being very naive and gullible--<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiJ_c851.html" title="User:PhiJ">PhiJ</a> 19:30, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I could be wrong on this, but my understanding is that you can get a <i>person</i> added to IMDB, but the credits come from the actual movies.

<li><b>Delete</b> even if he isn't a hoax. Wikipedia is not here to duplicate IMDB. To be blunt, there are clearly plenty of people over enamoured with the idea of film, and have the idea you have to be in some way important to be in any film, no matter how awful, and these people are wrong. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 00:13, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> I performed a minor edit to this page in the past (just corrected a link) after finding the entry while looking at some filmographies on IMDB. I'm not sure it's a hoax, calling it such suggests there was an intent to deceive people, it may just be an inside joke of some sort. In any event possibly not genuine and as noted previously even if it was it does not warrant inclusion anyway due to the lack of parts this actor has had. <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeebtlas_737b.html" title="User:Feebtlas">Feebtlas</a> 14:30, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</s>. <b>Keep</b>. After doing a little research of my own I would like to retract my original post requesting delete and replace it with a keep. I believe that the hoax may actually be on the part of PhiJ, a 'double hoax', if you will. By putting forward a legitimate entry for deletion he may actually be hoaxing us. There is far more evidence that this actor exists than does not. <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeebtlas_737b.html" title="User:Feebtlas">Feebtlas</a> 10:58, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Clarion University has only two networks (academic and residential) and each share a very small IP pool. As a result, all students share a minimum of external IP addresses hence it may seem like there are very few unique hits. We often have a problem on the residential network with AIM because if their servers go down, we all try to sign on at once (because this is automated in newer editions of this program). This causes their servers to boot us off since it sees hundreds of connections coming in from a single IP address. There is no reliable way to determine from outside our campus networks the difference between a unique and non-unique hit. If all 6000+ students were to visit Wikipedia simultaneously, you definately would not see 6000 unique hits on the server-end. That's why I believe the Google comment is irrelevant since the majority of our programming is geared for Clarion University students. --Terranika 06:14, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Littlewoods was a bad example, take SysWear or Dorothy_Perkins, both these articles (there are many others) seem self promoting to me with little other content. I tried to add notability to my aritcle by giving examples of where Glassesdirect had been in the press (now removed), not just because they have been in the press but because of the reason. My main concern is that my article now, is not that different to the others in the above category, but has been singled out for deletion. I have bought many pairs of glasses from this company and have recently found Wikipedia as a very good resource of information, I wanted to share my cost savings with other people.

<p>Well, this is my first time posting on Wikipedia, and I apologize for my faux pas. I'm sure that a lot of the content can be changed to make this less "public relations" (it is not advertising), and more "encyclopedia". Please advise as to how this article can be transformed into something acceptable. It's not clear, based upon seeing a lot of the content out on the website, what make this qualify for rejection while others do not.</p>
<p>The purpose of the post was to communicate a significant non-profit cultural event to the Western New York region, and growing outside of this region as well. Tens of thousands of people flock to this area each year, many coming from out of state as well. Its popularity is growing exponentially.</p>
<p>What makes this event unique is that hundreds of Buffalonians formally organize and volunteer every year to put on an event whose sole purpose is to beautify the city, improve its public image, and create a better type of community. It manages to bridge all sorts of socio-economic barriers, and promotes the community improvement of living conditions to areas of the city that need it.</p>
<p>This event is completely about social change, not money. There is no paid staff. Donations go back into the community in the form of beatification grants, which are used to create community gardens and landscaping.</p>
<p>What is confusing about Wikipedia's policy is that there are many things out there that are pure advertising, and have little or no benefit to the community at large. For example, there is a fast-food chain in Buffalo that has it's post out here. See Mighty Taco at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Taco" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Taco" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Taco</a> . This isn't advertising?</p>
<p>I believe this qualifies because it is a relatively unique and popular yearly event. There are other Buffalo events posted on Wik that are similar to Garden Walk - see Allentown Arts Festival (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allentown_Arts_Festival" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allentown_Arts_Festival" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allentown_Arts_Festival</a>) and Thursday at the Square(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_at_the_Square" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_at_the_Square" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_at_the_Square</a>). Incidentally, these events are more commercial, and do not distinguish themselves in any way from other public events all over the world.</p>

For example Hitler and others thought that the binding of prisoners hands by Commandos on Sark and Dieppe raids was an atrocity, so he issued the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commando_Order_2976.html" title="Commando Order">Commando Order</a> that resulted in a number of war crimes and prosecutions for war crimes after the war. That the commando order resulted in war crime trial with guilty verdicts is documented with reliable and reputable sources, but almost anything which someone at some time thought was an atrocity could end up on this page, because unlike a war crime there is no definition of what constitutes an atrocity in war.</li>
<li>There are lots of other pages which cover this area and are subject to some sort of NPOV and can be verified in already been published by reliable and reputable sources. See the list of articles under <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_Trials_3d43.html#See_also" title="Nuremberg Trials">Nuremberg_Trials#See also</a>. So if this one is removed no useful information on this page will be lost from the Wikipedia project.</li>
<li>One further possibility is as there is an <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allied_war_crimes.html" title="Allied war crimes">Allied war crimes</a> article is to move this one to <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_war_crimes.html" title="Axis war crimes">Axis war crimes</a> which would duplicate information in other lists but would give a central list for disambiguation purposes althought there is a list called <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_war_crimes.html" title="List of war crimes">List of war crimes</a> which already does this.</li>

The concept of atrocity is indeed inherently POV (your side commits atrocities, whereas mine takes extreme measures for reasons of operational necessity) ... but that doesn't stop an NPOV article being written, as reportage on the controversy. This article is actually just a list of existing articles, and it's one which a historian would find very useful -- not as an objectively accurate list of atrocities, but as a list of events which are frequently labelled as atrocities. As such, it is a very useful point of entry to the historical and historiographical debates.<br />
I think it does need an introductory section problematising the concept of "atrocity", but that's an editing issue, not grounds for deletion. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 00:19, 24 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>At the moment the list includes 3 British air raids and half a dozen American ones. As this was bombing on an industrial scale, if all the air raids throughout the war by both sides are added to this list then it will be huge. If not every air raid then which ones are chosen (Why for example is the bombing of Dresden by the British an atrocity but not the bombing of Dresden by the Americans)? Did you know that there were 262 separate air raids on Cologne alone <a href="http://www.koelnarchitektur.de/pages/de/home/news_archiv/823.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.koelnarchitektur.de/pages/de/home/news_archiv/823.htm" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>? It can not argue that some were violations of the law of war (for example because a city was undefended), because the criteria is atrocity not war crime, and some think that all civilian bombing was an atrocity (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Bell_%28bishop%29_8acd.html" title="George Bell (bishop)">Bishop G. Bell</a> for one). As it grows, I don't see how this list can be of any use to anyone as "a very useful point of entry to the historical and historiographical debates". --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 02:25, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi there, I wrote this article. I am a student from Montreal (User: Kieranfox though I'm not logged in right now) and met the author at a reading of this book. Arguments for the article: i) the author link is 'false' because I'm not aware of how to create a disambiguation and write a new author article of someone by the same name. ii) The book is not 'internet-only' but is simply available for free ALSO on the internet. I read it in a hard copy signed by the author, so I know. iii) Is the book non-notable? Have you read it? Do you have any arguments for why there is nothing notable about this book or its author? Does the fact that it is his first book make it irrelevant somehow? Please elaborate. iv) This is in no way an 'advertisement', especially considering the book is available entirely for free and no one stands to gain anything financially from this page; and as my 'relationship' to the author is, well, basically nonexistent. He signed my book once a couple years ago. I put the page up merely because the man and the book are fascinating and the information is well synthesized, PUBLISHED and available to anyone interested in reading it. I read over the What Wiki Is page. Isn't that what this site is supposed to be about, cataloguing and elucidating interesting information that has already been published and established elsewhere? Anyway I appreciate your vigilance, in that this might be construed as some crackpot simply advertising his own crap through Wiki, but honestly I would suggest you give the book a read or quick once-over (it is a short and quick read in any case) and then see if you still find its inclusion so abhorrent. Thanks. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 61.7.160.140 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_61.7.160.140_2967.html" title="Special:Contributions/61.7.160.140">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Hello there, and welcome to Wikipedia. In principle, you are quite right about what Wikipedia is - but I also suggest that you take a quick glance at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what Wikipedia is not</a> - namely, not a collection of indiscriminate information, or a catalogue of all the books in the world. That means, we only carry information on notable subjects - if we were to have an article on every pamphlet, screed, private thesis or self-published book, Wikipedia would quickly fill with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> cruft, grow unmanageavly large and lose encyclopedic value as a whole.</dd>
<dd>For this book, this means we need proof that more people than its author (and possibly you) care about it: a wide circulation, a noted scientific impact, substantial press coverage, etc., all through <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a>. Hope this helps, and have fun contributing more to Wikipedia! <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 07:15, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Sandstein. Your points are well taken, and I have included links to other press coverage that I could find in online format. I have to question the notion though that more people knowing or talking about a thing gives it more value, or a more deserving place in Wikipedia, though in essence the logic is valid... but one need only take a look at pop culture to see the flaws of this argument. I think that if you really believe it's invalid, I would ask you to read over the book (at least in part), and then decide if it is notable or not, rather than assuming that since mainstream academia has passed it by, you should too. That's all I ask. If after some reading you still think any mention of it should be obliterated here on Wiki, I won't fight with the decision. Thanks. (Kieranfox)</p>

<dd>The recently added links indicate that the book has received multiple reviews. With (weak) notability thus established, I retract the nomination and vote <b>Keep</b>. That said, no, I won't look through the book. That would be judging its <b>merit</b>, which is irrelevant to Wikipedia. Only <b>notability</b> is relevant (which is why we have an article on e.g. <a href="../../../m/e/i/Mein_Kampf_b165.html" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>). <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 09:44, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Well, it has way more information than most other lists - I can remove that information (then it would be a list like many others), but I don't see why that should make it more encyclopedic. By the way, one reason why that list contains that much information: Many of the locomotives listed there won't get a dedicated article in the foreseeable future (currently only very few have), so this way the most important data about them is nevertheless available. --<a href="../../../k/a/b/User%7EKabelleger_2a56.html" title="User:Kabelleger">Kabelleger</a> 22:29, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b>: You need not be frightened. This is pretty much standard operating procedure when someone wants an article deleted. Several of us - including me - are simply not understanding why Oxford1 wants this article deleted when you (assuming you are really the subject) seem to be notable.

<dd><b>Response</b>: Sorry you are receiving so many emails. Perhaps it would help to think about the fact that it is your notoriety which is spawning the emails.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I will likely vote delete, in view of the ostensible non-notability of the subject, but surely the reason given in the nomination is categorically insufficient for deletion. While the creator of a page certainly may make a case for deletion when he/she is the only author, this page has been edited (albeit not substantively) by sundry individuals, and it is not for the creator of the page to determine exclusively and individually its proper disposition. The information on the page does not appear to be OR and does appear to be available elsewhere on the Internet, in view of which fact it doesn't seem at all appropriate to consider whether the author (or subject) of the page desires that the information should be on the Internet. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:45, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Wikipedia is not striving to present <i>no</i> points of view. Instead, it tries to present <i>all</i> points of view without undue weight on either.

<li>Merge content into the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Unified_School_District_45b9.html" title="Central Unified School District">Central Unified School District</a> article and <b>delete</b>.

<li><b>Merge</b>. No reason to delete edit history, low likelihood of page being recreated repeatedly, so I see no reason to vote delete? Merge is just as good.
