<li><b>Speedy delete</b>: With due respect to my fellow Wikipedians, are y'all on drugs? It's a single sentence, a predicate nominative. "The sky is that thing up there." That's not an article. It's not a stub. It's a <i>fact,</i> and this particular fact is a dictionary definition. One of the oldest principles of the deletion policy is that Wikipedia is the encyclopedia, while Wiktionary is the dictionary: do not eat disk space with duplication. This thing could be deleted under G1 as a speedy delete, and it must be deleted as a dictionary definition in the regular AfD sense. If people want an article on veterinary surgery, they should write one. Until then, a dictionary definition violates policy. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:58, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. In its current state it is a one sentence "dicdef" but this subject matter clearly has the potential to move beyond anything that is suitable for a dictionary, which is why the stub should stay here in the encyclopedia. I, personally, do not feel comfortable expanding the stub due to my utter and complete lack of knowledge in this area but looking at Google, I found a number of sites with encyclopedic content that shows me the potential of this article in the right editors hands. Like <a href="http://animalpetdoctor.homestead.com/History1.html" class="external text" title="http://animalpetdoctor.homestead.com/History1.html" rel="nofollow">History of Veterinary Medicine</a>, <a href="http://www.vet.cornell.edu/about/history.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.vet.cornell.edu/about/history.htm" rel="nofollow">Cornell University's history as a leading educator in Veterinary surgery</a>, <a href="http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2003/july/Clewlow/Vet-History-Review.html" class="external text" title="http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2003/july/Clewlow/Vet-History-Review.html" rel="nofollow">Veterinary wound management with items relating to surgical care</a>, and this doesn't include all the articles that popped up recently due to interest in Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro's injury and surgery. To echo Richardcavell again, <i>this article needs authors not deletion.</i> <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 16:44, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: It needs authors <i>to begin it, as there is nothing there now that is allowable by our policies.</i> That's the problem. The amount of work the imagined and invited authors will put in is <i>total,</i> and yet the history will hold onto this inadequate insult of a fact as the origins? Why? What is the difference between what is there and nothing at all? What, <i>functionally,</i> is gained by this dictionary definition? If I were going to write on it, I would use my sneaky speedy delete super powers and then just start from scratch, as I think this kind of thing just gets in the way of an article, and it surely doesn't <i>invite</i> one. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Geogre, this is a case mark example of a <i>stub</i>. Yes, it is a humble begining but it's not insulting nor is it useless. The very purpose and benefits of stubs is that it <i>invites authors to expand it</i>. We have these stub categories so that someone who is knowledgeable in that field can look at the current stubs and work on expanding those within their realm of knowledge. I am an active watcher of the "Wine stub" category and I know I'm not alone. I would encourage the humble beginning of any wine related article because if it's taged with a "wine stub", eventually someone will get to it to make it into a great article. I am sure that there are those with Veterinary background who will come across this Veterinary related stub (which there needs to be a template for) and help expand the article. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 17:51, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
