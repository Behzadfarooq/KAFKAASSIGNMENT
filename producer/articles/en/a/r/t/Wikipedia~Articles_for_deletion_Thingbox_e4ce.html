<li><b>Keep</b>. Alexa ranking is a rather arbitrary distinction - should only sites which are above a certain point be listed? What is the cut off point? Site is fairly unique amalgam of the other gay community sites already listed on Wikipedia. Having this article gives a wider picture of the current state of play in online gay community websites.

<li><b>Comment</b> Articles about small websites need to met notability too, Thingbox clearly does not. --manchesterstudent 00:31, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm not sure a traffic ranking is the best measure for deciding whether an article is notable or not. Thingbox is a rapidly growing online community, and is already pretty well known amongst the offline gay community, whether members or not. -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorky1979_7690.html" title="User:Corky1979">Corky1979</a> 08:42, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I appreciate that - but it still need to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> - currently it doesn't. --manchesterstudent 00:31, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. First, Thingbox is mentioned in the list of applicatiions that makes use of <a href="../../../r/u/b/Ruby_on_Rails_95d8.html" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a>, and, as such, is deserving of an entry in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, unless one wishes to remove its mention all together. I think to remove its entry in this list would be a mistake, because it is the first of the <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_communities.html" title="Online communities">online communities</a> which makes use of it. So, the entry suggesting deletion of Thingbox is inaccurate in its claim that it "[d]oesn't seem notable in any way." Second, since <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gaydar.html" title="Gaydar">gaydar</a> and <a href="../../../o/u/t/OUTeverywhere_baf9.html" title="OUTeverywhere">OUTeverywhere</a> both have entries, and are otherwise not distinguished amongst the <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_communities.html" title="Online communities">online communities</a> by anything like this first use of <a href="../../../r/u/b/Ruby_on_Rails_95d8.html" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a>, I do not see why they should be treated differently by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. If Thingbox's entry goes, I think these two sites' entries should also go. <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gaydar.html" title="Gaydar">gaydar</a> is a purely commercial site, and <a href="../../../o/u/t/OUTeverywhere_baf9.html" title="OUTeverywhere">OUTeverywhere</a> has a form of restricted use unless one buys a subscription, Thingbox is, at the moment, free for anyone to use, and so seems to be more in the spirit of such sites like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch">ddstretch</a> 09:44, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As a website using new technology that is referenced elsewhere on Wikipedia, this article has merit and should be kept. <a href="../../../t/e/p/User%7ETeppic74_a359.html" title="User:Teppic74">Teppic74</a> 10:00, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> That doesn't mean it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>&#160;! --manchesterstudent 00:31, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Thingbox has become a part of the culture of <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">LGBT</a> online interaction, particularly in the UK, and as long as similar website communities are documented on Wikipedia, so must Thingbox. It is one of those strange cultural phenomena which resists clarity of description under Wikipedia's strict guidelines for articles. But if a website which constitutes such a disctinctive embodiment, and contibution to, the development of <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_communities.html" title="Online communities">online communities</a> (in technological <i>and</i> cultural terms) is absent from Wikipedia, then Wikipedia is not doing its job. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.27.65.111 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.27.65.111_cfac.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.27.65.111">contribs</a>) 07:25, July 17, 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If it is reasonable to document other gay community websites I see no reason why Thingbox should be any different. It is distinguishable from other websites by its open, unmoderated format, and while it is a small website it is gaining in popularity. Deleting the article now will not prevent users from resubmitting it at a later date when the site is larger and more popular. Therefore I believe it makes more sense to keep it now, rather than postpone the inevitable. (ajwazzer) tablet_eraser 21:21, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>You have it backwards, you are correct that readers can and should resubmit it if it becomes larger and more notable. For that reason, it's fine to delete it now and recreate if and when appropriate.

<li><b>Comment</b> Its not reasonable because it doesn't fulfill the requirement of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>! Other gay online websites (such as gaydar, out etc) do meet these requirements but, frankly, Thingbox is far too small and has no encylopaedic notability. Gaydar is a phenomonen, OUT has notability in the national press and is much larger. --manchesterstudent 00:31, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The use of a specific technology is not of itself enough reason to keep this article.

<dd>But this is not conclusive proof that I am a sockpuppet or that I have been engaged in trickery, which was what the allegation was, and for which proof was requested. All it means is that I have not made more than a few edits prior to commenting on this entry. The implication that I am therefore likely to be engaged in trickery does not follow. As <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pericles.html" title="Pericles">Pericles</a> of Athens is quoted as stating "Although only a few may initiate a policy, all may comment on it."

<li><b>Comment</b> I wouldn't say there are a lot of sockpuppets per se, but many new Wikipedia accounts and several older ones who haven't edited in a while suddenly showing up to participate here. That suggests someone is campaigning on Thingbox itself for Thingbox members to press for retention. AfD campaigning of any kind is considered a no-no; see also the "Meatpuppet" discussion at <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>.

<dd>* PHR: you assert that 'many new ... accounts ... showing up to participate here'. This simply isn't true. I'm afraid that both you and "The Stig" have fallen into what Edward de Bono calls the "Must-Be" error. Because you have seen Puppetry before where unfamiliar accounts appear on an Articles for Deletion page, you think you see it here. That is understandable. It is not the case and can be shown not to be the case. To do as GWO has done and libel these people is also understandable, but it is vile and corrosive. That you, PHR, appear to have fallen in with this I can only account for by a moment of inattention ... and it is the vulnerability of the editing process to what amount to unintentional personal attacks such as GWO's that is so distressing.</dd>

<dd>Since NONE of these accounts is new, none can possibly be either a sock- or meat-puppet. Furthermore, if you take a look, as I believe you may now have done in the case of ddstretch, you will see that none is an SPA (though Corky1979 had not yet edited his first article when you mentioned this).</dd>

<dd>I hope you will take my comment here in a spirit of good faith, since I believe you have simply fallen into an easy trap. The trap was laid more selfishly, I believe, by a libel which was not meant as a personal attack, but I suspect the product of hubris. Please don't be herded by this in future -- it doesn't make you look good. And what's more: it make me henching vex!! (this is not a good thing). I take on board your comment below about aculturation, but I hope you will agree that while my formatting may be rubbish, I have understood what is about here.</dd>

<dd>P.S. May I note here that I still have made no comment on the article itself. My knowledge of the site is through a fellow-student who mentioned this AfD page to me. I have read WP:WEB and I have a view, but I am not putting forward here an argument in favour or against deletion. Yet, it is important to include in this place the denunciation I have made of the baseless accusations of Puppetry.</dd>

<li>""Comment" The assertation in your analogy that this article is purely for the benefit of the subject of the article has little merit - any proper article benefits Wikipedia. That this article was created as a result of the <a href="../../../r/u/b/Ruby_on_rails.html" title="Ruby on rails">Ruby_on_rails</a> article should stand some way towards showing the deciding admin that this is not an act of spam or aggressive commercialism. Finally, Phr should join thingbox - he might enjoy it. Allotriophagy 20:00, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Referring further to Allotriophagy (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Allotriophagy_4576.html" title="Special:Contributions/Allotriophagy">contribs</a>)'s comment, I initially created this article because there was a broken reference to Thingbox on the <a href="../../../r/u/b/Ruby_on_rails.html" title="Ruby on rails">Ruby_on_rails</a> article (present in all edits) as a notable example of Rails technology in use. Edit history will show I fixed the link immediately after creating the missing article. <a href="../../../t/e/p/User%7ETeppic74_a359.html" title="User:Teppic74">Teppic74</a> 20:55, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Ruby on Rails does not make it notable per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a></li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I've logged onto this website and found the forums urging people to vote in favour of keeping this article. There is probably sock puppetry going on too. As a result, this entry will probably get more keeps than deletes. The number of unregistered comments (and keep votes from people without day to day editing experience of wikipedia) suggest this is being portrayed as a vote. However, the AFD process is not a vote - its a balancing act. Clearly this article does not meet the requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If we were being very flexible and allowing Alexa to have a say in this, we can even see then that the website is not notable at all. Other LGBT websites such as gaydar and out are notable by their size, press commentry and, as such, meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Thingbox does not. One day it might. But for the moment, Thingbox is not encylopaedic at all. --manchesterstudent 00:31, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Please do not spam this AfD with the same comment over and over again. Also please do not try to sway the argument with false information (there are no forums urging people to 'vote') and with your own speculation. <a href="../../../t/e/p/User%7ETeppic74_a359.html" title="User:Teppic74">Teppic74</a> 09:51, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>IN RESPONSE TO A QUERY TO <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp">alphachimp</a>, I HAVE POSTED THE FOLLOWING ON HIS TALK PAGE SEEKING ADVICE ON <a href="../../../g/w/o/User%7EGWO_480b.html" title="User:GWO">GWO who claims to be "The Stig" on Top Gear</a>'s libelous posting above.</p>
<p>I think you have elided away from the point, <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp">User:alphachimp</a>, or at least as far as the events are significant to me.</p>
<p>The objector made a direct accusation without supplying any supporting evidence. As I know that several of the contributors to the AfD page are distinct carbon-based humanoids, he has libeled them all. Furthermore, he has brought the discussion to a halt by libelling any subsequent contributor who opposes deletion. I am not, by using a legal term, advising a legal remedy -- that way madness and bankruptcy lie! I am simply pointing out that there is a reason in law why it is wrongful to make false accusations and I would ask you to point me to the appropriate rememdy within Wikipedia for an unsupported accusation against fellow contributors.</p>
<p>A bun-fight on the AfD page is not a satisfactory remedy.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/w/o/User%7EGWO_480b.html" title="User:GWO">User:GWO</a> must either present evidence to support his claim or retract it. How do I invoke this challenge?</p>
<p>The objector's posting was directly responsible for my NOT putting forward a new argument in favour of retention. What am I to do to prevent being subject to this 'prior restraint' which he has invoked?</p>
<p>FYI - the original posting:</p>
<pre>
   * Delete, nn website indulging in shocking sock puppetry. -- GWO
</pre>
<p>May I also clarify my motivations:</p>
<p>it is not 'offence' or 'indignation' at having been bullied out of an AfD. It is the fact that the actions of a contributor on an AfD page have been highly disruptive to the editing process. -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.35.164.244 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.35.164.244_0f86.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.35.164.244">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Hi, you might read <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html#Accounts_created_by_brand_new_users_acting_together_.28.27meatpuppets.27.29" title="WP:SOCK">this section</a> of the page about sockpuppet policy to understand what GWO was referring to. Basically, AfD's are supposed to be discussions within the regular Wikipedia editing community; newcomers (especially those who show up specifically for some single discussion) are welcome to participate but their conclusions are traditionally given less weight (or none) when determining consensus. In this instance I think that should also apply to nonactive accounts that suddenly woke up for this discussion. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 11:22, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So, what would you say was "nonactivity"? Remember, you probably have to be precise to avoid bringing about even more problems. For example, I made a few edits before, when I first joined, and then was away, abroad (in China) where access was difficult and eventually blocked for many months. In fact, whilst I was away I consciously used some of this time to gather more information which I hoped, and am intending, to use to expand a few entries concerning places in China (<a href="../../../z/h/a/Zhangjiajie.html" title="Zhangjiajie">Zhangjiajie</a> and Zhangjiajie City to name just two instances.) I think a whole new can of worms could be opened up if this idea of "nonactive" accounts is suddenly applied without prior warning. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch">ddstretch</a> 11:37, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../w/i/k/WP%7EWikilawyering_fdcf.html" title="WP:Wikilawyering">WP:Wikilawyering</a> is not a good strategy. No, I don't need to be precise, there are no set rules, we are allowed to react to situations as they arise, and the closing admin will read over the different comments and then use their discretion and wisdom to do something sensible. The admins are not robots who are constrained to follow formulas; we delegate them the authority to handle these things as judgement calls when necessary, because we trust their judgement.
<p>It looks to me like you made an account, played with it a little, and abandoned it, a very common fate of Wikipedia accounts (something like 3/4 of them have never edited at all). Then someone brought this AfD to the attention of Thingbox members and you came over from there. Please do edit some of the China articles (and anything else that interests you) but until you actually do participate like that (rather than merely intending to), we have to think of you as a non-participant. Also, even if you had been editing regularly, the mere act of coming over because of an external campaign is itself reason to make adjustments (see <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html#Advertising_and_soliciting_meatpuppets" title="WP:SOCK">here</a>); it's just easier to infer what likely happened, given your contrib history. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 12:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of course, it is interesting to read the comments made about people perceived to be "newcomers" in the light of the following section: <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers</a>, in particular, this passage: "Do not call newcomers disparaging names, such as "meatpuppet". If a lot of newcomers show up on one side of a vote, you should make them feel welcome while explaining that their votes may be disregarded. No name-calling is necessary." Some have done this more than others. I do not count <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">user:Phr</a> as being one of them. Thanks for the explanation, Phr, but I can only reiterate that your inference is, in my case, inaccurate. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch">ddstretch</a> 16:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I saw the reception was a bit unfriendly, and that's why I supplied those links that explained the terminology and logic in ways that were hopefully less upsetting. We should have been more conscientious about welcoming newbies even in difficult circumstances; but I hope you can sympathize at least slightly to the reaction we have (especially since this happens quite often) to being jumped on like this. Imagine a few dozen Wikipedians suddenly showing up at Thingbox without knowing anything about Thingbox's culture, trying to get Thingbox to display some article about Wikipedia for Wikipedia's benefit, without regards to Thingbox's usual habits about that kind of article, and expecting to have the same amount of say in such decisions as regular Thingbox participants who had been there for a while. I think it wouldn't go over much better than this AfD has gone.
<p>I see that we agree now that Thingbox doesn't meet the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidelines. See also <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#How_not_to_be_a_spammer" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM#How not to be a spammer</a> (the "review your intentions" paragraph), understand that Wikipedia is in the 20 largest web sites on the whole internet, realize we're <i>constantly</i> bombarded by people trying to sell products or gain notoriety by putting stuff in front of our readers because they know the value of that much advertising, and understand that we know exactly what it is that they want. It's a perpetual battle to stick to our goal of being an encyclopedia and not an advertising service and we very frequently have to tell (e.g.) up-and-coming musicians claiming to be on the verge of "making it" to come back <i>after</i> they've made it, not before. This is pretty similar--if the article gets deleted, I advise waiting a few months and examining the guidelines before trying again (assuming you meet the guidelines by then, which you very well might), and don't organize a campaign, those (as you see) tend to go over badly. I hope that helps you understand the situation a little better. -- <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 18:08, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>hello - i don't quite know how to post this but - well the thing is - i find the idea of suppressing the existance of the thingbox site rather sinister - and very sad given that it is a community site that exists for gay and lesbian people to better be able to get in touch with each other. Given the extremeness of the slightness of some entries on Wiki - and given that nobody is being forced to the info on Thingbox - I can only conclude that the wish to have it removed is for political or vindictive reasons - and frankly the idea that that sort of behaviour should be successful would be a tragedy for the Wiki. Thanks for reading this. *</li>

<dd>Thingbox, like other social networking "sites" does not merit inclusion because of the notoriety of it's web-only content. It merits an article because of the social activity of human communities bound through on-line communication. Like geographically-bound communities, there is not the same threshold of notability -- Wikipedia would not delete an article about a village because it was not frequently mentioned in the press, or was not utterly unique. Thingbox merits inclusion as one of many LGBT social networking communities in just the same way as Saxmundham merits inclusion as one of a number of Suffolk geographic communities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It should be sufficient to demonstrate that a sufficiently distinct activity took place, involving a significant number of people over a significant period of time for the activity to merit inclusion. This is not a static website and it is not the content per se which is notable.</dd>
</dl>
