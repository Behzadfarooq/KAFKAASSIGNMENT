<p>The result of the debate was <b>REDIRECT</b> to <i>Afro</i>. Mass-sockpuppetry aside, there is still no outright consensus to delete here, with many preferring a redirect instead (though relying rather heavily on a previous AfD, when really this AfD is about...this AfD). Still, there is literally minimal support for the article to standalone, so I figure a redirect is likely to displease people the least. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:45, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There was already a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jewfro_5d98.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jewfro">consensus</a> to have the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewfro.html" title="Jewfro">Jewfro</a> article become a redirect to <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro.html" title="Afro">Afro</a>, to which the contents of the article were merged into. During this process, I made a redirect <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew-fro.html" title="Jew-fro">Jew-fro</a> to <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro.html" title="Afro">Afro</a>. This was back on Janurary 15. However, the original creator of the article, after several failed attempts to erase the redirect on the main <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewfro.html" title="Jewfro">Jewfro</a> page, has decided today that the old AFD ruling does not apply to Jew-fro (and only to Jewfro), and has recreated the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewfro.html" title="Jewfro">Jewfro</a> article in <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew-fro.html" title="Jew-fro">Jew-fro</a> as it was before it was merged. I tried reasoning with him, but after facing intransigance and personal attacks on his part, decided to relist it here. <b><a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><font color="blue">Wh</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="#0AB20D">e</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><font color="blue">re</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhere_05e5.html" title="User talk:Where"><font color="#0099FF">(talk)</font></a></sup></b> 20:25, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Where, so not only do u seem to have a problem with Jewish concepts, but now you have a problem with democratic procedures? I think we should change this site to "where-pedia" and then people would only print things that Where deems to be okay. Furthermore, if this information is in afro, then depending on the outcome of this vote we will either have to keep it in there or remove it:) .Perhaps they are "sockpuppets", but i don't think there is a way to prove that, so we will just have to rely on good faith.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I voted keep last time and still believe that the article works fine on its own. Of course, <b>I wrote most of it</b> so maybe I'm biased. Nevertheless, sticking it in the middle of Afro essentially does a disservice to both articles. On a side note, I'm somewhat bemused by the ardent calls to respect the previous AfD outcome. Considering how freqently articles are nominated and renominated, sometimes three or four times, sometimes in the same week, until they are eventually deleted, at which point they become speedily deletable as recreations of previously deleted material, the editors who have waited some months to recreate Jewfro have shown significant restraint. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:34, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>But is this the place to withdraw a previous AFD decision? If this is a keep, then we will have Jewfro mentioned in two different articles.

<li>I think that Jewfro should have its own article, and I voted that way in the original AFD. But that AFD is closed, and this isn't the place to try and resurrect it - deletion review is.

<li>Considering that you nominated the article for deletion, hence reopening the previous AfD, I don't see why we can't discuss the article.

<li>The bottom line is that AfDs are really only closed as keep or delete. A close as merge or redirect is in fact equal to keep. I can point you to many Afds that were closed as merge where editors at the target refused the merge and so it was not carried out. I could also point you to many Afds closed as Keep where editors who had voted delete immediately redirected the article. That is actually extremely frequent. Your point about page deletion is not correct. Recreation of previously deleted material can be speedied. Hence, it requires DRV. However, there is nothing to review regarding the close of the previous Jewfro Afd since the material was not deleted. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:40, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's a somewhat idiosyncratic interpretation of the previous AfD, because the result was merge, which is exactly what was done- the article was merged and it is substantially longer than a dicdef. Afro had limited material related to Jewfro prior to the merge. Furthermore, if I add much more to the article, it would most probably have to be demerged anyway because it would overpower Afro. Nevertheless, that doesn't expalin why you feel the need to call it "non-encyclopedic" but also state that you agree with the previous AfD where the material was retained. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:22, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, I see where you're confused. Merge here on AfD means "merge and redirect," which was in fact the consensus of the prior AfD.

Where it belonged was determined to be <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro.html" title="Afro">Afro</a>.

<dd>I have to agree with you about the CSD, JJay. The previous AFD closed with a deletion in a figurative sense, but not in a literal sense, and only the latter matters with G4. Regarding the warnings, however, I think we do need two, as each warning serves a different purpose. The first warning (in blue) is addressed to the closing admin, and the second warning is addresseed to Whoermaster (and possible his/her friends). <b><a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><font color="blue">Wh</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="#0AB20D">e</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><font color="blue">re</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhere_05e5.html" title="User talk:Where"><font color="#0099FF">(talk)</font></a></sup></b> 12:56, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
