Anyhow, the purpose of this specific page is to vote whether the article should be deleted or otherwise; - thus try to come up with an intellectual reasoning, as to why this article should be kept, rather than bombarding us with abbreviations.

<li>'<b>Delete</b>. The source "<b><a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/home.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/home.asp" rel="nofollow">Ethnologue</a></b>" is a private and commercial company website with no academic credentials. I have been accused of targeting Turkish oriented articles, that is not true. I am against Turkey-ish propaganda machine -- Unfortunately these articles are fictitious and propagated by some individuals who are in quest for a false identity, by preying on other nations’ historical achievements as theirs – It seems this has become a habit of nationalist myth-making, like Himmler's Tibetan Aryans, French Gauls or King Fuad's Pharaonism; Ataturk’ government first laid claim over Hittite Empire as the ancient Turks, and when Germans point out to him, about their Indo-European race, they laid claim over Macedonians, Sumerians, then Scythians, Parthians, Germans, Etruscans … and now these fictitious entries. Be happy with what you are – what is the point of creating a false identity, when the truth will eventually prevail? The concept of this article is equivalent in creating an article called <b>Los-Angeles -Turkish Language</b>, since immigrant Turks live in Los-Angeles -- The entry therefore is POVs, and politically motivated.

<li>Your statement above carries much more POV and confused notions than what you are blaming the others for, I am sorry to say. "by preying on other nations’ historical achievements as theirs"? Please.. Besides, you seem to be confused with your research as well: Ataturk never said that Hitites were ancient Turks (as "Turks" of Central Asia) - he said that the "Turks" of <i>today</i> are the descendants of all those peoples that have lived in and migrated to Anatolia since the Hitites. <i>In fact,</i> that's perfectly in line with the academic studies. I know that there is a lot of half-truths and character assassinations going around all over the Internet, but please do your research better. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 15:54, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yukichigai, I'm afraid you're wrong again. You should familiarize yourself with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, websites like ataturk.com are not considered reliable sources. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">Mardavich</a> 22:18, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Neither of you have provided evidence to back that claim. So far the two sites check out fine. Ethnologue is simply the web version of a published textbook, which is considered notable <i>and</i> (reasonably) reliable, evidenced by the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologue.html" title="Ethnologue">Wikipedia article on it</a>. Ataturk is a non-profit organization which has been in existence for 10 years, which (from what I can find on it) exists merely to provide information on Turkey and Turkish-related topics. I fail to see how either fails <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, as I can find plenty of qualifying reasons, but none to disqualify either as a source. Unless you can provide some clear reason why they should be excluded your "arguments" (such as they are) would seem null and void. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 22:29, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, ataturk.com is not a reliable source pr all the other reasons I already outlined, it's just a fan website of Atatürk as notable and reliable as any other random fan website of a former king or president that could be set up by anyone from anywhere in the world, the website doesn't even have a declared editorial policy or a listed author, let alone an academic expert. It's pretty obvious that ataturk.com is not a reliable source, you seem to just want to argue for the sake of arguing. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">Mardavich</a> 10:16, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> -- Do you know what the word "academic" means? Do you ever read the pages that you quote from -- or you just have the habit of going around and shooting yourself in the leg? Ethnologue is not an academic establishment. However few entries from that page that you have kindly equipped us with:
<ol>
<li>The neutrality of Ethnologue as a scientific institution is sometimes disputed.</li>
<li>Ethnologue contains its fair share of errors.</li>
<li>SIL, the foundation behind Ethnologue has been accused of being involved in politics.</li>

<dd>You have a remarkable talent for attempting to change the rules you yourself set forth in the middle of the discussion. You ask for a scholarly source, and despite the fact that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> do not have such a requirement (merely an option to meet the inherant requirements set forth) you are provided with one. Then you declare it invalid because "it isn't an academic institution". It is an academic reference book, used by many schools and learning institutions, created by an organization that when it first published the book <i>was</i> a school. I don't know what <i>you</i> call "academic", but that fits the term just fine by me. Incidentally, the phrase you're looking for is, "shooting yourself in the <i>foot</i>," not <i>leg</i>. Also, you can lead a horticulture, but you can't make her think. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 03:33, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
