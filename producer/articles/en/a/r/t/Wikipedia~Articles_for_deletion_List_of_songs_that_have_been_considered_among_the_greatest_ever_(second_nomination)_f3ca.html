<dd>Also, the "people listing their favorite songs here" bias can be remedied by simply requiring that all entries on the list have sources saying that, and/or why, critics/magazines/etc. have named them the best songs.

<dd><b>Comment</b> In response to Idont Havaname, I highly doubt that a remedy, should one exist, would not be as simple as you suggest. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of 'best song' lists out there published by various magazines and well-established music critics and all people will have to do is find which ones include their favorites and then use them to source and validate their claims. It is conceivably possible that songs could require a large number of prominent sources, say 8 or 9, to show their universal appeal but I doubt that would ever come to pass. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:18, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b>, but I really mean merge, because this list contains some songs that <b>must</b> be on such a list and which are inexplicably missing from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_in_English_labeled_the_best_ever_ffa8.html" title="List of songs in English labeled the best ever">List of songs in English labeled the best ever</a>, unless I missed them somehow.
