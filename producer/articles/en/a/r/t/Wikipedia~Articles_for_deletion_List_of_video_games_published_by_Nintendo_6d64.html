<li><b>Delete</b>, useless as a list. Let's see how many people claim that categories are never redundant with lists. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 04:39, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Converting into a category will lose data, for instance the date the game was released, and for what platform it was released for. The game output of one single company is not untrackable; I'm not convinced this is unmaintainable. There's plenty of manpower on WP that can make timely updates on video games. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 04:57, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If that data's not in the articles themselves, Wikipedia's in worse shape than we thought. <b>Delete</b>. --<b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumblefool_50e8.html" title="User:Humblefool">humble</a></b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumblefool_8320.html" title="User talk:Humblefool">fool</a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">®</a> 06:07, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>(I knew someone would make this counter argument.) The difference between this list and having the data in every article is that you dont need to access 200+ articles to get the same kind of information. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 17:44, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. First off, this isn't just a combination of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_NES_games_1ff7.html" title="List of NES games">List of NES games</a>, etc. These are games actually published <i>by Nintendo</i> themselves, and the list isn't likely to grow threefold overnight as some seem to speculate. Also, I find the argument stating that it's already in categories to be invalid -- a lot of these games simply do not even have their own articles, and the information would not exist elsewhere on Wikipedia if not for this article. --<a href="../../../c/z/j/User%7ECzj_f490.html" title="User:Czj">Czj</a> 06:19, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a given that redlinks will be lost when this or any other article is removed. This argument could be applied to <i>any</i> article (even one comprised entirely of redlinks) so I don't think it's a valid argument for keeping. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 07:30, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It discriminates quite nicely. See, if it isn't published by Nintendo, it doesn't go in the list. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:31, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Sorts the games in a different manner than the categories (bu year and by console). Not unmaintainable since there the number of games is reasonable. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:35, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not unmaintainable, not indiscriminate. <b>Weak Keep</b> per <a href="../../../c/z/j/User%7ECzj_f490.html" title="User:Czj">Czj</a> - <span style="background-color:black; color:white; font-family:serif;"><a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmists_8945.html" title="User:Amists"><font color="white">Amists</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmists_986b.html" title="User talk:Amists"><font color="white">talk</font></a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Amists_d22c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Amists"><font color="white">contribs</font></a></sup></span> 10:53, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as it's already been said the genre of items that can go in here are quite narrow. Only games that nintendo has actually published can go in here. Given that Nintendo themselves publish (I think) abouit 10-20 games per year at the most it's not likely that this is going to become unusable. Not to mention the games are uite nicely partitioned by year so it is useful for research if needed, or just browsing Nintendo's history <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHairRef_3d4b.html" title="User:BigHairRef">BigHairRef</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHairRef_5c72.html" title="User talk:BigHairRef">Talk</a> 10:59, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I hate listcruft and think most lists fall under this category. However, this is not listcruft but is rather an example of an appropriate type of list. Clear and narrow guidelines and a good way of categorizing games. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 11:11, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>strong keep</b> The best kind of list has narrow scope, includes information (such as chronology) that can't be conveyed by categories, and can include red links for articles that don't (yet) exist. This is exactly such a list. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 16:07, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> umaintainable? Couldn't we just look up Nintendo's website for new releases? Indiscriminate? How is having an article listing only the games by one particular company indiscriminate?

<li><b>Keep</b> it's maintainable as it is only one company. Only using categories would get rid of useful and important data such as release dates and platforms.

<li><b>Keep</b> It's easily maintainable, and provides more info on one page than a catagory could. Perhaps make tables showing even more detail? Perhaps include Developers? Month of release?

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> A long list article is not grounds for deletion, nor is this unmaintainable or indiscriminate. Nintendo is a major publisher of video games, even before they had their own consoles, they were making games. We should have articles on most of their video games, so why not this list which organizes how their games were released?
