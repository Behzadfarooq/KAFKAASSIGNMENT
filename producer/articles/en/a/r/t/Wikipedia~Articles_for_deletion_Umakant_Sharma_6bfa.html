<p>Non-notability: all this man has done is to cheat at chess: at best this is an ephemeral story; it is not at all notable and he is not at all notable in wiki terms. <a href="../../../s/p/r/User%7ESpringnuts_c117.html" title="User:Springnuts">Springnuts</a> 06:21, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> requires either a professional competition or the "highest level" of amateur competion; according to the news sources, he was only competing at a club/regional level when discovered, rather than a national level. I think that brings him below the threshold of notability. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 06:36, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s guideline that he compete at the highest level is only one criteria for inclusion, and the fact that he doesn't compete at that level does not exclude him from an entry.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> (as main article contributor) - <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says that an individual must be in multiple, non trivial sources. THe story was linked to on the main page of CNN.COM in the technology section. The references section gets information from the article from 4 sources that are pretty reliable. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> also says, "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events, such as by being assassinated." While cheating at chess is not being assasinated, his involvement gave him notoriety in an newsworthy event (being covered by several sites and online newspaper). Google news serch comes up with 66 stories. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 06:43, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article said he started with a rating of 1933 and increased over 500 points to 1484. Surely these numbers are garbled or reversed. I also don't know what the Indian ratings mean. But if he is less than a master both before and after, he is not notable as a chess player. Perhaps some of this material could be incorporated in an article on <i>cheating in chess</i>, though.--<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkOink_a997.html" title="User:OinkOink">OinkOink</a> 06:58, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Its one of the cases where the subject is <i>famous</i> (or rather got a lot of publicity from non-trivial sources) but NOT <i>notable</i>. Its a "slow news day" filler story, like "man gets foot stuck in grate, causes traffic jam". In such a case, although the story gets published everywhere, the person is clearly not notable. At best, this person gets a mention in the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheating.html" title="Cheating">cheating</a> article.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> He's been noted multiple times in the media. <del>Deletion potentially smacks of ethnocentrism (most of the media sources are from India).</del> Nothing mentioned in the nomination is a valid reason for removal. It sounds like a notable item in the history of chess playing. All of the arguments above that argued for deletion are based on the subjective <i>opinion</i> that this person is either ephemeral (how would you know? we're not a crystal ball) or that he's "just a regional player," which isn't relavent to the fact that he's made himself notable by other things (cheating). <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 18:28, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The information is notable, but functions more effectively in an article on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheating_in_chess.html" title="Cheating in chess">Cheating in chess</a> than a biography. It's hard to imagine a bio on Umakant Sharma ever attaining FA status, unless he further distinguishes himself by other "achievements."

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Article is backed by several (strong) non-trivial sources – OK, so subject is notable because of what he did rather than what he is, but that is besides the point.
