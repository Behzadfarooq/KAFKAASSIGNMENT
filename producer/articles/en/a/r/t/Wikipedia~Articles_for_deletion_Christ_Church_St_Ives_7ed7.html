<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. I tried to find a way to save this, I really did, but the notability is not there, even after the cleanup. The references are weak, and nothing in the text of the article in any way asserts its notability. The closest I could find was "In 1990 the Christ Church congregation was the third largest in Sydney". Not only is this not notable, but the stat is unreferenced and 16 years old. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 02:09, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - if it is extremely notable, then its importance should be evident within the article. All the article claims is that is is a "large" church. --<a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 21:33, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And I totally understand why you think it isn't notable. However, the fact that the article is written poorly is totally seperate to the fact that the church is notable. Just because we have a bad article on Wikipedia does not make the church any more or less notable. Personally, I'm working on Patriot Act articles, which are even <i>more</i> notable, otherwise I'd do something about it. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 14:51, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Presumably 5 days was deemed significant time to improve any article, or at least put it on the road to improvement, if you think it's too short then maybe suggest so over at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 00:13, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Had something in the article as it was originally written given evidence to its notability, it would have been tagged with one of the cleanup tags rather than afd. As there was no assertion of notability originally, it was flagged as non-notable and tagged for deletion. This ensuing debate is a process by which such issues are worked out -- and final determination is made by an admin after sufficient debate has passed. There is an improvement tag that can be used to tag an article as "under improvement", (I forget the tag), but I'd assert that articles should either first be developed as a User Subpage until they are adequate enough to enter the article section, or are tagged by the author as needing expansion. My very humble opinion anyway. --<a href="../../../c/p/a/User%7ECPAScott_7db1.html" title="User:CPAScott">CPAScott</a> 17:01, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - this article has now been fixed up. The things that make it look like an advertisement have been removed, and some notable history has been included in the article.

<li>On notability: it gets mentioned (&gt;15 times over the last 20 years, I can only go back to 1987) in the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) a bit (usually as "<i>Rev Dr John Woodhouse, Rector of Christ Church, St Ives, who will...</i>" etc), but it also has had a couple of articles discussing the history and congregation figures in the SMH (they are now references in the article). There isn't much, if anything, in other big newspapers. In 1990 it was the third largest congregation in Sydney. There was a book published in 1990 (~126 pages, see the <i>Further reading</i> section in the aritcle), I think the church itself published it, but it is available at some academic libraries. Seems like a <b>keep</b> to me.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Keane_ca6f.html" title="User:Commander Keane">Commander Keane</a> 10:25, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
