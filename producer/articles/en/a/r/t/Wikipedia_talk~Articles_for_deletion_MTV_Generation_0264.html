	    <p>Just zis Guy, you know? --You're right, the MTV Generation is a legitimate term around the world. Brooke Heitz says that some people believe the early days of MTV brought in a new generation of TV watchers. (MTV was founded in 1981)<a href="http://www.siue.edu/ALESTLE/library/SPRING2001/feb13/mtv.html" class="external free" title="http://www.siue.edu/ALESTLE/library/SPRING2001/feb13/mtv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.siue.edu/ALESTLE/library/SPRING2001/feb13/mtv.html</a></p>
<p>Around the world, MTV has had a great influence. The Sangai Express "Call(s) it cultural invasion or whatever, but none can deny the fact that MTV has had a profound effect on the way our youngsters conduct themselves, from the way they dress up to the way they use the English language peppered with 'MTV Talk'. <a href="http://www.e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=news_section.editorial.mtv_generation" class="external free" title="http://www.e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=news_section.editorial.mtv_generation" rel="nofollow">http://www.e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=news_section.editorial.mtv_generation</a> MTV broadcasts to countries all over the world and the MTV-generation has become a global phenomena, with the same music and lifestyle dreams all over the world. <a href="http://www.splintermind.com/ntarchive/mtv.html" class="external free" title="http://www.splintermind.com/ntarchive/mtv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.splintermind.com/ntarchive/mtv.html</a></p>
<p>MTV can refer to both Generation X and Y because MTV continues to market to teenagers. The Kaiser Family Foundation refers to the MTV generation as 16-to 24- year-olds in 1997 (born mid-late 70s) <a href="http://www.kff.org/entmedia/Reaching-the-MTV-Generation.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.kff.org/entmedia/Reaching-the-MTV-Generation.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kff.org/entmedia/Reaching-the-MTV-Generation.cfm</a></p>
<p>Other websites equate the MTV Generation with Generation X. <a href="http://www.ncbuy.com/credit/articles/01_10523.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ncbuy.com/credit/articles/01_10523.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbuy.com/credit/articles/01_10523.html</a> <a href="http://www.dailyegyptian.com/fall01/09-19-01/apathy.html" class="external free" title="http://www.dailyegyptian.com/fall01/09-19-01/apathy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailyegyptian.com/fall01/09-19-01/apathy.html</a> <a href="http://www.hotjobs-coolcommunities.com/news/articles/article.cfm?ArticleID=260" class="external free" title="http://www.hotjobs-coolcommunities.com/news/articles/article.cfm?ArticleID=260" rel="nofollow">http://www.hotjobs-coolcommunities.com/news/articles/article.cfm?ArticleID=260</a> <a href="http://www.asne.org/kiosk/archive/convention/conv96/genx.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.asne.org/kiosk/archive/convention/conv96/genx.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.asne.org/kiosk/archive/convention/conv96/genx.htm</a></p>
<p>Others refer to it as generation y <a href="http://www.freecongress.org/commentaries/2005/050824.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.freecongress.org/commentaries/2005/050824.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.freecongress.org/commentaries/2005/050824.asp</a> <a href="http://www.mercatus.org/article.php/909.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mercatus.org/article.php/909.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercatus.org/article.php/909.html</a> <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0MJT/is_6_14/ai_112905386" class="external free" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0MJT/is_6_14/ai_112905386" rel="nofollow">http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0MJT/is_6_14/ai_112905386</a> It seems MTV can be associated with both generations, yet could be split up into decades based on different musical tastes during corresponding decades: teens of the 80s, 90s, and 2000s.</p>
<p>The MTV Generation article deals with two conflicting things: musical influence and generations. When I first came along to the website, it was because Piecraft was causing a ruckus in the Generation X talk page. It was a group in and of itself separate from Gen X and Y born 1977-85, much like Generation Jones. He pointed to specific musical and media influences from the 90s which appealed to teenagers at that time to prove that we were a different generation. That's when the problems started. People from Generation X and Y were threatened by the fact that the tail end and the beginning part wanted to be part of something else. They pointed to the fact that this generation was never discussed in Strauss and Howe's book on generations; that even though Generation Jones is well documented, a separate group from 1977-85 really didn't exist according to their POV; that MTV was not unique to only this group. I didn't see any problem with it because my POV supported it. I tried to add the list of celebrities, much like Generation X and Y articles had. Quickly, someone listed it for deletion, and Piecraft stormed out. After he quit, people listed this page for deletion as well. They started to question whether the MTV generation was a gap between X and Y. So, that's why I deleted all of the bands, Tv Shows (or moved them to the talk page) and decided to rename it because many people were claiming that this had nothing to do with the subject of generations and had more to do with MTV's influence on us.</p>
<p>So, now we have Andylkl coming over and saying it looks like a tornado because I removed all of that stuff. How will this work? On the one hand, there are people who want to talk about MTV's unique musical influence on 1977-84 (because we were immersed by it since we were little kids) and on the other hand, there is I, who wants to show that we are a cusp who are either, neither (because of our unique experiences in the world by being teenagers in the 1990s, which neither X nor Y can claim), or both comparable to Gen Jones. Since I couldn't find information about the MTV generation being a separate generation from X and Y, then I decided to not refer to it as a generation, but a group of some sort, still parallel to Generation Jones. I'm starting to question whether these are two separate subjects that shouldn't be on the same page. One going to the influence of MTV and the other going to Generations. However, even Generation Jones refers to music and television as part of generational identity. <a href="http://www.generationjones.com/files/zone/home2.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.generationjones.com/files/zone/home2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.generationjones.com/files/zone/home2.htm</a> I figured that maybe there should be a site for all this stuff that 90s teens went through outside of wikipedia comparable to Generation Jones, while still keeping a reference to a cusp that existed between X and Y here on wikipedia and then a page for the "MTV generation" as defined by the above sources but having nothing to do with 77-85 or covering a large span of birth years possibly from 1955-2000. It seems this page will be devoted to MTV generation and my subject has to go somewhere else. So, I've just deleted a lot of stuff. I hope Andylkl keeps that old version. r430nb</p>

<dd>For starters could both of you please type ~~~~ at the end of your comments? This will generate your signature and timestap. The above conversation is a bit confusing, since the comments and replies above is a bit hard at the moment. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_090d.html" title="User:Andylkl">Andylkl</a> <sup>[ <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndylkl_776e.html" title="User talk:Andylkl">talk!</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Andylkl_d01c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Andylkl">c</a> ]</sup> 08:29, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
