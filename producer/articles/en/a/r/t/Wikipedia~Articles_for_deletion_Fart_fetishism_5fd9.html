<li>no vote from me but I will offer the following: " '<b>Flatulence</b> (Flatuphilia, Eproctolagniac and Eproctophilia - arousal from flatulence) Flatulence refers to the passing of intestinal gas. The French once had a stage act where a performer attracted large paying crowds merely to watch him pass gas.

<li>Comment: It makes me sad to notice that articles touching on human sexual behaviour are voted to be deleted much easier than articles on other subjects, no matter how unimportant in an "encyclopedic" sense they are. I hope no one makes his judgement by his personal disgust against an article. I addmit that these things have been a problem on Internet. The problem is to find correct and objective information on sexual behaviour related things when wanted and only when wanted, and I see Wikipedia as the best place for this. wikipedia being the worlds number one source for objective information. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEasyas12c_219d.html" title="User:Easyas12c">Easyas12c</a> 17:39, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: I don't think a general encyclopedia needs to probe the outer reaches of weirdness when it comes to human behaviour in general, or sexuality specifically. For example, I'm sure there are a variety of different forms of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibalism.html" title="Cannibalism">Cannibalism</a>, and we could disgust almost everybody (and fascinate a few, I suppose) by having articles describing each of them in detail. This article isn't quite that bad, but flatuphilia must be several standard deviations from the norm of sexual behaviour. If you have some evidence that it isn't, then by all means present it. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:49, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. That is what I meant by the "outer reaches of weirdness". People are fairly weird in general, and there are plenty of weird human practices that are extremely common and notable, (such as, oh, religion for example). However, something so far out on the fringe that (a) practically nobody does it; and (b) practically no one has ever heard of it -- is not notable or encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 21:28, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If "people are fairly weird in general" then their "weird" practices are by definition encyclopedic - this particular fetish included. I'm interested to known what you mean by "practically nobody does it" and "practically nobody has ever heard of it", considering there has been to my knowledge no scientific study of the practice, so its actual prevalence is unknown, and that people such as myself, who have no interest in the "outer reaches of sexual weirdness" <i>have</i> actually heard of it.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 02:29, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Apparently between inclusionists and people who believe essentially that all forms of sexual behaviour are notable and fit for an encyclopedia article, Wikipedia <b>is</b>, in fact, going to be the on-line Encyclopedia of Unusual Sexual Practices. I don't know if this is because fetishists are over-represented amongst Wikipedia editors or whether it is a bending-over-backwards to be open-minded. Hopefully the latter. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:37, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> It is safe to assume that most people with paranormal thoughts/desires who cannot express them outwardly will seek refuge as anonymous internet users; they usually become heavy users. So it is logical to follow that the percentage of fetishists within the online community is MUCH higher than that of the offline population. This argument could answer BM's question of fetishists being over-represented amongst wikipedians; but could also be used as a supporting notion to Keep the article since wikipedia is an <b>online</b> encyclopedia which serves the online community with all its deviations.I personally don't support this because I think wikipedia should represent the better side of the online community and not the darker. I think that the result will be in favor of keeping the article which is a shame really because wikipedia will lose credibility when an article like this pops up as a random page on some innocent first-time-user's screen. <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmar_Filini_43d3.html" title="User:Omar Filini">Omar Filini</a> 18:19, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The whole fart diaries part is unencyclopedic as it seems to be a very minor, non-notable phenomenon (&lt;50 unique Google hits for "fart diary", only 2 relevant hits for "fart diaries"). Ignoring that, what's left is the fact that (1) such a fetish exists and (2) it can be combined with domination practices, and I fail to see why these two tiny tidbits of information should be granted an article of their very own separate from <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flatulence.html" title="Flatulence">flatulence</a>. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 23:39, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It amazes me how people describe entities as notable or not notable based on google search results! As I said the internet is a great medium for the spread of pornography, especially perverse pornography .. and thus you will find that almost all of your wildest sexual fantasies are found notably by google the great! You will get 105,000 search results for Fart Fetish (Notable) but only 59,000 search results for Nobel Laureate <a href="../../../n/a/g/Naguib_Mahfouz_211a.html" title="Naguib Mahfouz">Naguib Mahfouz</a> (less notable) and just 13,700 for Dr <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Nujoma_aa29.html" title="Sam Nujoma">Sam Nujoma</a>, The president of Namibia (Much less Notable) ... Does Wikipedia benefit from propagting pornography in the same way that pornographic sites do??? I bet not, but you know, THAT is PRECISELY why you will find so much porn on the web!! not because it is Notable!! but because it is a business!! and no one will pay to read a webpage about <a href="../../../t/o/g/Togo.html" title="Togo">Togo</a>'s or <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algeria.html" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>'s president, simply because they contain REAL factual information that is not for profit and will thus be selectively propagated! so the 8150 reasons argument is truly falacious! if Wikipedia editors will cast their votes based solely on google search results, then wikipedia will just be a well written version of the whole internet with all its rubbish .. and just a few of its gems concealed within the folds of pornographic and commercial information. <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmar_Filini_43d3.html" title="User:Omar Filini">Omar Filini</a> 01:30, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Centauri I really agree with you, and I believe in including all sorts of information on wikipedia! But when I find that the consensus on wikipedia is to vote to delete notable articles on notable subjects for such reasons as "Not Notable enough" (as has happened with the <a href="http://www.alexmarco.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexmarco.com" rel="nofollow">Marco of Alexandria</a> page, on which we both voted keep) I fail to see how something such as a Fart Fetish could have more notability among wikipedians! if Articles like this get passed while articles like Marco's get deleted simply because google gets more results on Farts; then the whole Notability of wikipedia as I have said earlier will become questionable. <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmar_Filini_43d3.html" title="User:Omar Filini">Omar Filini</a> 11:26, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
