<p><b>Delete</b> There is little in this list that isn't being done by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Category%7ETimelines_9f13.html" title="Category:Timelines">Category:Timelines</a> and its subcategories.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. This is very useful because it's all on one page. Quite different from the categories and not at all redundant. Would possibly support deleting the categories though. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:12, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I believe there are quite a few timelines in the category that aren't in the list. If they were added wouldn't the list become too long and need to broken up? Then it wouldn't all be on one page anymore. --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffW_9f12.html" title="User:JeffW">JeffW</a> 16:33, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You missed my point, which was that if all the timelines are added to the list that should be (it doesn't matter by whom) then the list will be too long to be one page anymore. Thus the argument that it is all on one page is a red herring. --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffW_9f12.html" title="User:JeffW">JeffW</a> 00:41, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When it gets that long where it is almost complete then we can examine our options such as deletion. For the time being, considering it is all on one page and far from complete, deletion is obviously premature. Of course, it is also possible that many of our existing timeline pages would themselves be merged or deleted over time, thereby eliminating the risk that the list would ever achieve a length that would even suggest the need for deconsolidation. Not that this is intended in any way to disparage the often very real benefits derived from spinning-off articles and lists. Despite your well-meaning question that seems to view AfD as a discounting mechanism establishing a net present value for articles based on future editing flows, my personal timeline for forming an opinion on AfD only runs for five days. Put simply, I am uncomfortable with a capital sentence rendered for alleged future crimes. In the present case, now well beyond my timeline due to the quite unfortunate initial close, no crime has been committed so the judgement must be to acquit. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:12, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This can divide the lists by type of list, something which categories cannot yet do. As such, this is actually currently more useful than the category! <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 06:12, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what you mean, what types of lists? A category can easily by subdivide by several different criteria, something a list cannot do without repeating entries. I know that there are several entries on the list in question that are repeated under two headings. --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffW_9f12.html" title="User:JeffW">JeffW</a> 13:31, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> its not an article, it is a navigation help - and better than the Category which should link to this... <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 10:59, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I see absolutely no legitimate reason to delete this perfectly good, well establiahed article. I commend Aaron Brenneman, the original closer, for listing this very controversial deletion close for review, but I do strongly recommend that he seriously consider that he is permitting his own personal views on deletion to influence his closes. There was in the original discussion a strong consensus to keep, which he appears to have completely ignored. This is <i>not</i> the way to close a deletion discussion. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 13:06, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't see any arguments here other than that the list is well established. Why does the age of the page matter? --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffW_9f12.html" title="User:JeffW">JeffW</a> 16:29, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>How on earth do you interpret 3 delete votes against 3 keep votes as a "strong consensus to keep"? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 14:39, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>If its 3 delete and 3 keep, it means that it did not reach any concensus (50% delete). A concensus of 75-80% (same as <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">RFA</a>) to have the article deleted. When it's no concensus, its automatically a keep. --<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">Ter</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">nc</a><a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerence_Ong_215c.html" title="User talk:Terence Ong">e Ong</a> 14:52, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, lists of lists/timelines are quite possibly the most pointless thing anyone could waste their time creating here on wikipedia.

<li>I just compared them, the list is easier to navigate from, the category seems a mess.

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> An immensely-helpful resource for researchers, as many articles aren't categorized appropriately and many users don't browse category pages. Policy isn't an end in itself, but an means to an end. If you guys aren't sure what deleting the list will accomplish, then why vote to delete it? I'm sure someone will just ignore all of us and delete it anyway, though.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 19:46, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as a perfectly valid, verifiable, and useful list. Lists can do many things that categories cannot: they can have redlinks to help direct people to articles that need creating; they can be sorted and organized in arbitrary ways; they can be annotated. Finally, they can eventually strive to be made into a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_lists_c1de.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured lists">featured list</a>. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 23:01, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, lists can do many of those things, but it has been around for years and no one has put in the effort to have it do any of those things.
