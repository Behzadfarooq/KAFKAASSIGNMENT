<p><b>Delete</b>. This is an article about a very obscure UFO incident. The sources cited are weak, and most (or all) of the ones I can find seem to point back to some Discovery channel "documentary" of dubious reliability. The article itself consists of images ripped off of one website which themselves seem likely to have improper copyright status, and a large chunk of text quoted directly from the documentary. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 00:31, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>, but it could use some work. This seems to be a real phenomenon. <a href="http://www.worldofthestrange.com/modules.php?name=Newsletters&amp;op=ViewItems&amp;vid=160" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldofthestrange.com/modules.php?name=Newsletters&amp;op=ViewItems&amp;vid=160" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Not that the theory isn't ridiculous, but it seems to have attracted quite a bit of attention. It seems to have had a fiction book written about it also <a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:9oYHVHzN13YJ:www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1883319439%3Fv%3Dglance+%22Fast+walker%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=22" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:9oYHVHzN13YJ:www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1883319439%3Fv%3Dglance+%22Fast+walker%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=22" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">Adambiswanger1</a> 01:53, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Needs work, but it's not hopeless and it seems notable. Since the text that came from the documentary is a direct quote, and is used as such, I'm not sure it counts as copyvio. The images appear to have come from <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~meirionhughes/Pub/page7.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.btinternet.com/~meirionhughes/Pub/page7.htm" rel="nofollow">Power of the Mind magazine</a>, and not directly from the documentary. The uploader included a link on one of the two pages, and also tagged them as Copyrighted free use. Possibly the uploader should be contacted to confirm that this is the case? -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 02:39, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. How notable is it really? The sources all point to the Discovery documentary, and not one claims to have any original information or have any information "from the horse's mouth". The first Google page only has a couple results that are actually related to the UFO, with the others talking about fast walking people or such. Generally, popular or well-known conspiracy or UFO theories with such distinct names have the first pages of Google tied up. I also don't see any real discussion occuring over this anywhere to make it any more notable than the thousands of other UFO encounters that don't have their own articles. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 04:08, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As it's an extremely common phrase, I don't think the fact that there are unrelated links on the first page of search results is enough on its own to condemn the article. For a source other than the Discovery segment, see the one in my comment below, an article in Omni from 1994. It's on UFO sightings in the 1980's, and it spends a good chunk of time on the 1984 'fast walker'.
<ul>
<li>Arr, the other results on the first page that use "fast walker" aren't exactly popular webpages themselves. Anyways, with the Omni one we now have two sources. Not much. Any other sign of notability? As I said, there are hundreds of other UFO encounters out there with as much evidence and notability as this one. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 04:29, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Without any references cited, it looks like complete bunk. But why not - nobody on Wikipedia bothers with references and most of the information in Wiki pages comes from google. Its like the old telephone game. First someone puts up a web page, then google catagorizes it, then it is copied into Wikipedia. Any original sources are long gone. Are we just supposed to assume this is true? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeccampbell_ddc7.html" title="User:Georgeccampbell">george</a> 02:41, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't really have time to work on this article myself right now, but if anyone's interested in putting in some time, I found an article on <a href="http://www.findarticles.com" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com" rel="nofollow">LookSmart Find Articles</a> that talks quite a bit about this sighting. <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1430/is_n11_v16/ai_15654222/pg_6" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1430/is_n11_v16/ai_15654222/pg_6" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> It's from the August 1994 issue of Omni. Apparently, 'Fast Walker' is or at one time was the official military code for an unidentified object that might be a missle. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 03:37, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The Omni magazine article makes this more notable/verifiable than loads of other things we have articles on. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 11:22, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Omni got to the point at one time where they would accept just about any story. It was like if the Weekly World News took itself seriously. <i>Many</i> UFO and paranormal stories went through there, but nothing is outstanding about this one in particular (especially as it wasn't even given a full article). -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 16:20, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>; the single website cited does not even remotely meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, which leaves this one article in Omni, which cites one single "researcher" as pushing this theory. If this article is kept, it will basically need rewriting from the ground up to reflect the real facts, which are that (1) there is no evidence whatsoever that this event ever occurred (the "evidence" is a single supposedly leaked printout), and (2) if it did occur, as the Omni article points out, it is trivially explained as an SR-71 flight. Really, this might merit a paragraph in a general article on UFO conspiracy theories, but that's about the limit.<br />
And please, stop using the "this is more notable than other stuff we have articles on" line.

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems that, while it's not as well known as, say, the Roswell incident, it is fairly unique in that the supposed UFO was picked up by a satillite, a machine, not eye-witnesses. It still could have been anything, wasn't necessarily a alien spacecraft, but it is <b>different</b> than other UFO "sightings" and therefore merits a mention.</li>
