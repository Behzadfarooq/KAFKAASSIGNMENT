<dd>Criteria #1 is part of a proposed, not yet agreed-on policy. Take a look at <a href="../../../w/r/i/Category%7EWriter_stubs_bedb.html" title="Category:Writer stubs">Category:Writer stubs</a>. All these writers are apparently notable enough for articles, yet only notable enough to have stub articles. Now, do we want to compound these writer stubs by creating stub articles on each of their books? For that reason, I disagree with proposed criteria #1. I highly suggest we keep details of a writer's books in the writer article, unless the book is so notable that it meets criteria #3, #4, or #5, or the article gets to be so long that (per <a href="../../../s/u/m/WP%7ESUMMARY_66b7.html" title="WP:SUMMARY">WP:SUMMARY</a>), sections need to be split off.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This manhunt is making news beyond just Upstate New York. Even if Phillips is considered to be an obscure thug, this story has made national news. It's been the top story in western and central New York for months and it's been well-reported in neighboring regions (one of which I am writing from). To approach it from another angle, there are hundreds -- if not thousands -- of Wikipedia articles dealing with items of only regional interest (which, by the way, contributes to Wikipedia's greatness, in my opinion). If this article is deleted for lack of notoriety, there are hundreds of others that must be deleted for the same reason.</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. This man is the most wanted man in New York State right now, having killed one state trooper and critically wounded two others since escaping prison 5 months ago. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 01:54, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would say this is definitely notable enough to keep for now. This was a top story on www.cnn.com a few hours ago. 5 Months on the lam after breaking out of prison is a lot.

<li>The title should also be changed. His name is Ralph Phillips, Bucky is just his nickname.

<li><del><b>Transwiki</b>.</del> My suggestion&#160;: the text currently in the article should be moved to Wikinews, while a (preferably short) article on Bucky should be left here. The article should contain a sentence each of 1) who Bucky is, 2) what crime he has done that made him NY State's most wanted man, and 3) his current status as a wanted criminal. And it should cite references and further reading from Google news searches etc. Add a current event template and a link to the Wikinews entry, and that should round it up nicely. Nevertheless the text currently in the article is most definitely unencyclopedic, since it is original research IMHO. But it is a nice <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_style.html#Feature_style" title="News style">feature article</a> (without a d); which belongs in Wikinews. --<a href="../../../l/e/m/User%7ELemi4_b950.html" title="User:Lemi4">Lemi4</a> 02:19, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, unencyclopedic. I'm sorry for the family of the trooper he shot, but Wikipedia is an <i>international encyclopedia</i>, not an American current-events site, and this story seems to be of interest only to a limited section of Americans. Moreover, Wikipedia is not a current-events site at all: that's why Wikinews exists.<br />
The inability of most of the posters above to admit that this is not what an encyclopedia is for will inevitably lead to this being kept for now, but I propose re-listing it in a couple of months, not a couple of years -- because I'm willing to bet that's how long it'll take for him to be forgotten, even by the limited section of Wikipedia's users who have ever registered his existence. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 11:42, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

When this ends, Phillips will die among the ranks of some of the most successful fugitives in American history. The national news has already begun covering this, though I'm surprised it took them so long as well, so it's by no means just of a "regional" interest.

<li><b>Keep</b>There are numerous sources, the events surrounding Phillips are notable, he is quickly developing into a cultural symbol in nearby areas (an entirely seperate reason for an article). Also, this is an article about a person, so it would not fit in at Wikinews. In responce the Haeleth's comments, this version of Wikipedia is in english, intended for all english-speakers, of which America makes up a significant portion. I would non delete an article of equal importance elsewhere, but it would obviously recieve less attention if it occured in a non-english-speaking country. <a href="../../../u/r/u/User%7EUrukagina_64db.html" title="User:Urukagina">Urukagina</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is the biggest manhunt in New York State since something like 1973. This has been huge news in Upstate New York for months now, and longer he goes without being caught, the bigger it is getting.

<li><b>Strong Keep,</b> though with a bit of Clean-Up. He's a nationally-publicized (via "America's Most Wanted") wanted fugitive accused of shooting three law enforcement officials (one fatally) who has (unfortunately) been perceived as some kind of rouge (anti-?) hero. Personally, I think the article here is warranted and doesn't put him in some unjustly deserved positive light, maybe it will even keep people looking for him. Plus I'd like to say (&amp; No Offense Intended) that I think the "Wikipedia is international, not just American" &amp; "not a current-events site" are silly, to put it mildly.

<li><b>Strong Keep,</b> he is of partial Native American ancestry &amp; has been traveling between 3 different Native Amarican territories in Western New York. This is a much different situation than if he were, say, a non-Native American just finding refuge in 3 different counties in the state. While these territories are not out-of-bounds to the rest of the public there is a pronounced difference in culture inside the territory. The most that any non-Native American usually sees is the gas station/cigarette store right inside the territory. If you are not a Native American &amp; you go driving farther into the territory, you are going to be noticed. If this event is cast in the light of the historical events over the past 50 years (that have profoundly affected the Native American territories in this region), one can gain understanding of the reasons why he would be sheltered &amp; befriended for most of his time on the run. <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECabreet_0427.html" title="User:Cabreet">Cabreet</a> 01:33, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>— You youngsters might not have heard of it, but Primal therapy was in college textbooks when I was a pup.

<li><b>Keep</b>. On the issue raised in the intro to this article about lack of independant peer-reviewed outcome studies, I recently emailed Arthur Janov for any web links or biographical references he could give me. He granted me a telephone interview a couple of days ago in which he assured me that his upcoming book "Primal Healing..." will contain such references and the book is due for release shortly (4 to 6 weeks in the USA, I believe, and late in the year in other English speaking countries). --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahameKing_bfb7.html" title="User:GrahameKing">GrahameKing</a> 11:29, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The creator of this Article, who sounds like he might be the owner of the site, is bassically describing the whole site.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Thank you, <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a>, for the information. Your brief links showcase no obvious problems evident in this article, and should serve as an indication of the case to retain the page. A brief search on google has produced an undeniable "Anti-Jon" sentiment, so it is obvious the gentleman is out there on the net, and known to the internet community, even if not known by the largest portion. Since Wikipedia is doubtlessly not a popularity contest, I would hate to think that "He's not popular enough" is a valid arguement. It takes little effort to verify his presence and notoriety. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECameronB_5245.html" title="User:CameronB">CameronB</a> 16:34, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi guys, I'm Bungledust - the guy who put the article up. I put it up because I thought people would generally be interested, because the site is growing and getting some big names, and thought that people would want to know what it is. It is completely unbiased and says exactly what somethingFM is about. However, it seems destined to be deleted. Just wanted to know: At what stage would this page be deemed fit to be a wikipedia article? Is it a certain number of hits, certain number of links, etc? It might not be relevant to American users (aimed at an Australian audience); would that affect it's notability? Thanks guys.</p>

<p>Despite the boldfaced notability claims in the article, I don't think we have <i>any</i> articles on <a href="../../../m/o/c/Mock_trial.html" title="Mock trial">mock trial</a> teams.

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Morehouse_College_Mock_Trial_ce50.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Morehouse College Mock Trial">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Response</span></h4>
<p>I fail to see how they are not WP-worthy just because a person does not participate in them. The purpose of Wikipedia (in my opinion) is to spread information and educate people on a wide variety of issues. Just because something may "mean a lot to the people in them" does not justify why it can not be shared with people who "are not in them". I feel that Mr. Case's rational smacks of Exclusiveness and basically forces contents on Wikipedia to be "only things that people are apart of". If we are to follow Mr. Case's logic, then there should be no Wikipedia articles on any athletic teams, professional or collegiate since the majority of fans and viewers "are not apart of them".</p>
<p>What does Mr. Case mean by, "they mean a lot to people in them"? Does he simply mean the actual students who compete in them? Or does he mean the countless professionals in the legal community who volunteer to coordinate and regulate the competitions held on campuses all across the country? Or does he simply mean the hundreds, if not thousands of students who have participated in the competitions in prior years, but still wish to remain informed about other teams in the competition? I would ask that Mr. Case not be so broad and vague in his assumptions regarding who will and will not have an interest in this information.</p>
<p>Mr. Case is right in his assumption that there aren't <b>any</b> articles on <a href="../../../m/o/c/Mock_trial.html" title="Mock trial">mock trial</a> teams on wikipedia. Considering that it is one of the most competitive collegiate activity with 600 teams, I feel that more schools should provide information about their Mock Trial programs so that others can learn about the educational and academic competition.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by TruOne (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruOne_0da3.html" title="User talk:TruOne">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruOne_a1bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruOne">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Your opinion means nothing as far as what the purpose of Wikipedia is. We are an online encyclopedia. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Nothing more, nothing less</a>. We have guidelines concerning what is, and isn't, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> enough to be included here. When I said that we don't have any other articles on individual mock trial teams, I mean that it does not appear that any other articles about mock trial teams have been written or survived a deletion vote. I mean that we have been working on <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">criteria for what makes an organization notable</a> under which most mock trial teams would not be included.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>TruOne points to the amount of time that people spend putting these things together. That doesn't justify inclusion by our criteria. People spend similar amounts of time organizing <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_League_ac50.html" title="Little League">Little League</a> teams and games ... I'm sure you would agree we can't and shouldn't have an article on <i>every single Little League team, ever</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is not about whether people would be interested in reading about it or not ... we don't sell ads here, we don't care how many people read or don't read a particular article. I don't deny that mock trial programs are important and educational. But if colleges and universities want others to "learn about the educational and academic competition", they can easily do it on their own wesbites. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 05:43, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Did a bit more research; the company does seem to distribute world-wide. It doesn't deal with the public much, as it makes industrial laundry machines. I saw nothing in the way of articles about the company, but there may be some in the Spanish press. I think I'm down to a 'weak delete', but if someone can find some articles about them in the popular press, I'd say 'keep'. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:05, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Read "Brianyoumans" comment above. Those two articles you posted are about a book about Mary Kay Ash called "More Than a Pink Cadillac." Can you verify a professor at the Dallas Seminary (as the article claims) is also the "best selling author" of a book about <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Kay_Ash_326a.html" title="Mary Kay Ash">Mary Kay Ash</a>'s comestics? <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 17:07, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Dear Blake911, Actually <i>Deletion is not cleanup</i>. If the discussion results into a delete this is not because the article is badly written, it is because the lemma has been decided to be not notable for an encylopedia. You are then actually not supposed to just start the same article again. Badly written articles about notable topics debark in the "cleanup" section not "afd". --<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJestix_6105.html" title="User:Jestix">Jestix</a> 07:06, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> Encyclopedic information needs to be unbiased. If another gaming guild, shadowclan, is to be allowed then you must allow all other gaming guilds. Or else delete shadowclan as well.

<dd><b>Comment</b>, I am not Blake, and you will not belittle my arguments by accusing me of hiding behind a false identity. As if any identity can really be verified on the internet. If you contend that shadowclan is notewrothy and bloodclan is not, that is your opinion, and certainly a subject for debate, but this is hardly the medium for it. I'm a live and let live kind of guy and you won't see me posting in support of shadowclans deletion on that page. But you ignore one portion of my argument wholly. Who is it then that would decide which gaming guilds are noteworthy and which are not? Certainly not you, since your opinion is obviously biased pro-shadowclan. There are hundreds of other gaming guilds out there that are far more original than either shadowclan or bloodclan, if that is to be your sole criterion of acceptance. At its core this site is for entertainment purposes only, as shown in the welcome screen "Welcome to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit." Which makes it sound fun. So I say let shadowclan have some fun by being listed here, along with all others who care to make the effort and consider themselves "original" or noteworthy.<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackson512_7c92.html" title="User:Jackson512">Jackson512</a> 23:02, 6 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackson512_7c92.html" title="User:Jackson512">Jackson512</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJackson512_346c.html" title="User talk:Jackson512">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jackson512_dc10.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jackson512">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></dd>

<p><b>Keep</b>It was recently agreed to keep the Shadowclan entry. This group is closely linked to Shadowclan, taking on the role of "carrying the torch" so to speak, therefore it should stay. It is extremely notable as well. If it is removed, then the Shadowclan entry should be removed as well. Drouillm 06:42, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Wrong</b> In what way are they linked to Shadowclan? Did they imitate them? Yes. nowhere are they a part of Shadowclan though. Is an Elvis impersonator as notable as Elvis? Not in the least. Niether is Bloodclan as notable as Shadowclan. Shadowclan invented a new way of roleplaying. Bloodclan imitated them. While imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, it does not notability make.

<dd>Maybe in your opinion Bloodclan is not notable, but there are many, many more who believe it to be better known than Shadowclan even. It's wrong to delete a page because a vocal minority of people don't "believe in it".

<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/Comment.html" title="Comment">Comment</a> I found websites to compare with Shadowclan. I know we're discussing Bloodclan but since I noticed this has evolved into some clan battle and Shadowclan survived a deletion nomination, I had to compare. When I viewed shadowclans deletion nomination entry. User Shazbot85 made supporting comments to keep the article and then later that he should not have commented since he has biases views as a member of Shadowclan. Which would make his comments here irrelevant. I personally feel both Shadowclan and Bloodclan are noteworthy.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Those in favor of keeping this article ground their position by asserting Bloodclan's equal notability with a similar gaming group, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadowclan.html" title="Shadowclan">Shadowclan</a>, whose article has survived a identical AfD nomination. According to the Shadowclan article and its AfD discussion(s), their notability comes from the following:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
- Being interviewed for a commercially-published book (a "<a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/...for_Dummies_1cf8.html" title="...for Dummies">...for Dummies</a>" book, no less). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471752738/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product/002-3724092-4225605?redirect=true&amp;ie=UTF8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471752738/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product/002-3724092-4225605?redirect=true&amp;ie=UTF8" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>

<p>According to this discussion and the present article, Bloodclan only appears to share this last item, attention from non-official game websites. Aside from falling short of equal notability with Shadowclan, this also constitutes failing to meet the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">notability requirements</a> for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes">Simoes</a> 20:47, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Blood clan appears to share the last two items and from what I have noticed there is several other gaming clans that survived AfD's with none of the above. They were and still are featured by <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runuo.html" title="Runuo">runuo</a> and <a href="http://www.uogamers.com" class="external text" title="http://www.uogamers.com" rel="nofollow">UOGamers Website</a> who in my opinion have a larger community than some of the shadowclan links you provided us with.</dd>

<dd>First (though I suppose this is obvious to you and everyone else), you have no evidence for your claims. Second, the last two on my list are neither necessory nor sufficient according to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a>. And even if other gaming clans have survived AfD nominations without having any of the aforementioned items (another claim of which you provide no evidence), this would not be grounds to keep this article (refer to the logical fallacy, <i><a href="../../../t/u/_/Tu_quoque.html" title="Tu quoque">tu quoque</a></i>). <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes">Simoes</a> 21:31, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When this article was submitted it did lack some evidenc and detail. However I prefer it be wikified or kept because it's more than noteworthy. Visit the links I already provided above who represent online gaming websites that feature Bloodclan. <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runuo.html" title="Runuo">Runuo</a> and UOGamers Developers also have mentioned that they focus their attention on Bloodclan.</p>

<li>It's a waste of time if one's arguments are in favour of violating our copyright policies. Our copyright policies are <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Foundation_issues" class="extiw" title="m:Foundation_issues">Foundation issues</a> and non-negotiable. If you want to make an argument that this article should be kept, show that there's an encyclopaedia article here. Here's a hint: Without the images, this article has <i>no content whatsoever</i>. It doesn't even tell us <i>which</i> <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_902f.html" title="ABC">ABC</a> it is about. It has <i>no context</i>. It is speedily deletable on two grounds, and a gross violation of the fair use policy (which is based upon the foundation that the fair use is allowable for "critical commentary and analysis" — an article with <i>zero text</i> contains no commentary or analysis). The best approach to any sort of article such as this is to <i>write all of the text first, and only then add the images</i>. Deleting this, so that Wikipedia doesn't continuously violate copyright until someone gets around to writing such an article, is a good start. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:51, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I remain unconvinced that you know what an encyclopedia is, Kappa. Few, if any, websites have individual articles in other encyclopedias. For example, it appears that the only mention of Google in the most recent Encyclopedia Britannica is in their article entitled "Search Engine". And even if other encyclopedias did regularly include articles on websites, they would use some knowledge-based criteria based on importance or historical significance, not on Alexa rankings. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 23:02, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>An encylopedia is a book (website/whatever) which explains things. Unlike WP, I don't think EB has any aspiration or duty to be a comprehensive encylopedia of websites.

<li>I didn't call the Alexa ranking arbitrary. I called your use of an alexa ranking of X as arbitrary. We have guidelines for inclusion. Those are at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. This site doesn't meet those guidelines for inclusion and should be removed.

For those concerned about loss of information, let's be honest: the only <i>information</i> in the article can be summed up as "Pokemon-Safari is a popular Pokemon fansite. It was founded in 1999 in Spanish. It became popular in 2006 when an English version was launched." There's no reason those three sentences need to be surrounded by an entire article of cruft, when the <i>useful and verifiable information</i> from this article could easily be made even more useful by putting it in some sensible context and adding those three sentences to a more general article on Pokemon fansites. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 23:02, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>If a product page is created for the product with relavent articles about its uniqness and importantce, would that be enough to close this debate? - iSCSI user 8:50, 5 September 2006
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b>. It looks like the company is making switches and network storage products. These are already covered on Wikipedia, and if the products of this company have valuable features that other switches or network storage products do not have, then the first place to add info should be the generic product class pages. Just creating product pages will not settle the issue, because then the notability of the products will have to be established. If we could read on the page under discussion here what makes these products really notable (keeping in mind that this is an encyclopedia, so there is a certain threshold, and just being a little better than other products is not enough), then this page could very well stay. But, so far the page only tells us that the company makes something that can be described easily in terms of generic product lines. By the way, should you be in any way associated with Sanrad: the size between 60 and 360 employees is a little vaguely defined, could we have more detail on that? If you are not associated with Sanrad, but just a satisfied customer, please feel free to establish notability for the Sanrad products. --<a href="../../../d/r/t/User%7EDrTorstenHenning_2c0a.html" title="User:DrTorstenHenning">DrTorstenHenning</a> 11:13, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am not an employee of sanrad.

<li><b>Strong and Speedy KEEP.</b> I dont think he or she was equating deletion with anti-Semitism. Metropolitan simply read it that way - not sure if this was Freudian or not. Metropolitan has a history of campaigning for the deletion of Jewish pages. The unsigned was merely stating that it would be obvious why an anti-Semite would wish to delete this article. This person couldn't think of another reason - but they didn't rule another reason out either. Personally, i don't think it requires anti-Semitism to delete this article. It merely requires someone to have no life, and thus nothing better to do with their time than go around and deleting other people's articles. Take up a hobby - I suggest Judo. p.s.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Yomangani, you raise a fair point. I think Kasparov pasted a link to the front page of the website of the israeli newspaper ידיעות אחרונות . I assume on the day Kasparov did this, there was a frontpage story. However, that link only takes one to the front page of the particular day that the user clicks on the link, and thus i don't know specifically what article was referred to. Maybe it was this <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il/yaan/0,7340,L-20716-MjA3MTZfNDY1MjI2ODZfMTQ4Njg3MjAw-FreeYaan,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ynet.co.il/yaan/0,7340,L-20716-MjA3MTZfNDY1MjI2ODZfMTQ4Njg3MjAw-FreeYaan,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ynet.co.il/yaan/0,7340,L-20716-MjA3MTZfNDY1MjI2ODZfMTQ4Njg3MjAw-FreeYaan,00.html</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't see how these links support the article in question. The first is about the jewish holiday of Rosh ha-Shana but as far as I can see says nothing about secular events the night before Rosh ha-Shana eve. The third is about "night culture" of Tel-Aviv without any connection to the JYE or Rosh ha-Shana (one phrase that seems to suggest that Rosh ha-Shana events become more popular). The second is a list of articles about Rosh ha-Shana again... perhaps some articles do contain something relevant, perhaps they don't, a quick check didn't help. <a href="../../../b/u/k/User%7EBukvoed_b5ba.html" title="User:Bukvoed">Bukvoed</a> 09:38, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The Jew years eve party is the cornerstone of young Jewish community social participation around the world. I met my first wife at a Jew years eve party in Vladivostok. I think it is great that the Perth Jewish Community is taking the Jew years eve party to the next level and it will hopefully place Perth on the international map.

<li><b>Delete</b> - non-notable private social event. At most, try to merge it with Rosh Hashana and see the reactions. In comparision, would an article about what Jews do on Halloween or Xmas eve be documented on WP with it's own article? Maybe in twenty years if this event is still around.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Shuki, XMAS etc has nothing to do with yehudim, but JYE is exclusively for yehudim, so your analogy doesn't work. Furthermore, JYE is not simply a private social event - it is also a communal event in many parts of the world (although admittedly it doesnt appear to be popular in USA). Merging with rosh hashonah is also problematic since that is a religiously based occasion and JYE is essentially secular/cultursl.

<li><b>Delete</b> because what on Earth does this have to do with Judaism or Jews for that matter? Should we thus create an article about Jews partying habits? If so let's have articles about those <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxymoron.html" title="Oxymoron">oxymoronic</a> Yom Kippur Balls when atheist Socialist Jews partied on the holiest Jewish holiday or Jews and Christmas parties since so many secular Jews attend Christmas parties at work and in their private lives. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 09:09, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - IZAK (and perhaps Shuki) objects to the article because it is a secular/cultural event rather than a religious event, and thus doesn't fit into his narrow vision of what a Jewish life should involve. This is absolutely no grounds for deletion. JYE serves as a means for Jews to get together and celebrate. THis is irrelevant to the debate, but as it happens, many <i>zeyer frumisher menchen</i> attend JYE parties, including some young rabbonim, especially those from Chabad. It is a great form of Jewish outreach. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/3/4/User%7E134.7.248.137.html" title="User:134.7.248.137">134.7.248.137</a> (<a href="../../../1/3/4/User_talk%7E134.7.248.137.html" title="User talk:134.7.248.137">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_134.7.248.137_2da3.html" title="Special:Contributions/134.7.248.137">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Delete</b> this has nothing to do with Rosh Hashanan, or any jewish religious expression and therefore lacks any of the regualar sources for jewish holidays (2000 years of jewish law - mishnah, talmud, numerous commmentaries).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - The reasons for deleting this seem unsatisfactory. Firstly, there seems to be the IZAK school of though that likens attending JYE with the use of prostitutes. (BTW IZAK, none of my frumishe chaverim do this , but your personal life is your business). If they had bothered to use their brains before typing, they would notice that JYE takes place on the evening before Erev Rosh hashonah, and thus purposely does NOT violate the sanctity of yomtov/shabbat. Regardless, this is an irrelevant argument as was pointed out by someone earlier. Then there are those who are not jewish who want to delete this article for reasons i have no idea, although Kasparov has provided some suggestions as to why - they need to get a life.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 58.7.231.161 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.7.231.161_19a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.7.231.161">contribs</a>).</small><small>— 58.7.231.161 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.7.231.161_19a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.7.231.161">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The main reason to delete this article is that it has problems being <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>, and all content must be verified under official Wikipedia policy. The idea of "Jew Year's Eve" is supposed to have originated in Perth, Australia, and the name is based on English-language wordplay, yet all the online sources cited have been in Hebrew, not English -- and according to <a href="../../../b/u/k/User%7EBukvoed_b5ba.html" title="User:Bukvoed">User:Bukvoed</a>, the Hebrew-language sources don't even support the article. I did find sources that describe a "Jew Year's Eve" event scheduled in Minneapolis this year <a href="http://www.danisraelmusic.com/dates.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.danisraelmusic.com/dates.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> but Minneapolis is the <b>only</b> place for which I have found verification. Since "Jew Year's Eve" is supposed to be celebrated in many cities around the world, a single event is not enough to support the article. The event cited by Yomangani above <a href="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:FDGFgjvCYr8J:www.merchantamerica.com/ncsy/index.php%3Fba%3Dview_category%26category%3D6668+Jew+Years+eve&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:FDGFgjvCYr8J:www.merchantamerica.com/ncsy/index.php%3Fba%3Dview_category%26category%3D6668+Jew+Years+eve&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> took place on December 31, not just before Rosh Hashanah (which would always be in September or early October).

I realize that several of the editors here are very supportive of "Jew Year's Eve", but unless we can establish by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that it is a commonly acknowledged event, we should leave it out of the encyclopedia for now. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 05:05, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

Let's say some folks decide to have a <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweet_sixteen_%28birthday%29.html" title="Sweet sixteen (birthday)">sweet sixteen</a> party for Jewish girls and call it Sweet Jewteen party does that make it automatically notable and worthy of an encyclopedia article. Finally, I cited valid possibilities for articles about known sociological phenomena, and the fact that no-one has seen fit to create articles about them should put a damper upon and justify the exclusion of this article from Wikipedia until such time as it becomes a more solid and acceptable feature of normative Jewish life anywhere. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 10:55, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I just wanted to add that i think the article should definitely be kept BUT it should recategorised. As it is, it is currently under a judaism stub. It is more a jewish cultural event, rather than judaism. Could someone please recategorise it appropriately? JYE is a great event. I remember i was in Japan a few years ago and the Jewish community in Kansai held a JYE (also called <i>Yudaya no Oomisoka</i> in Japan) party. It was great, and it meant that the next night (erev rosh hashonah), most of the travellers and transients etc had already met many people the night before at the <i>Yudaya no Oomisoka</i> (JYE) party. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFaito_231f.html" title="User:Faito">Faito</a> (<a href="../../../f/a/i/User_talk%7EFaito_d796.html" title="User talk:Faito">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Faito_0612.html" title="Special:Contributions/Faito">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Firstly, please do not delete existing posts. I replaced the above persons post (looks like yiddish to me) after someone else (not mentioning any names) illegally deleted it (disgusting behaviour). Shuki is right, it is not a vote, it is about the merits of the arguments. And since it is about merits, then it doesnt matter whether people who are arguing against deletion have a history of editing or not etc. The merits for deletion are weak. The Jews who are arguing for deletion are doing so because they don't like the idea of any jewish institutuions that are not purely religious. Not liking a particular event is not a reason to delete it. I don't like Wagner concerts, but that doesn't mean they ought to be banished from the public record. Furthermore, Under such grounds that JYE should be deleted because it doesn't have a religious grounding, one would also delete yom ha'atzmaut, which would be absurd. Then there are those nonjews who want to delete it because they haven't heard of it before. Well of course you haven't - it is an institution that only jewish people participate in (unlike a 16yrold birthday party IZAK, which is not a jewish institution, but a western one). My own personal experience of JYE is that the (communal) events and the people who put in the effort to organise them are all about k'lal yisrael. Now if IZAK and Shuki etc, if you are against k'lal yisrael, then just keep arguing for delete. Otherwise, look into your hearts and change your 'vote.' Shabbat Shalom.

<li>To the above anon: What pathetic nonsense. Firstly, I came along this discussion long <i>after</i> a number of anonymous editors had their say, so your argument is pointless. Secondly, where the heck have I ever gotten users who disagree with me banned? Show me where this happened please, go ahead, Wikipedia is an open book. You know, this just shows that people can come up with anything if there is no-one with an institutional memory around to refute them. By this I mean that I have been around on Wikipedia since 2002, and during that time I have had debates with other editors. In some instances they were clearly anti-Semitic, but at no time did I cause them to be banned, on the contrary they tried to get me banned. But over time those contentious editors got themselves into trouble with other editors because I have <i>never</i> gotten <i>any</i> users who disagree with me banned. Thus, thirdly, I expect to receive an apology for this blatantly false accusation against me, but I suppose that may be too much to ask from someone who hides behind both anonymous IDs and deceitful arguments. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 17:12, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yehuda ben-Yisrael (58.7.153.151), (can you please make the distinction between me questioning your accusations and God forbid not you personally) your accusations, as well as the reasoning that people are scared of IZAK, as well most of the <i>keep</i> arguments here are <b>false</b>, <b>pathetic</b> and <b>un-wikipedian</b>. The keep side has yet to prove the wikipedian merits of this undocumented new social party. Your Israel Independance day example is perfect. While <a href="../../../y/o/m/Yom_Ha%27atzmaut_90e7.html" title="Yom Ha'atzmaut">Yom Ha'atzmaut</a> has an article, you will not find any 'salute to Israel', 'march to Jerusalem', or other events in which thousands of people particiapte in WP unless they are added to the relevant holiday/significant day. Yehuda ben-Yisrael, this has nothing to do with k'lal yisrael and proving the legitimacy of this event. The point of this discussion is that 'JYE' is simply not ready yet(?) for a legitimate wikipedia article. I sincerely suggest trying to add it to the bottom of the Rosh Hashana article titled 'non-religious events', or current events'. --<a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuki_ea5a.html" title="User:Shuki">Shuki</a> 07:23, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>FWIW</b>, even if someone wants to stay anonymous and post a comment, then signing with four tildes is still expected and required. This also adds context to the discussion: The majority of <i>keep</i> proposers either do not know how wikipedia works and what is relevant and legitimate to it, and/or are merely being disrespectful of this institution. --<a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuki_ea5a.html" title="User:Shuki">Shuki</a> 07:23, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>FWIW</b>, ok Shuki, i take note of your suggestion to add JYE to Rosh Hashanah, but i think it is kind of disrepectful to Rosh Hashanah for it to share its page with JYE. Clearly RH is far more universal and sacred event than JYE, and i dont think anyone would argue otherwise. Also, sorry if u felt lumped in with IZAK. As was mentioned by someone earlier, his analogy of JYE to people who hold a ball on kol nidre is absurd (As JYE does not occur on yomtov but at least a day before it), but i note that you personally did NOT make such an analogy. BTW, IZAK does have a history of having people banned, but your point about adding the ~~ is a fair one. I accept that you may feel the arguments for keeping JYE are "un-wikipedian" although (for example) wikipedia seems to me to have articles about the most minute and irrelevant comic book and TV characters, so i really don't know what objects are worthy of inclusion in wikipedia. Personally, if information is accurate (and this case i think it is, although the univerality of JYE may possibly have been exaggerated, in which case that can be edited, rather than the whole article deleted), i see no problem with including it. What is relevant to one person is often irrelevant to another and vice versa. In conclusion, i still see no harm in keeping the JYE page, and the page may directly or indirectly encourage some Jews in the diaspora to become more involved in the community - <i>Kiruv</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> The fundamental problem here is the lack of verifiable sources for the article, not whether it is a Judaism related article or a Jewish social event or anything else. It could be called "whoopsy-daisy spree day" or "jumping holiday" providing there were reliable third party sources for it - the inclusion of the word "Jew" in the title is irrelevant here. So far there has been no evidence that it is anything other than a pun that is randomly applied to certain parties involving Jews or around the times of Jewish festivals, and even that is mostly anecdotal. The one attempt to provide references resulted in sources that don't apparently feature this term. Merging it to another Judaism related article is not a solution - without evidence it exists it is as invalid in another article as it is standing alone. Without reliable sources it violates <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and has no place here. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 11:16, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>I heard this reference at a Christmas party after Mass last year and wondered ever since what it was all about. We need to keep the article in order to answer that question. It "is" something so let us define what it "is" in encyclopoedic terms. Incidentally, the article as it stands is approaching mere drivel, not even up to middle-scholl standards. So...keep it but re-write it correctly. It needs to have some context around it; for instance, I think it needs to have an etymology section and perhaps a cultural impact section. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocEss_fb29.html" title="User:DocEss">DocEss</a> 17:29, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

At my request, he keeps me notified about AFD debates on Jewish topics because I don't usually watch AFD; he does this despite the fact that I probably often as not vote opposite to him. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:53, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I saw that you did not like my post&#160;:) This is a real nice company with lots of cool pda and smartphone cases. It is one of the elading companies in the PDA case market and is appreciated by many users. A simple Google search for "sena cases" returns about 261,000 results in my computer which I believe is a sufficient indicator of the size and penetration of teh company. Here are a few further pointers for you if you want to see more:</p>

</ul>
<p>The WP:Corp says the following: <b>"The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself."</b> Furthermore, it says <i><b>any</b></i> of the rules and I strongly believe that it satisfies this criteria if not the others. I believe about.com, pc magazine and gizmodo among many others are sufficiently independent and well established publishers.</p>
<p>There are many more articles from many different publishers in addition to lots of interviews with the founders. I will leave the Google work to you.</p>
<p>By the way, I am not affiliated with the company in any way. I am just a PDA Geek who thinks Sena Rocks!&#160;:)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, it looks like a nice PDA case and your posts were fine. I merged the info about the cases themselves into the article on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_digital_assistant.html" title="Personal digital assistant">Personal digital assistant</a>. What we're discussing here is the importance of the <i>company</i> which makes them. The above reviews are of the cases rather than the company. If there are Web articles about the company itself I've missed them - post them here or on my talk page and I'll take a look. PS I have followed the links from the article itself - one of my motivations for nominating the article was that as of 2003 it looked like there was a handful of people in an online store and that manufacturing was probably outsourced. So any company statistics would be very relevant. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 18:43, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm always about expanding , perhaps there is something unbelieveable about this company that we don't know, at least let the page develop it needs some work so i vote, <b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> if it doesn't expand.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi Dlyson,</p>
<p>I have not really had much time to check if there is any media coverage about the company. However, I think you can not expect each company to get as much media coverage as Google or IBM. This is not a billion dollar worth multinational giant. This is probably a small/miod size private company which is not required to publish any data about itself until it goes public. I really don't think that they are just an online store operated by a couple of people. You can hardly find any small online store that has quarter million Google entries and that has real good reviews from well extablished publishers. As far as I could see, Amazon.com sells its products from its own inventory, Palm.com sells them, Dell.com sells them, I am sure many others sell them. All in all, I think it is a farily large and established company that is worth at least a brief mentioning in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Also the fact that most coverage is about the products does not mean that the company is bad or worthless. Those products are what the company makes and in a sense the products <i><b>are</b></i> the company.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is enough coverage of the products to verify them as notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I have used their cases for my Palm T3 and Treo 650. I am not sure how big the company is but one thing for sure is that they have their own unique designs for these cases. Therefore, I do not think the cases are outsourced. The fact that Palm sells Sena's cases shows that they have unique features: <a href="http://web.palm.com/products/Category.jhtml?ID=20015" class="external text" title="http://web.palm.com/products/Category.jhtml?ID=20015" rel="nofollow">Palm Accessory Store</a>. This is where I purchased it. JoeMona 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the only info I could find on the company suggested they had 5-10 employees. I'm pretty impressed that a company this small has a slick website and this much coverage of their product. It's close, but I agree with Kappa and JulesH that the independent media coverage of the product makes the company notable. I don't want to stray into <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, but the amount of penetration they have achieved with a company so small also makes me believe the company is notable. <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> 03:17, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I close this discussion with a <b>delete</b> decision, for the usual reason: that <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">Wikipedia is an encyclopedia</a>, that its entries are therefore necessarily to be encyclopedic—that is to say scholarly, tertiary-source accounts of accumulated research and reporting on a given subject, written from a neutral point of view; that whereas Wikipedians utilize the collaborative <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a> approach to write the entries, in no way are the critical <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sourcing</a> requirements of such accounts thereby obviated; and that where an entry fails these requirements it ought to be remedied or removed.

<li><b>Comment</b> Because the magazine fails notability and because the article has no analysis of its subject; it's just a peg on which to hang a link to the magazine's website. <a href="../../../b/t/l/User%7EBTLizard_ebd6.html" title="User:BTLizard">BTLizard</a> 11:25, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, without secondary sources. It also fails to establish how trolling of Yahoo! is in any way distinct from simply trolling.

All in all it's one vast collection of forumcruft, with little or no chance of every being verifiable from reliable secondary sources; the verifiable content amounts to a description of Yahoo! (whihc we already have) and the fact that the Yahoo! forums get trolled (which is a trivial and obvious inference given that all unmoderated forums and many moderated ones are trolled). <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:17, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That particular guideline in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> means that the website has been reviewed, had an article written about it or something similar in notable independant sources. This does <i>not</i> include getting listed on blogs, directories, <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digg.html" title="Digg">Digg</a> or anything like that, because <i>anyone</i> can link to a site through these; doing so doesn't make that site inherently more notable (more visited perhaps, but traffic volume is not a criteria). So for example, if a website has had an article on Wired.com news about it, or an article in a newspaper or magazine, then it satisfies that criteria. The overwhelming majority of fan websites, no matter how well-made or comprehensive they are, do not pass muster. Otherwise Wikipedia would just become another web directory of every fan site on every subject ever. ~<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatticus78_82c5.html" title="User talk:Matticus78">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matticus78_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matticus78">C</a></sub> 15:05, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No advertising for small commercial enterprises on wikipedia please. Well I see the previous comment was deleted. I will repeat it, an article on a small and unremarkable computer company, particularly one that has a history of shoddy service, has no place in wikipedia.

<p>How does ocuk 'deserve' to be mentioned? OCUK has no cultural relevance or academic notability, it is merely an internet forum (shrug) and a small business with a poor reputation. DELETE. - panoptic0n</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's forum has over 23,000 members, hardly small, as far as culture it has a large gaming and distributed computing community and is something people expect to see on Wikipedia. I don't see how having a poor reputation makes it less notable, surly it would make it nore notable if anything. --<strong style=""><a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamish2k_d7fd.html" title="User:Hamish2k"><i>Hamish</i></a></strong> <small>(<a href="../../../h/a/m/User_talk%7EHamish2k_65dc.html" title="User talk:Hamish2k">Talk</a>)</small> 01:04, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't agree that ocuk is something 'people' expect to see on wikipedia, it's a small company and a fairly popular pc forum, which only means something to hardcore pc enthusiasts. Any 'knowledge' of ocuk that could be gained by reading this page will no doubt already be known to anybody that uses the ocuk site. It serves as free advertising for the company nothing more. I think it needs to be established that personal enthusiasms should not be allowed to run riot in what is supposed to be an academic text. OCUK has no academic or cultural value whatsoever. Perhaps if the OCUK site or forums had created some kind of cultural phenomenon like Myspace etc. then they would be notable but they haven't, the shop is just a small commercial enterprise and the forums are a place where people go to talk about computers, current events etc., just like many other forums.- panoptic0n</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Vote for deletion</b> As I menioned before if the OCUK folding team is notable make a seperate article, if indeed they can be said to be worthy of one. Also there are many 'large forums' and that does not warrant an entry in an academic text. The ocuk tag might be fairly well used in online gaming, but how does that warrant a mention in an encyclopedia? - panoptic0n</li>

However he has an IMDB profile with the movies he has produced to date. The merge desicion was to keep as a separate article as you can see here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Keane" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Keane" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>.<a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluence_1c59.html" title="User:Fluence">Fluence</a> 01:58, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: If this article should be deleted, why shouldn't articles like Rise of the Mushroom Kingdom be deleted? It's an article about another Flash cartoon.

If you do that, you can verify pretty much everything that has been written in the article. --81.94.65.69 05:39, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: As far as Flash animation series go, Perfect Kirby is extremely noteable. Its later episodes are generally recognized as being some of the finest examples of tween-style Flash animation on the internet. The criteria for webcomics seems to be a lot lower than Flash series, and I don't quite see how this is fair.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I guess my point is that the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_language.html" title="Armenian language">Armenian language</a> doesn't use the western alphabet, Armenia has, as a country, a substanially smaller portion of internet users (both as a percentage of its population and real figures), than a country such as the United States [<a href="http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=stats/web_worldwide" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=stats/web_worldwide" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>] and as a result, determining the notability of this band using google is misleading. They could be the most famous Armenian prog rock band ever and I'd have no idea. So non-notability can't be established.

<li><b>Keep</b>: as discussed on the DRV, this is anauthor who has published only book yet, but that book is published by a major SF publisher (Tor), the second book will appear in october, the first novel has had multiple independent and major reviews, the author has had interviews in prominent media (though not yet in the truly important ones probably), and the book has won a new literary award which received considerable coverage. Much of that info is missing or unclear from the current article though, so a rewrite / expansion is necessary.

<li><b>Comment</b>: as has been pointed out recently to me (on another AfD), distinct Google hits are calculated on the first 1,000 indistinct Google hits, not on the complete set. So a distinct number of more than 100 (give or take a few) means nothing negative, and in such a case the total number of Ghits should be taken into accunt as well (85,600 in this case).

<li><b>Comment</b> The <i>Lulu Blooker Prize is the brainchild of the folks at Lulu.com</i>. So it's a self-publishing marketer's invention. So, in my view, the only rationale to keep could be multiple, independent, non-trivial reviews. What I've seen look like very standard publisher-inspired ones but perhaps I'm looking in the wrong places. Any pointers to convincing reviews will be appreciated. Maybe she's the next Stephen King and I'm totally missing the point&#160;:-) P.S. I've finally found the deletion review and find I'm just repeating what Rossami said. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 19:54, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The Blooker Prize is <i>sponsored</i> by Lulu.com, but features work not mentioned or published by Lulu.com. Cherie Priest for example has <i>nothing</i> to do with Lulu.com apart from winning the Fiction Blooker. The Blooker is just as much of a genuine award as any other.

<li><b>Keep</b>: as the original article author, I in good faith created an article about an up and coming author who is well known in her field. I'd love to see the point of all this deletion, but are we really hunting for hard drive space this desperately that the opinion that the work isn't of note or is not mainstream enough really a good argument?

<dd><b>Keep</b>, there are too many notable recurring elements to work back into the main article without it becoming too full, the reason it was spun-off in the first place, as well as the fact that the page could easily be expanded; currently, it sits in its condensed form from the attempt to condense the main article before articles were spun off. -- <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewdrix_e10c.html" title="User:Viewdrix">Viewdrix</a> 21:01, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This appears to be an article about a website that furnishes services to public relations professionals who work primarily in the Asian and Pacific Rim regions. Presently, the language hardly reflects a neutral viewpoint: it uses promotional language to redirect encyclopedia users to the services the site offers. If it were to be written with a neutral point of view, I believe very little more can be said about it than the summary I've written here, so the article would be a stub. Could the stub be developed into anything more substantial?</p>
<p>As of this writing, 28 August 2006, Google returns approximately <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Scoopasia&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=PNf&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Scoopasia&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=PNf&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">240 hits</a> on the phrase 'Scoopasia'; these wholly fall into the realms of:</p>
<p>1. Wikipedia hits or hits on mirrors of Wikipedia, either on the article Scoopasia or on <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_release.html" title="News release">News release</a>, which Melvinyuan had edited on 10 July 2006, furnishing a link to the Scoopasia site in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=News_release&amp;oldid=63059433" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=News_release&amp;oldid=63059433" rel="nofollow">'External Links'</a> section. Melvinyuan is also the principle author of Scoopasia. (This external link was removed in early August; the editor who removed the link thought that it was advertising).</p>
<p>2. references from bloggers or individuals in link concentration sites who've noted the existence of the site but have not offered any independent views as to the site's notability</p>
<p>3. Pages that have since disappeared ("<a href="../../../h/t/t/HTTP_404_463b.html" title="HTTP 404">404</a>")</p>
<p>4. Echoed content from scoopasia itself.</p>
<p>No evidence of awards granted to the site has been found by me, nor are well known and independent parties distributing Scoopasia content as noteworthy and useful material.</p>
<p>This is not to say that <a href="http://www.scoopasia.com" class="external text" title="http://www.scoopasia.com" rel="nofollow">Scoopasia</a> doesn't serve its community, but I conclude that it does not do so in a noteworthy fashion that has caught the attention of neutral observers.

<li>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, reported in notable and verifiable sources. - a simple google search will show you the Joggers have toured the whole US more than once. They are from Portland on the West Coast and you can easily find an account of memorable shows in New York. here is a list of shows from this year's spring tour from <a href="http://entertainment.lycos.com/music/searchConcerts.php?query=The+Joggers&amp;type=artist&amp;exact=true" class="external text" title="http://entertainment.lycos.com/music/searchConcerts.php?query=The+Joggers&amp;type=artist&amp;exact=true" rel="nofollow">Lycos</a></li>

<dd>Mostly because documentation proving notability doesn't necessarily always fit with the text of the article. The fact that they have toured nationwide isn't mentioned because it is assumed. It would seem unnecessary to have to mention a band's tour history when nothing about their touring stands out as abnormal from a mid-sized band with two albums.

<li><b>Hmmmmm.</b> There is a very short article, <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debunking_9_11_Myths_a84e.html" title="Debunking 9/11 Myths">Debunking 9/11 Myths</a>, about the book based on the article. The book may or may not be notable; the article certainly is not, I would think. How all this could best be sorted out, I don't know. The best solution would normally be to <b>Merge</b> this article into <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debunking_9_11_Myths_a84e.html" title="Debunking 9/11 Myths">Debunking 9/11 Myths</a> (actually easier to merge that article into this one and rename this article to Debunking 9/11 Myths). I don't know, however, what parts of this article apply <i>only</i> to the article and not to the book. It's <i>likely</i> that the book is a superset of the article. Therefore most of the material would apply. The author might, however, have (for instance) addressed in the book some of the criticisms in the article, and so forth. And there's no way to tell what parts of this article apply to <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debunking_9_11_Myths_a84e.html" title="Debunking 9/11 Myths">Debunking 9/11 Myths</a>. Unless someone is willing and able to sort this all out, I guess I would have to say that this article should just be deleted. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 19:02, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

The question here is where do we draw the line for <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> of books, articles, and websites? This article comes up ranked #24 in Google results when searching "9/11", out of 289,000,000 results. Debunking 9/11 Myths is currently ranked #850 in Amazon.com sales, and is easily found in any local bookstore. I was just at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnes_%26_Noble_cca7.html" title="Barnes &amp; Noble">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>, and they had numerous copies of <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debunking_9_11_Myths_a84e.html" title="Debunking 9/11 Myths">Debunking 9/11 Myths</a>, as well as two copies of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Pearl_Harbor_5423.html" title="The New Pearl Harbor">The New Pearl Harbor</a> and one copy of <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossing_the_Rubicon_a77e.html" title="Crossing the Rubicon">Crossing the Rubicon</a>. But no copies of The Big Wedding, which is ranked #252,792 in Amazon sales. In the scheme of things, the book definitely is notable. The Popular Mechanics book builds on the success and popularity of the article, and as such, the Popular Mechanics article can and should be discussed in the book article. However, I think that an article on an article is too much, and it would suffice to merge with the <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debunking_9_11_Myths_a84e.html" title="Debunking 9/11 Myths">Debunking 9/11 Myths</a> article. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a> <a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_Contributions_4e83.html" title="User:AudeVivere/Contributions">as tagcloud</a>)</small> 22:13, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's not. Nonetheless, I have to wonder if Striver created both these articles to make a point? I like to assume good faith, but he's created so many stubs for individual videos, books, websites by Alex Jones, et al. We need a consistent application of Wikipedia policies, regardless of which viewpoint a particular book (or whatever) takes. If the Debunking 9/11 Myths book wasn't so widely available, with relatively high sales rank, I would put the book article up for deletion, and vote delete here. But, given the book's notability, I suggest merging this article into that one. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a> <a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_Contributions_4e83.html" title="User:AudeVivere/Contributions">as tagcloud</a>)</small> 03:25, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'll assume good faith, and that you were just trying to help by creating the stubs. The disagreement (over this article, and many other stub creations) lies with what's notable, and needs a separate stub article. I think we would do better to combine the two shorter, stub articles (which overlap significantly in topic) into one, larger better-quality article. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a> <a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_Contributions_4e83.html" title="User:AudeVivere/Contributions">as tagcloud</a>)</small> 15:37, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see your resoning, but i do not agree with your conclusion. The article has been around for over a year and has been PROMINENTLY refered to by multiple sources. That makes it notable in itself. Now, a book is on its way, and this article will not become less notable due to a book comming. And the book itself is also notable enough to have its own article. So i argue that both articles can stand on its own and should do so. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 16:06, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We regrettably take copyright violations extremely seriously here, and as such, we tend to be a bit paranoid (but not too paranoid). Stating that one has <i>suspicion</i> about copyright status of the article is perfectly okay, as that may encourage people to verify the copyright status; stating it's <i>definitely</i> a copyvio without a shred of proof is another matter altogether. Since you state, for emphasis, that you are indeed the copyright holder, we're more than happy to believe you unless damning evidence to contrary materialises. However, we still need to determine whether this material is suitable for Wikipedia. In particular, you're incorrect in presumption that "anyone offering an article on this subject must needs be from the wedding industry" - expertise on the field is very valuable in compiling the article, but we primarily need <i>encyclopedic research</i>, which means aggregation of facts from <i>sources</i>. (See <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.) Expertise just helps a bit in explaining how facts correlate. As for this article, it really needs sources. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 17:14, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete if you will</b> Author pjbruce. I really don't mind what you do. This is not a newspaper and i do understand that and am glad for it. I do not agree this is advertisement, if you actually read my response i told you to take out the link to our free service it's not a problem and that is the only thing which could possibly turn it into an ad, the other link are sources and nothing to do with me. But the libel issue still stands User:SliceNYC stated plainly that he felt this was copywright violation and it isn't. He didn't even check with me nor did any of you about the genuine nature of the material, yet you public feel free to make your statements. I think wikipedia should be very careful if their going down this road. Personally i will get in touch with the chairman (if there is one) of wikipedia, there really ought to be some guidlines and or training about the way you deal with public domains and material. User:SliceNYC's statement was libelous because it was written in his official capacity and published which as a supposed authority makes it defamatory especially when my user name was attached to it and a business reference. Really guy's this is completely unacceptable. I think the least you can do is publish a public apology on the front page of wikipedia to stand for one month and perhaps next time you will consult authors first.

<p><b>Media Law Resources</b> In order for the person about whom a statement is made to recover for libel, the false statement must be defamatory, meaning that it actually harms the reputation of the other person, as opposed to being merely insulting or offensive.</p>
<p>The statement(s) alleged to be defamatory must also have been published to at least one other person (other than the subject of the statement) and must be "of and concerning" the plaintiff. That is, those hearing or reading the statement must identify it specifically with the plaintiff.Pjbruce 14:38, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>You guys are unbelievable</b> I can't believe what I'm reading here. You know I'm not bothered in the slightest about the article (i've got too much else on) what concerns me is the lack of professionalism many of you editors demonstrate and is also what I am currently taking up with the foundation. The fact is people shouldn't be publishing comments that voice suspicions of copywright violation, that is libel under the terms of the law and why risk it? Nobody has threatened legal action, I'm trying to get you to see sloppy dealings with the public like this will only alienate you from the people you mean to serve. If you look at the editorial comments above many of them contain cheap shots and patronizing comments meant to enflame and ridicule. This is attrocius. Not one person has been able to deal with a valid complaint which was simply that instead of publishing incorrect and unjustified suspicions about a professional person, a private message or email would have been much better. I will certainly not contribute to wikipedia again and for one reason only you have alienated me by by your parochial attitude that demonstrates more a sense of a private club than a public service.

<p><b>Comment</b> You seem to think people citicizing your work is a bad thing. If you can't take criticism, I suggest you leave or simply not edit. It is completely acceptable for someone to nominate your article for deletion and criticize it until nothing remains. That is completely <b>legal</b> and accepted practice on Wikipedia. You sir, are the <i>only</i> person who lacks professionalism here. You couldn't hack your article being thrown out, you couldn't take the criticism, so you throw a fit and start <i>inventing charges</i> against someone who criticized you. That's seems like a pretty cowardly and pathetic action to me. If you actually have a problem with anything said in this article, I suggest you find a rule against it on Wikipedia and take it up with an administrator instead of making vauge accusations about libel (which you have no understanding of). If you find it strange that no one has dealt with a valid complaint of yours, that because you don't have a valid complaint. The libel "complaint" had my friend and I laughing for a good 5 minutes solid. If you can't defend what you wrote, that's fine, we'll delete it for you. Don't compensate for your inability to defend yourself by alluding to imaginary legal wrongs, simply admit your fault and move on. If your pride can't take that hit, then I don't suggest your put it on the line.

<p><b>Dear Mr Shazbot</b> You still don't see, the complaint is about behaviour like yours which is rude and offensive and nothing constructive. I really don't understand why you keep going on about the article, the article has never been the issue. I have indeed forwarded the complaint to the wikipedia foundation along with a copy of this dialogue, I really am apalled that you treat members of the public this way.

<p>Contested prod. The original version was a patent neologism, and this new edition is still "not in the dictionary", which doesn't exactly fill me with great hope and joy. I asked the author (who had written a header saying that it wasn't a neologism) to address the inconsistent spelling, the lack of attribution of sources and the lack of dictionary presence. Such adressing of sources has now thrown up an obituary of the mysterious "Dr Barnes", who apparently did something like this in one of his postdoctoral positions (although there's no proof of <i>what</i> he did in these positions, other than that he had them). It's also thrown up a Friendster profile on which a woman lists one of the two spellings as her occupation, which doesn't really impress me, since I could list myself as a "historiologist" on a site like that but it wouldn't mean that such a job existed or had a consistent job description. The author requested another 5 days at the same time as he de-tagged the article, so here they are. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:02, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's a higher bar for professional sports team selection than for being academic, and its silly to throw out the idea of relative degrees of academic notabilty altogether. Just getting a PhD or even a Master's means that you have published academically and have a high chance of being cited (<i>I</i> have a master's degree thesis which has been published by a major university and in a leading industry online magazine (with an Alexa rank of ~8,500). The research has recieved coverage in a Canadian national newspaper and a couple of US regional newspapers. It's also been cited in at least two published books, one by a leading academic and another by a mainstream journalist, as well as being cited in several other academic papers, including one published by a leading law school. I've also co-authored an article for the Harvard Business Review. Does this citation/authorship record make me notable? Definitely not.) The "all academics publish" argument is not as simple as you state it - another key part of the argument is that much of what is published is not academically or encyclopedically notable. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 16:08, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man_argument.html" title="Straw man argument">straw man argument</a>. I have never argued that "being academic" should be the bar for inclusion or even that all academics who have been published should have articles. Being a 20-year old selected for a professional soccer team and playing a couple of seasons before retiring into obscurity is currently enough to get an article in Wikipedia. That is not an achievement comparable to what is usually required to be appointed to a professorial chair at a university, or what most professors achieve over a lifetime. I will admit that I am more familiar with Northern European universities, and I realise that in the U.S. almost any teacher at a tertiary institution is a "professor" of some kind, but I think allowing articles on full professors at major American research universities is usually reasonable. By "major research universities" I mean institutions internationally known for their research and having doctoral programs in most fields.

<li><b>Comment</b> Clearly he's not a Knuth, Hoare or Dijsta, but that is setting the bar way too high (not all writers are Dickens, Joyce or Mahfuz either). And to be honest, I think that very minor writers of popular fiction are getting articles accepted much more easily than academics, despite both being in the writing business. WP:Notability (academics) says <i>The person has published a significant and well-known academic work.</i> P.S. If there's anything wrong specifically with the Pierce article it can be edited by anyone. And obviously only a very small proportion of college professors have or will have articles. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 14:58, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>, I know for sure that the title Additional Secretary is in no way equivalent to "associate deputy minister" or "undersecretary". An additional Secretary in Pakistan is just a middle level Bureaucrat in the Civil Bureaucracy and thats all.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I usually don't do that but this is in defense of my vote to <b>Delete</b>. I am myself a Civil Servant and a member of the erstwhile “POWERFUL” DMG (District Management Group). There are more than 2400 Officers in this Cadre working all over the country and this is not the only Cadre in the Civil Bureaucracy of Pakistan. There are 12 other Groups which have their own Officers (their numbers running into thousands)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Superior_Services_of_Pakistan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Superior_Services_of_Pakistan" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>. Now turning towards this article, apparently this article on Mr. Akhtar Munir fails all the tests of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. He has not written any notable books nor is he a recipient of national/international award. He hasn’t done a deed (association with a project of national importance) which should have been noticed in the national or international press. The supposition of the creator of this article that Mr. Akhtar Munir is the “First Licensed Commercial Pilot of Pakistan” is preposterous (seriously lacks credibility) because Pakistan came into being almost 59 years ago and I know for sure that Mr. Akhtar Munir is not the first person to obtain a Flying License. As a matter of fact a local son of the soil Mr. Qazi Sajjad (who unfortunately has no entry at Wikipedia) was the first man to achieve eminence for flying a glider (made entirely by him). This persistent love with flying earned Qazi Sajjad another distinction of being the first Civilian to teach at Risalpur’s Air Force Academy. My humble plea is that this article is nothing else but pure vanity and a self projection of a person whose only distinction is his ascendance to a senior middle level position in the civil bureaucracy of Pakistan but then so does thousand others. Should then they all be accommodated at Wikipedia? -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarwatt_1f61.html" title="User:Marwatt">Marwatt</a> 14:30, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi. When I created this article, I had no idea that one had existed before. However, I do think that Cameron is worthy of inclusion given, as Alec Davison points out, that she is the head of a national NGO coalition. She is a well-known and increasingly important figure in Scottish civic society. As regards her public notability, she was the subject of a full-page profile article in the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_Herald_b3ef.html" title="Sunday Herald">Sunday Herald</a> Magazine of 13th August this year (sadly not online). I like to think that Wikipedia provides access to wider information than national newspapers; it certainly should not be providing less than them. MichaelMcNab 12:13, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - you can add the Sunday Herald article as a reference if you've read it, there's no policy that demands all sources must be available online. I'm open to persuasion and I'll change my opinion if there is some evidence of her notability. <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop_Climate_Chaos_Scotland_5bf6.html" title="Stop Climate Chaos Scotland">Stop Climate Chaos Scotland</a> doesn't seem to get much press as far as I can see, and the "Climate Change Ambassador" role doesn't even mention the name of the project, making it hard to check her notability. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 12:38, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I've specified the Climate Change College project by name (an oversight on my part; apologies), and added the external link. I'd be grateful if others could help me with citing sources, as I haven't quite got my head around the style and code. The profile piece is 'I recycle, I use energy-efficient light bulbs and my last gas bill was £1.17' by Vicky Allan, page 7, Sunday Herald Magazine, 13th August 2006. The source for her selection on the 2007 election list is <a href="http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1311042006" class="external text" title="http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1311042006" rel="nofollow">today's Edinburgh Evening News</a>.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> - Wikipedia has lots of 'ex-'politicians of one sort or another, so being an ex-student leader shouldn't be decisive. Wikipedia also has lots of considerably more minor political figures - including almost the entire central committee of the UK <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Workers_Party_%28Britain%29_d2ca.html" title="Socialist Workers Party (Britain)">Socialist Workers Party</a> (not even a parliamentary party) and numerous internal figures from the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Socialist_Party_334a.html" title="Scottish Socialist Party">Scottish Socialist Party</a> who are only of interest to leftish political anoraks. While I agree that third on the Lothians list makes Ruth a player in the upcoming elections, the key thing is her high profile in Scotland through student and NGO activity, to which various people have alluded.

<li><b>Don't delete</b> - What is undeniably notable is that Ms Cameron has in the past couple of years become one of the most well known young politicians in Scotland amongst, in particular, the student politics circles. Her stint as Edinburgh Uni President was very high profile, and her then moving on from that straight into a very high profile NGO post and candidacy for a potentially winnable MSP seat definitely counts as worthy of interest. In short she is 'one to watch' and hence it is fitting that she have a Wiki article. PhylSM 17:33, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Keep arguments not convincing when based on potential future achievements. "One to watch" for future notability means she is not now and may never be notable enough to meet inclusion criteria. She isn't yet a MSP. Maybe she will be elected next year. Maybe she will then be notable. Including her now couldn't possibly help her name recognition and help her attain that which she seeks?

<p><b>Comment</b> - Although I've included Cameron as a civic society, rather than political, figure, I would argue that there is a substantial public interest in including election candidates on Wikipedia. For many, it will be the only source of information about aperson that you are being asked to vote for that is not a spun party press release or website. Providing this sort of information to voters is an excellent example of the value of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>That argument aside, as I say, Cameron is a Scottish civic society figure of note. She is the head of one of Scotland's most significant NGO coalitions, counting Friends of the Earth Scotland, WWF Scotland and the RSPB (itself one of the country's largest membership organisations) as members. Before taking up this role, she was a student leader of national significance, not just another run-of-the-mill union officer (and, having been to a run-of-the-mill university myself, I'm under no illusions as to the notability of those), as evidenced by the national press coverage of her tenure (search for "ruth cameron" at <a href="http://www.scotsman.com" class="external text" title="http://www.scotsman.com" rel="nofollow">The Scotsman</a>). She is now known by name and reputation to everyone of importance in the Scottish campaigning sector.</p>
<p>I'm a little surprised at the debate over Cameron's likelihood of election; it seems perverse and blinkered to say that a civic society leader becomes notable if and only if he or she is elected to parliament.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks I hope to be able to add more detail to this article as well as, if permitted by the Wikipedia community, new articles for Stop Climate Chaos Scotland and other NGOs and key NGO leaders. It is a worrisome comment on Scotland that national figures like Richard Dixon (WWF Scotland), Rosemary Burnett (Amnesty) and Kevin Dunion (Scottish Information Commissioner) are exluded, but members of the Celtic squad that have never, to my knowledge, played a single first-team game (e.g. <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diarmuid_O%27Carroll_956f.html" title="Diarmuid O'Carroll">Diarmuid O'Carroll</a>) warrant articles of their own. I hoped to remedy that, starting with an interesting figure about whom I know enough to work up a useful article. I would be very grateful to Wikipedians if they could allow me to do so.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. All of the article seems to meet the policies just fine, it appears to be verifiable, from several reliable sources, and NPOV. As for the concept of notability (which is only a <i>guideline</i> anyway) being the co-ordinater of a national campaign, supported by several large NGOs is signifigant, as is convener of the Young Greens. Also, Cameron has had a number of articles published in the national press, and was prominent in her role of EUSA president, with numerous newspaper mentions. --<a href="../../../v/c/l/User%7EVclaw_af47.html" title="User:Vclaw">Vclaw</a> 15:37, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. There's not much doubt about that, it's really fairly blatant. This is simply an attempt at free publicity by the friends/ colleagues of the subject. The article is pretty much a stub anyway, such is the lack of notability of its subject, with barrel-scraping filler along the lines of "She was also awarded an internship at the Observer newspaper". At present this person is no more worthy of note than anybody else (and there are plenty) involved in student/minor politics. If the subject actually gets elected then she would probably be entitled to an article. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPathlessdesert_86ae.html" title="User:Pathlessdesert">Pathlessdesert</a> 15:24, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Okay, let's delete this properly. Uh... first this is speedy deleted as A7, then it's speedy deleted because of basically having an A7 substub, then it's speedy deleted by me because the author blanked the article (do they want the article or not?) Now, it's grown into an article that basically doesn't give any bigger hints on possible notability of the subject. Website is absolutely of no help in this respect, either. Not notable, hard to verify. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 09:00, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Give us one good reason as to why should you delete this. We are really confident that Rencin and others are really sad about this[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Onfireministries" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Onfireministries" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>]. Yes it is true that there is also another organization in that name, but does that mean to say that you will have to delete it just because it is from India.<br />
Praying for you all. God bless you. If you are deleting it then do it soon. Please don't delay and make us feel sad because of this. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 205.173.93.41 (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.173.93.41.html" title="User talk:205.173.93.41">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.173.93.41_7a6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.173.93.41">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>For your information, we're keeping this deletion debate open 5 days after it was opened, and after that, as long as it takes for an admin to come to conclusion. We're keeping this open as long as it needs to, to give everyone a fair shot to fix the problem. The reason why this article is considered for deletion is stated above in this weird Wikipedia lingo, and in normal Earth communications, it'd be best summed as thus: a) the organisation appears to be rather small and has little influence beyond the immediate surroundings (yes, we cover local organisations too, but we also need to consider "how local is too local"?) and b) there doesn't appear to be any reliable media sources in the article that would talk about the organisation. The organisation's own website helps, but we'd really really love to see news mentions and like. Sorry if any of you are feeling bad about this, but we regrettably have a rather high bar for inclusion. I'm not included, either. My city is here, as is my university, but, uh, that's about it =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 08:38, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Strong Keep</b> all. Firstly, the statement made by the nominator in which this article fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is inaccurate. Allow me to voice out the reasons. WP:BIO states this (and I quote): <i>Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but <b>only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature</b> that most members of its squad are worthy of articles</i>. Is Arsenal a club of sufficient stature? Of course it is! It is one of the most successful clubs in English football. Moreover, these articles pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> hands down, which <b>is</b> an official policy in Wikipedia. On top of that, the Arsenal Reserves play in the <b>top</b> reserve football league in England, which may also be classified as amateur sports or more accurately amature football. We are not talking about a second division reserve team here. We are dealing with one of the top football clubs in England and surely all the football players within this club are <i>inherently</i> notable. --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 03:08, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</s> switched to <b>Delete</b> per Qwghhlm's comments. --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 12:57, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not exactly certain... but one thing very much going against this article is that it reads like a promotional blurb for the site. Wikipedia does not explicitly prohibit people from creating pages about themselves, their company, or their organization -- although I personally think they should (explicitly prohibiting such edits would save so much wasted AfD time...). However, I would argue that if the site <i>is</i> notable enough for inclusion, then someone not directly attempting to promote the site would be willing to write an article about it. As written, I don't think the article is okay; it is too self-promoting. A rewrite might make it valid... but I'm guessing it's not notable enough to find an unaffiliated person to do a rewrite&#160;:D --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysweet_f27f.html" title="User:Jaysweet">Jaysweet</a> 17:04, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
