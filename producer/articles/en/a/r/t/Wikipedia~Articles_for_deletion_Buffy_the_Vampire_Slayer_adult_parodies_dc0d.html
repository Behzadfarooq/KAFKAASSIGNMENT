<p>Vanity: the page author seems to be involved in the comic book, and it doesn't meet notability reqs. The movies aren't Buffy parodies (and the article even says that about one of them). Most of the text about the movies is cut&amp;pasted from the sources listed, so the article is mostly a copyvio. Pornspam, too, do we really care about the umpteen other "Buffy" movies that have nothing to do with the TV show? "Parody" means more than alluding to something in the title, and these movies aren't parodies. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivianDarkbloom_43b2.html" title="User:VivianDarkbloom">VivianDarkbloom</a> 20:01, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Re:Vanity</b>: Please do not mislead voters Vivian:
<dl>
<dd>(<b>1</b>) I am the author of the article, and am not involved in the comic book, I simply named my login name after the comic.</dd>
<dd>(<b>2</b>) The comic, <i>Boffy the Vampire Layer</i> is an adult parody of <i>Buffy (TV series)</i>, and the movies <i>Buffy the Vampire Layer</i>, and <i>Muffy the Vampire Layer</i> are both parodies of <i>Buffy (TV series/movie)</i>. All of these three parodies contain young teenage slayers obviously parodying the character Buffy Summers. <i>Muffy the Vampire Slayer</i> is the only movie which in its content does not parody <i>Buffy</i> (TV/movie), simply it's title does.</dd>
<dd>(<b>3</b>) The text is not cut and pasted.. The sources listed were used for the story descriptions, but there was no copy &amp; paste involved and comparisons between the wiki-article and the sources will result in noticing there is complete rewording.</dd>
<dd>(<b>4</b>) Because of the points above, I do not see any genuine justification for nominating this article other than a dislike of adult content, but please review <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" rel="nofollow">WP:Not#Wikipedia is not censored</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/o/f/User%7EBoffy_Layer_70e8.html" title="User:Boffy Layer">Boffy Layer</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/f/User_talk%7EBoffy_Layer_3086.html" title="User talk:Boffy Layer">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Boffy_Layer_de19.html" title="Special:Contributions/Boffy Layer">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<li><i>Comment</i>: No, it's not a renomination. This article didn't even exist when the nomination you're talking about was made. And, besides, the copyvio problem would be cause for deletion alone, and that wasn't discussed before. The one guy who writes all the Buffyporn articles has been adding extra copies of "his" "work" under different headings. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivianDarkbloom_43b2.html" title="User:VivianDarkbloom">VivianDarkbloom</a> 19:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Re: Comment</b> Actually I created the articles about Buffy adult parodies, and rather than expanding as implied above, I took on board comments from VivianDarkbloom and reduced the number of articles (to only a single article: the one up for deletion; <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_adult_parodies_cc89.html" title="Buffy the Vampire Slayer adult parodies">Buffy the Vampire Slayer adult parodies</a>). -- <a href="../../../b/o/f/User%7EBoffy_Layer_70e8.html" title="User:Boffy Layer">Boffy Layer</a> 20:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>: Because this article did exist less than 24 hours after "<i>Buffy the Vampire Layer</i>", was up for deletion at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Buffy_the_Vampire_Layer_73c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Buffy the Vampire Layer">Afd: Buffy Layer</a> and there was already a general concensus for several days at that deletion forum to keep the merged article. -- <a href="../../../b/o/f/User%7EBoffy_Layer_70e8.html" title="User:Boffy Layer">Boffy Layer</a> 20:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> This is not exactly a re-nomination; in the previous case, people were expressing a desire that the individual film not have an article, but this was not created as a result of the debate, just during it. However, (1) I found very limited copyright problems, and fixed them, so that should no longer be an issue, but (2) this article is actually pretty <i>good,</i> and it's not cruft at all, but rather a fleshed-out list of examples of adult parodies of Buffy. Actually interesting; much more so than the endless books and episode articles. Plus, this article is very new, and can probably continue to be improved. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 20:26, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I've carefully looked at the article and it's sources and come to the conclusion that the article is well written - more so than most articles on Wikipedia. Therefore I'm a little puzzled that it's even up for deletion apart from the fact it includes adult content? -- <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyverse_d279.html" title="User:Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a> 20:52, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The author for this article has clearly put a lot of work into this article resulting in the parodies being verifiable. Furthermore I see no original research, and I see a neutral point of view. When the article is not breaking anything in the official "<a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">WP:Deletion policy</a>" isn't it unfair and against WP policy to delete it because some view it as 'cruft'? -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 23:09, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not that interested in many of the science articles on Wikipedia, but I'm not gonna suggest the Science editors get their own Wiki instead. In its ambitious mission of documenting the sum of all human knowledge, what is 'not encyclopedic'? My understanding of Wiki is that non-encyclopdic articles are the ones that do not follow the 3 core policies (verifiability, no original research, and neutral point of view), or articles that are listed on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html" title="WP:Not">WP:Not</a>; the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> says as much: "<i>All text created in the Wikipedia main namespace is subject to several important rules covering criteria for articles (<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>), encyclopedic quality (verifiability and original research), editorial approach (neutral point of view), as well as the Wikipedia copyright policy. Articles and text which are capable of meeting these should usually be remedied by editing</i>" and advises that articles that are not fulfilling these official policies are instead deleted. Also the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">deletion guidelines for admins</a> advises that "<i>the three key policies, which warrant that articles and information be verifiable, avoid being original research, and be written from a neutral point of view are held to be non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by any other guidelines</i>".</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a> meaning it doesn't have the same kind of practical limits <i>but</i>, also that it does not have have to cover topics that are tradiationally seen as 'academic'. Wikipedia does not rely on peer-reviewing, and it is not made just for academics, that's why it can cover almost anything including popular culture and even pornography (in this case the article draws from both). That's why the front page can even feature an article about <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoo.html" title="Spoo">a fictional food product made from alien worm-like creatures</a>. Yet so many continue to look down upon popular culture here trying to believe that Wikipedia is a professional encyclopedia that shouldn't be dealing with such matters of 'cruft'. However IMO part of the appeal of this encyclopedia is that it has the ability to overcome the idea that knowledge can be monopolised (by religious orders, governments, academia..). Having read the article and through the comments on this page, I see only 3 reasons people have voted 'delete': First, because they were influenced by the nominator's accusations before I responded to such accusations. Second, because the article references pornography. Third, because the article is not of interest to them because they are uninterested in <i>Buffy</i>. In conclusion, there is no real basis for the deletion. And IMHO it's actually better-cited and better-written than most articles here. -- <a href="../../../b/o/f/User%7EBoffy_Layer_70e8.html" title="User:Boffy Layer">Boffy Layer</a> 19:15, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
