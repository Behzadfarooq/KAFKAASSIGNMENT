Baqir as-Sadr makes the claim in the work that the theory is a particular concept found in Islamic philosophy, and perhaps it is (it may be that it is more commonly translated by some other term in english). Baqir as-Sadr is certainly a notable and quotable source (although the article on his book is also up for deletion), but someone better versed in Islamic philosophy than me needs to establish if it is a particular concept acknowledged and recognised in the field, or whether it is a term only found in Baqir as-Sadr's works (or even, a mis-labelling introduced by his translator).--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 14:08, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</font></font></li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> The book's author <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_Baqir_al-Sadr_2358.html" title="Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr">Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr</a> is certainly notable as one of the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_Iraq_de40.html" title="Islam in Iraq">more prominent</a> Iraqi Shiite clerics, jurisprudents and <i><a href="../../../u/l/e/Ulema.html" title="Ulema">ulema</a></i> of the 20th C., and much of that notability rests on what he said, wrote and philosophised about (rather goes with the job description). Accordingly, significant works of his such as this book and his work on economics (<i><a href="../../../i/q/t/Iqtisaduna.html" title="Iqtisaduna">Iqtisaduna</a></i> ) are likewise notable, just as they are for works of other religious and philosophical figures. As for its content, I do not believe it to be OR, since it seems only to summarise the book's content and main points (which is what other articles on books mainly do), and is readily verifiable since as pointed out above the book's text is available online in english. It's not really a 'review', and there are no grandiose claims, opinions, or other unsubstantiable mentions that I can see which would push this into OR. I don't see a reason to suspect they are not the contributing editor's own words either. The other oddities can be attributed perhaps to the contributor's unfamiliarity with wikipedia conventions, and I take the 'to be continued' tag as the contributor flagging that they intend to expand on the article. I agree that the prose does need a good copyedit and the overall style needs to be less idiosyncratic, but these can presumably be addressed.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 05:14, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It should only be deleted if you also delete WebMD. Please go to the Wikipedia's entry for Personal Health Record. WebMD is entered in the Examples section. If you follow the link for WebMD there is NO deletion request. WebMD's personal health record is a commercial product, for which users must pay an yearly fee. The fact that the editor does not choose to hide her identity behind an alias should not be the reason for deletion. There was nothing to hide given the obvious precedent for WebMD's commercial product. simone@RecordsForLiving.com 25 May 2006</p>

<p>The initial keep result for this article at its first AfD was contested at DRV. A very messy sequence of events ensued involving an out-of-process deletion (and reopening, and reclosing, of the first debate.) The confusing result was judged by DRV consensus to be in error.

<li><b>Keep</b>. To repeat what I said at the DRV, this page meets the basic standard of usefulness. Lists are useful for conducting research, e.g. on the topic of why entities choose to add exclamation points to trademarks. For instance, why was <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dare_%28album%29.html" title="Dare (album)">Dare (album)</a> released as "Dare!" in the U.S. and "Dare" elsewhere? A list is the best way to organize this information because it maintains its availability for those who are interested and does not intrude upon other pages. Presuming that our policies are directed at creating a useful reference work, it's hard to imagine that they are intended to cause us to delete useful pages such as this. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 04:12, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't buy the arguments about why this list would be useful.

What purpose does this list serve? When do I ask the question: "what are all the proper nouns that contain an exclamation mark"? I can't think of a realistic answer to that.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm the author. Lindomar is indeed a significant internet fad in Brazil, you can see the numbers in the article and confirm them by searching Orkut. I think searching Orkut and getting big numbers provides enough verifiability. There are also many webpages (including blogs) about him, as told by Google. Also see the talk page for my other arguments. If you want cleanup, do it yourself, or say exactly what is the problem, and I'll do it. I have already read some Wikipedia guidelines in Wikipedia and I think the article is OK. As someone has already pointed, I reused the photo from the Portuguese wikipedia, but I did not write that article (though I edited it to make it less messy, though it is still messy) nor based this one in that one. I based the article from the communities in Orkut and in the "Diário de Pernambuco" that you can see in the references. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorgePeixoto_851f.html" title="User:JorgePeixoto">Jorge</a> 06:13, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>Noteable</i> It seems to me that Aquygen deserves mention, if nothing else. I do not personally believe that "it has to be a hoax" qualifies this article's deletion. It may, if not worded correctly, constitute the disputability of the factuality of the article, however it does desirve mention. If the so called "fact" of the matter that this article is claimed as a hoax by those who are, for lack of a better description, biased ensures its deletion, shouldn't the article on cold fusion (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion</a>) be deleted/removed as well? What is happening here is that some people feel that it is their duty to subvert any possible hoax rather than allow the mention of notable happenings in our modern time; a hoax is also worthy mention, at the very least as a stub.

It is a scientific fact that you can verify by contacting Hydrogen Technology Application Inc. They are based in Clearwater Florida.

<li><b>Delete</b> unverifiable/NN. First, searched ChemFinder and found no results. Then, searched through AcademicSearchElite and found an obscure molecular physics study about photofragmentation of H20 and D20, but I think the "HHO geometry" refers not to a compound that is different than water, but a physical arrangement of the atoms that compose water (Title: Photodissociation of Water. II. Wave Packet Calculations for the Photofragmentation of H2O and D2O in the B- band" by Harrevelt and van Hemert. Also, a side note: Article is dated April 1, 2000. Published in the Journal of Chemical Physics). One article in particular, "Pseudoscience today, theater lighting controls, and more" made it sound like HHO is just a stoichiometric mix of hydrogen (2 parts) and oxygen (one part), not a chemical compound with the formula HHO (which is WATER, people!).</li>

<p>This is, irreparably, the author's POV. It may or may not be a valid philosophical concept, but it is the author's view of the universe.

There are many people who will be searching for this person on Wikipedia and thus they should be presented with a factual description of who he is and what he does.

<p><font color="#FF6633">Wikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not:</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF6633">Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a "sympathetic point of view" for every article. Self-promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006 that: "Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves, their direct family or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so." [1] Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles, or to articles in which you have a personal stake, is similarly unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography and Wikipedia:Notability. Advertising. Articles about companies and products are acceptable if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small "garage" or local companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. See also WP:CORP for a proposal on corporate notability. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Humbledof (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Humbledof_d116.html" title="Special:Contributions/Humbledof">contribs</a>) .</small></font></p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>REDIRECT</b> to <i>Text and rubrics of the Roman Canon</i>. TerenceOng's rather summary dismissal doesn't really help a great deal, but the analysis by the other two editors is more useful. This seems like a harmless enough redirect, and there's little reason to simply retain content that contains established errors when error-free content is available elsewhere. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:15, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

The English translations in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Canon_abbf.html" title="Roman Canon">Roman Canon</a> could be a useful addition to <a href="../../../t/e/x/Text_and_rubrics_of_the_Roman_Canon_24bc.html" title="Text and rubrics of the Roman Canon">Text and rubrics of the Roman Canon</a>, but the latter article contains most of the useful content. In fact, once the articles have been merged, I'd be inclined to rename the merged article as "Roman Canon". <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a> 13:43, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> By "duplication" I did not, of course, mean "copy". The full Latin text with English translation is already in <a href="../../../t/e/x/Text_and_rubrics_of_the_Roman_Canon_24bc.html" title="Text and rubrics of the Roman Canon">Text and rubrics of the Roman Canon</a>, one free from errors found in the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Canon_abbf.html" title="Roman Canon">Roman Canon</a> article such as "is being shed" (in Latin, "effunditur"), as a translation of "effundetur" (will be shed), and "do" (in Latin, "facite") as a translation of "facietis" (you will do) in the phrase "do this in memory of Me". If <i>in addition to</i> the full text given in each section described a continuous text of the whole Canon were desired, a link to any of several websites would be enough. In short, what valid material is there to merge into the article that "contains most of the useful content"? (As for the quite separate question of renaming, we would have to consider also the candidacy of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_of_the_Mass_8081.html" title="Canon of the Mass">Canon of the Mass</a>, with which most other articles link at present.) - I see now that I forgot to sign.

(By the way, a single hit <i>in Google Books</i> is not negligible, though I'd rather see half-a-dozen to a dozen. For comparison, exact phrase "Charles Atlas" gets 1200 hits in 100 books).</dd>
<dd>Re vanity: both this article and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooks_Kubik_bd54.html" title="Brooks Kubik">Brooks Kubik</a> were created by <a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETjic_e1bf.html" title="User:Tjic">User:Tjic</a>. Based on his user page and other contributions, I would be very surprised if Tjic were Brooks Kubik himself or even a close associate, and these contributions and his other contributions does not follow the typical pattern of the pitbull self-promoter who thinks he can use Wikipedia for free advertising or building website traffic. Furthermore, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dinosaur_Training&amp;oldid=20049503" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dinosaur_Training&amp;oldid=20049503" rel="nofollow">original Tjic text</a> as well as subsequent edits are completely free from promotional or hucksterish language. So, I don't see vanity, though I do see a question of how recognized and important this is in the muscle-building community. (To which I don't belong).</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Ok, not vanity. But non-notable chapter in non-notable book doesn't add up to notability. -- FRCP11 13:08, 25 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think I used the word "borderline." Here's yet another case of "borderline:" I'm not sure how to link this, but go to www.a9.com, select only "books", and type "brooks d. kubik" in quotations. You get the out-of-print book, the Ironman book... and allusions to Kubik by two other strength-training authors. Typing in "brooks kubik" (no d.) yields three different mentions by other writers. In other words, a handful of strength-training authors have mentioned his name in print. Tell you what: I'll change "weak keep" to something weaker. If someone kicks sand in my face I'll probably cave in altogether. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:24, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. "Dinosaur Training" is fairly well known in strength training circles. I thought part of the goal of Wikipedia was to serve as a learning tool, but the standard here seems to be "non-notable, because I haven't heard of it". Does one have to be as well-known as Charles Atlas to merit an entry? And calling the book that cited Dinosaur Training non-notable seems rather weak; it was published by McGraw-Hill - not exactly self-published. <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 00:21, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The AfD for Leistner was pointing here per <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> Section 6 for related articles. If you want to argue that one meets Wikipedia notability criteria and one doesn't and that they should be split up, you're welcome to split them up. I was trying to save time, because Dinosaur Training should've been included in the Brooks Kubik AfD. -- FRCP11 01:20, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I have split the two. Saving time seems like a poor reason to combine them; Leistner and Dinosaur Training aren't directly linked (Kubik and Dinosaur Training would've been a more reasonable pairing). <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 02:32, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm the guy who first created it. I was the out-going president. I made it sound self-congratulatory because... it was my baby, right? But this is a society of prestige - I could list you twelve ex-presidents who are now HC/CA/HL judges, senior partners in noteworthy Solicitors firms or in fact give you a life story of our Honourable President - Lord Mustill. (Legend that he is). I thought the point of wiki was that anyone could add. No-one had set it up before, so I did. I'm not entirely qualified to fill all the details - but isn't the point that it will gradually grow? User:NWP20 25 May 2006 19:07 (BST)</p>

<p><b>Responce from the article creator:</b> When editing the article, I must have misunderstood when it said to expand it and after expanded delete the 'importance tag'. I'm guessing that was for an administrator to delete and not myself. My apologies. We wanted to create a resource that talked about what VR in the Schools is and how it is used (much like how wikipedia has pages on Universities). We didn't consider this advertising since all of our information is free and and VR in the Schools is non-commercial. I can understand however how advertising can be perceived. I do apologize for taking your time, we did not intend to break any rules.

<p>I really don't understand how this website is worthy of an article on Wikipedia. From what I can gather it's just a fan site with a small following and has no wide appeal to anyone not specifically interested in the subject. Also it meets none of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">Wikipedia's criteria</a> for notable web content.

<p>This was originally a speedy candidate, but the person in question may be notable. 500+ Google hits, and fronts for a band.

<li>I commented on the talk page about that. It's really a very tough call, but looking at the facts and when I can see from this article I belive it should be a <b>keep</b>, they seem to be a legitimate band. They have a decent list of songs, a strong following, I feel very mixed but it appears this should be a keep.

<li>I think the problem with all you people who spend your lives editing other people's contribution is that you seem to think that this is YOUR web site. that YOU can decide what is on it and what's not. Might you ever spend some time out of your speed deleting addiction to realise that people in the 'london indie scene' may find information about this little known band and its members more interesting than some obscure 17th century french explorer who appears in length on this site. I am simply asking you to be a little more open minded and to realise that just because your itchy little fingers cannot keep off your mouse button, the success of this web site depends on freedom of information for those who want it not on the ideals of 'wikipedians'.</li>

OUR</b> website. it doesn't depend on you, or the two other people who appear on this page. there are millions of wikipedia users. how do you know that the majority of them don't want this site? When you are running out of server space and need the 500kb that this article uses up let me know and i will be more than willing to give it up for a better cause. Until then...mind your own business.</p>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> per <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criterion A7</a>.

<p>Would you like to hear a song as proof? You must consider yourself the source of all music knoweledge if you can justifiably decide that this band doesn't exist. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 137.222.240.11 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.222.240.11_4613.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.222.240.11">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Whether or not the band exists is a nonissue. When judging music-related articles for inclusion in Wikipedia, <a href="../../../n/m/g/WP%7ENMG_d058.html" title="WP:NMG">notability</a> is the currency of the realm ... and that's what we're failing to find. Proof of notability is the responsibility of the article's creator or editors. Perhaps instead of responding to every "delete" vote in this thread, you might take it upon yourself to furnish <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> proof of the band's notability, and save the article from deletion. (Sadly, "would you like to hear a song" is not proof of notability -- see <a href="../../../n/m/g/WP%7ENMG_d058.html" title="WP:NMG">WP:NMG</a> for examples of what -is-.) When creating other articles in the future, you might consider being proactive and including proof of notability as part of the article <i>when you write it</i>, thus avoiding this scenario altogether.

<dd>Existence is not the same thing as notability. My left foot exists, but you won't find an article on it on Wikipedia because it just isn't important enough to warrant one.

<li>That is interesting. You seem to think that people want to know that you are 23, like beer, science and good books? Surely your foot would be more interesting? I think the discrepancy between my ideas and your is that you seem to think that somehow an article which may not interest everybody is not worth placing on wikipedia. Why does this matter? It makes no different to anyone's surfing pleasure, doesn't offend anyone, and can by its existence only be beneficial. There are one and a half million articles on wikipedia. What's one more or less? I think that maybe you should all worry a little more about contributing information yourselves onto this site rather than imposing your non existent authority on others who are just trying to get in the spirit of things. You don't own wikipedia, you don't control wikipedia and you have no right to presume that your vote counts for the whole world.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> while i've heard of this artist (and seen him perform in TO) his insignificant number of releases on labels which themselves are insignificant does not help him pass the WP:MUSIC guidelines.

<li><b>Keep</b> While I'm sure that judgement comes from a lot of experience, it doesn't feel like there's much consideration involved. The notability of OpenBBQ/OpenJam isn't just the purpose stated, but that it's 1) the first event of this kind, and 2) that it is a charity benefit event for what is arguably a notable debate going on in the Raleigh, NC area. Wouldn't the philanthropic nature of this event make it notable? As for the localness and the fact that it's only one day, I would argue that the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_City_Limits_Music_Festival_504c.html" title="Austin City Limits Music Festival">Austin City Limits Music Festival</a> is also a local festival that started with only two days. Since there is no official notability policy, I guess I'd like to see a little more argument for why this wouldn't be considered notable. Where is that line?

<li>In all fairness to that could I pester you to wait a little while? If the merging of the strucutures pages proves to be an acceptable compromise then there will not be any reason to delete the other pages. When I created the pages I designed them to ebe and flow to conform to wikipedia’s policies and guidelines, but for them to be reborn in a more acceptable form means coordinating a large amount of info, and that job only gets harder if there happens to be a time limit on the construction, as is the case here. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomStar81_7db8.html" title="User:TomStar81">TomStar81</a> 06:41, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have nominated this article because of the use of the word "trivia", which is defined by wiktionary as <i>insignificant trifles of little importance, especially items of unimportant information</i>. This puts the article in direct conflict with my understanding of the following Wikipedia guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Articles title assumes that the information therin is trivial, violating <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a></li>
<li>If we are to assume that the articles information is indeed trivial then it is violating <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Imporance</a>.</li>
<li>Finally being that a trivia list is inherintly a list of random facts, this article is in violation of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some or all of the information in this artile may be good however, it should be integrated into proper places within established articles. For advice on how this may be accomplished you might want to look at: <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">Wikipedia:Trivia</a> and <a href="../../../g/k/2F/User%7EGK_On_adding_trivia_to_the_main_body_of_an_article_ae34.html" title="User:GK/On adding trivia to the main body of an article">User:GK/On adding trivia to the main body of an article</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_stuart_c99c.html" title="User:The stuart">The_stuart</a> 17:48, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge and delete</b> i think some of the information may be relevant in other pages, but as much as I love Pink Floyd, I don't see the need for a free-standing article. -- <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStubblyhead_0a29.html" title="User:Stubblyhead">stubblyh</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">ea</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">d</a> | <sup><a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStubblyhead_555f.html" title="User talk:Stubblyhead">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_stubblyhead_ad64.html" title="Special:Contributions/stubblyhead">c</a></sub> 18:08, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The information in the article is both important and interesting. It is possible that this is not the best use of the word "trivia" and the article should be renamed or reorganized, but that doesn't mean the article gets deleted. Additionally, it doesn't appear that the nominator made an attempt to seriously evaluate the article before nominating it. I don't agree with nominating an article based on a word in its title. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 18:47, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The nomination pretty much says everything. This page is certainly an indiscriminate list of information, and importance is definitely an issue.

<li><b>Keep</b> but rename per angus in order to clarify the worth of this article. Many of the things in this article are not trivial, especially the items in the miscellaneous section, and the info about cycles and synchronicities. I understand wanting to divide it up among the respective albums, but it is nice to have everything here in one place. However, some of the more speculative pieces, such as Bill Clinton's dog's name being a reference to the song of the same name, should be removed or cited. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelmills_0f99.html" title="User:Joelmills">Joelmills</a> 01:19, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Objection to this article on the ground that "trivia" breaches Wiki's NPOV and "importance" values is specious. I agree that some of the material is too trivial to include, but certainly the cycles and synchs deserve to be kept.Grimhim 10:16, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> Speculative items <b>need</b> citations. Alot of the content is valid and should be merged with <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_Floyd_f331.html" title="Pink Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> (but rename it if it's such a big deal) - much of this information is precisely the kind of thing which people look to the Wikipedia for, but which most users consider too <i>trivial</i> to include in the main article, which is already bursting at the seams. That doesn't necessarily mean that the information is in any way <i>trivial</i> to someone looking for information about the band, such as synchronicities and the band's cultural influences, nor does it imply things too trivial to include in the Wikipedia. Much information which is "uncited" are direct observations - what citation is needed for mentioning a <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> poster in a television series, clearly observable to anyone watching the episode? - <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">dharm</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">bum</a> 10:10, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> This article has a purpose and an interest. I see no reason for it to be deleted. Merging would only serve to lengthen the already long original article.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- I'm certain this article was split to avoid an overly long article at <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_Floyd_f331.html" title="Pink Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>. Perhaps a rename to Pink Floyd facts or a more suitable less-trivial name is in order. - <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 02:29, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but rework. Most information is interesting but doesn't fit into the main article because of it's size.

There has been a section about "influences" and so on suggested on the talk page of the main article. Instead a section in the main article it should become a seperate article (because of size).

<li><b>Keep</b> - Please scroll down. There is <b>no established policy</b> about this. Several trivia articles have been created if the main article will get too big or too cluttered with the inclusion of the facts. The Calcutta article is difficult to edit, but is expanding at an extraordinary rate. I strongly recommend that we leave this as is, in order to avoid cluttering up the main article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Way too long to merge with main article. I have to take issue with two of the nom's main points. The word <i>trivia</i> is well established in describing relatively unimportant aspects of pop culture, so I do not think it is POV. Trivia is not listed under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> because it is not a list of loosely associated information - it is very much associated with the main topic. As to importance, well, the nom makes a valid point, but for a popular show like this, it is acceptable to have <i>relativly unimportant</i> facts in their own article (again, one that is as long as this). --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelmills_0f99.html" title="User:Joelmills">Joelmills</a> 01:40, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It's rediculous if you think this information doen't belong in wikipedia because of some technicality that doesn't even apply to this article. It might be a good idea to merge the page if there were only a handfull of trivia items, but this is a huge amount of information and could not possibly be merged with the article. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlaze_b5ad.html" title="User:Glaze">Glaze</a> 17:29, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - It's my belief that Wikipedia's rules are a guide, not hard-and-fast rules for which she would get lost in their minutiae. The trivia page is too big to be incorporated into the main article but it is the kind of interesting sub-article that people looking for information on That '70s Show might like to read. This isn't a print encyclopedia where we're worried about space, so an article like this that offers an interested reader more in-depth information that they might not find elsewhere is something that should stay. DetectiveFork 19:10, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Delete this and you'll have to get rid of the vast amounts of useless Star Wars, Star Trek, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, (etc, etc) information which so many people have wasted so much of their time on. It might as well stay (besides, I want to read it). - Rik</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The article is far too long to incorporate into the main article, and editing it to fit would not do the main article justice. It isn't causing any harm by being separate, and is very informative besides. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikekearn_68aa.html" title="User:Mikekearn">Mike</a> 07:40, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- We shouldn't delete something like this because of a few technicalities. This article is damn well informative and should be kept for people to peruse. Besides, it's too long to merge with the main article. Candidates for deletion should be articles on esoteric topics, and "That '70s Show" is definitely not little-known. If everyone in here is too concerned about such trivial (pun unintended) details, then the simplest way to fix the problem is to change the title of the article. --User:Inviktos</li>
<li><b>Keep! Please!</b> - This is way too long to merge back into the main article. The main article was a mess when most of this stuff was part of the article. Separating this material into a separate trivia page helped clean up the article for That 70s Show. If you read the Wikipedia:Trivia article, you'll see that while Wikipedia policy is not to promote trivia, it does not ban it. Obviously plenty of people feel that the That 70s Show trivia meets the qualification for being interesting enough to keep. <a href="../../../w/r/y/User%7EWryspy_d7ae.html" title="User:Wryspy">Wryspy</a> 08:35, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> "Trivia" is a commonly used term on Wikipedia, I don't think that's a valid reason for deletion. In addition, the trivia section was in the main <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charmed.html" title="Charmed">Charmed</a></i> article, and it was placed in its own article because of its size. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiraLuka_a2e1.html" title="User:MiraLuka"><font color="purple"><b>Mira</b></font></a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMiraLuka_ed02.html" title="User talk:MiraLuka"><font color="blue"><b>Luka</b></font></a> 23:15, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Trivia has been split off because it was too long.

I suggest pruning the trivia down to the information relevant to the show, adding why it is relevant (such as the end-of-season door closing that has become a trademark of the show). <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamDobay_1d3b.html" title="User:AdamDobay">AdamDobay</a> 10:47, 27 May 2006 (UTC) Addition #2: Restructuring the article perhaps shows better that it contains notable information that is not insignificant.
<ul>
<li>If the information within this article is important, sifnificant, relevent, or notable then the article is incorrectly titled if you note the definition of "trivia".

<li><b>Keep.</b> I created this page to solve a problem - namely, that the headline <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Underground_1afc.html" title="London Underground">London Underground</a> article was way, way too big and unstructured. It's a subject about which there are a lot of factoids and bits of information which are interesting but not interesting enough for the already-bloated main page. This page provides somewhere for them to go - otherwise they would just start appearing back on the headline article again, leading to more reversions, more editor effort, and more edit wars as people battle over what's important enough to be on the headline article and what's not. In short, this page is there for a reason! --<a href="../../../m/p/k/User%7EMpk_a450.html" title="User:Mpk">Mike</a> 18:33, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - per Mike. The information on this page is useful to hundreds of people looking for information such as this. Most articles would have it on the main article, but the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Underground_1afc.html" title="London Underground">London Underground</a> article is far too bloated already. <a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjr_xi_bca9.html" title="User:Djr xi"><b>DJR</b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../d/j/r/User_talk%7EDjr_xi_f6e8.html" title="User talk:Djr xi">Talk</a>)</small> 18:35, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> It's quite different to something like "Tom Cruise trivia" - discussing LU trivia is a common pasttime for Londoners. None of the facts are original research, they are things that people discuss and pass around. It really is in a different category to the other trivia pages marked for deletion.

<li>Having <i>read</i> the article, IMHO the content is wiorthy of inclusion. The issue is whether it is collected here, where people can find it, or divided among multiple articles according to subject-matter, which will make it difficult to co-ordinate the suble connectivities involved -- <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockpuppetSamuelson_cde2.html" title="User:SockpuppetSamuelson">SockpuppetSamuelson</a> 07:32, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- per mike. Many articles have trivia and some articles have big sections which deserve seperate articles <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimply_south_c93c.html" title="User:Simply south">Simply south</a> 11:14, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - it might be titled 'trivia' but it's far less trivial than dozens of articles about episodes of Star Trek or obscure American public servants. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBretonbanquet_dd44.html" title="User:Bretonbanquet">Bretonbanquet</a> 23:05, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - Most articles have a trivia section. Just because this one's is long enough to be moved to a separate page doesn't change that. --<a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDtcdthingy_8e94.html" title="User:Dtcdthingy">Dtcdthingy</a> 04:05, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I have contributed to this article and consider it worthwhile to retain it as a stand-alone page. As has been pointed out, this page does not represent original research but instead acts as a catalogue of facts about London's underground system which are circulated amongst Londoners much as one might circulate jokes or indeed any meme of information. I'd say this page is already the best record on the Internet of such facts and should hence be retained. 'Trivia' in the title of the page is being used in a far less pejorative sense than "things which are trifling or unimportant", and is instead being used more in the sense of "bite-sized facts". I think trivia is the best title for the page but perhaps we could work on an alternative title referring to 'facts'.</li>

If there's too much info for main article, yet it is important and it needs a place, I'd appreciate the article's creator adding his views.

<p>I have nominated this article because of the use of the word "trivia", which is defined by wiktionary as <i>insignificant trifles of little importance, especially items of unimportant information</i>. This puts the article in direct conflict with my understanding of the following Wikipedia guidelines:</p>

<dd>I think HansTAR was trying to say that the trivia shouldn't go on the Amazing Race pages because there is too much and it would create clutter.

<li>If I may say this: what may be non-notable and unimportant to some might be perfectly well-fitted in an encyclopedia for others. I, for example, could care less about a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_performed_on_American_Idol_a4cb.html" title="List of songs performed on American Idol">list of songs performed on American Idol</a> (which, to me, seems just as "fan-ny" as this article). However, if ever I need to do research for American Idol, I know that good ol' Wikipedia contains just the list I need. Same with Amazing Race trivia. I'm all for changing the title and trimming any completely unnecessary details, but, again, I cite that this is not merely a random assortment of facts, but an organized list in the same manner as that American Idol list. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansTAR_ef6a.html" title="User:HansTAR">HansTAR</a> 05:08, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I created the page in question, and would suggest deleting rather than merging. These points are interesting and fun to know, but are not really appropriate for a proper encyclopedic article. They do not add any important information to Pascal's life. They are just odd "fun facts" left over from spending a long time researching him for the main article. I wouldn't suggest merging them with the main article because it will degrade the quality and sobriety of that article. So my vote is for deletion if it is not appropriate for List of trivia lists under Wikipedia rules. <a href="../../../c/o/t/User%7ECott12_9235.html" title="User:Cott12">Chris</a> 21:07, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - what's with all this hatred for trivia? Like the author says we shouldn't be merging tons of trivia back in main articles. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsRover_23ea.html" title="User:MarsRover">MarsRover</a> 04:49, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Merge</b></s> is the best option as most of this information should be in the article. It provides valuable insights into Pascal's life, career and character. It lends more colour. That is not a bad thing. Also the article is curiously deficient in parts. We have the information about the will and the court battle, but the outcome is separated out into the "trivia" article. That doesn't make sense. I don't regard most of this information as trivial. To leave them out is virtually censoring the main article and not providing a full rounded picture. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 23:21, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the main article links to the trivia list under "See also," so nothing is lost by keeping it separate. While some might merge nicely (like his missing son and his earlier film career), some of the odder things in the trivia list just don't seem to warrant Encycopedic mention, such as his peculiar nicknames by his guru or that he was naked when he got into movies and when he met Shaw. Just a thought to consider. Maybe this could be solved by merging some and deleting the rest. People can always read the biographies for the other material. <a href="../../../c/o/t/User%7ECott12_9235.html" title="User:Cott12">Chris</a> 01:03, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree! Peculiar nicknames by guru give an insight into what was going on behind the public image, and the naked bit too, especially with Shaw. It fleshes out (excuse pun - not intended, honest) the facts. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:41, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Almost all the material has now been merged into the main article, and the part about David Lean co-directing "Major Barbara" has been moved to Wiki's <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lean_b22d.html" title="David Lean">David Lean</a> article. I still haven't figured out how to explain how Margaret Scott paid his debts to his mistress, his last option payment on "My Fair Lady," and his hospital bill on his death-bed -- later to be repaid from the estate (actually her daughter was repaid from the estate as Margaret either jumped or fell out of a window to her death in NY before the settlement came through), and various other tid-bits such as that he didn't drink, but smoked cigars profusely to the point where Shaw became alarmed. Perhaps these are truly trivial in the sense that they are unimportant. I may still see if they can also be included in a coherent way. I will wait till the end of the 5 day arbitration in case there are more votes to keep the Trivia page. I don't know how to delete it, so I will leave that to an administrator. <a href="../../../c/o/t/User%7ECott12_9235.html" title="User:Cott12">Chris</a> 16:24, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have now moved everything over to the main article. If anyone wants to remove this trivia entry, be my guest. I don't know how to do it. I think the inclusions actually improved the article and I am greatful for all the input and support. I also want to add that I am very proud of the Gabriel Pascal Wikipedia article now as it is the only article about Pascal over one paragraph long on the entire World Wide Web and all facts are from quality published sources. <a href="../../../c/o/t/User%7ECott12_9235.html" title="User:Cott12">Chris</a> 21:54, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have nominated this article because of the use of the word "trivia", which is defined by wiktionary as <i>insignificant trifles of little importance, especially items of unimportant information</i>. This puts the article in direct conflict with my understanding of the following Wikipedia guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Articles title assumes that the information therin is trivial, violating <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a></li>
<li>If we are to assume that the articles information is indeed trivial then it is violating <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Imporance</a>.</li>
<li>Finally being that a trivia list is inherintly a list of random facts, this article is in violation of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some or all of the information in this artile may be good however, it should be integrated into proper places within established articles.

I therefore also see articles about political party fraction leaders as justified.

<dd>Though it seems to me that this allows for an article on Luc Verhelst, while undoubtedly readers may find such interesting, I do have serious doubts about the interest of the submitter: the content of the initial article does not give the impression that sufficient information is given so as to fulfill the eagerness of readers. With respect for both parties in a discussion that has been going on between them (and myself) for the last couple of days, this very fact should have made creation of the article improper. As an anonymous submitter, I am quite conscious of Luc Verhelst signing his articles by what I assume to be his real name. One can not write such article on my name or on the name of people using an alias, whatever my or their public role might be. Since Luc Verhelst can hardly be allowed to write his own article, it should disappear ASAP. -- 213.224.87.185 2006-05-26 07:04 (UTC)

<li><b>??</b> I'll totally admit that I could be wrong, but it looks like the vanity guidelines say that it's more of a cause for editing out the vain parts rather than deleting the article, and I believe the offending content has been removed, and the Cubscast article now appears to be totally objective. It seems to me that you guys are singling out one article, sometimes judging it by standards which exceed Wikipedia's guidelines (maybe using what you wish the guidelines were). There are countless examples as previouisly mentioned about other podcast entries which have no real merit (unlike this one), yet for some reason have faced no opposition, and are still included in Wiki. The real question becomes, what rules does the current edit violate? Your initial reaction was very justified, but the article has now been edited. I don't see why you can't work with the creator to make it "acceptable" instead of trying to delete it alltogether, while allowing hundreds of less-qualified entires to stay.

<li><b>Response</b> - Well, I'll admit I don't know if WP has guidelines for what to do if the article is created, but I do that writing about yourself/your organization is explicity a <a href="../../../b/a/i/WP%7EBAI_39d0.html" title="WP:BAI">bad article idea</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 22:34, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Re: Response</b> I think I caused a lot of this trouble because I was the one that pointed out to them that they should have an entry. I should have added the entry myself, rather than telling them they should. But what’s done is done and the article now appears fine. I think everyone (even the orignal author) agrees the original article was in violation, but now that the article has been amended, I don’t see how it’s in violation at all. It’s objective, relavanet and follows the guidelines. If you’d like me or someone else outside Cubscast to add the same entry strictly out of quasi-principle, fine, but that just seems silly.

<li>If there are podcasts less notable than this on Wikipedia, they too should be deleted. Wikipedia has standards for notability. For an extreme example, you can't write about friend's dog for a Wikipedia article. Because of Wikipedia has such standards, you must prove a subject's notability in order for it to be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 00:43, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The Chicago Tribune found it notable enough to write articles on it multiple times. RedEye newspaper in Chicago also did a color feature on it. WGN radio, one of the largest stations in the world, interviewed a host of the show about the popularity of podcasts and this podcast in particular. Celebrities find it notable enough to go on the show. Many thousands of people a day listen to it. Is that not notable? CaptainSer 01:09, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>A local color feature, especially in something like RedEye, which has, let's face it, a lot of fluff, is not really a good indication. Also, there's a difference between something that may be considered notable locally (and just about anything about the Cubs is notable in Chicago) and what should be considered notable in a worldwide encyclopedia. I don't know about the number of downloaders: what is the bar for a podcast? I suspect the listeners for one team's fanbase are much smaller than a lot of podcasts with wider appeal. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 17:35, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Then I guess it's a good thing that the RedEye article isn't the only outside source that proves notability, but one of several. Have you guys actually looked at the new edit of the Cubscast Wiki entry?? Certainly you consider a New York affiliate of NPR, WGN Radio, and an in-flight magazine as better sources. 2 of those are non local, and WGN is broadcast nationwide if not world wide. Not to mention the huge feature in the Chicago Tribune. Also, the fan base might be smaller for a niche podcast, but because WGN is a national/worldwide station there are cubs fans literally everywhere. And, as it has been argued here before, Wiki currently hosts articles on 113 other podcasts besides Cubscast. Most of them are much, much, much smaller and lesser known, and a huge majority of them dont have ANY outside sources linked from their articles. Claytonb1987 17:44, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, regardless, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> makes no such local/national distinction, and Cubscast has provided other non-local examples in addition to the ones which you personally could consider local. WGNradio is also freely available on their website, which makes it internationally accessible. Claytonb1987 18:22, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>WGN radio was also an original clear channel station, so they are local if you consider millions and millions of people and a 6 state reach local. I'm not sure an entire region of the US including one of the largest cities in the world should be called local. I also happened to listen to the interview on the internet in Canada.

<p>And while I can make no judgements to the triviality or not of the sites it's contained on. There are certanly multiple publications of the I Like Monkeys peom (existing on at least 100 separate websites). Which also makes it source independent. While there may not be enough content to qualify for a article of it's own, I believe it desurves a place in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Phenomenon_7c5a.html" title="Internet Phenomenon">Internet Phenomenon</a> article at the very least. - <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomodachigai_ab30.html" title="User:Tomodachigai">Tomodachigai</a></p>

<li>The problem isn't that it's not a phenomenon yet, it's that it was a phenomenon in the 1990's and it's popularity is winding down (see <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Phenomenon_7c5a.html" title="Internet Phenomenon">Internet Phenomenon</a> for more information on how they work)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. To me, the goal of an encyclopedia is to answer the questions "What is it?" and "Where did it come from?". The article answers both of these questions. Even if the answer to the latter is "No one knows". What a delete suggests is that this article not only has no value, but that, because of it's existance, it actually detracts from the Wikipedia. I created this article because I myself wondered those very questions, and I must admit, I was somewhat surprized when the article didn't exist. So I did the research, and found the answers myself. Maybe not the ones I wanted, but the only answers availaible. Then I figured I'd put that research to use, so that not only could I help others looking for the same answers that I was. But also, add to a part of the Wikipedia where it was lacking.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article wasn't even given a fair chance for survival, having been speedy deleted almost as soon as it was created. It was originally thought to be "nonsense" or a "test page". Then the article had to go through the undeletion process, to finally arrive here at AfD. With only one contributer (myself), and a few hours of live time, of course it's small and undeveloped. All I ask is that you give this article a chance. Thank you. - <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomodachigai_ab30.html" title="User:Tomodachigai">Tomodachigai</a></p>

<dd>This is it, Tomo. This is the chance. I admit I did not support its restoration on the DRV, but only because I knew what the result would be (hint: look at the above votes). They didn't vote "delete" because it's small and undeveloped; they voted for deletion because there is no potential for it to grow, or to develop. All "I like monkeys" is is a funny story. There are lots of them. It was briefly popular about 6-10 years ago, but it never rose to an Internet phenomenon like "All your base are belong to us" did. The latter was featured in a major syndicated comic strip, without further explanation (thus showing that Bill Amend thought a good number of his readers would get it); the former is ... just a funny story. (Not even all that funny, in my opinion, but to each his own.) The question is, how does this help the encyclopedia? What useful information could possibly be written about this story that cannot be divined by simply reading the story itself? "No one knows who wrote it" is not useful, because it's not true; <i>someone</i> knows. Unless some external source has written <i>something</i> about this story, there's no encyclopedic content that can possibly be added to this article. It may be unfortunate, but that's the grim reality. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 01:57, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> per Leifern and IZAK, particularly due to the WP:Libel issue. There is no indication that the case has even gone to trial yet, let alone reached a verdict. A mere "allegation" or "civil lawsuit" against a person is completely NN (unless the person is <i>already</i> notable, and even then it's questionable.) The only possible notability at this point is that he is an "Orthodox Jewish rabbi", making this a Man-Bites-Dog story. The article itself alludes to its NN, by acknowledging that the "impact [of the allegations] remains unclear." Bottom line: Delete now and revisit the issue once the criminal/civil cases are concluded and the societal impact becomes clear. --<a href="../../../n/m/a/User%7ENmagedman_ad26.html" title="User:Nmagedman">Nmagedman</a> 11:41, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I just got round to read back issues of <i>New York</i> magazine today. This already seems to be a big deal in the Orthodox community, judging by the letters page of the last issue, and its only likely to get bigger. About Izak's objections, I can say in response to both points, that (a) distortions and (b) potentially libellous statements are easily eliminated by Our Friend The Neutral-making Phrase, namely (say it with me) "It is alleged". If really terrified, add "unsubstantiated" and "in certain quarters". About Nmagedman's objections, yes, the point is that he is an Orthodox Jewish rabbi, with charge of a yeshiva. That's why it is a news story, and thats why it seems people are discussing it and would wish to read about it. Your objection is the same as all the people who vote to delete the articles about that kid who disappeared in Aruba because the only possible notability comes from her being a pretty blonde. Yes! Tragically, it does. Irritates me too, but nothing to be done. Live with it. The world is imperfect.

It's very one-sided and kind of sneaky, if you ask me. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 18:57, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I couldnt agree more. There are some significant fanbased games put of for deletion the last couple of days and being deleted on principle with hardly any comment. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinoke_5222.html" title="User:Robinoke">Robinoke</a> 16:28, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Your both coming across as pretty daft to be honest. For all your repeated claims of how significant this and other games have been, I've yet to see you ONCE come up with any of the proof that would save the article. <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> says why merely saying 'It's popular' or 'I like it' doesn't cut it. We need news stories, and other associated THIRD-PARTY (translation: Nothing to do with the games creator) sources of information. If you can't get them, then Wiki policy states the article must be deleted. Blaze merely votes to keep something with no actual reason, and has recently been voting to keep solely based on who nominated the article, which is stupid, to be frank. And FYI Blaze, people are saying 'This article should be deleted because it fails to meet WP:X, Y and Z' because that's the point of having policies. They ensure standards are (supposedly) maintained and prevent cases like this where an article seems to be being used solely to attract more traffic to the creators site. Wiki is not an advertising service, and if someone can't be bothered to say WHY an article should be kept, then it wont be. If you think this article doesn't deserve to be deleted then prove us wrong. Find some news stories (and 7 word mentions in another article don't count either), put the information in the article, and cite them.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 09:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I wasnt saying that you have to be a creative genius to be in wikipedia (the bar for entry seems to drop daily anyway... perhaps one day wikipedia will be like an enormous phone directory); I was trying to make the point that just because you are a game designer, doesn't mean you are automatically significant.There are tens of thousands or more of game designers around the world - the vast majority of them are not notable. Pearson seems to have worked as a junior designer in teams for a couple of games. By Davidzuccaro's standards, we would have to have wikipedia articles for all 10 other people on the design team for Metroid Prime too. But why stop there? lets have articles for everyone on the production team too.... <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 13:51, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What on Earth are you talking about!?</dd>
<dd>This article is about Urbanates!, if you had read it you would know what that means!</dd>
<dd>It has NOTHING to do with "University of Florida merchandise" or any Song or Album by anyone!</dd>
<dd>As for it being a "neologism", Well if you had read the Reference links provided, you would see that the first link is to an article Written on the topic in 1955...</dd>

<dd>- Technocracy Digest, Nov. 1955"</dd>
<dd>Now since when is a 51-year-old (at-least) word considered Neo-anything?</dd>
<dd>It is a perfectly legitimate Word and has been in use by the Technocracy Movement probably since it began in the 1930's. The term may not be widely known by most people today, but that does make it illegitimate, over the course of the 20th Century the word has most likely been spoken by Millions of people, just because you have never heard of it or it doesn't appear in many Google searches doesn't make it a neologism according to Wikipedia's rules.</dd>
<dd>If it is not in Dictionaries, then that is the fault of the Dictionaries, as I said it has been used for decades and printed in a vast amount of Publications.</dd>
<dd>I see nothing in the rules here <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, to warrant a deletion of the article, and nothing in the rest of your argument to warrant it either, I will be removing this template immediately unless you can show some sort of legitimate reason not to.</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. As Hibernian says, this is <i>not</i> a neologism. I'm not terribly familiar with the technocratic movement, but even so, I'm aware of the concept of urbanates having been around for a good while now, and from what I understand, they're a pretty important part of the whole philosophy. I think this is one of those situations where Google is <i>not</i> a great tool for gauging notability. At the very least this should not be deleted but merged to <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technocratic_movement.html" title="Technocratic movement">Technocratic movement</a>.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The article needs more context at the beginning to make it more clear. A single sentence on the technocratic movement would be good.

<li>Not that I don't see where you're coming from, but just the same, I think it's worth noting that notability does not equal popularity or commonality (and vice versa). -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 01:21, 27 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But notability does mean, in the case of a word, have people heard of it, and do people use it? I don't see any use of this word outside the technocratic movement, or even any indication people are aware of it and don't see it deserving of a separate article. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 22:21, 27 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, this is an old debate. Take <a href="../../../o/g/l/OGLE-TR-122b_4831.html" title="OGLE-TR-122b">OGLE-TR-122b</a>, for example. I'd be very surrpised if you'd ever heard of it (I certainly hadn't, until I looked it up just now), you most likely don't even know what it is until you click on the link, and chances are that most people you talk to won't have heard of it, either. (In fact, chances are that more people have heard of urbanates than that.) Yet saying that it isn't notable would be extremely foolish. The same applies to various subjects that are notable to experts or practicioners of a given field but to which the vast, vast majority of even well-educated people are completely oblivious -- for example, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brauer%27s_theorem_on_induced_characters.html" title="Brauer's theorem on induced characters">Brauer's theorem on induced characters</a> or <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brane.html" title="Brane">branes</a>. I mean, I personally feel rather strongly that notability <i>is</i> an important criterion for inclusion in Wikipedia and implicit in the "not an indiscriminate collection of information" rule, but I also strongly feel that notability cannot be determined by popularity alone. Just because something is somewhat obscure doesn't mean it's not significant (and, in fact, that's where encyclopedias really are at their most useful, anyway -- when they provide information about topics that are not already common knowledge). Not that this is the most hugely important topic in the world by any stretch of imagination, but it's not exactly random trivia either. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 13:46, 28 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry, I don't see the comparison between a rather unique scientific anomaly and a recondite word that a minor movement has tried, and failed, to spread for fifty years. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:53, 28 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's hardly a question of spreading the word. It's a (pretty old) word that is used to describe an admittedly minor but nonetheless significant concept. Whether or not that concept is widespread is of secondary importance. Furthermore, I must repeat that judging the concept's importance by Google hits is not a great idea. Google is an awesome tool, but it often fails us on matters like this -- if you're looking for sexual acts or current events or something contemporary that is being done in the scientific community or something related to computers or pop culture, things that the internet is full of, it does very well. It is <i>not</i> a great tool for determining the importance of 50-year old concepts that are no longer popular or topical, either because of their enduring nature or by virtues of nostalgia or appeal to retrophiles. In fact, I suggest that if you are not at all familiar with a concept beforehand, you can't properly judge its significance without proper references. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 02:28, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just to be clear. I don't believe this is a 50-year-old concept that is <i>"no longer popular or topical"</i>. It never was popular or topical. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 06:29, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Is that assessment based on actual knowledge, or just belief? -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 07:52, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's based on the fact that I've never heard the word, or read the word, or heard anybody use it. Do you have any reason to believe that in fact it once was popular or topical? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 21:05, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, that's my point -- you haven't heard of it, but that's no different from not having heard about a particular star or a theory. Clearly, then, there are things that cannot be judged notable based on whether you have heard of them -- so in order to figure out whether they're significant, you need to do research. In this instance, the practical difference between urbanates and stars and theories is that the internet is full of information about the latter simply because of their nature -- but when it comes to obscure and even outdated concepts like this, Google just doesn't do very well with them. If people don't talk about it on the net, it doesn't show up. Point is -- and please don't take offense here -- I don't think you really know whether the topic is notable or not, and you don't have a basis for evaluating it. There may well be something published about the topic on paper that could be used as a better gauge of notability, but I don't think either of us has access to any such publication. As for me, <i>I</i> don't know enough of the background to really evaluate how significant it is in the grand scheme of things, either, but what I <i>do</i> know is that I have heard the word before, I have discussed the concept before, and to me it seems worthwhile enough to qualify for inclusion. That hardly makes me an expert on the matter, but it <i>does</i> indicate, to me, that this is not just something utterly insignificant someone made up on the fly. Yeah, it's pretty obscure, sure, and of minor importance, absolutely. But <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. We're not about to run out of space here. This is not a hugely important topic, but it's not a waste of space, either. It doesn't do anyone any harm. It's not original research. It's not vanity. It's not utterly trivial, and the concept's existence is verifiable. It's most certainly not a neologism (as claimed by the nominator). It may even be of use to someone who's researching the technocratic movement. It has some historical significance. This is a far cry from an article about someone's garage band or pet or teacher or random crackpot theory (not that I think the concept of urbanates is particularly realistic, but just the same, this is not gibberish spouted by a lone schizophrenic with a net connection) or whatever. And let me be honest here: I'm not going to pretend that I'm going to cry over this article if it ends up being deleted, because I can't say that I honestly care all that much about urbanates, and it <i>is</i> a minor topic. But as a matter of principle, this just strikes me as a very weak basis for deletion. As I said, I think notability matters a great deal, but I <i>don't</i> think it can be accurately measured just by Googling and whether someone's heard about it in situations like this. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 23:18, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So your argument is that it <i>might</i> have been notable once, and Google wouldn't show it. Sorry, but this strikes me as a very weak basis for retention. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 01:35, 30 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, well, it's not Wikipedia policy to remove articles on subjects that are no longer as notable as they were. Good thing, too; that would make for a pretty crappy encyclopedia. (Also, that's not exactly my argument, but rehashing it is unlikely to do make a difference here.) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 15:25, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think Captain Disdain is correct, it should be included if only for historical reasons (though that is certainly not the only reason to keep it). As I think has been established, it is not a Neologism or a made-up term, thus the original delete reason is not relevant. I do not currently have much evidence to present on how widespread the term ever was (mainly because most Technocracy related material is in paper form and only small pieces of it are online), however what I can say is that the Urbanate concept was an integral part of the Technocracy movement, and that movement certainly was/is Notable. It did once have a membership of something like half a million people in the U.S and Canada in the 30's and 40's, so it is quite probable that all of those members would have been familiar with the concept of Urbanates in at-least some way. The Movement still has several thousand members is North America today (though I don't know the exact numbers), and in recent years it has started to spread World-wide via the Internet (hence how I heard about it). I believe that does qualify it as a notable concept by Wikipedia rules. Now the Article may not be great (I did just write it myself as a short introductory piece to be added to later) and it is by no means complete. I am currently continuing research into the Concept and I hope other people with knowledge of it will also contribute. It will be expanded and explained better with further additions, (one of things I would like to research is the History of the Term, when Exactly it was come up with and by whom, etc.). So I would ask that this deletion template now be removed.--<a href="../../../h/i/b/User%7EHibernian_671b.html" title="User:Hibernian">Hibernian</a> 02:33, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, the deletion template is not going to be removed until the AfD process is complete, Hibernian. That's just the way it goes, and how it should be.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that the article needs to be improved significantly, however the concept of Urbanates is as central to Technocracy as Energy Accounting. Without them a Technocracy could not achieve the performance rates that it claims. Most of the inefficiencies Technocracy purports to be able to fix are contained in the structure and design of cities; hence, Urbanates are designed to replace them. --Kolzene 09:56, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>It's only "marketing" insofar as I think it's a good idea which health trusts across the UK are choosing to adopt freely. The whole point is to provide more support for the most complex patients in their own homes. There's no "government ploy", it's not under copyright idea, and I certainly don't make any money out of it!Geraintlewis 09:59, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
The problem with the idea of merging with Primary Care Trusts is that virtual wards are multisectoral, i.e. they cross over between health (PCT, hospital trust, ambulance trust, GP practice) as well as social care. We know that these complex patients nearly all have both health and social needs. Geraintlewis 16:35, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the facility is rather unique in that while it is used by the local school district for sporting events, presentations and graduations, etc., it is also used as a major regional concert and performance venue, as part of a public / private partnership. In this way, the use of the facility is maximized and revenue generated goes to benefit the school district.

<li><b>Weak delete, and clean up if not deleted</b> First off, this article needs clean up. It has a list of musicians who have played there <i>ONLY</i> to assert notability, not because the information is important. You wouldn't list every artist who's ever played at <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_City_Music_Hall_a17e.html" title="Radio City Music Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a>, would you? In addition, the second paragraph is quite advertisement-y, and needs ot be changed a bit. Now, as per the actual deletion discussion: not to cancel out my fellow New Jerseyan's argument, but I simply don't think this arena is notable enough. I respect the fact that it's a somewhat interesting arena insofar as what it's used for, but I doubt it's the only one of its kind. While, in my reading of WP, I think a precedent has been set up for stadiums, this is only if they're of particular significance- for example, if a European soccer (footie) team plays its home games there, or if it's the largest concert venue in a certain state. 3,500 seats is rather sizable, but it's smaller than every minor league ballpark, and there's no way every (or even the vast majority) of minor league ballparks have their own articles. And the <i>main</i> use of the arena is just that of a school district, but that makes it no more notable than a high school football stadium. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 01:33, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
