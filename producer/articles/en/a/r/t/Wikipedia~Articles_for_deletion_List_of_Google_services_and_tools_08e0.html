<li>Um, there is a big difference between that IBM page, which is simply a list, and this page on Google.

<p>Look, this article is just fancruft plain and simple. It is overly large and the topic of Google on Wikipedia is overly divided and longwinded. Take a look at the <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo%21.html" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo</a> article, and notice that Yahoo is a) twice as large as google b) older than google c) has a lot more services than Google. If there weren't so many zealots around here worshipping Google we wouldn't have this problem. And this is where <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groupthink.html" title="Groupthink">groupthink</a> kicks in; what do you do when everyone in the vote is biased towards worshipping the same thing? How about some objectivity around here. It's obvious the article is just crap and possibly violating Google's rights by putting <b>30</b> of their corporate logos on a single page. --<a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlterego_1aa3.html" title="User:Alterego">Alterego</a> 16:59, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my understanding, I wouldn't consider this "fancruft", even if it were too detailed. But I do not believe that the comparison to Yahoo is relevant—if one feels that Yahoo has more services and is more notable, one is certainly free to expand that article, but I don't interpret such arguments to mean that the information on Google should be <i>reduced</i>. You are right in that most of the information in the article could probably be found by following your link, but then again all the information in Wikipedia should be able to be found elsewhere. Our job is to collect it and present it in an easily-understood format, from an outsider's view. For instance, the page you cite does not actually contain any information on the services; and even when I tried following the links on that page I still did not reach pages that were informative about the nature of the service. Furthermore, I would prefer reading about something on Wikipedia, where for instance Gmail's potential privacy concerns may be covered in a way a company's self-description wouldn't. As for what to do if everyone else is biased except you—you consider that <i>perhaps</i> you are the one who is biased. Perhaps not ("If there's nothing wrong with me, there must be something wrong with the universe"), but I don't think groupthink as I understand it really applies here, at least not until the last few votes. Certainly facing 5 or 6 keeps and no deletes might give someone pause, but it trend would already be clear (unlike in real-time discussions where opinions are shaped concurrently). In any case, it's good to have a difference of opinions to keep ourselves in check. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 22:53, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC) By the way, that quote was not meant to be an insult (and it turned out that there <i>was</i> something wrong with the universe) — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 23:06, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
