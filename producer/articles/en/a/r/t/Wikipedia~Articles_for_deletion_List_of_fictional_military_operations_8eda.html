<li><b>Keep</b> I really I don't concur with the reason for nomination (I don't see any original research in this article), though I do think this article is poorly organized and probably needs to be rewritten.

<li><b>Delete</b> as a list too far. This list doesn't define its parameters: so far it appears to include only recent movies, but the title would imply that it could include other media, such as books and computer games. There must be thousands of films which would qualify, and tens of thousands of books, so the list will either be absurdly selective or impossibly huge. There's also a boundary issue, a lot of fiction using fictionalised derivations of military operations; how heavily fictionalised must an op be for inclusion? --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 03:25, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, it already includes things besides movies. There's several books, computer games and TV series mentioned. However, I do agree with you that this list needs some explicit specifications.

<li><b>Delete</b> -- list lacks the Scouring of the Shire, World War III from Red Storm Rising, the Dominion War, and, I dunno, gazillions of other fictional military operations. Category is far too broad; even a reasonable threshold of notability would probably bloat this page beyond the point of maintainability. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 06:46, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>For one thing, the Dominion war and World War III, is a <i>WAR</i>, not a specific military operation. There is a difference. The Scouring of the Shire is a sepcific event in the Lord of the Rings, not a planned overall assualt with stragetic objectives. The page is quite maintaianable, since there are not too many "<i>Fictional Military Operations</i>", and most can be verfied quickly if it is relavant to the plot or not. --Eldarone 05:05, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - too broad a range of operations without articles to explain them.

</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - no corresponding category possible, as no one would suggest creating articles for these operations. The list currently lacks structure and is only alphabetical. Suggest that the topic is approached at a smaller level, such as overview articles for specific areas (such as military operations in computer game series X), and then create a category for those overview articles. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 15:49, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fictional Military Operations is perfectly relevant to the many science fiction universes, books, RPG's, etc. It's a quick and easy aid for one to find a group from a stroy and look up the right series. And the ,list is maintable, and has been maintianed well. Also, this list is relavent due to the imporantce of the Military Operations to the plot of many stories. Instead of creating many useless pages that just deals with the oneoperation, a single list will be able to maintian any and all plot relevant operations. --Eldarone 23:37, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Incredibly Strong Keep</b> Lists are legitimate and useful parts of encyclopedia. There are lots of lists in Britannica, Compton's and others and so here is what could be the largest encyclopeia in the world, these sorts of things are essential as part of the ongoing quest to catalog human knowledge. --164.107.92.120 23:59, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is not an ongoing quest to catalog human knowledge. It is a general-purpose encyclopedia meant to be accessible to the general reader. This list is useless for the general reader.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I actually like the idea of this list, but it's simply not sufficiently defined in terminology and thus excessively broad.

<li><b>Delete</b>, because I don't think depictions of military operations <i>per se</i> are that substantial in fiction, as opposed to battles or wars.
