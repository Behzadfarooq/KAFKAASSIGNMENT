<li>It doesn't help the closing administrator to just add a "pile-on vote". It helps the closing administrator to provide a proper rationale for why this article should be kept or deleted. You can start by looking at the references added to the article by <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> and discussing whether they are enough to satisfy <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:25, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Still lacks multiple nontrivial coverage in mainstream media.

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not a directory. I live in Alabama and I have actually been to the Patton Creek Shopping Center. There's nothing that sets it apart from the shopping centers in Birmingham, Alabama, much less shopping centers in general. The only reason someone would be looking for information on this place would be to find a restaurant or movie times. It's a brand new place. It hasn't had time to have any significant impact on the community or the State of Alabama to warrant inclusion in an enyclopedia. If it had been the site of riots and protests or an infamous killing spree by disgruntled store clerks--- that would be different. All that happens there is that people buy books, clothes and gifts and then eat out afterwards. Nice place, but I assure you it is not notable. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 21:10, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I see two references in the article. One is from the local chamber-of-commerce about one of its members (and thus not independent) the other is about the mall's "architectural concrete masonry" from the Alabama trade organization that the company that did the masonry work belongs to. So even if the article were to be rewritten about the architectural concrete masonry of this particular mall (and I really cannot see that), it still wouldn't have two independent sources. Moreover, this is just a normal mall with the normal stores functioning in a normal way, so there's nothing particularly notable about it. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 00:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think both sources are independent of the shopping centre. It's not as if they were reprinting a press release. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 07:39, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The sources exist because it is the job of chambers-of-commerce/trade associations to promote their members. They're not reprinting press releases, they're <i>generating them</i>. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 19:12, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. One argument against the claim that all malls are the same is the vigorous competition between real estate developers for the combination of attributes that will bring in tenants and shoppers, which means that mals try hard to differentiate themselves from their competitors, and the fact that malls sometimes go out of business (see <a href="http://www.deadmalls.com" class="external free" title="http://www.deadmalls.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.deadmalls.com</a> for more). So here are some questions that I would ask about any mall. Is it a transit hub, with a bus terminal part of the mall, or is it hostile to transit users? Do the mall's security personnel have a reputation for bullying or racism? Have their been documented incidents of these behaviors? What is crime like in and around the mall? Was there a controversy about building the mall, perhaps because the land was originally zoned for other purposes? Have the mall's owners made substantial contributions to local politicians? Many of these questions can only be answered with access to the local newspaper's archives, which makes it difficult to put together an article from thousands of kilometers away. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 07:39, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> And restaurants try hard to differentiate themselves from their competitors. Heck so do gas stations. While I agree that the above questions about malls are interesting, they hardly make the malls notable. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 07:50, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As I don't believe in rampant deletion of articles and that there should be a good reason for an articles deletion, I agree that the perhaps obscure location might hinder the locating of independant sources (at least on the internet) that might indicate the uniqueness of the mall. It might be an idea to ask users from the Alabama area (such as the original creator of the article, <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucs2004_7ff0.html" title="User:Bucs2004">User:Bucs2004</a>) if they could shed some light on some local sources. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinmeister_cfe3.html" title="User:Justinmeister">Justinmeister</a> 21:37, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>As Requested:</b> I don't believe in the rampant deletion of articles, but I don't believe in having articles that don't meet Wikipedia's criteria, either. I promise, promise, promise you that the local sources in Alabama do not treat Patton Creek Shopping Center any differently from any other mall in the Birmingham area. In fact there are a handful of identical malls that were built in the Birmingham area recently, including Patton Creek, and they're regular, everyday, ordinary malls. It's just not a big deal, escpecially now that it's built. It's a nice place, just like a lot of other nice places. Not notable-- not even to Alabamians. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 19:26, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The "ACIA - ConcreteWorks" link has the look and feel of a press release, especially based on the last paragraph.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a very notable project. The shopping center is part of a major revitalization of the area which includes a number of shopping areas, restaurants and public areas. The center required major reworking of surrounding highways, including the first "flyover" in the area, which was named the <i>Birmingham Business Journal's</i> New Construction Project of the Year. <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/stories/2003/03/10/focus5.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/stories/2003/03/10/focus5.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Patton Creek exists in the shadow of the Galleria, Alabama's <i>top non-paying tourist attraction</i>, bringing in 14 million people a year. The construction also raised issues relating to the government's right to imminent domain when private land was taken to built highway on/off ramps. This article should be rewritten to note its notability, not deleted because it is poorly written. -- <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="#0000FF" size="4">AuburnPilot</font></a><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></a> <small>17:33, 4 November 2006 <sub>(<a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>)</sub></small>

<li><b>Comment</b> As an attorney in Alabama who has actually been to the Patton Creek Shopping Center I can tell you that the events surrounding the construction of this place, including the legal history, were <i>(YAAAWWWWN)</i> uninteresting and ultimately unnotable. The thing that's notable is the <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverchase_Galleria_7326.html" title="Riverchase Galleria">Riverchase Galleria</a>, and Patton Creek is <b>just one of many</b> shopping centers that have been built in the area. The "flyover" is marked as the "Galleria" when you use the exit off of the highway (not "Patton Creek"). It is, as you say, merely <i>in the shadow</i> of the Galleria. It is, as you say, merely <i>part of</i> an economic expansion. Being the next-door neighbor to the Galleria is not an assertion of notability. The <i>Birmingham Business Journal</i> is a minor publication that exists primarily as a propaganda tool for major business interests in the area. There's no hard-hitting neutral journalism to be found there, and besides that your argument would suggest that every year a new article should appear in Wikipedia depending on which new construction is the best thing currently happening in Birmingham, Alabama. Patton Creek belongs in a directory, not an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 19:12, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
