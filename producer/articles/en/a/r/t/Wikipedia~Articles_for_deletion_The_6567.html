Please read our <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy, by the way. You are making the mistake of thinking that this isn't a dictionary article because it isn't short.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. This is nothing more than a dicdef, and would expect to find an entry for "the" in no source other than a dictionary. The expanded etymology that forms the basis for this "article" does not make this encyclopedic. If tacking on an etymology makes something encyclopedic, we may as well merge wikipedia and the wiktionary. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 01:03, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is nothing more than a dictionary definition.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is true that Wikipedia is not a dictionary. However, this is not a dictionary entry, it is an encyclopedia article.

<ul>
<li>Actually, it is exactly a dictionary article, except with the sections in a different order. The first section contains usage notes, with example sentences. The second section contains etymology (and some discussion of the development of definite articles in general that belongs in, and can already be found in, <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definite_article.html" title="Definite article">definite article</a>). And the third section contains pronunciations. All of those are canonical dictionary article content, and standard parts of a full dictionary article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:50, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> "The" is one of the most importants words in the English language. We use the word in the course of our everyday lives. Without the word "the" this sentence would read <i>"is one of most important words in English language. We use word in course of our everyday lives. Without word this sentence would read..."</i> --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandy-Panda_1c75.html" title="User:Candy-Panda">Candy-Panda</a> 13:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The importance of the word 'the' is not under question. The question is whether there should be an article which is effectively a dictionary definition on Wikipedia when the Wiktionary exists for that purpose. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambro_fced.html" title="User:Adambro">Adambro</a> 15:55, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Constantly repeating that Wikipedia isn't a dictionary doesn't actually make this into a dictionary definition. It contains an etymology section and a section about dialects, as well as links. These things would only appear in a dictionary if the dictionary is stretching its entries to include more than just definitions. It's manifestly *not* a dictionary definition. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 19:38, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know if you've looked at a dictionary lately, but they certainly do include etymologies and usage notes. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 20:52, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In which case the dictionary is stretching its entries to include more than just definitions.</li>
<li>A dictionary definition is a definition that appears in a dictionary. A dictionary definition is not "*anything* which appears in a dictionary". If a dictionary includes encyclopediac material about something, that doesn't mean the encyclopediac material is a dictionary definition. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 21:49, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The policy is not "Wikipedia is not dictionary definitions", but "Wikipedia is not a dictionary", which <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DICT" title="WP:NOT">as you can see</a> includes usage guides. If the content doesn't go beyond what's in a dictionary, then it falls under there. What material do you feel is encyclopedic? There's an etymology that's more of a history of defnite articles than of the word "the", which looks like it's encyclopedic by mistake, but that can be merged. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 22:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whilst <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> seems unhappy that other editors keep referring to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy, I would suggest that as <a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> has noted, this is very important as it states the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html#The_differences_between_encyclopaedia_and_dictionary_articles" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">differences between encyclopaedia and dictionary articles</a>. It also states <i>"A full dictionary article... will contain illustrative quotations for each listed meaning; etymologies; translations; inflections; links to related and derived terms; links to synonyms, antonyms, and homophones; a pronunciation guide in various dialects, including links to sound files; and usage notes; and can be very long indeed"</i>. My point being that the question is whether it should be a dictionary definition or an article on Wikipedia according to <i>these</i> criteria. We are referring specifically to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, not what any other dictionaries may or may not contain. We are not simply making the statement that 'Wikipedia is not a dictionary', we are referring to what that policy tells us should be on Wikipedia and what should be on Wiktionary. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambro_fced.html" title="User:Adambro">Adambro</a> 23:01, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason I said it that way is that several people specifically mentioned dictionary definitions, which this isn't. But even ignoring that, it has no similar words with different articles, no inflections, nobody is suggesting foreign language versions, and it certainly isn't a proper noun. While it is an article about a word, even the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy gives an example of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singular_they.html" title="Singular they">singular they</a>. Featured articles include <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia_%28terminology%29.html" title="Macedonia (terminology)">Macedonia (terminology)</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_%28surname%29.html" title="Yuan (surname)">Yuan (surname)</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Read_my_lips%7E_no_new_taxes.html" title="Read my lips: no new taxes">Read my lips: no new taxes</a>. Good articles include <a href="../../../h/o/i/Hoi_polloi.html" title="Hoi polloi">Hoi polloi</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">Truthiness</a>, and <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_tastes_good_like_a_cigarette_should.html" title="Winston tastes good like a cigarette should">Winston tastes good like a cigarette should</a>. By people's reasoning here, we shouldn't have an article for <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_tastes_good_like_a_cigarette_should.html" title="Winston tastes good like a cigarette should">Winston tastes good like a cigarette should</a> unless it actually discusses whether Winston tastes good, and any article about the phrase itself should go to Wiktionary. That's absurd. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 03:05, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Honestly, you'd think some people believe "We're sending it to Wiktionary" is the Wiki equivalent of "We're demoting you to toilet cleaner". Just because it's a definite article doesn't mean it has a definite article in Wikipedia (there's your pun for the day). Most of the content isn't really about the word itself, it's about definite articles, and the saveable info can be merged <a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_%28grammar%29.html" title="Article (grammar)">there</a>. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 20:52, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. If someone can write some content into the article that's more than just what "the" means and where it came from, it would help the case greatly, rather than just arguing "It's not a dictionary article" and "it can be expanded into an encyclopedia article". If it can be done, <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> and do it. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 22:05, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not a dictionary. This contains nothing but dictionary information, albeit good, well-cited dictionary information. I agree with UsaSatsui - if this can indeed be expanded into something encyclopaedic, please do so, because some of us cannot quite imagine how. GassyGuy 01:40, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the status quo. This is a valuable article, and it should not be deleted. Why delete something that is useful and already exists?</li>
