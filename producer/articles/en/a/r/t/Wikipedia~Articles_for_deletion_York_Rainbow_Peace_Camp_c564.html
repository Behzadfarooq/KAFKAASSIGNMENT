<p>I wrote a wikipedia article today on York Rainbow Peace Camp, which I consider to have been the indicator of an astonishingly rapid rise in the amount and depth of anti-capitalist militancy in York, England in the year 2003. Prior to this, York could be considered somewhat politically apathetic, especially in terms of direct action and popular engagement in politics outside of the big 3 political parties.</p>
<p>The article is already being considered for deletion. I hope to defend its inclusion in wikipedia, as follows:</p>
<p>It is unsurprising that York Rainbow Peace Camp is not mentioned in the online media searches which have been conducted, as the "official" name of the camp was "York Rainbow Village Peace Camp" (I omitted the word "Village" in the title by accident), but the name never quite caught on anyway, and it was usually referred to locally as "the peace camp", since there was no other peace camp nearby.</p>
<p>Also, we at the camp scarcely saw it as a priority to woo the corporate-owned mass media. However, York's dominant local paper, "The Evening Press" did give us a surprising amount of coverage, and a search for peace camp in their archive ( <a href="http://www.thisisyork.co.uk/archive/" class="external free" title="http://www.thisisyork.co.uk/archive/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thisisyork.co.uk/archive/</a> ) brought up 9 relevant hits;</p>

<p>There was also a hit about a more recent peace camp in York, when Archbishop John Sentamu held a marathon prayer vigil in a blue tent inside York Minster, at the time of the Israel-Lebanon conflict. This is dated 15th Aug 2006. No evidence has been found that he was directly inspired by the events of 2003, but it could be postulated that a tradition may be emerging in the city.</p>
<p>Also, plugging a search for "peace hotel" into the same archive search engine will bring up more articles from the newspaper, as will searches for the names "Lara Saunders", "Ruby Robinson" and "Sky Sunshine Robinson", 3 activists who died tragically during the period in which the peace camp was active.</p>
<p>If my article is allowed to remain on wikipedia, I hope that I might be permitted to dedicate it to them.</p>
<p>Anyhow, thanks to whoever suggested the deletion, as having to support my article's inclusion has inspired me to find additional sources which can be used to bring the article up to scratch.</p>

<p>i was at the York Peace Camp and the article is accurate. The local newspaper references should support this. i have some photos of the Peace hotel i would like to put on the page, so would like it to remain. i do not think that because this was a real event with real people and not televised or in a previous book it should be deleted. it is more valid than much of the stuff on wicipedia which is pretty irrelevant and petty.</p>
<p>i think the author has overemphasised the role of people with mental health problems, as only a few people at the camp and hotel were such. so i would only recomend a little editiing.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Database and search engine hits while often very helpful are NOT the ultimate test. Also this is an example where entering only a few specific search terms creates a misleading result, try "York Peace Camp" and you will find more sources, a little creativity goes a long way. Furthermore the sources provided of articles written by the York Press are valid sources. Therefore this article meets the WP:V requirements. <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatherhaveaheart_e6da.html" title="User:Ratherhaveaheart">Ratherhaveaheart</a> 19:20, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I did try "York Peace Camp". It's in my original nomination with an assessment of the hits produced (a little creativity didn't go very far in this case). The York Press is a local city newspaper. Factiva doesn't include this but does include the <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Post_68dc.html" title="Yorkshire Post">Yorkshire Post</a> and the <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Evening_Post_23db.html" title="Yorkshire Evening Post">Yorkshire Evening Post</a>, the local <i>regional or county</i> newspapers, as well as the Press Association Regional Newswire for Yorkshire and Humberside. No hits for the search terms from these sources showed up (there are hits for protests and peace camps against US activities at military bases <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_Menwith_Hill_1c56.html" title="RAF Menwith Hill">RAF Menwith Hill</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_Fylingdales_e6d6.html" title="RAF Fylingdales">RAF Fylingdales</a> but none for the subject of the article). I don't think coverage by the local city newspaper is sufficient for encyclopedic notability. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 20:19, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I apologize I did not see the "York Peace Camp" search reference before, I still maintain that the Google search is not the definative test of either verifiability or notability. However your opinion that local city newspapers are insufficient is not supported by Wikipedia policies. Under WP:V the requirements for sources are that they are preferably in English, that they are not of dubious reliability and they are not self-published. Under WP: N, "what constitutes "published works" is <i>intentionally broad</i>, including published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, published reports by consumer watchdog organizations and government agencies." The York Press meets these requirements. <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatherhaveaheart_e6da.html" title="User:Ratherhaveaheart">Ratherhaveaheart</a> 21:15, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My understanding of the articles for deletion process is the look at the arguments rather than the votes, to make sure that the WP:ORG reason for deletion is addressed, the proposed policy states "Organizations are usually notable if the scope of activities are national or international in scale and information can be verified by a third party source. Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable <i>unless</i> verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found." and "Notability can be asserted for organizations through: Inclusion in third party published materials. A significant amount of media coverage that is not trivial in nature and that deals specifically with the organization as the primary subject" Here the York Press articles provide the reliable third party source which is verification and notability. Just in case this debate starts to turn to the ad hoc arguments I have seen in the past I would like to state my independence, this was my first exposure to York Peace camp. I participate in the articles for deletion debates which I think provide illustrative examples of the application of WP policies. Also those that support my philosophy that the purpose of an encyclopedia is to provide references for research, so if the article would be useful for research than I generally vote to Keep.

<p>May I thank icathryn (who was at the peace camp doing daily news flyers (only hardcopy, I think), and Ratherhaveaheart for their support and for recognising that this is important to me, and to hundreds of people I don't even know how to contact any more. I would also put to Bwithh that it is not only the bigshot national media who can validly document an event.

<dd>This is an incorrect statement. A single newspaper article may present a number of different viewpoints. Furthermore Wp: NPOV is not about having one viewpoint it is about having the correct unbiased neutral viewpoint, as long as the source provides that than it is not in violation of the policy. <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatherhaveaheart_e6da.html" title="User:Ratherhaveaheart">Ratherhaveaheart</a> 19:05, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
