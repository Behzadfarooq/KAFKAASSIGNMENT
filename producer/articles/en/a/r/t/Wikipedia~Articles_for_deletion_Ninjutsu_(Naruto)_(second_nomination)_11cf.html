It's just once long list of every single <a href="../../../j/u/t/Jutsu_%28Naruto%29_2a40.html#Ninjutsu" title="Jutsu (Naruto)">ninjutsu</a> move thatâ€™s appeared in <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naruto.html" title="Naruto">Naruto</a>, which makes no sense in a wider context, and even within Naruto many of the moves aren't really notable, having only appeared once or twice in the source with little impact or no impact on the plot.

<li><b>Delete</b> Naruto is a popular franchise, but to go to this much detail is to provide too much information. The series is notable, but that does not make every microscopic detail of anything mentioned in it notable enough to have a Wikipedia article. Not unless for each of these Jutsu's the article's creators can furnish multiple independent sources where it is the subject. The fact that it is seen in an episode or gets a passing reference in a game guide does not show it is notable. By that token, after almost 120 years of dedicated fancruft, Sherlock Holmes' nemesis Prof. Moriarty deserves an article, but Holmes' pipe and his syringe do not. Startrek has had a huge fan base for 40 years, but we do not need an article telling what kind of imaginary batteries to put in the phasor or other details in the fictional tech manual.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 22:53, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I have to agree with <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a>, this just seems like Naruto-cruft.

It's possible that it could be greatly minimized and merged with <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naruto_%28anime%29.html" title="Naruto (anime)">Naruto (anime)</a>, but its current condition is not in accordance with the encyclopedia guidelines. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 23:17, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Someguy0830. Holmes' pipe would more accurately be compared to an article on a character's clothing or accessory (which are not that significant), whereas his detective methods or <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baritsu.html" title="Baritsu">Baritsu</a> might be considered article-worthy, similarly to the pages in question. --<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPentasyllabic_4b26.html" title="User:Pentasyllabic">Pentasyllabic</a> 01:18, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b>&#160;: Lots Of work went into this, and its not fake.There are loads of images because there have been over a year of filler episodes after the first season.thats almost 130ish episodes just for fillers. While its true that fillers have no major impact on the plot of the second season, they added depth to the "naruto" world. Besides the Second season is starting on the 15th of Feb.i woudl delete this page if the anime was over, but since theres a second season, i think its pointless to delete it. a bit of re orgaisation would be nice <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Endriago (<a href="../../../e/n/d/User_talk%7EEndriago_2d33.html" title="User talk:Endriago">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Endriago_0975.html" title="Special:Contributions/Endriago">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>I'm not sure I understand your justification of the use of so many images. Doesn't the fair use template that was put on each image say a <b>limited number</b> of ... images. There's really no need to use that many, and it's beyond fair use. In addition, something doesn't stop being notable after it has ended. This list will either stay or be removed <i>regardless</i> of the current state of the Naruto television show. It's excessive detail, and its "usefulness" to a particular segment of Naruto fandom is not a critieria for keeping it in the encyclopedia. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 15:37, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - I'm not singling out attacks from the anime "filler" episodes, I'm saying a large number of attacks / jutsu in general aren't notable, including those in the comic / manga. As for the "lots of work" argument, I belive that doesn't really count here (I'm not an expert), but as I've said above, if there's another place that'll take the list (is there a Naruto wiki?) then there's nothing to stop it being moved. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredOrAlive_8809.html" title="User:FredOrAlive">FredOrAlive</a> 15:53, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

The closest thing to a relevant guideline, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html#Fiction_in_Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Notability (fiction)</a> states <i>Minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a "List of characters." This list should reside in the article relating to the work itself, unless either becomes long, in which case a separate article for the list is good practice.</i> This article is well written given the subject matter, meets the core policies, and seems to be dead on with the relevant section of Notability (fiction). Ultimately, I say keep. With respect, other than the argument that it's primary sourced, which is not grounds for deletion, the main deletion argument looks a lot like some flavor of IDONTLIKEIT to me. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 21:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Squil, you are right that it doesn't meet the "out of universe" style guideline - I only meant that it was, IMHO, well written in a more colloquial sense. I do encourage the Naruto editors to start a project to bring their pages more in line with the style guides, but of course, that's not grounds for deletion. The relevant section of Notability (fiction), IMHO, is the section I put in italics above. IMHO, this is "Minor concepts . . . merged with short descriptions" and placed in a separate article because the wouldn't fit in the main article. According to the Notability (fiction) notes, the guideline was based in large parts over debates about Lord of the Rings -- compare <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Middle-earth_weapons_b5c4.html" title="List of Middle-earth weapons">List of Middle-earth weapons</a> for a similar level of fictioncruft and/or encyclopedic detail.

<li><b>Keep</b> per everyone else. A merge wouldn't work, the article it got merged with would be too long, so it is all or nothing. Naruto was previsly #13 (or something) on the most recently visted articles list meaning that many IP's and registered members look at Naruto and Naruto related articles. This action would piss off the IP's and cause trouble for those who edit these pages constantly (myself included) and there you would be sitting pretty with not a care in the world while we sit here answering IP after IP on why we have no ninjutsu article then we would complain to you and you would be tired then everyone would get uncivil and an edit war would start and the article would come back.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is not francruft, and despite its length, is an important part of the Naruto universe.

Especially with the more complex ones, see <a href="../../../k/e/k/Kekkei_genkai.html" title="Kekkei genkai">Kekkei genkai</a>, it is highly difficult for a reader of any of these articles to make any sort of sense of them when any of the above are mentioned.
