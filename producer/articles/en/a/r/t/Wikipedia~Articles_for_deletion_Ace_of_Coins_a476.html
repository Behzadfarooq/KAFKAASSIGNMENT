There's nothing wrong with stubs, so long as they're sourced, and they can absolutely be added to. Besides, most people are going to be looking for the "mystical" interpretation of these cards when they look them up. If there are other uses for these cards as you claim, then <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">add them to the article</a>, but just because you're a skeptic doesn't mean you need to declare war against the tarot.

<li><b>Keep all</b> With literally centuries worth of books written about the tarot, and more arriving all the time, it seems to me that an article should be possible for every card and its various meanings and symbolism. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 16:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b> as per above. It may be arcana, but it's notable arcana, and as noted above, there's nothing wrong with stubs or short articles as long as the info is correct and notable.

<li>Whadaya mean, as <i>PMC</i> suggested? I tell ya I get no respect, no respect at all. As far as the articles by suit being too long, none of the articles look to be more than a paragraph or two, some of which is duplicative, so merging shouldn't result in anything overly long. If one or more individual cards gets to be lengthy it can then be split out into its own article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge by suit</b> - The arcanas may be notable, but the cards themselves are not particularly notable independently of their meaning within the overall system. I agree with the nom. that even if likely interpretations were added (and thoroughly sourced) these individual entries would not amount to more than a mass of perpetual stubs. Concerns about the resulting articles being too long can be alleviated by concise editing, and maybe the use of a table. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 19:50, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b>. Just because a minor arcana tarot card is nothing but one of many pip cards in a game of tarot, it does not imply a lack of content related to the non-gaming side of the card. There is much content that can be added based upon the usage of a card for divination. There is still more that can be added about the symbolism and background of the card.--<a href="../../../p/t/d/User%7EPtdecker_b311.html" title="User:Ptdecker">P Todd</a> 02:13, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think Otto's MERGE proposal seems most reasonable. Also, to UsaSatsui This AfD is intended to promote discussion. Despite what Bill O'Reilly may have told you, there is no "war on tarot" being conducted here. I think tarot is a fine card game played in France! Seriously, I think Ptdecker is doing good faith work with the POV concerns. However,whatever POV issues I and a few others may have raised about games and divination are not related to this proposal. My purpose is to see what the community here thinks we should do with all these stubs before any sort of work is to be done on them. <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmiloid_26c5.html" title="User:Smiloid">Smiloid</a> 03:02, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm afraid if we MERGE, we will end up breaking them all out again sometime in the future. If they were merged even by suit, if each card was fully fleshed out as they should be the article would be huge. I don't think there is a "war on tarot" (nice pun, Smiloid). But, I do think by pure numbers there are many more users of tarot for esoteric purposes then users of the cards for game play. Seems like a 50%/50% balanced bias towards game play is actually a bias away from the majority of physical people (just my opinion).--<a href="../../../p/t/d/User%7EPtdecker_b311.html" title="User:Ptdecker">P Todd</a> 19:15, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>That would be fine to break them out again when that time comes. As of right now these cards are not in any way fleshed out. I think the authors of all these individual card articles have placed the cart before the horse (excuse cliché ). There is one article on one of the suits. The other 3 suits have been neglected. Articles on the parent class should have been created prior to all these articles on individual members. Also if you look closely, Knight of Swords has an exact clone. At the very least one of those two should be merged/deleted. Again this is not for the games/esoteric debate. I am simply raising a question as to how all these cards should be treated.<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmiloid_26c5.html" title="User:Smiloid">Smiloid</a> 06:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep All</b> There are multiple schools of thought and research regarding Tarot cards. They can be viewed as historical cultural symbols, they are used by some philosophical systems as spiritual or meditative icons, they are used by many in various ways as so-called "divination tools" (in both formal and informal contexts), and they are used by some for playing of games. Another consideration is that there are many systems of Tarot and the cards do not have the same meanings in each system. If we merge the articles into one larger article, then it would be likely that the merged article will contain images and discussions of many cards and would quickly become be overly long. So, although many of the individual articles are currently stubs, if we leave them be, Tarot enthusiasts and experts of all persepctives will populate the pages with interesting info. Why do we need to be in a hurry about that? <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParzival418_18da.html" title="User:Parzival418">Parzival418</a> 04:33, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>WikiCommons needs more "minor arcana" images. I could make a comment that the Waite 3 of Swords is a clone of the Sola Busca 3 of swords or the ribbon on the 2 of coins Waite deck was inspired by the ribbon that carries the card makers name and date eg "Conver 1760" but I think the lack of appropriate images is one factor hampering the development of these articles.<a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmiloid_26c5.html" title="User:Smiloid">Smiloid</a> 06:28, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep All, don't merge</b> Each of these cards represents meaning in Tarot spreads. In fact, each card represents two meanings: one if the card is right-way up, and another of the card is reversed. These plus descriptions of the artistic symbolism from popular Tarot decks more than constitutes enough content for an article, and leaving these up as individual articles encourages that that work be done.</li>
