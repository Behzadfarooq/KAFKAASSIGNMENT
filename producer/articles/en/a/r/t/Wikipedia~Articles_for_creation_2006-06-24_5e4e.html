<p>I speculate the Wikipedia "Computer Bought The Farm" as a GNU error message is derived from generic concept "bought the farm", a euphemism used to refer to someone dieing in a military plane crash, e.g. in WWI or WWII.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that "bought it" as a flying euphemism may predate this, I believe the early Biggles books mention it (aloing with "gone west").

<p>Patrick "Pat" Korte is an American political activist and co-founder of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) that reformed in January 2006. While in high school, Korte became actively involved with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and was active in the anti-war movement. Korte became an organizer for World Can't Wait: Drive Out The Bush Regime in late 2005, but soon became dissatisfied and frustrated with the group's lack of militancy, authoritarian nature, and strong ties with the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), USA. Korte realized the need for an organization that placed an emphasis on student power, participatory democracy, and had the capability to organize around a wide range of issues.</p>

<p>The Cardiothoracic Ratio = The Transverse Cardiac Diameter/The Transverse Chest Diameter as a percentage.</p>
<p>The Transverse Cardiac Diameter is the horizontal distance between the most rightward and leftward borders of the heart seen on a postero-anterior (PA) chest radiograph. The Transverse Chest Diameter is measured from the inside rib margin at the widest point above the costophrenic angles on a PA chest film.</p>
<p>A cardiothoracic ratio is considered abnormal if it is more than 50% is in an adult and more than 66% in a neonate.</p>
<p>The cardiac diameter itself can also be measured and (in normal individuals) is less than 15.5 cm in males, and less than 14.5 cm in females. A change in diameter of greater than 1.5 cm between two X-rays is significant.</p>
<p>Possible causes of a ratio greater than 50% include:</p>
<ul>
<li>cardiac failure</li>
<li>pericardial effusion</li>
<li>left or right ventricular hypertrophy</li>
</ul>

<p>The film North Woods began as a fractured fairy tale dealing with child abduction and a horrific quest to get the child back home to safety. As the filmmakers realized that this would not be an easy, or even affordable task, they toned the story down to it's basics using the same characters. The new story went through months of re-writes until it was finally in a presentable draft. After 2 days of filming, the camera broke, causing the film to be delayed for more than a month. After getting the camera fixed, the film was completed and the test screenings were some of the worst that they had ever seen. During the next 2 years, the film went under grueling re-writes, re-shoots, and test screenings until the film was finally complete.</p>

<p>Ha Long literally means descending dragon(s) and according to local myth, the story goes as follows: Long ago when their forefathers were fighting foreign invaders from the north, the gods from heaven sent a family of dragons to help defend their land. This family of dragons descended upon what is now Ha Long bay and began spitting out jewels and jade. Upon hitting the sea, these jewels turned into the various islands and islets dotting the seascape and formed a formidable fortress against the invaders. The locals were able to keep their land safe and formed what is now the country of Vietnam. The Dragon family fell so much in love with this area for its calm water and for the reverence of the people of Vietnam that they decided to remain on earth. Mother dragon lies on what is now Ha Long and where her children lie is Bai Tu Long. The dragon tails formed the area of Bach Long Vi known for the miles of white sandy beaches of Tra Co peninsula.</p>
<p>This myth is in line with the Vietnamese myth of their origin Con Rong Chau Tien. This myth describes the union between a king (representing the dragon) and his bride (representing a goddess) giving birth to 100 children which are the ancestors of the Vietnamese people. The Ha Long myth illustrate the Vietnamese belief of their origin and the fact that throughout their history, they are aided by their ancestors, the dragon and the gods, in the defense of their land.</p>

<p>MARIYAH MOTEN- MISS TOURISM QUEEN INTERNATIONAL PAKISTAN 2006</p>
<p><br />
The total finalists summed up to 85 nationals and the local contestants who traveled all over China (Beijing, shanghai, Chongqing, Hang Zhou, and other cities), to compete for China’s largest international pageant: Miss Tourism Queen International 2006. The delegates arrived in Shanghai, and from there they were taken to the beautiful city of Chongqing, which was an hour by plane. Chongqing is the largest and most populous of the People's Republic of China's four provincial-level municipalities. The municipality of Chongqing has a population of 32,355,000, most of them living outside of the urban area of Chongqing proper, over hundreds of miles of farmland.</p>

She had heard stories from Naomi Zaman who had competed in the same pageant last year and won two titles as well. This time it was our Texas girl Mariyah Moten, who wanted to keep up to the expectations of the Miss Pakistan World’s organizers and wanted to represent her country as well as possible. Here began Mariyah’s journey from Houston, USA to Toronto, Canada and finally to Shanghai, China.</p>
<p>The government hotel is where the delegates stayed in Chongqing, which was on heavy patrol for about a week. The whole purpose was to make these bright young ladies understand Chongqing's civic culture and the natural scenery.</p>
<p>On 18th morning 9 o'clock, the various countries' beautiful women arrived at The Fontanel Square, where they were greeted by many Chongqing elementary students holding the fresh flowers and eagerly waiting to greet their big elder sisters. Big elder sister was the term used by the Chinese local in describing these beauty queens in China.</p>
<p>Chongqing deputy mayor arrived at the conference site and delivered a speech, and wished each elder sister complete success, and hoped that they would tak e with them Chongqing’s beautiful scenery and the warm spicy culture.</p>
<p>In order for the contestants to melt into Chongqing’s culture, the organization committee had especially arranged "the Chongqing type" welcome feast – which consisited of the spicy food for all delegates. In the end the contestants were overwhelmed and Mariyah described her experience as one to fit a queen.</p>
<p>Mariyah Moten, the 23 year old Karachi born, delegate travelled all the way to Toronto, Canada to compete in Miss Pakistan World 2006, and came in teh top five as Runner up 3. From there she travelled to Shanghai, China to compete in Miss Tourism Queen International 2006. Mariyah has brought Pakistan's name on the map in terms of representing Pakistan in International pageants.</p>

<p>The <b>Octatron SkySeer™</b> is an autonomous, computer controlled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed for easy transport and launch. It is designed and manufactured by Octatron, Incorporated of St. Petersberg, Florida, USA.</p>
<p>Intended for short-range operations, the electric-powered SkySeer resembles a normal radio controlled model airplane or two-meter glider. Once unfolded from its storage tube and its electronics initialized, the SkySeer is then hand-launched by its operator. All of the drone's basic flight functions are handled by GPS including landings. Range is approximately two miles/3.2km and is extendable via Octatron's NetWeaver™ interface.</p>
<p>The basic platform is very low cost; a fully loaded SkySeer retails for approximately US$25,000 to $30,000 which includes all electronics, video surveillance equipment, ground station and computer interfaces. Video interface is in real time and allows the operator to literally see what the drone sees and to record it as such. The ground station's recorder can store up to twenty hours of high-quality MPEG-2 format video which can then be transfered to DVD or Flash.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is currently experimenting with the SkySeer as a means of crime prevention. At present, the experiment has been suspended by the Federal Aviation Administration because of that agency's claim of a lack of the proper permits. Although the FAA does not regulate model aircraft, it does have jurisdiction over unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>
<p>Negotiations between the two agencies are underway.</p>

<p>ACORD is a non profit organisation that aims to introduce standardisation in the insurance industry across the world. This is perhaps the first time that such an attempt is being made in any industry.</p>
<p>ACORD's concerns are P &amp; C insurance, life &amp; annuities, reinsurance, insurance broking and any other intermediary involved in the business of insurance (of any kind).</p>
<p>ACORD addresses the following major areas in the insurance value chain:</p>
<p>1. Standards in electronic data transmission and communication. ACORD has developed XML codes for different insurance purposes. These codes are available for free download (www.acord.org) and integration into software packages by anyone who wishes to. 2. Standards in paper forms and documents in use in insurance industry. Of late, this has transformed into standards in EDI (Electronic Data Interchange).</p>
<p>ACORD operates out of offices in New York and London.</p>

<p>MittenZ (12 November, 1923-16 June 1989) Commonly referred to as Mitz, and by his friends Tom, was a Professor at the Institute of Goralimp, he was also the author of several theories such as ‘The Goat To Man: A New Stage in the Evolutionary Process’, ‘Goats in Evolution’ and ‘How Goats came To Be’ and his scientific breakthroughs with his colleague Drimp.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-24_5e4e.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>
<p>MittenZ was born in Goatlington, Australia 12 of November 1923 to Marry Clovor Donalee (43) and Richard M. Nixonton (50). MittenZ was the youngest in a family of 12. At the age of 4, MittenZ began noticing goats for the first time. He became attracted to goats, and felt that he himself was a goat as he states in his critically acclaimed memoirs, “At such a fragile age I seem to have inadvertently allowed myself to be “over come” by these magnificent creatures. In a sense, I was a goat.”</p>
<p>At age 6, MittenZ’ father Richard M. Nixonton died over a long battle with cancer. The death of his father affected MittenZ in a lot of ways; he soon realizes this and admits that his father’s death was the biggest and most frightening blow to MittenZ as a young child, as he later states in the letters to his Sister Marrile Donalee. After the death of his Father in 1929, MittenZ and his family would move to what is now known as Borsash, in Southern Australia. There MittenZ had undergone intense psychological experimentations that he deemed “Silly and foolish”. He had a league of private tutors whom his mother had referred to as “The Mistresses” MittenZ soon speaks ill of these women in his memoirs and states, “The three women in my life whom have made the life in which I have lived so disastrous and jarred that I would sooner slice off my hand then to have those three demoniacs in my company once again.” MittenZ was enrolled to the Borsash school of Talented Souls in 1933 at the age of 10. His experience there varied, and MittenZ does not speak much of this in his memoirs. But he does state that his first love, which we have identified as Violet Le Jude (12), was “Overcome by the darkness.” We to this day do not understand the exact meaning of this statement. In 1936 MittenZ apparently leaves the Borsash school of Talented Souls for the Borsash Academy. Here his studies on Goats and the evolutionary process of Goats intensifies, MittenZ later states in his memoirs that at the Borsash Academy he received the greatest and most profound knowledge a man could ever receive.</p>
<p>MittenZ later attends the Cambole Institute of Experimental Devices, which was pleasantly situated 15 minutes from his home. It is said that MittenZ regularly rode his bike to attend this institute and was seen frequently handling goats near the Cambole Institute on Patch Adam’s Farm for Domesticated Animals. It is said during this time period that MittenZ was experimenting on goats, and using the devices he had acquired by the Institute to test on the goats. This may seem cruel, but never were the goats harmed. His experience there has a heavy impact on MittenZ studies and he later states that the Institute was filled with people whom he had disliked throughout his childhood. He leaves the Institute in 1945 and receives a Scholarship for Churnbowls College located in Ballfist, Australia. During his time at the Churnbowls College he meets somebody who will stick to him until his tragic death in 1989, Drimp Colodoll. He speaks frequently about him in his memoirs and states, “Drimp Colodoll was probably my dearest friend whom I have had the inexplicit joy of having in my acquaintance, though his opinions vary from mine; he is still the friend one could only wish for in certain situations.”</p>
<p>After the death of his eldest brother John Scoot Fitch Jerald, MittenZ abandons his position at the Churnbowls College in 1949 and returns to home. For several months MittenZ would spend his time aiding his sicklied mother, who was at the time 66. MittenZ’ mother never recovers, and dies in 1950. MittenZ states in his Journal:</p>
<p>”August 20, 1950.</p>
<p>My mother is gone. My mother.. Is gone..”</p>
<p>This is the only time MittenZ will speak of his mother’s death.</p>
<p>After his Mother’s death, MittenZ would enroll in the Cloverfaced College 230 miles from his childhood home of Goatlington until the following June where he leaves the college to enlist in the Australian army. MittenZ was commissioned as an officer 1st battalion, Clombderdon Heavy Infantry. MittenZ arrived at the front line in a town called Solay Forstroodlement. He was later injured at the Battle of Barkingdogs and returned to his studies after the war had ended.</p>
<p>In 1952, MittenZ applied for Corfangledon College in Collerfest, Australia. He was accepted, and will later state that his place at the Corfangledon College would be the sole place that would encourage him to write ‘The Goats of the World’ and ‘The Goat To Man: A New Stage in the Evolutionary Process’. MittenZ received heavy criticism for his evolutionary theories on Goats, but he continued to astound scientists and people a like. His third book “The Goat to be” was ranked the third best seller of 1955. He will later receive the award “the Goatlin award for literary and scientific expertise” in 1964.</p>
<p>In 1957 MittenZ would meet a late Lorry Vanstroodlehyme at the National Convention for Evolutionary Progress, they became fast friends and in 1959 they would marry. There’s much speculation on how and why Lorry Vanstroodlehyme married MittenZ, some theorize that she was simply after MittenZ newly acquired wealth. But MittenZ merely states, “Lorry and I were in love, and at such a feeble age one must assume that marriage was simply cliché—if we didn’t tie it then when would the next chance present itself? I married Lorry with this ideal. And I have no regrets.”</p>
<p>MittenZ retired from his position at the Corfangledon College to continue his work on Goats, Lorry and MittenZ both agreed to buying an estate up on the Cloudinthesky Mountains, Northern Australia in 1961—this house would usher in a new train of thought for MittenZ. Just one month after they settle into the estate, MittenZ starts work on his acclaimed Goat trilogy ‘The Goat with No Name’, ‘The Goat in the Train’ and the completely unrelated ‘The Twisted, winded epicycles of a perfectly trained Goat horde’. All three will inherently increase MittenZ’ popularity among people. By 1962, about 74% of the Earth’s population owned one of MittenZ’ books. He will later state, “This popularity baffles even me. I’m simply an Australian born goat-lover with a theory, but you people flatter me. And I thank you.”</p>
<p>In 1964 Lorry Vanstroodlehyme dies, leaving MittenZ with a tainted memory of the best years of his life. MittenZ will later state that during his marriage he had actively cheated on Lorry with a 27-year-old evolutionist from the United States Institute for Goatly Talks named Debra Wisinhower. Some say the unnecessary strain on the relationship is what might have caused Lorry to die so suddenly. MittenZ never spoke to a single Woman again until his death in 1989.</p>
<p>In 1965 MittenZ picks up the pen once again and starts work on a completely renovated style, the book he would publish would set him up with legends like Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley, and Steve Erwin. ‘The Evolutionary Process in the Eyes of a Goat’ would make MittenZ a national and world success. He would later state in his Memoirs that this book opened his mind up to new experiences. This book encouraged MittenZ to make the Documentary film, ‘The Goat Sky’ which would play a scrutinizing 20 months in the Movie theatres. In 1967 MittenZ was awarded with the highest honors in Australia, and was elected Prime Minister—Australia’s economy was never the same. Shortly thereafter, MittenZ would make Australia a World Power and a center for World Peace among countries differing in opinion. He would connect the Middle East through peaceful democracy and would end all world conflicts like China Vs. U.S. and Palestine Vs. Israel. Both settled to agree on terms MittenZ would conjure up personally.</p>
<p>In 1977 MittenZ lost the election to Charles Francais Goraninty, Mitz admitted that he himself had failed Australia in 1975 when a typhoon hit Western Australia, which was built to withstand any typhoon so promised by MittenZ, and he had openly regretted ever setting up the Typhoon Alert System—which was responsible for thousands of deaths. Shortly after the Typhoon war broke out between India and Brazil which would result in a massive power struggle between the two ‘already’ World Powers. Australia vowed to keep out of the war, but after outstanding criticism from both the U.N. and the U.S. Australia had to interfere and so it did. 49,032 Australians were lost in a nuclear attack as Australian forces were being deployed in the Eastern borders of Brazil. This caused an outrage among the Australian people and MittenZ was deemed the worst Prime Minister (In a time of war) to ever come into power. MittenZ retired respectively and wished Charles Francais Goraninty the best of luck, unfortunately that luck did not occur. And Australia has been on a downward spiral ever since.</p>
<p>In 1979, with the Police Enforcement Act of Legitimate Time-Inspecting Presuppositions MittenZ fled from Australia and its dictator Charles Francais Goraninty, he fled to the People’s Republic of China—but did not stay very long. He then fled to Russia where both the people would greet him and it’s active government, unfortunately for MittenZ he was attacked by some twenty Christian Radicalists who have an outspoken disagreement with anything that has to do with Evolution. He was hospitalized for four weeks until he was lead out of the country by plane. The Russian Government vowed to never see that happen again, but MittenZ never returned to Russia. Instead he fled to the United States of America. Where he would write ‘The Screeds of Man: A study on dull Politicians and their idealisms’ which would, again, boost MittenZ credibility. But unfortunately for MittenZ the long-standing Nuclear strike by Brazil (Which was later renamed the South American Union under the impending Globalist agenda that was being pushed by Edwardo Devasquiz) was still a deep-wound in many people. And he did not receive much support.</p>
<p>In 1982 he would return to Australia once again, with the fall of Charles Francais Goraninty and his fascist regime Australia was once again a free Democracy, partially Liberal for the people could not muster enough courage to trust the Conservative party that was currently set there. During the time MittenZ spent in hiding, his brother Richard Nixonton and his sister Abbigal Loanhart Graffole and her husband were both killed in many of the outcries against the Fascist government that was set. This affected MittenZ in a very peculiar way, and he would retire to his childhood home in Goatlington until 1988 where he suffered from a stroke and was rushed to the hospital, only to be diagnosed with Ass cancer. After a year fighting, MittenZ’ ass simply gave up. And he died at the age of 69.</p>

<p>MittenZ spent his best years as a professor for several colleges; he was a grand spectacle indeed. He taught at Corfangledon College for 9 years (1952 to 1961) and was later a Professor of Modern day Evolution and Common Biology at the College of Comminghand for two years until he retired from teaching and concentrated his efforts on his writing and theorizing. MittenZ up to his death craved the comfortable life of a College professor, but he simply did not have enough energy in order to be compatible in such a profession. So he sent the notion out with the cat. And he never did dwell on the subject again, until 1987 in a letter to his brother Marcus O’Reilly Nixonton. MittenZ was much affected by the works of Don Scottferd Macarthur and his works on the Human psyche as well as his Political ideology, he was also very much influenced by Dougless Ramathor whom he had secretly read in his Summer estate in Belfadge, Australia every Summer.</p>

<p>MittenZ was always affected by Literature and the study of Human and Animal biology, ever since he was a child he dreamt of someday becoming a famous author, never in his mind did he ever have the notion of becoming a World leader. But it comes with the territory, and with age comes wisdom. During MittenZ complicated life he wrote several books, most theorizing about the evolution of common goats—as well as the goat-to-man theory, which had never been heard of until MittenZ came along. MittenZ is probably best known for his works on Goat evolution and his long-standing battles with Creationists.</p>

<p>was a book professing the Evolution between Man and Goat; MittenZ believed that there was no Ape in the Evolutionary chain—merely a goat. He believed, and studied, the many similarities between goat and man. Even comparing fossils with that of a Human skeleton. Which is the essential basis of this book. In this book, we find that MittenZ believes strongly in Evolution and Natural Selection, but he does not believe there was an ape or a “Common Ancestor” in the equation. He believed the Goat was our previous state, and he believed the goat is a perfect being. As he states in the book, “The goat is not a worthless character, nay—it is a free and wild beast. If you tease it with carrots it will charge, if you pat it and love it you will gain a friend. This is essentially the same as a Human, only we do not desire carrots as much. Human interaction is a chemical phenomenon; human hatred is a chemical phenomenon. Any act or emotion that seems like a self-evident truth (but deemed inappropriate by the Mass Public) is merely part of the Humans nature; we simply inherited these “genes” from the goat. And thus we are similar to the Goat.”</p>

<p>the book is simply that, it explains where and how the goat comes into the Evolutionary chain and why. It explains the goat’s purpose and the goat’s features, and it also explains (in low-detail) about the common interaction a goat has with a human. It is a book theorizing the goat’s abilities, as well as the goat’s faults. In his memoirs, MittenZ states, “The book ‘Goats in Evolution’ merely explains the goat’s role in Evolution, you may not know it—but the goat plays a vital part in Natural Selection; as well as Evolution in general. It explains the traits of the goats, the character and the general attitude that is currently accepted amongst them.”</p>

<p>is a study on how Goats modernized, and how Natural Selection chooses the finest goats. It explains the traits that are developed between goats, and how and why the weakest of the goats dies off. It goes into detail about differentiations amongst different sets of goats. It’s a book about Natural Selection, and its affect on Goats. MittenZ did not speak much about this book in his Memoirs; he simply stated that when he was making it a woman named Maggy Pinchiner constantly nagged him on the style in which he has inherited.</p>

MittenZ spent a lengthy time writing about ‘The Study of Goats in Person’ he went into character, and the endeavors him and Drimp went through during their two-year place in the wilderness studying these goats.</p>

<p>The Goat Trilogy is a children’s book series on Goats and the adventures they face, and how they overcome them. It is a children’s book series, so it shouldn’t be taken seriously. They are simply moral stories.</p>

<p>is the first book in the acclaimed Goat Trilogy, which starts off with a goat with no name wondering the hill-side in search of better feed without any friends. It details his adventures and how he reacts in certain situations, it is a moral story for children 7-under. And is a beautiful book filled with love and adventure. MittenZ speaks little of the Goat Trilogy, but he did say this, “In order for us humans to set a common decency and an understanding of morals we must for put ourselves in the position of certain characters and react in best suitable ways. The biggest attack the psuedo-religious nut-jobs have against Evolution is that we set no Moral Stronghold, and we are simply sitting on Morass. Well this is just an attack on those who attack us with such puerile misunderstandings and generalizations.”</p>

<p>Is the sequel to the first book ‘The Goat with No Name’ it, again, details the adventures of certain goats who are in search of better feed and shelter from predators.

<p>MittenZ will forever be imprinted on the concrete slabs of History. His insightful ideals and his general understanding of human-goat biology will forever leave its mark on the wall of History. MittenZ asked if he could be remembered solely for the achievements in which he takes great pride in; as he told his sister in one of the last known letters that MittenZ wrote during the years of his illness. He states, “Dear sister, there is not much time left—and I do feel a jabbing pain in my ass at this very moment. But I’d like to thank you, and all of you, who made my life a pleasure. I only wish to be remembered for my writings on goats, the studies I have made and the articles I have written. The debates I’ve gone through, all-worthless to me in the long run. I’d simply like them to understand the goats; I’d like them all to understand what it is to be a goat. This is all I ask in return.”</p>

<p>Dave's Dream Is the name of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress that dropped the first atomic bomb after the end of WWII.That day was Monday, July 1, 1946 The bomb was identical in design to the one used over Nagasaki, Japan a &lt;23 Kiloton device "estimated". The bomb was not delivered exactly on target as it missed by roughly 980 short and 1870 feet left of the target fleet thus rendering much of the sensitive test equipment utilized on that test useless. Never the less some ships were sunk but this from the observers standpoint made "The Bomb" seemed much less effective as most Americans thought it was. Many Americans thought that no One would waste an atomic weapon on something as futile as a naval fleet therefore causing the navy to justify its use of the target fleet used at Bikini Atoll. In 1946 the naval department realized that its future was questionable afterall the war that had ended only 11 months before was ended by the USAAF. This to some Americans at the time made navies seem obsolete. The U.S. Navy wated to show that they were not vonerale to such a weapon however the large amount of funds allocated to Operation Crossroads at the time caused the top brass in the U.S. Army Air Force to get envolved with the naval project. Many would say later that the use of a bomber "Dave's Dream" should have been done by a balloon rather than a USAAF bomber as according to David Bradley's book "No Place to Hide", published 1948.</p>

<p>oBIX (for Open Building Information Exchange) is a standard for Web Services-based communication with building control systems. Building control systems include those electrical and mechanical systems that operate inside a building, including Heating and Cooling, Security, Power Management, and Life/Safety Alarms that are in nearly all buildings as well as the myriad of special purpose systems that may be tied to particular buildings such as A/V Event Management, Theatre Lighting, Medical Gas Distribution, Fume Hoods, and many others.</p>
<p>oBIX is a web services protocol protocol to enable communications between building mechanical and electrical systems, and enterprise applications. The protocol enables facilities and their operations to be managed as full participants in knowledge-based businesses.</p>
<p>The purpose of oBIX (open Building Information Exchange) is to enable the mechanical and electrical control systems in buildings to communicate with enterprise applications, and to provide a platform for developing new classes of applications that integrate control systems with other enterprise functions. Enterprise functions include processes such as Human Resources, Finance, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Manufacturing.</p>
<p>oBIX is being developed within OASIS, the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards. Version It is expected to be released for public review during 2006.</p>

<p>Presently most mechanical and electrical systems are provided with embedded digital controls (DDC). Most of these devices are low cost and not enabled for TCP/IP. They are installed with dedicated communications wiring. Larger DDC controllers provide network communications for these dedicated controllers. There are several well established binary protocols (BACnet, LonTalk, Modbus, DALI) that are used on these dedicated networks in addition to numerous proprietary protocols. While these binary protocols can be used over TCP/IP networks - they have challenges with routers, firewalls, security, and compatibility with other network applications. There is an added challenge in that the industry is split between several largely incompatible protocols.</p>
<p>Because oBIX integrates with the enterprise, it will enable mechanical and electrical control systems to provide continuous visibility of operational status and performance, flagging problems and trends for system analysis or human attention.</p>
<p>OBIX provides a technology that enables facilities operators, owners and tenants to make decisions based on a fully integrated consideration of all life-cycle, environmental, cost, and performance factors.</p>

<p>oBIX provides a publicly available web services interface specification that can be used to obtain data in a simple and secure manner from HVAC, access control, utilities, and other building automation systems, and to provide data exchange between facility systems and enterprise applications. In addition, the TC will develop implementation guidelines, as needed, to facilitate the development of products that use the web service interface. Rlease 1 provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A standard for the exchange of data between systems in a secure manner.</li>
<li>Eventing of data (alarms and events)</li>
<li>Logs of data for trending variables such as temperature</li>
</ul>
<p>The intent of the OASIS committee is to complete several iterations of this standard, each of which will add in additional functionality. In addition the committee intends to address the issues of interoperability and conformance testing, and further revision and maintenance of the specification.</p>

<p>Alighiero Boetti, born in <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turin.html" title="Turin">Turin</a>, Italy on 1940 and who died in 1994 in Rome, is one of the most influential artist of the postwar period. Historically located in more than one art movement -it is said to be both part of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arte_Povera_9c18.html" title="Arte Povera">Arte Povera</a> movment as well as part of the european <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conceptual_art.html" title="Conceptual art">conceptual art</a>- his artistic practice makes use of several different mediums like performance, photography, mail art, embroidery, prints, drawing and painting.</p>
<p>The harmony of dualism was an essential principle in the thoughts, feelings and actions of Alighiero Boetti, who attained international acclaim with his colourful embroidered pictures ("Arazzi").</p>
<p>In a photomontage with the title "I Gemelli" (English: The Twins), he not only combined two photos of himself into a double self-portrait; but in the subtitle, the dualistic principle is expressed once again: Alighiero e Boetti. In the words of the artist: "Alighiero is the child-like part, outwardly directed, determining a familiar environment. Alighiero, that is what I am named and called by those who know me. Boetti is more abstract, if only because a surname is itself yet another category."</p>
<p>Alighiero Boetti is an autodidact. His artistic career begins in the second half of the sixties. After his first exhibition in 1967, when he becomes associated with the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arte_Povera_9c18.html" title="Arte Povera">Arte Povera</a> movement. He is interested in oriental culture and other related disciplines, such as philosophy and alchemy.</p>
<p>In 1971, he travels to <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> for the first time. He stays there for one month and, through 1979 - the year of the invasion of the Russian army - returns every year for longer periods of time. It is also in 1971 that he commissions his first embroidered pictures, which are crafted by Afghani women. The production of these embroidered pictures continues until his death. According to Anne Marie Boetti partner of the artist for some time, establishing a hotel in the Afghan city of <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabul.html" title="Kabul">Kabul</a> was a way to create a more direct relationship with the city and its community. Allegedly, the One Hotel lasted until 1981 when the building was destroyed by the civil war. Boetti made his last trip to Afghanistan in 1979 and until his death he regreat not being able to go back. During the 1980s he went to meet Afghan communities that lived in Pakistan. He kept producing embropidery works until 1991 along Afghani women.</p>
<p>"From the very outset of his career as an artist, Alighiero tried to find an artistic form suitable for expressing the fundamental structures of the world which he discerned in appropriate aesthetic terms", writes Rolf Lauter. "When the works were in the realisation phase, Alighiero often resorted to a dialogical communication system between the artist, on the one hand, and collaborators, assistants and outside parties handling the work, on the other."</p>
<p>The placing of texts and word into grid-like structures plays a special role in this process. The "Arazzi piccoli", for example, are generally comprised of four by four, but often also of five by five or more squares of letters, which are embroidered in random colour combinations. Read from top to bottom, they reveal sayings such as "Dare tempo al tempo" (To give time time), "Ordine e Disordine" (Order and Disorder), etc.</p>
<p>The "Arazzi grandi", on the other hand, are comprised of 25 x 25 squares of letters. "Twenty-five is the square of the holy number five and is therefore also the centre of magical squares. It consists of the sum of the numbers 1 + 3+ 5 + 7 + 9, and thus contains all the holy numbers which can be used in magic." (Boetti)</p>
<p>Among the most widely known works by Alighiero Boetti are the embroidered maps of the world, which derive from conceptual works of the years 1967 to 1971. In September 1971, he took the first preliminary drawing to Afghanistan. Once the artist specified the colours of the threads to be used, four women then worked simultaneously on the embroidery, which, depending on the format, took between one and two years to complete.</p>
<p>Equally popular among collectors are Boetti's "Lavori Biro" (Ballpoint Pen Works). The works in this group were executed with "common" ballpoint pens on paper, in the colours blue, black, red and green. Some of these were later mounted on canvas spanned on stretcher frames, while others were mounted on cardboard and placed in Plexiglas frames.</p>
<p>At least with the earlier works, the artist asked the individuals working on the pictures to produce hatches which conformed as much as possible to a basic grid of small squares in order to make the technique used to create the pictures more visible. Later, the structures varied according to the individuals' own patterns.</p>
<p>"The extent of the delegated work varies from the minimum, as in the case of the Biro (Ballpoint Pen), where there is nothing creative to do at all, to the maximum, as in the case of the Tutto (Everything). I asked the assistants to draw everything, all possible forms, abstract and figurative, and to join these together until there was no space left on the paper. Then I brought the drawings to Afghanistan, where I had them embroidered with threads of ninety different colours, whereby I stipulated that the exact same amount of each colour had to be used."</p>
<p>From 1987 onwards, Boetti works together with his Iranian assistant Mahshid Mussari, who collected the most varied motif patterns for the realisation of the last and largest "Tutto". After weeks of preparatory work, the oversized canvas could finally be sent to Peshawar in December 1993. After ten months, the completed work could finally be sent back to Rome, although Alighiero was never able to see it himself. He died in 1994 as a result of a brain tumour.</p>
<p>This extraordinary work, which measures circa 2.5 x 6.5 meters (circa 8 x 21 feet), is now in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in Frankfurt am Main. This "Tutto" is a symbol for the complexity of the world, its cultural diversity and its development; and, especially in light of the most recent political events, it can be viewed once again from an entirely new perspective.</p>

<p>Originally built by Sir Francis Rodes, circa 1583-84 as the family seat, Barlborough Hall became an independent Catholic day school in 1939. It is located in Barlborough, Chesterfield, Derbyshire. The hall’s Elizabethan design is attributed to Robert Smythson, one of a noted family of architects. It has been called, “the county's finest unspoilt Elizabethan country house” by <i>Derbyshire Revisited Photographic Memories". The hall was mentioned in the Domesday Book.

<p>Dominic Kirwan enjoys superstar status today thanks to chart-topping albums and phenomenally successful concert tours, but he will be the first to admit that his Irish roots and the strong musical influences of those early years can still be seen prominently in his live shows.</p>
<p>Success will never spoil this mild-mannered star who places great value on the opinions of his countless fans. He fondly recalls growing up in Omagh in a home full of laughter, music and traditional dancing. Dominic’s undoubted talent as a dancer was recognised by the prestigious Seamus Kerrigan School of Irish Dancing and these lessons soon paid off when Dominic began winning competitions both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Musically Dominic followed his dream and fronted a variety of local bands including his own group, The Melody Boys. The band soon became popular favourites on the live circuit scene, catering for all tastes with their wide range of songs featuring rock, pop, rhythm and blues, Irish ballads and country songs.</p>
<p>After several years of performing and honing his talents Dominic was signed to one of Ireland and the UK’s leading independent labels who he felt had his best interests at heart and guaranteed the total support and commitment necessary to take the next step on his road to stardom. The first fruits of this new relationship came with the release of a four track EP called The Green Hills Are Rolling Still followed by his debut Ritz album Try A Little Kindness.</p>
<p>Further albums followed and, now established as an artist in his own right and headlining his own tours, Dominic not only hosted his own television series, but also picked up the prestigious BBC Entertainment Media Of The Year Award for Easy Listening/Country Music.</p>
<p>It was the album On The Way To A Dream which gave him his first chart topping success. This held the top spot in the UK Country Charts and was followed with the top-selling video, Dominic Kirwan In Concert when he joined pop stars U2, Bon Jovi and Queen in the charts and so confirmed his growing appeal.</p>
<p>As often happens, the release of a compilation - The Very Best Of Dominic Kirwan - marked the end of the first chapter in his career and also proved to be the perfect introduction to his music for many new fans.</p>
<p>In 1999 Dominic took time out to travel to Nashville where he was teamed with top record producer Ronnie Light and some of Nashville’s best-known musicians. The result was the stunning Unconditional Love album, which once again saw Dominic top the British country charts. He returned to Nashville each of the following two years to repeat the winning formula, producing the albums Stone In Love With You and Under Your Spell - both highly praised by the critics and enthusiastically received by the fans.</p>
<p>Videos have featured high on the list of Dominic’s successful releases in recent years. Live In Galway (together with the accompanying CD soundtrack) has been available on the Rosette label for a while and a new TV special concert video was shot in early 2003 and is due for release in the Autumn - titled The Entertainer. An updated double CD of The Very Best of Dominic Kirwan (voI2) was released in 2002 and a brand new Irish album, Echoes of Ireland, containing many personal favourites and evocative songs from Dominic’s youth is released in the Autumn of 2003. The album will particularly please the many fans who have been clamouring for Dominic to record The Fields Of Athenry - featured on a recent episode of Coronation Street.</p>
<p>And there’s no let up in touring either which is sure to please audiences in the UK and Ireland. “In recent years we’ve averaged 200 shows a year,” Dominic says, “we believe in taking music to the people.”</p>
<p>The years 2002/2003 have also seen Dominic making waves in the Caribbean. He headlined sell out cruises in the Islands, joined by a good number of stalwart fans as well as countless new converts. Dominic also continues to set aside one weekend a year when he performs to fans in his hometown of Omagh and year on year the crowds who attend get bigger and bigger.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-24_5e4e.html" title="Edit section: [Laban ng Masa (Fight of the Masses)]">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">[Laban ng Masa (Fight of the Masses)]</span></h2>
<p>Laban ng Masa (Fight of the Masses) is a broad popular movement of progressive political blocs, people's organizations, NGOs, and individual social activists that have united as an independent counterpole movement for the ouster of the present Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA), an end to elitist rule, and establishment of a democratic transitional revolutionary government.</p>
<p>Laban ng Masa was launched last June 29, 2005 in U.P. Diliman in a gathering of more than a thousand people representing 105 organizations from various sectors and progressive political tendencies, with former UP President Dr. Francisco Nemenzo as its chair.</p>
<p><br />
Laban ng Masa is an independent counterpole movement.</p>
<p><br />
Laban ng Masa is a counterpole to the other anti-GMA forces led by the elite opposition because it shuns a repeat of mere changing of guards in Malacanang, typical of EDSA 1 and 2, with one rival elite faction replacing another but with no meaningful democratic reforms in the system. Laban ng Masa does not support the call of the elite opposition for the former President Estrada restoration.</p>
<p>It is also a counterpole to fascist anti-GMA forces whose aim is to install a military junta (albeit with token civilian representatives) to secure the same elitist and anti-democratic social system. While these groups openly call for a "revolutionary transition government", Laban ng Masa has nothing in common with them. We oppose their anti-people and rnilitarist agenda, which is more likely to succeed only with US instigation and support.</p>
<p>The Filipino masses and sections of the middle class, while wanting and fighting to oust Gloria, are wary of another elite-led EDSA-type "regime change", much more so of a militarist junta. It is for these reasons that Laban ng Masa seeks the unity of all patriotic and democratic forces fighting for the ouster of GMA and installation of a popular and democratic government that will initiate radical reforms in the system. We specifically call on the officers and men of the military and police who stand by their nationalist and pro-people ideals to unite with the broad patriotic and democratic front.</p>
<p><br />
Laban ng Masa seeks to establish a popular and democratic government.</p>
<p><br />
As soon as GMA is out of power, a transition government shall be formed by all political forces, sectors and movements that led and participated in the regime's ouster. This transitional revolutionary government (TRG) shall pave the way for the establishment of a regular government based upon the democratic representation of all sectors, respect for all civil and political liberties and initiation of fundamental economic reforms.</p>
<p>A constitutional succession of Noli de Casto to the presidency is objectionable because, he too, like GMA is a beneficiary of massive and systematic fraud. A snap elections administered by the same cheating machinery of traditional elite politicians will only&#160;!install in government the same set of scoundrels.</p>
<p>The TRG is revolutionary because it is unencumbered by the legal and institutional constraints that maintain elite domination. It is a revolutionary government with the strength and political will to enforce fundamental social reforms, especially the radical break from past neo-liberal economic policies. It shall also immediately prosecute GMA, her family and all parties culpable of electoral fraud, jueteng pay-offs, "Jose Pidal" money laundering, etc.</p>
<p>The TRG is transitional because the revolutionary government will pave the way for the drafting and ratification of a new constitution that will embody popular and democratic reforms in the economic, political and social life of the nation. Upon this new constitution that new structures of governance shall be established, including radical reforms in the electoral system as the basis for genuine democratic elections.</p>
<p><br />
On Immediate Economic Policy Issues</p>
<p><br />
The economic sufferings of the Filipino people have reached intolerable proportions under the GMA regime, owing to the decades-long subservience of present and past elitist governments to neo-liberal policies. .</p>
<p>It is therefore urgent that the TRG addresses pressing economic issues to ease the burden of the current economic crisis on the lives of the Filipino masses. Towards this, Laban ng Masa shall push the transition government to formulate short-term policy reforms on the following issues and people's demands as a starting point for the long-term and strategic policy direction of the new government:</p>
<p>On Foreign Debt. Conduct a debt audit. Call for a moratorium on debt servicing. Repudiate all onerous and illegitimate foreign debt. Re-channel debt service payments to basic social services and national development.</p>
<p>On Taxation. Institute a progressive and efficient taxation system.</p>
<p>Reduce the prices of oil products and basic commodities.</p>
<p>Increase wages and ensure job security for all.</p>
<p>Deliver and broaden basic services for the masses.</p>
<p>Implement genuine land reform. Immediate redistribution of big landholdings (e.g. Hacienda Luisita, landholdings of the Arroyos, Cojuangco, Florendo, Alcantara, etc.</p>
<p>Reclaim the coco levy funds back to the hands of small farmers through a farmers' public trust fund.</p>
<p>Protect rice and our domestic agriculture and fisheries from trade liberalization.</p>
<p>Protect local industries from the onslaught of neo-liberal economic liberalization. Work for genuine industrial development.</p>
<p>Stop the new Mining Act and protect the national patrimony.</p>
<p><br />
On Political Policy Reforms</p>
<p><br />
Laban ng Masa shall urge the TRG to implement a minimum and transitory program for political and institutional reforms on the following areas aimed at addressing the long standing clamor of all sectors for radical changes in governance.</p>
<p>On graft and corruption. Immediately institute transparency mechanisms which would prevent government from entering into shady deals with any interest groups.</p>
<p>On electoral reforms. Address the problem of cheating and fraud and ensure broad people's participation in all levels of government.</p>
<p>Reform the judiciary.</p>
<p>Recognize the right to self-determination of the Bangsa Moro and protect the rights of ethnic and national minorities.</p>
<p>Full recognition and protection of women's rights.</p>
<p>Promote the welfare of all civil service employees, military and police personnel.</p>

<p>Bruno Santos is one of the emerging model sensations that hail from Brazil in the recent years. In fact, he is the only male model who was selected to carry out two blockbuster campaigns simultaneously for two competing fashion houses, Versace and Giorgio Armani.</p>
<p>Bruno did not have an easy childhood when he grew up with three brothers and one sister. He has had many jobs since the age 12. Bruno worked on construction and even on a farm during his younger days. His grandmother believes that his chiseled physique is a result of hard work as a child. Besides the obvious good looks, Bruno is academically excellent in school. He was an engineering student before he became a model. He was even teaching math on the side.</p>
<p>Modeling was never on Bruno's career agenda by any means. In 2000, his girlfriend who was modeling at the time introduced him to her agency. The agency suggested him to try out in Europe, and they were willing to pay for the traveling expenses. Bruno was working full-time and didn't take the offer seriously. But the agency and his friends eventually changed Bruno's mind about modeling.</p>
<p>Bruno traveled to Paris, where he met his agent Ike Gamez. It was Ike Gamez who introduced Bruno into main stream high fashion, which led to the campaigns for Versace shot by Steven Klein and Armani by Peter Lindburgh. While Bruno was modeling in New York, he had the first hand experience to witness the tragedy of September 11, 2001. That saddens him a great deal till this day.</p>
<p>Traveling around the world and experiencing different cultures is the upside of modeling for Bruno, especially when he met his secret crush Christina Agulera at the shoot of Versace. But the downside of the business is traveling away from home and family. Because of the traveling, Bruno has a difficult time to have a steady girlfriend (lucky for the single ones out there). In his home country Brazil, Bruno owns a restaurant where his family works. He enjoys reading poetry in his spare time.</p>
<p>As an established figure in modeling business, Bruno is known for his professionalism and his positive attitude. He even adds some of his own theatrical touch during photo shoots at times. Bruno recently jumped ship, from Re:Quest Model Management (the agency that launched his career in New York) to commercial powerhouse, Wilhelmina Models. In this fickle business, you can bet that Bruno is the one to stay.</p>

<p>Enviromental distance concerns "physical distance that is larger than the human body and surround it, but not so large that they cannot be apprehended througt direct travel experience." (Montello, 1997). Environmental distance is a research topic within cognitive psychology, geography, AI and the cognitive neuroscience research community.</p>
<p>One of the questions relating tot enviromental distance is 'How do humans extract and encode distance information when traveling from A to B'. Several factors have thusfar been found to influence the mental representation of distance information, such as subjective travel time, optic flow, effort (mental and physical), and the number of events encountered</p>

<p>Joel West was born in the U.S. heartland, into a family of professional rodeo cowboys on the broad, flat plains of Iowa. With a rodeo arena in the front yard, it was the closest an American boy could come to growing up in the circus. And while he may have forgotten the rodeo stunts he learned, for more than five years, Joel West's exotically elfin face was at the epicenter of some of the hottest, most passionate and most controversial fashion campaigns of the 1990s. Where was his lean body first "discovered?" Would you believe it was in, of all places, a Dairy Queen! A 17-year-old Joel was on his way home from an annual church skiing trip, grabbing a "Blizzard" for the road, when a local photographer stopped him and asked if he'd ever thought of becoming a male model. The rest, as they say, is history!</p>
<p>His high-school senior-year yearbook also contains some interesting information. Joel was voted "The Biggest Brownie," which meant he was the biggest kiss-up to teachers. (For the record, Joel disagrees.) He was also voted the "Worst Driver."</p>
<p>Joel West is one of the most recognizable faces of Calvin Klein, having shot the entire collection with Peter Lindbergh and the sensational Escape campaign with Jean-Baptiste Mondino. But he's also shot major campaigns for Versace Sport and Versace Home with Richard Avedon, for Iceberg Jeans and CK Jeans with Steven Meisel and for Calvin Klein Underwear with Tiziano Magni, in addition to campaigns for Armani, Soviet Jeans, Bagutta, Emporio Armani and Golf Underwear among others. Joel has also worked with Bruce Weber, Albert Watson, Mike Ruiz, Eean Wei, Doug Inglish, Greg Henry and Greg Gorman, among others</p>
<p>His No.1 goal is "to become the best male model in the world. I don't start something unless I can believe I can be the best." As the first male model to land an exclusive contract with Calvin Klein, it would appear he is well on his way to achieving this goal!</p>
<p>No longer the elfin boy from Indianola, Iowa, Joel West lives in L.A. now. He's 26, 6'2" of solid muscle, in the best shape of his life, and pursuing acting with the same passion, discipline and dedication he brought to modeling and to everything else he's tackled. He is intelligent, charming, witty, self-deprecating, earnest and completely driven.</p>
<p>If you are considering modeling yourself, here's his best advice. Joel believes there are 3 essential elements to becoming a successful male model: "Confidence is No.1. Second, you have to be very focused and know what you want out of the whole business. And third, a good, positive outlook!" Joel has an apartment in New York, and shows his dedication to the work by exercising 12 hours a week.</p>

<p>Mirko Kiković je jedan od prvih osnivača gej pokreta na prostorima bivše Jugoslavije. Još kao četrnaestogodišnji dečak je osetio potrebu da "izađe iz ormana" i otkrije ostatku sveta svoje pravo ja. Nakon oštre borbe s roditeljima koji su mu pružili patrijarhalno vaspitanje, nekako je uspeo i njih da privoli za svoju stvar. Pomogao je i mnogim mladim sputanim i neodlučnim pojedincima da izađu na put svetlosti.</p>
<p>Svi ga pamtimo kao jednog od organizatora prve i jedine zvanične Parade ponosa u Srbiji. Nikada se iz naših sećanje neće izbrisati njegovo prkosno lice natopljeno krvlju kako prkosi uvreženim tradicionalistima i ortodoksnim sveštenicima.</p>
<p>Mirko trenutno radi za jednu od najvećih kompanija za izradu pića u Srbiji i ne srami se ni na poslu da pokaže svima ko je i šta je.</p>
<p>Gej zajednica u Srbiji ga i dalje ceni kao jednog od prvih i istinskih lidera.</p>

<p>Marcus Woods' early life began in the suburbs of Manchester. At the early age of 4, Marcus was discovered by professors at The University of Manchester as being the first human ever to spell the word "antidisestablishmentarianism" right after the first try. Marcus had undergone several tests to determine his IQ which consistently gave a 147. He skipped through kindergarten in its entirety moving immediately to the Primary school of St. Mary's. Here he skipped the first two years, being that he was already able to write, read, and do basic math, without any prior teaching.</p>
<p>He went to go on to the High School of St. Micheals, where after graduating at the age of just 14, He was offered various scholarships by the University of Newcastle, the Oxford University College, University of Manchester as well as offers from abroad. Wanting to stay close to his family and friends, he picked up on the offer from The Oxford University College, and decided to study Mathematics and Physics, with a specialty in Astrophysics.</p>

<p>Upon studying Astrophysics at Oxford University College Woods' made groundbreaking work in the field of Cosmology, working closely with George Chapline at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. They proposed that black holes do not exist, and that objects currently thought to be black holes are actually dark-energy stars. They draw this conclusion from some quantum mechanical analyses Woods had made earlier while working with Stephen Hawking.</p>
<p>Later on, Woods was offered by the NASA to work at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and was offered his own R&amp;D team of scientists to work further on his study, but he declined, and instead chose to chase his childhood dream of becoming a movie star.</p>
<p>While there aren't many notable international releases yet, Woods has starred in several Bollywood films, and is considered an idol in India. In 2005, the India's Most Wanted show on India TV ran an exposé that accused several Bollywood figures (including Woods) of seeking sexual favors from young actresses. This ploy would not be, of course, unique to Bollywood moguls; film industry figures worldwide have long been rumored to subject actresses to the casting couch. Woods vehemently denied these accusations, and most of the Bollywood establishment have supported him. Surprisingly, the exposé resulted in insignificant public outrage.</p>
<p>His international debut will come with the release of Ocean's 13, in which he will star along the likes of George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Robrets among others. It has also been confirmed that Woods will have a role in the upcoming Quentin Tarantino movie "Super Hacking Ninja Monkeys do exist."</p>

<p>Staurosporine is a potent inhibitor of protein kinases with an IC50 in the nanomolar range. It is an alkaloid from the bacterium Streptomyces sp. In particular, it acts as an inhibitor of protein kinase C (Protein Kinase C represents a family of Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-dependent enzymes which catalyzes the covalent transfer of phosphate from ATP to serine and threonine residues on proteins.) and of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity. Staurosprorine is often used in in vitro models to induce cell death in a transcription-independent manner. It has a highly anti-proliferative activity. Staurosporine might be considered as a prototype neurotropic drug in view of its ability to induce neurite outgrowth and to increase tau protein levels. Because it mimics some of the neuroprotective effects of NGF and might block certain signals required to enhance cellular levels and/or beta amyloid processing, staurosporine was by some researchers considered to as a candidate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The ability of staurosporine to promote neuronal regeneration and brain cholinergic neurons survival has been also demonstrated in animal studies.</p>
<p>As the protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzyme family mediates a central cytoprotective effect in the regulation of cell survival, activation of PKC, and subsequent recruitment of numerous downstream elements such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, opposes initiation of the apoptotic cell death program by diverse cytotoxic stimuli.</p>
<p>Thus, inhibition of PKC, which has been shown to initiate apoptosis in a variety of malignant cell types, is of interest in cancer research. Selective targeting of PKC may prove useful in improving the therapeutic efficacy of established antineoplastic agents. Although staurosporine itself is too toxic to be applied, there are more specific PKC inhibitors available.</p>
<p>Indeed, staurosporine and its derivatives possess antineoplastic activity in vivo in human tumors grown as xenografts in nude mice. Staurosporine analogs are also potent modulators of the cyclin-dependent kinase system, which determines the progression of cells through the cell cycle.</p>
<p>The induction of mitochondrial apoptotic processes by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine indicates a possible role for PKC in the modulation of the intracellular mechanisms leading to Programmed Cell Death. Abnormalities in both levels and activity of PKC, found in some chronic neurodegenerative syndromes, lead to the possibility that PKC dysfunction could be involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms of disease.</p>

<p>A condensation trap is a trap used to collect condensation from dew or moisture in the air. It is usually a plastic bag placed over the leaves of a plant and tied to the stems. When the trap is placed at night or in the early morning, as the air heats during the day the bag will create a green-house effect collecting moisture from the air inside in the bag. This trap is most commonly used in a survival situation where water or clean water is scarce such as in a desert environment.</p>

<p>The exact term "New Canada", according to Rick Anderson (<a href="http://ca.groups.yahoo.com/group/NewCanadaProject/message/47" class="external free" title="http://ca.groups.yahoo.com/group/NewCanadaProject/message/47" rel="nofollow">http://ca.groups.yahoo.com/group/NewCanadaProject/message/47</a>), was coined by founder, first and only leader of the Reform Party of Canada, E. Preston Manning, through his book in 1992 (<a href="http://www.cc.umanitoba.ca/cm/cmarchive/vol20no4/revthenewcanada.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cc.umanitoba.ca/cm/cmarchive/vol20no4/revthenewcanada.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cc.umanitoba.ca/cm/cmarchive/vol20no4/revthenewcanada.html</a>) and his New Canada Act of 1998 (<a href="http://www.uni.ca/library/reform_nca.html" class="external free" title="http://www.uni.ca/library/reform_nca.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uni.ca/library/reform_nca.html</a>).</p>
<p><br />
However the "Project" actually started when Don MacAlpine from Nipigon in the Thunder Bay-Superior North riding, got the ball rolling on this idea when he was originally asked by Paul Hellyer to run as a candidate of record for the Canadian Action Party in 1997, but because that party wasn't democratically reformed enough, he took it upon himself to create Take Back Democracy (<a href="http://www.takebackdemocracy.ca" class="external free" title="http://www.takebackdemocracy.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.takebackdemocracy.ca</a>) right after then ran it up about until the 2004 federal general election.</p>
<p><br />
After that election's success in electing and making Independents like Chuck Cadman, Carolyn Parrish, David Kilgour, Pat O'Brien and Bev Desjarlais, he came up with the idea of a Coalition or Association of Canadian Independent Democratic Representatives, then went on to promote it on his Steps to Democratic Empowerment (<a href="http://www.nwconx.net/donmac/" class="external free" title="http://www.nwconx.net/donmac/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nwconx.net/donmac/</a>) during the federal general eleciton of 2006 where a Québécois Independent from Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier named André Arthur was actually elected.</p>
<p><br />
Soon Don MacAlpine retired both Take Back Democracy and Steps to Democratic Empowerment webpages to push harder for his Coalition or Association of Canadian Independent Democratic Representatives across the country, contacting the 90 non-affiliated Independents who ran in the least election who had not been elected, meanwhile other Independent-minded Canadians were already organizing, strategizing and planning out the next step themselves in other regions from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>
<p><br />
Up right until now, the most advanced so far was the Independent movement in Ontario which included Brad Harness from Ailsa Craig in the Lambton—Kent—Middlesex riding representing the New Canada Party (<a href="http://www.newcanada.ca" class="external free" title="http://www.newcanada.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.newcanada.ca</a>), Mike Houghtling from Waterloo in the Kitchener—Waterloo riding representing United We Gather, Joshua E. Eriksen from Keady in the Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound riding representing the Canadian Independence Alliance Bloc Coalition, Tim Hickey from Belleville in the Prince Edward—Hastings riding representing National Challenge for Change in Canada (<a href="http://www.shareholderinthedream.ca" class="external free" title="http://www.shareholderinthedream.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.shareholderinthedream.ca</a>), Ronnie Amyotte in the Mississauga—Erindale riding representing Block Canada, Bill Cook from Tara in the Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound riding and John Gault from Toronto in the Trinity—Spadina riding representing the Representative Party of Ontario (<a href="http://www.representativeparty.on.ca" class="external free" title="http://www.representativeparty.on.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.representativeparty.on.ca</a>) and Partap Dua from Markham in the Markham—Unionville riding and Mohamed Elrofaie from Mississauga in the Mississauga East—Cooksville riding representing the United Peoples Party of Canada (<a href="http://www.uppc.ca" class="external free" title="http://www.uppc.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.uppc.ca</a>) along with a few other individual united Independent supporters for an "organically grassroots meetup" that would be the first "Common Parliament for the Common People" of Canada in Ontario held inside the International Market Café at the International Trade Centre in Mississauga on Saturday, April 1, 2006.</p>
<p><br />
Though when united, the group was too busy strategizing, planning and sharing ideas to formally organize and agree to an official Independent platform, eventually they did create a Common Ground Agreement later on their New Canada Project listserv is (<a href="http://ca.groups.yahoo.com/group/NewCanadaProject" class="external free" title="http://ca.groups.yahoo.com/group/NewCanadaProject" rel="nofollow">http://ca.groups.yahoo.com/group/NewCanadaProject</a>), which is temporary active for the interim until a democratic grassroots congress is held with a open and free vote by the membership at large on the validity of the document in time for the upcoming election.</p>
<p><br />
Its Common Ground Agreement is a platform document that melds both the principles and policies agreed upon by through general consensus, with those ideas added to it from the Fireweed Democracy Project (<a href="http://www.fireweeddemocracyproject.ca" class="external free" title="http://www.fireweeddemocracyproject.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.fireweeddemocracyproject.ca</a>) sessions Richard Anderson from Merrickville in the Leeds—Grenville riding led on CPAC (<a href="http://www.cpac.ca" class="external free" title="http://www.cpac.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpac.ca</a>) from April 6-9, who has also joined in talks on the listserv this spring, has been appointed to the national advisory boards of Fair Vote Canada (<a href="http://www.fairvotecanada.org" class="external free" title="http://www.fairvotecanada.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.fairvotecanada.org</a>), Manning Centre for Building Democracy (<a href="http://www.manningcentre.ca" class="external free" title="http://www.manningcentre.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.manningcentre.ca</a>) and the progressive Canada 2020 (<a href="http://www.canada2020.ca" class="external free" title="http://www.canada2020.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.canada2020.ca</a>) this summer.</p>
<p><br />
Once the Agreement was made, the evolution of the Project spawned the genesis of the New Canada Project website (<a href="http://www.newcanada.ca" class="external free" title="http://www.newcanada.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.newcanada.ca</a>) owned by Brad Harness, which is projected to be the starting and finishing point for the Common Ground Agreement through a Wiki-styled Open Living Platform co-administrated by Craig Hubley from Toronto in the Toronto—Danforth riding and Andrew C. Thomas from Scarborough in the Scarborough-Guildwood riding for all Independent-minded Canadians to use, add, edit and create one brand-new Canadian vision for the future through direct participatory democracy online, the Project's deadline being late December as a general federal election is expected to be held by the governing Tories by the group some time in Winter 2007.</p>
<p><br />
Also, there is another New Canada Project recently being used separately, as the New Canada Project for Social Justice and Strategic Leadership (<a href="http://www.newcanada.tk" class="external free" title="http://www.newcanada.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.newcanada.tk</a>) has been launched on Saturday, June 17, 2006 of this summer by Adam Henley from Peterborough in the Peterborough riding according to a post on the group's listserv (<a href="http://ca.groups.yahoo.com/group/NewCanadaProject/message/46" class="external free" title="http://ca.groups.yahoo.com/group/NewCanadaProject/message/46" rel="nofollow">http://ca.groups.yahoo.com/group/NewCanadaProject/message/46</a>).</p>

<p>Born from the ashes of Russian metal and exacerbated by one classical pianist's descent into progressive madness, the unique sound of SEVEN WAYS OUT is melody-driven, soulful alt-rock'n'roll with influences that are equal parts hard rock, jazz, and down-home blues. What's it sound like? Picture B.B. King and the NY Philharmonic duking it out in a mud pit while Blondie does sideline cheers. You can't picture that, can you. That's ok, it's kind of gross. But the fact is, every time the members of SEVEN WAYS OUT get together and play, we reap the benefits of three classically trained music snobs facing off against a reformed metalhead, a super-skilled DJ, and a guy who can stand on his head for longer than you can stand on the subway. Think: complex compositions, soaring violins, a shockingly full sound, an edge that's grittier than 8th Avenue pavement at rush hour. All this, plus a sweet, smoky soprano voice, makes SWO a band that pushes the rock genre with a melodic, unorthodox style and progressive sound that betrays the finely tuned musical talent behind all that headbangin'.</p>

<p>The Saxonia International Balloon Fiesta is the third biggest hot-air balloon festival in Europe. Annualy over 100 000 people visit the spectacle, which takes place in Leipzig (Germany) at the end of July. The Fiesta is organised by a local Marketing agency, co-partner is the City of Leipzig. In 1995 the first Balloon Fiesta attracted 5000 visitors as a local event in Mügeln. In 1996 the festival was relocated to a recreation area close to Leipzig called „Silbersee“. This area lies beyond the air lanes of Leipzig. The spacious recreation area „Silbersee“ is situated between the urban areas of Loessnig (a distric of Leipzig) and the open-pit landscape in the southern areas of Leipzig, which is currently in a process of recultivation and transfiguration. The public park „Silbersee“ has room for over one hundred balloons. Competitions between the hot-air balloons are essential at the Saxonia International Balloon Fiesta. The different kinds of competition-flights are: Fox hunting, Key grab and flying as far as possible. Most of the balloons are sponsored by large companies.</p>

Jose is an attorney from Miami, Florida that was named as Florida's College Student of the Year in 2002 and went to the Columbia School of Law. Though he was kicked off relatively early in the season, Pepi became a notable character when he was brought back by finalist Lee Bienstock, to assist in the final project, and Carolyn Kepcher, Trump's assistant, did not recognize him. This became a recurring theme in the final two espisodes and Donald Trump personally recognized Pepi in the final episode to the live audience's delight.</p>

<p>Y Mountain is located directly east from <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_University_4ac9.html" title="Brigham Young University">Brigham Young University</a> in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provo%2C_Utah_a20a.html" title="Provo, Utah">Provo, Utah</a>. There is a trail that ascends a mile up the face of the mountain up to a giant Y built over a hundred years ago as the insignia for <a href="../../../b/y/u/BYU_ee50.html" title="BYU">BYU</a>. For years this trail has been the most hiked trail in <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah_Valley_0573.html" title="Utah Valley">Utah Valley</a> and provides a beautiful view of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provo%2C_Utah_a20a.html" title="Provo, Utah">Provo</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/e/Orem%2C_Utah_f377.html" title="Orem, Utah">Orem</a> and the rest of the many cities in Utah Valley and <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah_Lake_bbe8.html" title="Utah Lake">Utah Lake</a> (a large freshwater lake that feeds the Great Salt Lake).</p>
<p>The large white Y on the side of the mountain has become the nationally recognized insignia for <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_University_4ac9.html" title="Brigham Young University">BYU</a> and the reason why BYU is often called the "Y". It is made of concrete and is 380 feet high and 130 feet wide. No other college in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> has a symbol larger, in fact, the Y is even larger than the letters in the "<a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Sign_a9b2.html" title="Hollywood Sign">Hollywood Sign</a>" in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>.</p>
<p>There are 14 strands of lights around the perimeter of the Y, which are lit 5 times a year by the Intercollegiate Knights. It is lit for Freshman Orientation, Homecoming, Y Days, and graduation in April and August. When the Y is lit, club members are selected to guard the Y in the night and make sure it remains lit until dawn.</p>

<p><b>Early 1906</b> - When the junior class of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_University_4ac9.html" title="Brigham Young University">Brigham Young University</a> wanted to paint '07 on the side of the mountain, the senior class became upset. To settle this conflict <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_University_4ac9.html" title="Brigham Young University">BYU</a> President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._Brimhall_e202.html" title="George H. Brimhall">George H. Brimhall</a> proposed that they paint the letters BYU on the mountain instead.</p>
<p><b>April 2006</b> - The plans to construct the BYU on the mountain were begun. Professor Ernest D. Partridge was assigned to conduct a survey and designed the emblem. When this was complete, a line of students and faculty passed buckets of <a href="../../../l/i/m/Lime.html" title="Lime">lime</a>, sand, and rocks up the mountain in order to fill up the letters. After six hours of hard labor, only the Y had been completed, so the filling in of the remaining two letters was postponed and later abandoned.</p>
<p><b>1907</b> - The BYU Y Day tradition began. This consisted of thousands of students hauling, by <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucket_brigade.html" title="Bucket brigade">bucket brigade</a>, gallons of <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitewash.html" title="Whitewash">whitewash</a> up the mountain to paint the giant Y. This tradition lasted until 1973. It was abandoned due to erosion of the mountain.</p>
<p><b>1908</b> - A three-foot high wall was erected around the letter to keep it together. This required an additional 20,000 pounds of concrete.</p>
<p><b>1911</b> - <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serifs.html" title="Serifs">Serifs</a> were added to the top and bottom of the Y, giving it its current look.</p>
<p><b>1924</b> - Tradition of "lighting the Y" began. Each year during special evenings, mattress batting was placed buckets and soaked in <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerosene.html" title="Kerosene">kerosene</a>. The buckets were then set around the edges of the Y and lit with torches. This ended in 1970 when it was decided that this tradition was hazardous. After being discontinued, a small building was constructed which contains a generator that lights up 14 strands of 25-watt light bulbs which outline the Y.</p>
<p><b>1960s</b> - BYU began to use a helicopter to carry 1000s of pounds of whitewash to repaint the Y. This is now redone every 5 years.</p>
<p><b>May 20, 2006</b> - The 100th anniversary of the Y was celebrated. Many people hiked the Y that day to commemorate the occasion.</p>

<p>A 1031 TIC exchange involves trading a property (for instance a home) for another property as to avoid federal capital gains taxes. The TIC part stands for Tenant in Common. In this scenario, the property that one trades for is managed by a management and provides a steady income stream while indefinitely deferring capital gains taxes. A little know tax gem.</p>

<p>This little known place in the South Pacific is a sunken atoll. No land at all, just a circular reef about 5 miles wide by 8 miles long with a little passage on the west side to go inside and be surrounded by breakers and ocean on all sides. It is speculated that fewer people have actually been inside this reef than to the top of Mt. Everest. The weather conditions have to be just perfect to go inside the reef. A wreck still visible on the reef is a testament to this. Once inside it is possible to anchor in water that is crystal clear and underwater visibility to depths approximating 200 ft. Snorkeling inside the reef may be experienced with sharks, fish and rays.</p>

<p>Kieran Devaney was born in the east Dublin suburb of Liverpool, spent his childhood summers in the West of Ireland and now lives between his home in Rosses Point, in County Sligo and the United Arts Club in Dublin. His interest in photography was sparked when he joined his first newspaper, the Crosby Herald, as a trainee reporter in the 1970s. Kieran went on to write for the Liverpool Echo, the London Times and to broadcast for Radio City, LBC, TVAM, ITN, Channel Four News, Sky News and for the last eight years produce the news at TV3 in Dublin. His photographs of the West reflect life in Rosses Point and its surroundings where WB and Jack B Yeats spent their childhood summers in Elsinore House, the home of their uncle Henry Middleton. His Dublin pictures are taken in the world of Patrick Kavanagh as he made his rounds down Baggot Street and up Grafton Street. But above all it’s the pastel sunset and the rugged faces of Sligo which have prompted him to pick up the camera and record images of life in the West in the 21st century.</p>

<p>Formed in the summer of 2005, drummer Bill Christie, guitarist David Henry, and bassist/vocalist Kevin Van Amburgh decided to collectively create the type of rock n roll that was missing from their lives. Providing a mixture of 60s rock and punk, with sprinklings of funk, reggae and rockabilly, the band's unique sound and catchy melodies make them an instant hit with audiences craving pure rock and roll. Their catchy songs and live shows have forged their reputation as a high-energy, over the top live act. While the band has released several EP's so far, they are in the process of recording their debut album.</p>

<p>1) The Environment. Simpson is closely aligned with many proposals that are familiar to Green Party adherents. From an Apollo program for renewable fuel sources and technologies, to environmentally friendly architectural design and community planning, Simpson could easily be referred to as a supporter of Al Gore's vision of man's environmental impact and the benefits of conservation and rethinking our exploitation of fossil fuels, as laid out in his film "An Inconvenient Truth".</p>
<p>2) Health Care. Simpson supports affordable health care for all US citizens, using the single payer model. She sees the negotiating power of the US government as key to providing the most cost efficient services for Americans.</p>
<p>3) Terrorism. Simpson calls for increased utilization of diplomatic and economic tools as well as law enforcement techniques to address the vast majority of the problems of international terrorism. Additional focus must be placed upon the motivation behind the attacks, not simply attempts at their prevention.</p>
<p>4) Iraq Occupation. Simpson supports withdrawal of US forces, ala Murtha, at the "earliest practicable date", with an over the horizon presence to assist the government in power against armed uprisings. But day to day security operations should be in the hands of the Iraqi people.</p>
<p>5) Constitutional Issues. Simpson is a staunch supporter of three co-equal branches of government, rejects the concept of the "unitary executive", and suggests that congress is duty bound to exercise it's oversight powers vis a vis the executive, even during times of war in as much as it must insure that it's laws are being faithfully executed. Congress must have robust authority to insure the laws it passes are followed. Rule of law trumps presidential prerogative.</p>
<p>6) Elections. Simpson calls for an open, transparent, accessible, and verifiable voting process, with paper ballots and streamlined re countability in all states. Voter registration processes should promote participation by the largest number of citizens possible, and at least one national holiday should be set aside for voting, with more total hours of accessibility to the polls allowed for.</p>
<p>7) Deficit spending. Simpson calls for a balanced budget, aggressive debt reduction, and a return to tax policies comparable to those of the 1990's. She views the national debt as a national security issue.</p>

<p>B.D.Kuchera, also know as Benjamin Daniel Kuchera/Ben Kuchera grew up in Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Cincinnati. He had a keen interest in art at an early age and began as an illustrator at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. He would also later paint, draw, write and animate as well as make films. Filmmaking however, became his greatest passion.</p>
<p>After graduating from high school, Kuchera wrote and directed his first 16mm film, a short called "Rest Stop 2 Miles" which he shot on location in rural Illinois. This was shown on regional PBS. He would soon after build on his experience by undertaking his first feature length project, "Mayfly Days," also shot on 16mm film.</p>
<p>As he wrote, shot and edited "Mayfly Days" over the next several years along with his close friend Michael J Taylor, Kuchera attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and later the California Institute of the Arts where he received his bachelor's degree in Film/Video in 1999. He accepted a full-ride scholarship to study Fine Arts and Electronic Media at the University Cincinnati and completed two years before leaving to work in the commercial film and video production industry.</p>
<p>Married to Sarah Jane Bajus in 2004, Kuchera now lives in Lexington, Kentucky. He has years of commercial and documentary video experience under his belt and is developing several scripts and documentaries through his company Silver Screen Arts - a production and post-production studio. He has also discovered Fine Art to be completely incompatible with the commercial Arts, and has begun a journey into the Arts and storytelling. Kuchera is now a college professor and independent filmmaker and Artist.</p>
<p>Kuchera is a devout Protestant Christian, and gave his life to Jesus Christ on June 5th, 2005, and was baptized on June 12, 2005. Kuchera asked his wife to marry him on June 5th 2004, and was married on June 12, 2005. The significance of the parallels of his marriage to his wife, and his devotion to Christ were far from coincidental.</p>
