<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm just going to go with my original vote. After considering the many sock arguments, I just cannot see any significant notability emerging (other than "he is a hero to the karala people"). The sockpuppets and personal attacks have to stop. It's getting a little ridiculous. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="DodgerBlue"><b>alpha</b></font><font color="black"><b>Chimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>laudare</b></a></sup> 14:51, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Alpha. Do not take a hasty decision. All are not socks. Many admins and some like jyothis are genuine editors who are from malayalam wiki.I may be new here but have sincere intentions and am here to expand the music section with many more articles on singers of kerala (Already started one on <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gayatri_Asokan_4397.html" title="Gayatri Asokan">Gayatri Asokan</a>). Jyothis has given many more links to clear the notability issue. Also please could you explain why this should be deleted? You already might have known that he is a hero for the kerala people. If so he should be notable! The huge response is natural as he has a big fan following in kerala. There are also some other people like <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amit_Sana_ac08.html" title="Amit Sana">Amit Sana</a> who have an article. Why are you all silent on the many comments on amit's article? Sock or no sock you should have a reason. somasundaran's article satisfies so many wiki guidelines while only one is required to qualify it. So what is the problem here? Anyway jyothis has come out with so many links to prove credibility, notability and verifiability(see down). You can also ask him (anyone) to improve or modify the article.Also understand that the section on playback singers from kerala is very weak. Don't we need to improve it? Also seems the so called pradipsomasundaran who wrote the article first was just a fan who was after some fun and is no more on this scene. But fact remains that he has just managed to bring this unnessary controversy by putting up a half baked article in the first place. But we feel that this wonderful artist should not be disgraced further due to this imposter's mistakes and by people such as Angeo who seem to have stooped to low levels of personal attacks. That's why all are pained. This has become a fight for dignity for all of us from Kerala. Also now the article has some dignity and now the vanity issues should not be insisted as the original editor has run away. Please remember that we are all judging on a wonderful singer in his absence!The only way we can end this seemingly unending ridiculous war is stopping this on a good note with dignity restored for the singer.But we should give praise to all who managed to bring up so many information on the singer. Let's take all relevant and useful info and use it to put up a good article instead of turning a blind eye to their efforts.</li>

<p>If he was not notable then he would not be participating in such a reputed program in kerala! I feel like a fool in having to show you such links to make you and others believe that pradip is one of the most popular singers of Kerala who is very very busy.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I believe this guy is genuine. But I don't think he has achieved enough fame to merit a wikipedia article. The links provided which go the newspaper <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">The Hindu</a> were verified by me. Some of the article just mentions his name with a long list of other singers which just say that he is going to sing at this function/festival/programme. Also the <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDB_38d9.html" title="IMDB">IMDB</a> article mentions that he has just sung for one film which is Manasam. Some of the singers which this page has mentioned such as Sunidhi Chauhan have sung in many fims/albums. Also they are known throughout India.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, some of the comments mentions that he has worked with well known music directors such as Kaithapram and Ravindran. Google shows absolutely no hits regarding this. Google hits must not be used as a basis for an article but it could mean PS has worked with them in one movie or a song.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally, Pradeep Somasundaran's google hits show it to be 901. But on further inspection, there are just about a dozen sites which really mention this guy. --<a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgeo020_177d.html" title="User:Ageo020">Ageo020</a> 21:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Pradip Somasundaran is genuine, very much so! 'Meri Awaaz Suno' was probably the first every Indian TV competition for singing talents and was endorsed by the likes of Yash Chopra. This show was hosted by Anu Kapur, and was one of the very few popular programmes on Doordarshan at the time. It is true that Pradip did not get a major break in the Hindi music scene, even after being a clear winner on a national stage. However, he has worked with some of the great music directors in south indian languages like Ravindran and Ilayaraja.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.26.31.106 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.26.31.106_99af.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.26.31.106">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I understand you desire to have an article on Wikipedia. How about just placing the article in your userspace and dropping the whole matter? It'll show up in people's google searches, giving you what you're looking for. You have yet to cite some <i>notable news source</i> asserting your significance. I'm thinking something like BBC, New York Times, etc - something Wikipedia users have heard of. As for flooding this AfD with anonymous opinions...it's just silly. Anybody can see through the pattern of edits. Quite frankly, your interests would have been best served by posting one clear, well written opinion regarding your notability. I'm just saying. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><span style="color:DodgerBlue;font-size:95%;"><b>alpha</b></span><span style="color:black; font-size:105%;"><b>Chimp</b></span></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b>laudare</b></a></sup> 22:05, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I would like to disagree on some of the above points. This may seem like a wiki war but please bear with me.</dd>
<dd>1. If he is a noted playback singer, why does IMDB list only Manasam as his only credit. Being a notable singer, why does he only feature in only 3-4 articles in the Hindu. Why doesn't he come in other South Indian newspapers like Malayala Manorama, Deepika, Indian Express or Mathrubhumi. (please consider that this is not an attack on the reputation of the Hindu)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Answer: See here. <a href="http://www.musicindiaonline.com/l/20/c/singer/" class="external free" title="http://www.musicindiaonline.com/l/20/c/singer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicindiaonline.com/l/20/c/singer/</a> This lists more songs. Still this is not complete</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These have malayalam fonts and do not appear in searches. Simple fact! If you want more articles just on this person enough can be provided as he he performs all over the state.</p>
<dl>
<dd>IMDB is very unreliable for judging the significance of Malayalam film personalities. It may be used to argue that someone is notable, but never than someone is not. It lists five films for Baburaj and two for Dakshinamoorthy while the actual number is well over hundred for both.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Google hits on this guy are very few. A noted playback singer must generate atleast 1000 hits. Even though he has 901 hits, only 10-12 actually mention his name as a singer. The rest are just hits for the surname somasundaran.( sunidhi chauhan, PS's co-winner in MAS generates 160,000 hits)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Answer: See searching the name pradeep somasundaram. He is also listed in this name.This will give you another 900 odd results. Then the total make it almost 1800! So that will get you to your magic number of 1000. After all who brought this rule that a playback singer ought to have at least 1000 hits? Strange!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3. The site blogswara just has below 8000 hits. And there is no mention of this site in any national newspaper comparing it to open source revolution. Also please note that the site has just about 10 songs to be downloaded, one of which belongs to PS.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Answer: Did you except all songs to be sung by Pradip? The site clearly tells that this is a joint effort. Not a single persons album.Silly argument which does not guage a person's popularity. If so all films &amp; albums would have songs only by single persons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4. Podbazaar is the audio version of <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youtube.html" title="Youtube">Youtube</a>. Users actually upload a songs or interview and write an article about it. It means that a user can write anything about it. It's not necessarily reliable. Also note that podbazaar is not in the top 100,000 sites according to <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa.html" title="Alexa">Alexa</a>.( it is around the 1 million mark.)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Answer: We are not talking about Podbazar's popularity here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please do answer this question: Is there a meter by which you can guage a person's popularity? No. Have you lived in Kerala since 1996? Have you heard this person's songs? Then why do you say that he is not popular? Based just on the Internet searches?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Info on the net is based on what info we feed into it. Kerala is very bad in internet density. Broadband started here only in 2005! So it will take some time for people in Kerala to be internet savvy. Please take all these facts into consideration.--59.93.35.130 12:48, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b></dd>
<dd>Ageo, I dont know on what basis you say that other major dailys has not recognised the person in question. The Hindu has a good online edition and I believe that you will not be searching in the native language, say malayalam or tamil. the problem with the current system that uses the ascii fonts used by individual language dailys are custom-built, which takes out the searchability. hence, I would think that the argument which says he doesnt generate google listing does not hold much good.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I would like to know how many movies are listed in IMDB, with a comparison to the actual number of movies released. this is to identify the authenticity of the argument that says that IMDB doesnt have any records.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please note that the blogswara recorded 5000+ hits and 300+GB downloads within no time of release of its first album, in which the person is a part of.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the point that Sunidhi chauhan generated that many, please note that she sings in Hindi, which has a wider audience level and reachability in the net. whereas the other languages are yet to make their way into the internet community in the level as hindi has.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Unfortunately being mentioned in a list of other people, all of whom performed does not constitute a "feature" as in "Multiple features in popular culture publications such as Vogue, GQ, Elle, FHM or national newspapers." A "feature" is (from <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">wiktionary</a>) " 1. An important or main item." Being listed in the context of many others who participated in an <i>event that was features</i> does not constitute a "feature." As far as the unreliability of search tools to properly reflect foreign-language sources, this may have to condemn the article to unverifiability (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeidenstud_07d3.html" title="User:Seidenstud">Seidenstud</a> 03:01, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b></dd>
<dd>Is this a wiki war? Seems like one of your mods Ageo is bent on making it so! He seems to be from Kerala and still bent upon to discredit a person about whom he does not know anything. Hey accept the facts. The other mods are more mature.Have a broader outlook.
<dl>
<dd>contention1): Why is pradip singled out when the abhijit sawants/amit sanas all have articles here?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am a press reporter &amp; writer based in Kerala and know this singer since 1994. I think it's time to close this discussion.Most of the supporting comments are from amateur fans. I am a passerby and was alarmed to see so much talk based on just news from internet! Net or google is not the final word on any person's popularity or talent it also gives incorrect and incomplete facts many times.There is more to a celebrity than google. Has anyone of the mods here has ever heard this man's voice? You can judge his popularity from his music blog. It's unfair to comment on a person's talent &amp; popularity from factual materials just from the Internet without taking a round up of other important factors like regional popularity and support.So thought of giving some clear facts without any bias as one of the mods here has suggested.</p>
<p>A celebrity is more than internet news. It takes just minutes to be one and years to sustain it.Pradip became a celebrity for all malayalees in 1996 and is still going strong after 10 years.</p>
<dl>
<dd>contention 2): I found articles about Kazi, Abhijeet Sawant, Amit Sana</dd>
</dl>
<p>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/Amit_Sana" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/Amit_Sana" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/Amit_Sana</a> - This man does not have any material to support any claims as per this wiki but still he is there!)and even just some participants of the Indian idol/ program on your wiki who are here just due to this single T.V program! Some have not even sung a single film song or any album to credit!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Who authorised this article to stay without even an iota of supporting facts as pradip has?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then why should pradip not be here? (Just a contention)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Contention 3) The same rule should apply for everyone.He is a celebrity since 1996. Some</dd>
</dl>
<p>of his achievements are as below.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) 1991-President's Gold medal winner in A.I.R National level Light Music</dd>
</dl>
<p>competetion</p>
<dl>
<dd>2) 1996- Lata mangeshkar Award for best male singer of India in Meri Awaz</dd>
</dl>
<p>Suno, the first National level Televised Music competetion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>3) 1997- The prestegious TOYI (Ten Outstanding Young Indian Award) given by</dd>
</dl>
<p>JCI International which is recognition to his contributions <a href="http://www.pradipsomasundaran.com/images/toyi.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.pradipsomasundaran.com/images/toyi.jpg" rel="nofollow">TOYI Award</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>4) 1998- Best T.V Playback singer of Kerala award for the</dd>
</dl>
<p>song"Ennakkaruppin"</p>
<dl>
<dd>5) He is a regular in many T.V programs and has done a listless number of</dd>
</dl>
<p>Albums.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This list is endless and they are only some of his major achievement..He has</dd>
</dl>
<p>performed all over India &amp; in all the gulf countries many times.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So your first requirement of having won atleast an award of National repute</dd>
</dl>
<p>is satisfied as he has won three such awards.</p>

<dl>
<dd>The finding by one of the mods about singing in only one film is not true.</dd>

<dd>Mod's: The list and details about Indian Playback singers is very new and</dd>
</dl>
<p>without much indepth info. Why don't we all try to expand it rather than closing out such talents. You should also expand to wider areas of information other than just basing your findings on the number of google hits.</p>
<ul>
<li>An encyclopaedia should try to bring comprehensive info on even the smallest info.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wiki should also be about trying to find real talents(who do have contributed in their fields) who need to be introduced to the whole world. Let's not shun away from expanding knowledge and throwing light for the world. No one should be discriminated against.Let's give credit to the people who introduce such new faces to the wiki. Isn't the whole existence of the wiki based on expansion of such new info?</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Pradip has been on the music scene since 1996 since he won Meri Awaz Suno. This music show was the forerunner of the many later music shows such as Sa Re Ga Ma and Indian Idol. Also note that he is a major celebrity in his home state of Kerala. Also according to <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> not many people outside South India will know him. Hence, he is culturaaly significant for him to merit an article over here. --202.150.117.156 05:35, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>&#160;: Pradip Somasundaran is truly Self-made. He is very talented and has many achievements to his credit. How Popular are Internet and Google in 1996 when he won the talent show for Meri Awaz Suno which was famous and broad cast all over India on television channel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indian national Newspapers like to sell their stuff based on political news . We are discussing about talent here. Wiki needs to introduce people of talent instead of repeating something already on the net. His contribution to music in Kerala is remarkable.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> He is a well known singer in Kerala. Google hits on him will be far and few. But that doesn't mean malayalam and local newspapers don't cover him. The Hindu is one of the major South Indian newspaper which keeps a good online record. Also local TV networks cover him regularly. He has worked with great music directors such as Ravindran and Illayaraja. Some of his music albums are all the rage in college campuses throughout Kerala. At the time of his victory in Meri Awaz Suno, he was interviewed by every TV network in South India. But as 10 years have passed since then, not many people will remeber him. One of the users is hell bent on destroying his credibility, I am sorry for him --<a href="../../../1/3/0/User%7E130.216.191.84.html" title="User:130.216.191.84">130.216.191.84</a> 23:07, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>From all the above mentioned information, the following points are enough to merit his article here 1) He has sung in many Films (only some are indicated in Internet as database is old) . Heard he sang in a new film of for Ramesh Narayan. Saw the news from papers. So he is a playback singer and active. He is a life member of M.A.C.T.A (Malayalam Cine Technicians Association) 2) His songs appear on Television channels almost every day! 3) He has two Awards of National repute 4) He has a music blog which is live proof of his activity in music field and his blog is listed the fifth in it's category in India <a href="http://www.indianbloggers.com/category/music/" class="external text" title="http://www.indianbloggers.com/category/music/" rel="nofollow">Indian Bloggers Website</a>and touching 6000 hits in a span of 3 months! 5) He has participated in International Youth Exchange programs two times. 6) He propagates the use of free software in Kerala. 7) He is an eminent lecturer who teaches Electronics which makes him special and different from ordinary singers All these show that he is a multifaceted personality. I found even lesser mortals having articles written on them. Whay have you not gone after such people? So let there be sanity. Let talent courtesy and vanity get it's worth.

<li><b>Pradip Somasundaran</b> is indeed a playback singer. The (auto)bio that appears in this article is almost accurate. I know this man very well and his brother was a colleague of mine. His "Meri Awaz Suno" feat was front-page news for almost all dailies in Kerala at that time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pradip Somasundaran is not very famous nowadays. As you can see in the article, he was on a roll till 1998; limelight has eluded him since then.</p>
<p>That said, let me admit that I am a bit surprised seeing him in Wikipedia. As I said, he is not that famous; yet he is not an ordinary keralite either. Let me say, for a brief period of time, he was a somewhat-well-known guy.</p>
<p>Overall a very funny situation..is he famous enough to get into wiki? Mind you, to an ordinary (non-netizen) keralite he will be more famous than wiki!</p>
<p>However, I think this article should be deleted. Reason? Take a look at it's history. A pathetic attempt for fame and publicity.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Indian wikipedians are not Gods and they are not the masters of wikipedia. Also any wikipedian who lives outside Kerala and has not been in Kerala for more than two years cannot claim to be an authority in this matter. Some contentions like "he was famous then" "he is not famous now' are very immature in the case of celebrities in music, acting, film direction etc. Oce a celebrity is always a celebrity. here there is no need for any concern as somasundaram is very active in giving live shows, T.V programs all across kerala. I even saw his program on Kairali channel yesterday and on doordarshan almost every day! His program Anjali on Amrita T.V is still continuing after 2 years and has won two state level awards. Hence the knowledge of our admins who are away in far places from kerala and those who do not watch television but go on typing on their keyboards though very sincere in this matter is mostly half baked and outdated. So they cannot be blamed.</li>
</ul>

<dd>He is also a regular participant in Swaralaya Music &amp; Dance festival at Palakkad and is performing there this october too! Fact can be cheched from their website <a href="http://www.swaralayapalakkad.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.swaralayapalakkad.com/" rel="nofollow">Swaralaya</a>. He is also to perform for a fund raising program by the Malayalam Film fraternity in Cochin. So who says that he is not active in the first place? Such reckless opinions are only personal opinions and not the truth. If he were not famous now he would not be invited again and again for programs all over Kerala. SO this amounts to deliberate attemopt to defame the singer and is serious matter. The fact is that any famous artist has highs and lows in his career. Right from Michael Jackson to Whitney Houston and the great Rafi in India had bad phases. Jackson and houston have had long times when they have not had any new releases. So will our wiki admin's delete their pages? This is rubbish and immature thinking. If it were such we would have to remove articles of all such people and dead people since their current contributions are nil! Once a person attains celebrity status it is for his whole life. He or she stays in the heart of millions of fans for a particular reason which is for keeps. They may sway between active and passive phases of their career. Anyway this guy is only around 40! He also seems to have up's and downs. But seems quite stable with so many albums awards and achievements to credit. What the hell more are you looking at here? The article also says that he sang for "Art of Living International" which is indeed prestigious if true. Some articles mentioned above like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_sana" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_sana" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_sana</a> are stupid in that they do not have anything on the person concerned. He has no album to credit and also their is no award list or any material that would be termed suitable for his qualification for a wiki article. "Many believe that Amit Sana is a superior singer to Abhijeet and that he only won due to female support but Amit remains great friends with Abhijeet they made a special appearance in season 2 of Indian Idol where he and Abhijeet along with Aditi Paul performed a song together" These are the wordings used in this article! The admin's who are keeping their eyes shut to such rubbish hearsay should hang their heads in shame! So who put it there and why there is no hue and cry about this one??? He has not even won an award. He is just a runner up! There are so many singers in Kerala like Manjari, gayatri who have only 100 and 6 hits in google! So does that mean that they are not celebrities or playback singers&#160;? They are State Government award winners. It is foolish to says that a playback singer has to have 1000 google hits. Who made this rule? Gayatri and manjari are the leading female singers in Malayalam. If an some wiki admin who lives abroad did not hear about them does it mean that they do not exist?</dd>
<dd>Shame on such Admins. They should be reported to the arbitration committe for such immature comments and shouls not be allowed to function as Admins.</dd>
<dd>As for me somasundaran (even if he started the article which i doubt as the first version was like some of his fans one trying to have some fun) satisfies all requirements of having an article here in wiki <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people)" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people)" rel="nofollow">WP:BIO Notability</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(music)" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(music)" rel="nofollow">WP:MUSIC</a> Both the above norms more than satisfied in his case.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Musicians and ensembles There are a lot of bands, singers and other musicians and musical ensembles with articles in the Wikipedia (see Category:Musicians).</p>
<ul>
<li>A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, DJ, musical theatre group, etc.) is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Has had a charted hit on any national music chart, in at least one large or medium-sized country.[1]</li>
</ul>
<p>Has had a record certified gold or higher in at least one large or medium-sized country.</p>
<ul>
<li>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country,[1] reported in notable and verifiable sources.</li>
<li>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</li>
<li>Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...).</li>
<li>Has won a major music award.</li>
<li>Has won or placed in a major music competition.</li>
<li>Has been the subject of a half hour or longer broadcast on a national radio network.(He is a graded Radio and T.V artist)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>He satisfies all the above requirements SO IS HIGHLY NOTABLE. So why have you put this article for deletion in the first place? So close this matter now. All other personal likes and dislikes like whether he was popular before, is popular now or will be in future, is nonsense as THERE ARE CLEAR GUIDELINES TO GUIDE US ON THIS. So all personal references like "I have not heard this guy", "he should have won all major competetions in India", etc. do not hold any ground at all.</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>WHETHER HE IS POPULAR NOW OR NOT IS NOT THE ISSUE HERE AS SOME PERSONS ARE DELIBERATELY TRYING TO SHIFT ATTENTION. THE ONLY ISSUE IS WHETHER HE SATISFIES ANY OF THE CRITERION AS PER WIKI NORMS.All other personal comments of what someone thinks on his poularity are to be ignored. There is no meter for poularity and this cannot be acertained mere google searches and by people who are away and are not living in kerala. Let this be decided by we who live here!</dd>

<p><br />
I think now some wikipedia users behave like this sender. <b>Coz i never heard abt Pradip so how can u say?</b> Don’t be behaving like this! <b>A real wiki pedia user who interested in music should know about all singers</b>. He is really a good singer. He is really multitalented like a Teacher in Electronics dept and a singer.</p>
<p>we can never compare him with Yesudas or MG Sreekumar. And <b>he is not a notable Play back singer</b>. <b>But he is a notable singer</b>. And <b>he deserved for this article</b>.</p>
<p><br />
<b>I never say to delete this article</b>.</p>

But need modification. I think there is no need of maximize the article with his all details. And <b>maximum try to minimize the article with necessary details.</b>

<p><b>Comment</b> Alpha Chimp. This is not an article about a Mozart or a Beethoven, only about a singer who now as seen from the info and various comments is notable through his awards and T.v programs. So even if there are socks they have been very informative and have countered vague arguments very well. So I think they can be excused.I think we should give the credit to Jyothis who has compiled the facts. Tintin I think this writeup is not too big. Have see many huge articles like here. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton" rel="nofollow">Eric Clapton</a>, and here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayachandran" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayachandran" rel="nofollow">Jayachandran</a>(which is more hearsay,over descriptive and not neutral. It also smacks of hero worship). Also since the credibility of this person was in question, Jyothis did the right thing by making the article more comprehensive, and wiki friendly.He has laid out only the facts and information about this singer who has been mis-understood by many wikipedians who are not in Kerala.After all this is our job, bringing out the truth and compelling the people who want such articles to be published to be more accurate. So now Admins please go after the Amit Sanas, Prof. Bindu's and such people. let the people who started this article heave a sigh of relief and improve upon it. Enough time has been spent already debating on this. Admin's take a decision now without going for the extra day.--<a href="../../../g/l/u/User%7EGluewhale_a099.html" title="User:Gluewhale">Gluewhale</a> 15:21, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You do not have any basic knowledge of wiki! You have made all silly references like 1) 1000 hits in google to be a playback singer 2) Close up Antakshari being a music talent show.</p>
<p><b>From your Quote</b> <b>"" *</b>Delete <b>the singer may have won the trophy but its not a trophy well known to other indians.

<p>This was your silly comment in the begening where you wanted this person to win all singing competetions in India (Are you his mentor?)</p>
<p>You said you have not heard him. What importance does this have here on this discussion. You might not have heard about many persons. That shows your ignorance and arrogance not knowledge.You do not have any proven competance in music to prove professional competence of this person. This has been already done by the people who gave him so many awards and made him sing in so many films, albums, T.V shows and live shows in India and abroad. This is not your job. Your job was to see whether the article satisfies wiki norms and you had no business to poke into competance and poularity polls. <b>YOU DID NOT DO YOUR JOB IMPARTIALLY AND WITH NEUTRALITY.</b> Thousands of malayalees including admins here know him and have heard him. Now you want to shut their voices by this last ditch futile attempt? There is also a complaint that you sent anonymous hate mails to the singer's blog and some nasty campaigns making this a personal war. We have proof that you sent personal invitation to other wikipedians from your page to help you in this hate campaign which is below the dignity of any wikipedian. You do not have any right to do so. Your actions speak for your sick mind!</p>

<p><b>This is a message to all Category:Kerala Wikipedians</b></p>
<p>I want your opinion on this particular person Pradip Somasundaran. He claims to be a famous singer in Kerala. Now being a Malayalee, I have not heard of this person before, so I wonder whether or not you have heard of him before and set this issue straight. If so, then please let your opinion be counted at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pradip Somasundaran. Please note that by voicing your opinion as a Malayalee/Keralite will add more weight to your words.</p>
<p>Many Thanks --Ageo020 21:42, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Hey PS Yes, you are right. I have not lived in Kerala in the past 2 years. That doesn't mean I am not familiar with it. Now Amrita TV is not a TV channel watched by the masses. They watch Surya, Asianet or Kairali. If you have been seen on this channel, it means to me in my biased opinion that you are not too famous to have an article in wikipedia. Also remember that there are many singers who have cut their own records. That doesn't mean they have to have an article too.</b></p>
<pre>
  Plus I am a frequent listener to malayalam film songs and I have certainly not heard of you. Do not waste your time ranting about whether the article should be deleted or not. Instead focus your energy on singing and becoming famous and then having someone else to have an article written about you. This letter may make you more angry, but I am sorry.

<p>I found these messages on your page and on the person impersonating as user pradipsomasundaran. These clearly show your immature dirty mind and illegal actions. <b>This also proves that all your comments are biased as you yourselves have admitted to this here! You have used abusive language with intent to disgrace defame and provocating a person.</b> If the real Pradip Somasundaran finds this out you will cut a very sorry figure for yourselves! This is enough to file a case against you in the arbitration section man!</p>
<p><b>Admins: Remove this person soon. He is a disgrace to wiki. He is just an editor(counter vandalism unit member?) and claimed to be an Admin with an Admin box on his page which was removed when some one reported this.</b> He also is a novice who started editing in March 2006 and yest behaves as if he is the owner of wiki.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The outcome of this this discussion will be decided on merit not your ego! After this is over your actions will be reported to the arbitration committe. Except you all the other people who have commented, including admins have behaved sensibly with reason and dignity.</b></p>
<p>All your silly arguments have been put to rest by many many of the people who commented here. Now that you do not have anything to say, rather than replying to the observations you become a mouth for some other admin and be a cry baby and say that "hey, all the supporters are fake!" You have not replied to the Amit Sana issue so far. Why are you showing double standards?" When you started spreading lies did you expect others to be quiet? Now you will tell that even the other admins are socks. This is a futile futile attempt again. Where were you all this time?</p>
<p><b>Let's stop trying to disprove the already proven celebrity status of one of the most talented young singers of kerala who still has a long way to go. No other singer in kerala sings so well in so many languages and so many styles! He does not have many film songs but he is not retired and is only around 40. He is also very active as a singer with many programs. There is nothing we or he can gain or loose in this unnessary debate. Let's show maturity. Enough material proof has been provided by many for his credibility. He satisfies more than one criterion for an article here.</b></p>
<p><b>Have you all editors and mods from kerala seen how many singers from malayalam have a decent page here? And we call ourselves malayalees??? Only K.J Yesudas has a terific page here in wiki standards. P. Jayachandran also is o.k. But none of the singers gave a good article here! Is it because they all do not have 1000 google hits? Time to stop this silly argument.</b> All the playback singers including kamukara, udayabhanu, unnimenon, venugopal, gayatri, jyotsna, rimi tomi, vidhu pratap, manjari who are loved and adored by lakhs of malayalees do not have a page here! Let pradip's page be an eye-opener to all those who want to take up this issue and make the section of malayalam playback singers strong. Why is it so that malayalees are the biggest "paras" to malayalees?(sorry this usage will be understood by malayalees only. Not in wiki dictionary) Let's all forget personal ego's and get to improving information on all the great playback singers in Malayalam instead of degrading them.

<p>It is quite sad to see such remarks, as you are tracking the IPs. Also, as I have stated above, I contribute to Malayalam Wikibooks.</p>

<p>Pradip is a well known singer of kerala.He has done many albums in malayalam.And one of the most commenting thing about him is i think no malayalee sings hindi songs as good as him. So there is no need for a deletion. [User:Tharanath R] 04:30, 5 August 2006</p>

<b>Request to the new editors (especially Jyothis and Gluewhale) who added their comments here</b> : Since you all seem very passionate about articles related to Kerala, I wonder whether you guys would like to hang around a little longer in Wikipedia, instead of disappearing the moment this AfD is over. There are not many articles about Kerala and even those which are, are mostly not in a good shape. We could do with a bit of help in improving the articles. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotice_board_for_India-related_topics_Kerala_a779.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notice board for India-related topics/Kerala">Kerala noticeboard</a>.

Thanks) <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> (<a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">talk</a>) 14:42, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b></p>
<p><b>I end my defense of this article by presenting a comprehensive list of verifiable documents above along with what has been presented by jyothis from various sites which PROVES BEYOND DOUBT that he is a very very notable guy. Not only a great singer of Kerala but a multifaceted talent who has spread his knowledge &amp; talent not only in Indian but also abroad. The Govt. of India has sent him two times abroad to Japan for his talents (we lesser mortals do not even have heard of such programs!). Other than the "Lata Mangeshkar Trophy" he has been honoured both in India and abroad two times, one by by the JCI with TOYI and other the Dubai Kairali Kalakendram for his contribution to music. He has won two awards in Kerala too for contribution to music. He also won an International talent competetion. He has done shows abroad and is still actively doing music shows, singing in films, singing in albums, singing in T.v programs, propagating linux, technology in India and abroad. Now what more do you want from this person?</b></p>

<p><b>This is just one of the hundreds of comments that I found on his blog today! If a person can find his blog from this article then it should be good enough! The hundreds of comments there prove his popularity as a singer. Kerala is a small state and people of his breed are rare.So he is one of our heroes! Now you decide whether to keep your ego's in tact or to keep this article! We cannot undo a person's contributions by just shouting foul 100 times. Thank you...I retire...from this defence for dignity and justice and hope justice and sanity prevails over false ego's!</b></p>
