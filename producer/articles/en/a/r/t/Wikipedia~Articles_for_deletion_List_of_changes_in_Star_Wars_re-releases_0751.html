<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 08:50, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Compared to lots of other star wars-related material in the encyclopedia, this stuff is somewhat culturually significant and is interesting to quite a few star wars fans, including the not-too-crazed. It's also relatively non-<a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a>-y in that it pulls a lot of related material together in a single article instead of spewing it to 20 separate articles. Alternative would be to disperse it into the articles about the individual films but I like the idea of centralizing it like this. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 09:19, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Wikipedia is also not a paper encyclopedia. The article is relatively neutral in tone, and is verfiable and referenced. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 10:34, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The argument this article is "relatively" not as a bad as others, is irrelevant to the nomination, as is the weak claim the article is "somewhat" culturally significant. WP is not paper, but it is also not an indiscriminate collection of everything. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 10:40, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I'm saying this list is not indiscriminate. It's info that I'd even hope to see in a paper encyclopedia that covered Star Wars in any depth. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 11:14, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While slightly crufty, considering the significance of <i>Star Wars</i> and the controversy that Lucas' tendency to reinvent his movies creates certainly makes this article worth keeping. Furthermore, as written, it's fairly close to being worth considering for Featured Article status. <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred">Caerwhine</small></a> 11:03, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per reasoning of others above. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_Treason_ae0c.html" title="User:Voice of Treason">Voice of Treason</a> 12:57, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Regardless of the intrinsic quality of the article, I feel that Star Wars/Lucas Wikipedia articles should have significance beyond the Star Wars community, whereas this article is by definition and in practice entirely inward-looking. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 13:51, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with the sentiment that Wikipedia articles should have significance beyond the Star Wars community, but that "community" is a tiny subset of "people have have seen the movies" or even "people who are fans of the movies". I think this article reaches well outside of the tiny subset that can reasonably be called the "Star Wars community". I'm not even in the largest of those groups mentioned (I've seen some of the SW movies but not all, I don't own any SW videos or merchandise, and I'm not remotely a SW fan) but I liked the article. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 21:24, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't say this article is uninteresting. I think it would find a more natural audience (including your good self) in a blog or a movie almanac. I'm not sure that it is appropriate for Wikipedia, or, for that matter, a paper encyclopedia. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 00:08, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I think the stuff in the article is appropriate for Wikipedia, given the depth of SW-related coverage that WP editors have already deemed appropriate without serious controversy. I have some minor reservations about the article existing as a separate article, as opposed to splitting out its contents to the articles about the individual films. But that's a matter of editorial discretion, and there's benefit to putting it all in one place like that. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 01:57, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is from a nuetral point of view, and provides information to many star wars fans, there is no reason to delete it.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Phr and Caerwine. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/y/User_talk%7EBryanG_f39b.html" title="User talk:BryanG">(talk)</a></sup> 16:49, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, it's NPOV, and a pretty good article. Worth keeping if only as a cruft dam. --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><font color="green">des</font><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">at</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat">talk. o.o;;</a></small> 22:06, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b> into the respective movie articles; information on the various versions of the SW movies (which this really is) is good to have. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 23:53, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, this is a highly useful and informative article. Giving its position on Wikipedia, a casual fan could find out what he was looking for without having to probe all varieties of Star Wars fansites with less-than-reputable sources. 24.161.191.234 08:32, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Interesting, well-written, and encyclopedic. I remember when the re-release came out in 1997, and the changes to the trilogy got a LOT of mainstream press, so this is <i>not</i> just something only hardcore fans care about. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 12:26, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Thorough and necessary for fans - I don't know of another source that has all this information in one place. <font color="darkblue"><b>Baseball,Baby!</b></font> <font color="red"><sup><i>balls</i></sup></font><font color="darkblue"><sup>•</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BaseballBaby_1aec.html" title="Special:Contributions/BaseballBaby"><font color="red"><sup><i>strikes</i></sup></font></a> 00:06, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The changes in the <i>Star Wars</i> series are a key part of the production history of the franchise. It's nowhere near featured article status - it's just an uncited list without much compelling prose, but it certainly doesn't deserve to be deleted. --<a href="../../../j/t/a/User%7EJtalledo_ca0a.html" title="User:Jtalledo">Jtalledo</a> <a href="../../../j/t/a/User_talk%7EJtalledo_8071.html" title="User talk:Jtalledo">(talk)</a> 18:46, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, What harm is there in keeping this article? I don't understand what the point would be of deleting it. It's useful and informational. People will complain about anything. I came here to find this information and it was greatly useful and appreciated. I was scratching my head in wonder as to why the article would be up for possible deletion. Please keep this online.</li>
