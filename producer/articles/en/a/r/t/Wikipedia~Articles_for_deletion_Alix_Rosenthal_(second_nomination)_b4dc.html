<li><b>Keep</b> Anyone who claims that this article is an ad in disguise or is in any way biased, please point out the words or phrases that give that appearance. Endorsements are verifiable facts and should not be deemed promotional content. Endorsements typically appear in nonpartisan voter guides, and they can further <i>or</i> hinder a candidate's success. An endorsement from an organization with which a voter disagrees, for example, is a reason for that voter <i>not</i> to vote for a candidate. Inclusion of endorsements conforms with the <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a> proposition. Although running for local public office does not confer notability by itself, when combined with a growing body of independent, verifiable information -- and yes, endorsements are a part of that -- notability emerges. And that's consistent with the <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a> proposition. Further, a Google search of this candidate yields about 15,800 results, and given that this particular name combination is not all that common, it's likely that most of these results refer to her. To say that a local political candidate can only attain notability <i>after</i> winning the election is just as inaccurate as saying that simply running for local public office confers notability.--<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterthedog_0768.html" title="User:Waterthedog">Waterthedog</a> 01:29, 23 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— <b>Note to closing admin</b>: <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterthedog_0768.html" title="User:Waterthedog">Waterthedog</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/t/User_talk%7EWaterthedog_dd27.html" title="User talk:Waterthedog">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Waterthedog_cb81.html" title="Special:Contributions/Waterthedog">contribs</a>) is the creator of the article that is the subject of this AfD.</small></li>

<li>I noticed that none of the generalized handwaving about notability made the slightest attempt to ACTUALLY establish any here, except the raw misleading Google count -- which turns out to be 199 unique hits. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:25, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I use <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a> proposition to support my position because, although it is still a proposal, it is much more specific and on point than <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and I think far superior to the vague notion of notability. But on that point, Rosenthal is a candidate for public office of a major city. True, any resident of the city can sign up to be a candidate, but those who run a serious campaign, win endorsements and gain the attention of the local news media become noteworthy candidates. There are all sorts of articles on Wikipedia on people who are only known to a particular locality. Candidates for important local public offices -- and city councils are important -- deserve attention. These politicians are poised to be the candidates of provincial/state and national offices of the future. Calton is right to point out the number of unique hits, which I neglected to check -- it was not an attempt to mislead.--<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterthedog_0768.html" title="User:Waterthedog">Waterthedog</a> 10:02, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Only if and when there is enough independent, verifiable information to write a non-stub article on a candidate should one be written." Accordingly, an article was written on the election and the article itself contains "enough independent, verifiable information" to write a non-stub article on the candidate.--<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterthedog_0768.html" title="User:Waterthedog">Waterthedog</a> 16:14, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Thanks for pointing that out, for I didn't properly understand exactly what is happening with this nomination. I do not think that a candidate for a local board (even in a large world-class city) is notable. Winning the election is maybe only 3/4 of what is needed to be notable in my humble opinion (except if there is something else to add to notability). As an someone more on the inclusionist side, I get frustrated when I see what appears to me to be renominations until an article gets deleted. That is not the case in this nomination.

<li><b>Delete</b> I have serious doubts that Ms Rosenthal would be notable even if she were to win, but that would depend on what people wrote about her then; what they're writing now is not the sort of reporting that's needed to justify an article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Let's not lose sight of what is ostensibly one of our common goals: to maintain a repository of verifiable, objective information. I'm not seeing the harm in creating articles for local political candidates so long as they are not libelous and are written in an unbiased way with independent, verifiable information. Not having articles of mayoral candidates and candidates of the legislative bodies of major cities is a loss for Wikipedia. The notability of Rosenthal is borderline, I admit. But if that's the only flaw, I fail to see need for deletion. The <i>integrity</i> if information is what is really important. And, yes, if a candidate is so obscure that relevant facts about the candidacy cannot be verified then that's a problem; that's not the case with Rosenthal. The fuzzy concept of notability and broad construct of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> should not be used to suppress articles about local political candidates.--<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterthedog_0768.html" title="User:Waterthedog">Waterthedog</a> 22:26, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The Rosenthal article is not an electioneering platform and it complies with the soapbox guideline because it is written in an unbiased manner. Articles about candidates for public office are not inherently biased. Again, if anyone finds wording that is biased, the remedy is to change wording, not delete the article.--<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterthedog_0768.html" title="User:Waterthedog">Waterthedog</a> 17:40, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Derex. I admit to Eusebeus that I do disagree with <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a>, which is only a <i>proposed</i> guideline. Application of that proposal, however, would call for merging this information into the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California%2C_election%2C_2006_d929.html" title="San Francisco, California, election, 2006">San Francisco, California, election, 2006</a> article, which does not currently include such detail on any of the candidates. Giving Rosenthal such preferential treatment in the general election article would be biased, but having this separate article isn't. It's not a campaign ad -- yes, of course it lists endorsements, but it mentions her failed attempts to get other endorsements, and also notes criticisms of her. If there's more negative material that should be added, feel free to add it. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 10:55, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: That's entirely illogical. We don't make exceptions to guidelines because another article would be only partially complete as a result. If this info were to go into the elections article, then it would only improve that article and perhaps even inspire someone to more fully define this particular election article beyond a simple listing of candidates and their campaign websites. Think it unbalances the article to do so? Put the NPOV tag at the top and say on the talk page that the other candidates need info added to better meet a neutral PoV. This article isn't submitted for deletion because of uncorrectable NPoV anyways; it fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and therefore more negative info isn't mandated (nor does that somehow neutralize an unbalanced sycophantic article). <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 17:12, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not arguing for an exception to a guideline -- as I pointed out, <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a> isn't a guideline. The simple issue is how we treat the verifiable information about Alix Rosenthal. Which approach best serves the readers:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(1) A general article about the election, with links to individual articles about the candidates (meaning that we keep the Rosenthal article);</dd>
<dd>(2) A general article about the election that includes information about each candidate in the level of detail of the article now proposed for deletion (meaning that we merge everything in this article into the general article, and provide comparable information about other candidates); or</dd>
<dd>(3) A general article about the election with little or no information about the candidates, so that most or all of the information in this article is expunged from Wikipedia (the consequence of deleting this article without merging).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I believe that alternative #1 is best. The general article will give people a quick idea of the parameters of the election. Those who want more detail about the race in a particular district can click through to the candidates' bios. Alternative #2 would drown the general article in an ocean of detail. Alternative #3 would excise from Wikipedia some verifiable information that many readers, in San Francisco and elsewhere, would like to have. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 18:16, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>You argue under the false pretense that verifiable info about Alix Rosenthal belongs on Wikipedia. This discussion is foremost whether Alix Rosenthal meets the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria for inclusion. That is the guideline you are ignoring (i.e., trying to find the exception to) in order to determine its appropriate context. Cart before the horse. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 18:42, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If by "false pretense" you mean that I'm making the assumption that the information belongs on Wikipedia, no, I'm expressly <i>not</i> making that as an assumption. I included my alternative #3 to accommodate the people who want the information expunged. I just think that people who want the information expunged should be clear about it. (Some people support deletion and merger of the article. If this article is deleted, the next step will be wrangling about whether to merge it into the general article about the election.) I reject alternative #3 because I believe that the public attention attendant upon a candidacy such as this one makes a person notable. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 20:33, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Incorrect. Starchild does not have a page and is an opponent of Rosenthal. Also note that left unsaid by you is that <b>none</b> of the other candidates (who are not also incumbents) have articles. Putting this article in a very tiny minority of 1, in that regard. Your comment only serves to highlight the fact that the Rosenthal article is an exception, not the rule. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 19:46, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I didn't say that <i>all</i> of Rosenthal's opponents had articles, but I should have clarified that I meant her more prominent opponent, <a href="../../../b/e/v/Bevan_Dufty_a5c9.html" title="Bevan Dufty">Bevan Dufty</a> (the incumbent). Bevan, along with all the other incumbents in the race (with one exception), have their own articles. The fact that the office itself including most of its members have articles lends support to the notability of the candidates running for those seats. I'm not saying that all candidates running for local public offices should have their own articles, but I am saying that these candidates should not be categorically barred from having articles either. Candidates who run serious campaigns, gain the attention of the local media and win endorsements of prominent local political organizations do meet the notability threshold of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.--<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterthedog_0768.html" title="User:Waterthedog">Waterthedog</a> 20:18, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
