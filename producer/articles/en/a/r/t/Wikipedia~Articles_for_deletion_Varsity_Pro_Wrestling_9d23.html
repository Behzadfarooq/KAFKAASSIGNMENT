The anon has taken issue to this article and wants its deletion (I'm filing this AfD on the anon's behalf), believing it to be non-notable. The article itself doesn't have much sourcing, and it doesn't have any of the independent sources I'd expect to demonstrate notability. I don't know too much about this subject, though. I'm starting this AfD both because there has been a serious request (which to me is not worth rejecting out of hand) for the article's deletion, and because once the relevant arguments for keep/delete come out, hopefully the dispute between the anon and Paulley should calm down somewhat. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 17:06, 31 January 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</p>

<dd><b>Speedy/Strong Keep</b>: i wasnt really a disput cus i have never talked to this anon user before. Anyway as for the article yes some more sourcing is required and i am in the mist of doing that... the promotion its self is a notable pro wrestling school bringing in national and international stars alike including <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Sopp_8853.html" title="Monty Sopp">Billy Gunn</a> (who made his first UK indy appearance with the promotion and made a second tour last year) and now are set to bring in <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Japan_Pro_Wrestling_3424.html" title="All Japan Pro Wrestling">All Japan Pro Wrestling</a> star Suwama (<a href="http://www.1stopwrestling.co.uk/view.php?ArtID=2664" class="external text" title="http://www.1stopwrestling.co.uk/view.php?ArtID=2664" rel="nofollow">recent newspost here</a>). The actual promotion was apart of the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution_British_Wrestling_9696.html" title="Revolution British Wrestling">Revolution British Wrestling</a> territory system as RBW Southwest until RBW closed and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_UK_Kid_6907.html" title="The UK Kid">The UK Kid</a> turned the promotion into his own school. --- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulley_2f3a.html" title="User:Paulley">Paulley</a>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Anyone with money and a wrestling promotion can hire an international wrestler, it doesn't make the promotion notable. There's no independent coverage, the sources are basically press releases posted on UK wrestling news and rumour sites. There's no non-trivial coverage. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 21:46, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The promotion is a split off of a notable territory system... as is a highly regarded pro wrestling school... hiring international talent isnt exactly non-notable esspecially if your bring over highly regarded stars into the country professionally for the first time. Their really is some bias against promotions and wrestlers of the UK on this site... i can list loads of non notable, poorly written American promotions that seem to hang around -- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulley_2f3a.html" title="User:Paulley">Paulley</a>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Why is it notable? If it's notable, provide sources to show that. Excuse me for not simply accepting your word that is is notable, but I think you should know Wikipedia doesn't work that way. Ditto for highly regarded, you need to cite sources to show that. As for your accusation of anti-UK bias, incorrect. I'm from the UK, and know that VPW tend to run shows in one area of the country that aren't particularly notable, correct me if I'm wrong didn't the Billy Gunn show draw about 120 fans? That isn't a criticism as I know how the UK wrestling scene struggles, but I'm more than happy to&#160;!vote (and have done so in the past) for American promotions that are of similar size. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 23:33, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry having a bit of a bad day.. just a little annoyed that this only came up because an anon user was sending personal attacks to my user page all afternoon. Though it has infact caused me and other users too improved the page alot... im all for referencing and such these days (i tend to do that more now than i do adding info). Anyway RBW's territory system though short lived did cover the whole of England (which is notable, cus the last time that happend was Joint Promotions which was again short lived after management changes) this is the history of the South West territory that has numorous <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Varsity+Pro+Wrestling%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Varsity+Pro+Wrestling%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">hits on google (just under its current name)</a>, and has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Varsity_Pro_Wrestling&amp;limit=999" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Varsity_Pro_Wrestling&amp;limit=999" rel="nofollow">several internal links from other wikipedia articles</a>. I just think this article is in a lot better shape than dozens of other promotion articles on wikipedia and has been referenced to the best of my abillity... and if that's not enough then there isnt much else i can do.. ---<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulley_2f3a.html" title="User:Paulley">Paulley</a> 01:12, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Sources have improved, but there is still a complete lack of newspaper articles. That would fit with the absence of hits in Google News that are later than 2005. A poster above claims that www.1stopwrestling.co.uk is anti-wrestling, but I don't believe that's the case. I think it's a general site for wrestling info, though as a self-published web site, it wouldn't be classed as a reliable source for factual issues. I agree with <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">User:One Night In Hackney</a> that notability remains to be shown. The wrestlepedia link doesn't work. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 14:25, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmm.. i can think of only one newspaper the this may have appeared and that would be The UK's Daily Star paper that has a wrestling section on sundays (i think).. im sure the Billy Gunn appearances would have been mentioned. I will see if i can find some online transcrips or something though that is a long shot... a very much doubt i will be able to find anything though... its not like i know people that archeive papers or anything lol! --- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulley_2f3a.html" title="User:Paulley">Paulley</a></dd>
