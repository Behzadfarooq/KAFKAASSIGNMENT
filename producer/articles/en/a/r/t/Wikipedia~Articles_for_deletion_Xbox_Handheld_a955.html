<dd><b>Comment</b> All the article says now is that Microsoft is working on designing a Xbox handheld, as claimed by one writer. That's not enough for an article, and its still crystalballism - Microsoft must have dozens of major R&amp;D projects going on, many of which probably won't see actual public release. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:35, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - While it has been confirmed that they're working on a handheld Xbox, there's no telling that it's going to be called Xbox Handheld, no telling when it's going to be released, indeed no telling if it's going to be released, as company plans can, and do, change.

<li>It's still has to be almost certain to happen.

<li><b>Delete and Page Protect</b>, even with the new sourcing. It's still total speculation and might not even be in the alpha stages of development. I doubt it'll simply be called the <i>Xbox Handheld</i> and it could be that Microsoft cancels it because right now the only information we've got is from someone who's already left Microsoft over a year ago.

<li><b>Comment</b> I still think that the article should be kept as a stub, but I have added the information (and sources) to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360#Portable|Xbox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360#Portable|Xbox" rel="nofollow">360 page</a>. If and when Microsoft officially announces the portable, we can split it off. <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfomanager_4c30.html" title="User:Infomanager">Infomanager</a> 23:10, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It has nothing to do with the 360, don't place it into that article. <a href="../../../m/e/o/User%7EMeow07_e4a1.html" title="User:Meow07">Meow07</a> 01:24, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article, besides having unencyclopedic content (are we going to have articles on every single R&amp;D project by a major corporation, most of which will never see public release?) is <b><u>not verified</u></b>. A single journalist's claims based in "insider sources" is not sufficient - not multiple, not solidly reliable, not verifiable. Furthermore, the article is misleading to say that Microsoft has "confirmed" this story. Microsoft has called the claims "highly speculative"<a href="http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=52739" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=52739" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 13:43, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Even in its reduced form the article is reporting that one source has speculated that Microsoft is working on this product. Until we have confirmation (not speculation) that it is being worked on it cannot warrant an article. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 14:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Completely speculative, also <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 03:06, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Not just is WP:NOT a crystal ball, but there's barely even any speculation. A couple of articles and an unofficial mock-up do not equate to a Microsoft handheld. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 12:42, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
