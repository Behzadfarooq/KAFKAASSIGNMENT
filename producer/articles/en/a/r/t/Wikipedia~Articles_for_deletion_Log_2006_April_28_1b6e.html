<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. While there were more delete than keep votes, most were simply "per nom", and what is and what is not notable is not established by us, so saying "only gone for 42 hours" and "kids go missing all the time" completely misses the point. If news sources (and thus a large number of people) found it notable, then it meets our standards. (Aside: not finding it in Google News and a lack of current event tagging should not be surprising for an incident that happened in 2003). The article provides multiple references to backup the notability claim, and thus, should be kept. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 00:41, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tried to prod, but was reverted so afd'ed as a result of this. Wikipedia is not a newssource, my opinion is that this is more or less a regional event, the person in question is not notable, and as such should be deleted. She was only gone for 42 hours, and like it or not, kids go missing all the time, many of whom are kidnapped. <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 23:18, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The character is obviously real, which can be confirmed from the book. The little girl is real: the source quoted in the article is an interview with <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._K._Rowling_604a.html" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> in which she speaks of having met the little girl. If you want to go on record as claiming that JKR perpetrated a cruel hoax you had better find better reasons than "I think it's a hoax". I ckecked the website for the source—Maclean's in Canada—and they appear not to have <i>any</i> archives for 2000: this is why sites like <a href="http://www.quick-quote-quill.org" class="external text" title="http://www.quick-quote-quill.org" rel="nofollow">Quick Quotes Quill</a> exist: to preserve ephemeral stuff like this for when it has expired (this is even assuming that this article was ever published online: if it was paper-only, where are you going to look?).

<dd><b>comment</b> Nobody said that J.K. Rowling perpetrated a hoax. Rowling wrote a book with a character named Natalie McDonald. Other people ascribed a story to this character that may not be factual. I still have yet to see any confirmation beyond fan sites. J.K.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think it's a good idea to keep articles based on the <i>possibility</i> of future notability, but if we're pretty sure she's about to come out with an album on a major label, then I think it makes more sense to keep the article than to delete and recreate later.

<li><b>Delete</b> - nn - but I truly fail to see the logic in redirecting this to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catgirl.html" title="Catgirl">Catgirl</a>. A catgirl is a girl with catlike features; they're common in pop culture, whereas male counterparts are nearly unheard of. We could move <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catgirl.html" title="Catgirl">Catgirl</a> to Cat-person and redirect both "Catgirl" and "Catboy" to that page, but, frankly, I think a better solution is just to out-and-out delete Catboy. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 05:46, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to clarify, I don't think any of us "redirect" voters are suggesting that Simon Smedley has anything to do with catgirls. We're saying that catboy should redirect to catgirl because catboys -- that is, male humans with cat ears and tails -- <i>are</i> relevant to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catgirl.html" title="Catgirl">catgirl</a>. If you look at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catgirl.html" title="Catgirl">catgirl</a>, you'll see that it does discuss catboys, in the fourth paragraph. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 04:13, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> While I appreciate the effort to merge the story into <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_abduction.html" title="Child abduction">Child abduction</a>, I do believe it is somewhat out of place in that article. I also can't help thinking that if this had happened to two <i>American</i> sisters, we'd have articles on both girls, another on the legal issues, one on their parents, and a complete timeline of all events. (See <a href="../../../j/o/r/Joran_van_der_Sloot_4b5f.html" title="Joran van der Sloot">Joran van der Sloot</a> for an example of the detailed treatment stories in the US news get here.) David Sneek 17:36, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> First, there was no abuse, and second, the girls were nabbed by their father who under Iranian law recognized he had legal custody. International child abduction is not unusual. The article mentions that the US State Department's Office of Children's Issues counted 904 abduction cases by U.S.-based parents in 2003.<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/12/06/MNG0S3HNAE1.DTL" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/12/06/MNG0S3HNAE1.DTL" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> Are those cases encyclopedic too?

<li><b>Comment</b> Obviously it is not the abduction that is notable, but the events that followed it. Two minors lived inside an embassy for over five months causing all kinds of diplomatic and legal problems, their case got intense media coverage in Belgium (and made the news in many other countries too), two foreign ministers and a prime minister had to get involved to find a solution: that is what makes it very different from other abductions. David Sneek 18:53, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, I dont know that the article isn't encyclopedic as one editor stated -- as noted in another, the situation was news in Belgium "for months." That alone qualifies the situation, I think, for some encyclopedic treatment. As I note in my comments at <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_abduction.html" title="Child abduction">Child abduction</a>, however, the case isn't that signifcant in terms of child abduction or international child abduction. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonels_d4b8.html" title="User:Ronels"><font color="blue"><b>Ronels</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonels_a55e.html" title="User talk:Ronels"><b><font color="red">talk</font></b></a></sup> 22:27, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

I also placed a different version in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_abduction.html#Belgium_embassy_girls" title="Child abduction">Child_abduction#Belgium_embassy_girls</a> on an earlier date. I do not know who created the artickle <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pourhashemi_sisters.html" title="Pourhashemi sisters">Pourhashemi sisters</a>. --Belginusanl 20:44, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>,I believe we are notable considering we are the biggest successful DS Online Clan as well as one of the first(not the first). -ptfreak</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,I think 600 members is considered notable. We would just like to get the recognition we deserve as possibly the largest Nintendo DS clan on the internet. -N64BOY39</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,I personally see the Blue Diamond Clan as one of the best video game clans and most succesful of all time. There should be no reason for deleting an article on one of the the greatest and most successful clans.If you do not belief us check us out. bdc.clan.pro</li>
</ul>
<p>- golferwerd</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>,I personally believe that there is no point in having this article here, as it was purely created to advertise their clan. Also, it is just a Wifi DS Clan. Maybe the best (in golferwerd's opinion [but not mine]), it's just a Wifi DS Clan. You could hardly get a clan to be any smaller and specific yet be of any importance.</li>
</ul>
<p>- James Vanderbilt</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>,The Blue Diamond Clan may seem unimportant to those people who do not play DS Wifi games, but the importance of articles is relative. To people involved in the Nintendo gaming community, this article holds value. Therefore, it should not be deleted. - Lynn</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,I dare you to find another DS Wifi Clan that is:</li>
</ul>
<p>1. More Populated and 2. More Successful than the BDC. This Webpage should stay on because the BDC is the best DS Wifi clan out there. The BDC has a unique arengement of people and each and very visit to the BDC is always fun. There is always something to do there be it games or talk about random stuff. All the other DS Wifi clans have already collapsed but the BDC is as strong as ever. Also, commiting suicide does not make a clan notable. Just.....dangerous. Again, digg.com must have found the BDC notable because the gave the BDC a 10, but its just only the perfect score right? ~Crazyforkillua[BDC's Sheik Smasher Expert]</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>,The clan is large, and still growing, showing great potential. I can see why one may not want every single clan to write an article, but this clan is very successful. As for it not being notable, like was said, if you personally don't care about online gaming, then you probably wouldn't think is was noteworthy, but that's an opinion. Anyone interested in online gaming may find it interesting. Also, I didn't find this article to be an advertisement any more than any other Wiki article that has a link to the source. Anyway, why would one advertise on Wikipedia instead of a site more heavily frequented by video gamers? -Thorn</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,BDC is the biggest WiFi clan on the internet. Period. Also the most successful. And quote from the top of this page "Your continued donations keep Wikipedia running!" So, how does it hurt Wiki to have MORE information? Explain that to me. -Nintendofankid</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,BDC is one of the best clans I have ever been in. I have been in tons of clans before for different reasons, but this clan actually... How you say it touched me. (Not like that pervs &lt;_&lt;) Anyway without this clan... I don't know maybe I wouldn't be here. This clan is just more than a ds clan to some, but a part of some peoples lives. Before some other person comes and flames that last sentence I just said I would like to say... I know it may seem nerdish or whatever you people say is wierd and not common to you. Just remeber that a person is a person no matter what. Plus I'm going off topic and just probably blabbing stuff out, so I would like you to remeber that BDC is more than a clan, but more like a family - Zuto</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I agree with Nintendofankid and Zuto - Bacon&amp;Eggs</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,the Blue Diamond Clan is the most successful and most notable Wi-fi clan out there. We have 600 members and if you call that unnotable then your opinion on here shouldn't matter, as you wouldn't know much about a wi-fi clan. You can go on the BDC to play games, or to just hang out and chat. And as Zuto said to some people the BDC is more then just a clan, to some it's family. It will be a serious injustice if you delete the Blue Diamond Clan article. After all, more articles mean more visitors for Wikipedia, which means more success. And that's what is wanted, right? ~ Joe, a.k.a JoeWise6</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,this clan is great. I joined the day I got Mario Kart DS. I came across this clan on gamefaqs. Someone was advertising so I joined. I expected it to be one of those "other clans" that usually dies because of non-active members. I thought to myself, "I'll just use this clan to make wi-fi friends to play on Mario Kart." Little did I know that this clan would take a piece of my heart with it. I am now very active and the clan is thriving is ways I didnt imagine. I love it so much I sneak on at school (shh). If you were to chose a wi-fi clan, chose BDC. I promise you that you WILL make friends and that you WILL have a great time. - abc123</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,as Lynn has stated, this article holds value to those involved. The Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection community is a relatively new community, with plenty of clans being created each day. The Blue Diamond Clan is among the oldest and is currently the most populated clan of this type. This article holds valuable information. If an article about the most popular clan of a certain online service is not valuable, then what is? This clan deserves an article, especially for being a quintessential Nintendo Wi-Fi Clan, and for being the apex of these clans in general. - Katie, a.k.a. "Valkyrie"</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,BDC is a threshold in Nintendo's growing online community. It has brought hundreds of Nintendo's fans together to meet and share everything from memories to funny videos. It's an online community where everyone knows everyone and where we stick together like a family. The goal of the article is not to advertise, but to inform, as does every other article on Wikipedia. BDC has pioneered and helped shape Nintendo's WiFi community, and is guaranteed to only expand and become more notable, especially when Nintendo Wii is released. I really hope BDC can keep its article, it means a lot to me. -Nick a.k.a. phoenix</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,I was SO bored until I found BDC. I always have someone to talk to or play against. And I'm sure people will appreciate this page as much as I appreciated the article on Digg. This shouldnt be deleted just because noone commited suicide or noone in this clan is famous. You guys call this an encyclpedia right? I think an article like this should be included in an encyclopedia. What harm did this article cause? I dont see anything wrong with this being here. -KopyKat I can see you</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,BDC is a clan I have become a part of. I didn't know anything about clans at the time I joined. But the friendly community sucked me right in. This is probably the NICEST, ONE OF THE MOST THRIVING, and SUCCESFUL clans I have seen compared to many others. I made so much friends in BDC and if you decided to delete this article you might be preventing many other people to have new good friends. And so what if no one commited suicide in the clan? What if Arnold effin Swartchinager isn't in here? That is not what makes a clan notable. What makes a clan notable (Preferably a wifi clan) is the community, challenge, and relationships. This clan ain't some clan that has any boundaries to join either unlike some clans. We came right from the start of DS wifi with a good history and you know what? That seems like a pretty long time for it to deserve an article. Thank you.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>,I don't have many friends at school... no good friends are in my class. I get picked on occasionally. What does this have to do with the BDC? I know that when I log on here I won't be picked on. I will be accepted for the person I am. The BDC is a part of me, and I'm sure others feel the same way. Please don't delete this article. - WiiMonkey</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,I agree with all you guys-Naruto</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,the Blue Diamond Clan should stay up because without it, the DarkSnipers Clan would have no real competitors! The Blue Diamond Clan is the inspiration that makes other clans want to try harder to be successful! The BDC (Blue Diamond Clan) is the root reason for other clans to exist... If the Blue Diamonds go down, then the entire Nintendo Wi-Fi clan community will have nothing to work towards unless another Clan is good enough to match the popularity of the BDC.</li>
</ul>
<p>BDC is to Nintendo, as E3 is to the Gaming Community in general! -Kurayamiblack(DSC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, this shouldn't be deleted. It is in no way an advertisement but a way for fellow gamers to come together and accomplish something greater. If we were advertising we would have only included our positives. We are a group of dedicated gamers who care a lot about each other and want a way to be able to remember ourselves for what we have done for each other. -Jermtastic</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the fact that more than 600 people have registered makes it somewhat noticeable. That so many members are protesting deletion proves just as much.</li>
</ul>
<p>Video games are considered "of note". Otherwhise, there wouldn't be nearly as many articles on them as presently exist. Small to medium sized communities are considered "of note". So is the internet. This is all three combined into one confusing myriad of a microcosm.</p>
<p>Personal value doesn't matter, but numbers do. And teacher tells me that 600 is a large one. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuper_Genus_33f8.html" title="User:Super Genus">Genus</a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This clan has helped me a LOT of times of when I was in need. So I would want to keep this site, even in times of trouble, we still were able to help ourselves. And for that, I would really appreciate it if you guys can keep this.- LJkaRma</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The clan seems to be growing at an alarming rate. Why take it off a growing website? It has become a part of my life, not just because of the games, but because you grow along with the site, and everyone on it. -Cyeo</li>

<p>This is a well-written article, but what damns it <i>prima facie</i> is the opening sentence: <b>The "Jesuit Ivy" is a nickname given to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a> in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.</b> So, basically, this article is about an institution's nickname. Can you imagine anyone writing a "Penn State" article this size, just because it happes to be the nickname of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_State_University_be4e.html" title="Pennsylvania State University">Pennsylvania State University</a>? This smacks of academic boosterism (<a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_academic_boosterism_a43b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid academic boosterism">which is not welcome on Wikipedia</a>); surely no one's contributed a thing to this article aside from BC students and affiliates.

<li>A note to the nom - probably would've been better to start a discussion on the talk page rather than propose scrapping the article in its entirety, as you said yourself it is a well-written article and I'd be hard-pressed to eliminate any of it when merged onto the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a> article, as there is no blantant academic boosterism, as you label it. Perhaps next time, try to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. Plus, your Penn State comparison is a bit off, as there is a story behind the name "Jesuit Ivy". Had there been a separate article entitled "BC", your comparison would've been right on point. <font color="green">Hoopydink</font> 09:06, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's a story behind lots of nicknames. We don't have separate articles for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Manson_e590.html" title="Marilyn Manson">Marilyn Manson</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Warner_de66.html" title="Brian Warner">Brian Warner</a>, do we? No blatant boosterism? Calling youself <i>the X Ivy</i>, as the nom alludes to, is booster pratice number one. Also, while I'm not assuming bad faith, I do notice a predominance of Boston-related edits, Mr. H, particularly for a certain <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_High_School_9ac2.html" title="Boston College High School">Boston College High School</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERaggaga_12ad.html" title="User:Raggaga">Raggaga</a> 18:51, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I believe that the proper comparison to BC being called a Jesuit Ivy would be <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_U_dd6b.html" title="The U">The U</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_University_of_Miami_a31b.html" title="The University of Miami">The University of Miami</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_U_dd6b.html" title="The U">The U</a> is a disambig page which leads to an article describing the story behind the nickname that has been conferred to the University of Miami. Since <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a> or the insular community did not create the name, but rather an outside source (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>), there is no boosterism. The article does provide reasoning behind the name. If there's a bias or err in judgement on my part being suggested, I'd refer you to the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_High_School_9ac2.html" title="Boston College High School">Boston College High School</a> article in question, as I'm probably the primary editor and take a look. You'll see that there are no <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a> or boosterism. It's written in respects to the NPOV policy (much like the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuit_Ivy_7d0c.html" title="Jesuit Ivy">Jesuit Ivy</a> article). Also, if you do check it out, why not stay a while and edit it a bit? <font color="green">Hoopydink</font> 04:05, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -Since this is not just a name for the college but of JFK's <i>actual speech</i>. I also think its significance goes further than BC, so it would be wrong to jsut merge it to the BC article. The Jesuit Ivy speech was an important turning point, addressing the status of Catholics in public life, Church-State politics (and Kennedy's own future as the first Catholic US president), the role of Catholic universities and their position relative to American higher education. Perhaps these issues, which are touched on in the present article, should be made more explicit. 216.236.252.235 18:09, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think it should be kept as a separate article since it's the name of the speech itself. Also the nominator's objection that it's academic boosterism doesnt really hold here. It's not like BC woke up and decided to call *itself* the "Jesuit Ivy." Kennedy did. --<a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESader07_1261.html" title="User:Sader07">Sader07</a> 06:07, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I think the boosterism problem is not so much in the actual nickname, but with having that nickname as a separate entry. Redirecting it and mentioning Kennedy's speech in its proper historical context in the BC entry would be just fine. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 06:25, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and add more context here. Most of this article would be pretty tangential in an article about Boston College itself. 216.227.122.37 05:03, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> The <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a> article is already too long and should probably be broken down into sub articles. -136.167.255.119 03:11, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per above... Also, adding a section in the BC article about specifically this nickname wouldn't really make sense in the main BC article. The speech is notable for BC and warrants a mention in the main article, but not as long of a mention as the Jesuit Ivy article is. The information in the Jesuit Ivy article is worthy to be kept in Wikipedia and doesn't belong in the main BC article; thus, it should be kept in a separate article. Moreover the article is very well written and it would be a shame to lose all that hard work. Also, many things would need to be removed such as the wikisource link and the excerpt from the actual speech. <a href="../../../p/s/a/User%7EPsantora_c464.html" title="User:Psantora">Paul</a><small><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Psantora_252c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Psantora">C</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../p/s/a/User_talk%7EPsantora_c626.html" title="User talk:Psantora">T</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Psantora&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">+</a></sub></small> 07:51, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Delete</s></b> Wikipedia should only consist of material that can be verified from some outside source, however obscure -- no outside source, no article. We should never consider how informative, well-written or interesting the content of any page is on its own terms. That is utterly immaterial in light of THE RULES. We should only stick to the narrowest possible interpretation of the THE RULES in all circumstances, without any exceptions for any reason whatsoever. All articles should be composed in the dryest, most soulless manner so that we can all pretend that they are written in a way that offers no point of view, even though all history has shown us that such is humanly impossible. We must ignore the examples of such utter trash as the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica and dozens like it, which included and continue to include POV from its writers and articles on obscure subjects, since we know that those encyclopedias never achieved any serious critical or popular recognition or excellence. Indeed, we must also be sure to insult and dismiss the value in any articles with which we personally disagree or dislike, because that helps wikipedia's reputation for lack of POV among its writers. Also, we should be especially sure to find reasons in the THE RULES to delete anything that's popular or identifiable with youth culture, political and economic conservatives or moderates, and/or anybody or anything not susceptible to being included among those subjects we would approve for our own intellectual consumption. Above all, we must NEVER, EVER allow anything into wikipedia that would not exist in a regular encyclopedia, as that would put wikipedia in danger of turning into something unique and distinct, which, as good Marxists like us know, is evil and selfish. We MUST DELETE this article and all others like it before young, impressionable minds begin to disregard THE RULES!!!! <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERiseAbove_b64c.html" title="User:RiseAbove">RiseAbove</a> 07:20, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That was a mistake. More to the point, the inclusion of one allegedly-yet-unverifiably popular internet video on Wikipedia does not open the door to every other video for which someone pops up and says "yeah, my mates and I have heard of it".

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>--I am unclear as to how this article is unverifiable. The question of "legitimate" verification requires resources that are not available to Internet phenomenon (a realm in which, one must be reminded, Wikipedia itself belongs). Further the very purpose--I believe--of Wikipedia is to allow verification by way of open source and access to information that is not readily available elsewhere (let us be reminded of articles like "Skateboard Tricks", and "turntabilism") and this certainly includes Internet media and other esoterica. If the issue is that the article belongs under a larger "tree"--as part of "internet phenomenon" as suggested above--than it is simply a question of information taxonomy. If there is a question of content (i.e. revision) than this is not cause for deletion it is a request for clarity. One is immediately struck with the strangeness of deleting an article that provides information about an object that is not only a member of the same media as Wikipedia but is created in its very same spirit. And as a final note on verification, one merely must do the most basic of web searches and find an easy and quick link to the video and from there scrutinize the article in view of its source. In terms of that which is forgettable (the issue of timeliness) much of what is available on Wikipedia that relates in any way to pop culture will be lost--some in quicker breaths than others--but this does not, nor should it, preclude inclusion. The very possibility that it may be forgotten is the very reason to include an article: We are the archivists of the Internet, and without cataloguing that which occurs--monumental or not--we may lose or forget what the internet is--or is meant to be--in addition to its waves and ripples, its own peculiar movements. The question of whether the thing is worthy of an article is foolish, this is an open source popularly edited source of information, this is thankfully not scrutinized by the academy (think of what would be lost on Wikipedia if it were, or what we could easily lose by continuing this line of argument). Further articles such as "Juggernaut Bitch" are meant for the specific searcher, such as the individual above who was researching "internet phenomenon". The inclusion of such articles keeps Wikipedia democratic, and though edited popularly, not populist. As to the idea that Wikipedia is not an exchange of information, this is fallacious. Wikipedia, being that it is made up of a series of editable documents, is nothing but an exchange of information that--depending upon the users' level of interest in participation--can either be a one or two way methodology of exchange. The very idea that the article is commonly accessed through google seems enough for it to stay afloat, but those opposed to its existence are more than welcome to edit it.--RevNet <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.215.145.160 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.215.145.160_5d44.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.215.145.160">contribs</a>) 02:19, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<p><i>Comment</i> I appreciate those of you on this page who are voting Keep, you do yourselves an intellectual honor. However, I don't think there are enough of us to compete with the sheer weight of the doctrinaire Wikipedia Inquisition that's watching to make sure there aren't any rules violations. They put up this new AfD about a week after the last AfD was consensus keep. If this one is keep, they'll put up another one in a few days. And again, and again. There's nothing stopping them from doing it as many times as it takes to get the page deleted. It's not a question of the rules, or decorum, or wikipedia's reputation, it's only about a certain, sad group of martinets which seeks to discredit anything which it does not approve of. So, rather than get into arguments with those same martinets, I advise you to save your effort. As Schopenhauer said: "The ability to think from one's own resources is the prerogative of the few. The rest are guided by authority and example." That's a fact of human existence that we simply cannot change, no matter how rational, clever or outright true our arguments are. And yes, for those haters voting delete, I think The Juggernaut Bitch is brilliant AND I just quoted Schopenhauer. Wrap your ivory tower minds around that -- that is, if you even know who Schopenhauer is. If I ever meet any of you in real life, I will be sure to hit you with your own pimp.

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> The creed of summarizing that which has been previously published by reliable and reputable sources is a fair guideline for an enyclopedia, in general, to follow. The obstinate adherence to it, in open hostility towards common sense and the will to inform, is the act of an obsessive compulsive and a philistine. Unfortunately for the authoritarians behind this grand inquisition, knowledge is an unruly beast and the scope of notable sociological phenomena far exceeds what spills down into the neat compartments of academic journals and "reputable" (whoever's presuming to define this dubious term for the rest of us) sources. As has been pointed out above, the nature of internet memes prevents their notability being "verified", as defined by the martinets, in the same easy manner as more traditional subjects. Of course, all of the information on this page is verifiable by watching the video, which the million or so people who have viewed it (as recorded by google and youtube statistics) will be happy to attest to. But to a certain kind of blinder-sporting absolutist, the very idea of accepting such wildly unruly data as evidence is anathema. Unfortunately, these people are often in a position to make the rest of us suffer. Is it the mission of an encyclopedia to hold fast to an arbitrary rule of content as a public exercise in intractibilty? Or is it the mission of an enyclopedia to educate, enlighten, and disseminate? Are we to sacrifice valuable data which a mass of people derive use and benefit from, because of the inability of a few to adapt to a world where information does not always make itself known through state approved channels? To those who support deleting this page because of its alleged "unverifiability": the forest you're looking for is over there, right behind those trees. Spotlessmind 20:51, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>-Wikipedia, as an encyclopedia, is intended as a repository of all subjects of any notability.</dd>
<dd>-By the guidlines you so literally cite, which apparently decline to recognize tracking and usage statistics as a valid source, *no* internet memes may qualify for submission to wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>-Internet memes can achieve, and have achieved, notability.</dd>
<dd>So we have a problem. And we have two choices: we can censor information so that Wikipedia delineates only that body of knowledge fortunate enough to have been reproduced through channels which a few self-appointed arbiters of knowledge artifically designate as "acceptable". OR: We can choose not to carve large chunks out of the social and historical record for irrational and bureaucratic purposes, and admit that RULES are an imperfect contrivance, subject to constant scrutiny, revision, and exception, and that they *do not apply* to all things at all times. Are you saying you are unwilling to allow basic common sense, practicality, efficacy, and the evolution of informational transmission, to supercede THE RULES on an individual, merited basis, without another RULE explicitly stating that this may be done? If this is so, then I have to ask, and I ask this non-rhetorically and in all sincerity: of what benefit are you? Spotlessmind 02:52, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Which is where we have a problem; namely, that there are no agreed guidelines on how much of an internet presence a 'meme' needs before it warrants its own article. At the moment, everything seems to be getting funnelled into <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_memes.html" title="Internet memes">internet memes</a>, which is hardly an ideal situation. But here I am, crossing the boundaries of what I've said above. This isn't the place for this discussion. It is a place where the <i>outcome</i> of such discussion, as and when it takes place, is required. I do think you're getting a bit hyperbolic here, excluding (what is an admittedly minor manifestation of) this internet meme from Wikipedia at the present time is <i>not</i> "carv[ing] large chunks out of the social and historical record". <small>—<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorge_ce73.html" title="User:Porge">porg</a><a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorge_Esperanza_cfdf.html" title="User:Porge/Esperanza"><font color="green">es</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../p/o/r/User_talk%7EPorge_e2a2.html" title="User talk:Porge">talk</a>)</sub></small> 03:06, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not hyperbole, it's extrapolating to a logical extreme. The argument to me is not about this page, specifically, but what this page represents, and the idea that there are now, and will continue to be even more, subjects of note on the internet that must and can be verified differently from Plato's Republic or the Battle of Antioch. If this page is impermissible, then there are a LARGE number of Wiki pages that must also be so. Spotlessmind 04:24, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No kidding. Spotlessmind, I see you're new here. Please keep in mind that Wikipedia is not everything you want it to be.

<dd>Melchoir, I see you confer length of association with unwarranted moral authority. Please keep in mind that if I were interested in turning Wikipedia into everything I want it to be, I would be campaigning for the comprehensive inclusion of a porn star database with extensive photo and screen capture galleries. If you are interested in removing from Wikipedia things of an undocumented nature, then I suggest and wholly support your finding such a thing. In the meantime, feel free to click on the link at the bottom of the article, where you will be directed to a page documenting the existence of one "Juggernaut, bitch!" video. Spotlessmind 02:40, 30 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><i>Moral</i> authority? How ridiculous. I'm not saying the article is <i>bad</i>; I'm saying it doesn't belong here. As for the Google video page, I've seen it, and all it says is "The Juggernaut!!!". There is nothing that does or could support this or any encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 05:02, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Melchior, you could simply Google "The Juggernaut Bitch." You will find that the results include not only numerous pages leading to the video, but also a listing for the <i>wikipedia article itself</i> at around number 5 or 6 on the list. But yet, somehow this page is not notable enough to remain on wikipedia. Spotlessmind is absolutely right.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Most of those Google results are of either people on various forums and personal blogs (apparently neither format is criterion for notability and/or verification for an article on an internet meme...go figure.) quoting lines from the film, or mirrors of the film itself. If this film was not notable, I doubt it would have that many people quoting lines from it or hosting it on other servers for other people to see. The only things we have for verfication and reliable sources are the link to the MySpace account of co-creator Xavier Nazario (where he discusses the video, and where people who have seen the video posted how much they enjoyed it), and the video itself. Seriously, what more does an article of this nature need? It's an article on an internet meme, not an article on some groundbreaking scientific research project. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarNeptune_05e2.html" title="User:StarNeptune">StarNeptune</a> 15:13, 30 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, notability standards in all categories require nontrivial sources independent of the subject, and blogs and personal websites are never reliable. Neither of the links supports the original research going on in this article. Articles on all topics are held to the same standards; it would be ridiculous to lower the bar for memes just because you want more of them to have articles. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 21:12, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Can the author vote on this? I rewrote the article because Porges was no help at all. I'm a newbie and a serious contestant for the florida house seat. I have kept the article to state only facts and cut out everything Porges couldn't deal with. I had to resubmit it because he deleted the 45 minutes worth of work I put into the first one so i couldn't go in and 'edit' it. If you all get so hung up on 'self authored' articles you are going to create an environment that will encourage people to lie about their identify when they write articles here.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). <i>Four</i> options are on the table, keep as is, merge with a more general list, convert into a category, or just delete. Merging into a more general list probably means annotating the entries which use the DVD-9 format (and I cannot be bothered to do that now, but if anyone thinks that is a good idea, go ahead). Conversion to category would mean losing the redlinked entries until we get articles on them. With no consensus for any of the four options, I will default this to the outright "keep" result without prejudice against a relisting later. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:37, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> I know of many people whom this list would help! Read the updated/expanded list introduction to see why it is relevant. This info is made more useful because PS2 games disk formats are NEVER provided by Sony or the game makers (though CD-based games can USUALLY be identified in stores since they often display the special CD logo on back). PS2 lasers are by far the most common failure on the system. Since the dense DVD-9 format requires dual-layer focusing and has only been in use since 2003, these disks have common read errors when switching layers. This list is a great complement to the extensive PS2 CD-ROM game list created 6 months ago <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_PlayStation_2_CD-ROM_games_fe07.html" title="List of PlayStation 2 CD-ROM games">List_of_PlayStation_2_CD-ROM_games</a> -- <a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory77_2c49.html" title="User:Rory77">Rory77</a> 08:21, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Bloated Response</b> This is not useless information, but I can see I won't convince any of you serial-information-destroyers of this. The fact that we have a 20 year old admin commenting on this list means I'm 99% sure you will delete this list and probably the other (CD-ROM) list I mentioned above. I knew full well your deletion fetish may lead to the CD-ROM list being axed as well, but risked it to provide you with more info. The PS2 is one of the only systems in history where games have confusingly been released in more than one medium. Additionally, there are VERY FEW conceivable high-level/obvious lists or classifications for PS2 games, but among them would be such things as genre (there are many pages for game genres that list game examples for each system), developer, release year, networkability, and disk media. There are currently 2 lists for PS2 networked games. You guys better delete both of them while you are at it too. Since none of <b>YOU</b> have ever looked at these lists before, I'm sure that means they are useless information. <i>Seriously, a list only takes a few kilobytes on the Wiki-drive and each of these lists I mentioned are NEARLY COMPLETE (I personally flagged both lists as "incomplete" to encourage users to update them and not take them as 100% definititive).

<li><b>Obvious KEEP</b>. There is nothing in this article (or list) that doesn't belong in Wikipedia. "Listcruft" is a lame attempt to circumvent the need of presenting any real argument for deletion. "Not important" is a dubious claim, as the material on this list probably has vastly greater influence on today's society than, say, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrada_of_Laon_72c3.html" title="Bertrada of Laon">Bertrada of Laon</a> (just a random example). – <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimwi_eb8f.html" title="User:Timwi">Timwi</a> 16:54, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Second, the calls to convert the list into a Category miss the major differences between categories and lists: the former are not capable of referencing yet-to-be-written articles, which the latter can accommodate in addition to further annotation which increases value. I call upon the closing admin to take these points into serious consideration when evaluating the votes above.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Keeping this list would open the door for things like List of G-rated PC Games on 3" disks, List of R-rated PC Games release on both 3" and 5" disks etc. (And yes I'm obviously exaggerating of course). Since enough people seem to want a list of games (though I still don't understand why), I've changed my vote to merge the DVD9 and CDROM lists.

<li><b>Reply to Comment</b>: that might be a possible compromise, although I would be more inclined to support this proposal if it went further. From a quick perusal of the various lists on offer, it would appear that unifying the various "by format" lists into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_4ac8.html" title="List of PlayStation 2 games">List of PlayStation 2 games</a>, adding <b>much</b> annotation as to format/networking/etc, accompanied by splitting that list into sub-lists by initial letter (List of PlayStation 2 games: A, etc) would be the best long-run solution which subsumes all other possibilities. In the even-longer-term, this is a possible application for <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/wikidata" class="extiw" title="m:wikidata">wikidata</a> or something similar.

<dd>Are any scientists satisfied with the present state of modern relativity? I can't think of anyone who wouldn't be much happier if it could be replaced with a consistent theory of gravity at the quantum level. And what the hell does Essien's religion have to do with it. I don't like the idea of focusing on self-styled "dissidents". It doesn't sound like good science to state your point of view, and then do the experiments. Oh, and the article is POV, badly written, rambling, has a tone that smacks of original research and doesn't seem to serve any great purpose that isn't covered in the better article. <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html#Alternative_theories" title="General relativity">General relativity#Alternative_theories</a>. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>&#160;: Article is rambling rant with quite a bit of original research. In points it can become quite offensive, like apparently implying that researchers at DESY murdered someone for some cabalistic reason (if I were involved with DESY I would probably be ask for WP:OFFICE to be applied here). And of course, we have the editor who constantly adds these things to it. From previous experiences with such issues, it seems that deleting the articles can be an effective method of getting these editors to stop. I am not even sure how notable the topic really is (outside of sci.physics, of course). Although a google test might give a large number of results, crackpots often manipulate these results. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> 15:44, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The GPL Quake source release only includes the engine code, not the game data, which still remains proprietary to iD Software.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not going to "vote" or taking this seriously but I chimed in. If I'm in the mood, I would say delete but I don't care if it stays or gets deleted. I'm the starter of the <a href="../../../k/w/t/KWTS_84e3.html" title="KWTS">KWTS</a> article that which the article links to and have heard of this show. The show is still alive on-air in the Texas Panhandle if you guys are wondering if it is still "alive." (Don't know about the current status of the podcast.) Just don't see the signifiance having an article about it. The show is produced by a student-run small state university campus station. Not just only two students. The show was featured in the Texas A&amp;M System's press release, <a href="http://tamusystem.tamu.edu/systemwide/05/09/features/podcasting.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://tamusystem.tamu.edu/systemwide/05/09/features/podcasting.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> but still not important in my opinion. --<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_What_Where_Nguyen_Why_874b.html" title="User:Who What Where Nguyen Why">Who What Where Nguyen Why</a> 20:30, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../k/w/t/KWTS_84e3.html" title="KWTS">KWTS</a>. After thinking about it, the KWTS page is a stub and needs to be expanded. Some parts would be good in that article after just Google search, "Gaming Uncensored" + "podcast" came with 30,000. Granted that is not a good measure. However after browsing through many page results with the combination of those two strings, a lot of <i>non-major</i> websites mention it. Although, it doesn't deserve an article. Still no problem with deleting it. If deleted, will still briefly mentioned in the KWTS article. --<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_What_Where_Nguyen_Why_874b.html" title="User:Who What Where Nguyen Why">Who What Where Nguyen Why</a> 02:02, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Gaming Uncensored is one of the longer running Podcasts available in a disposable world where things start and finish quickly. Whilst Ricky Gervais has a mention regarding his podcast in Wikipedia, yet having done only a handful, here is a show with 63 episodes having been available on iTunes for over a year that is being doubted and marked for deletion. Quotes used above pertaining to the shows hosts appear irrelevant to me, whilst comments relating to KWTS linking are the valid ones that ought to be valued. Please note, I have never worked for KWTS nor have I been fired by Ricky Gervais so these two references are purely intended to relate to parity and fair representation on Wikipedia. A historic tv show such as Mind Your Language has representation on Wikipedia without having been shown for 27 years. Should Gaming Uncensored be represented as equally? I'd say so . . .

<dd>There is absolutely no evidence that he was ever even employed in his trade - the only historical facts on record are that he was in the Army in 1944 and had his picture taken once. So tell me - what else does anyone know about him? He's simply not notable other than for having a picture taken. Beyond that, what makes him notable? No one has listed any reasons. Incidentally, I am the webmaster for the Calgary Highlanders website and have access to the War Diary of the battalion. I don't mean to denigrate his service, but I can safely say there was nothing to distinguish him from the hundreds of other Canadian Army snipers that served in the Second World War, and <b>absolutely no basis</b> to describe him as "the most notable Canadian sniper in history" - in fact, that would go to <b>Ducky Norwest</b> or <b>Pegmahbow</b> or one of the other First World War snipers. The First World War snipers have easily verifiable kill records - there is no evidence out there that Marshall ever even shot anyone. So no, my objection is not to the misidentification of the kukri on his belt (my analysis is based on discussions with regimental museum staff and examination of the photo enlarged to 3 feet square, so please, sherucij, let me know what examination you have done besides looking at an internet picture), but rather to the fact that the entire article is a waste of bandwidth based on the fact we don't know anything about him, nor, frankly, are we like to given the lack of information available in the public record about him. He's simply not encyclopaedic.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 17:14, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - The point is that it's not the job of Wikipedia to examine enlarged photos to draw our own conclusions, it's to report what is <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiable_e5a8.html" title="WP:Verifiable">WP:Verifiable</a>, and your personal opinon isn't.

<p>Michael Dorosh's arguments make the case for articles on Ducky Norwest or Pegmahbow to be created, not for this one to be deleted.

<dd>They're making an entire movie about the Iwo flag raising - the difference is that we know a lot about the guys that raised the flag, Ira Hayes, etc., and the flag raising itself was a notable event. Marshall is photographed... standing in a field, posing for a picture. See the difference? There is nothing notable about standing in a field posing for a picture. Raising the flag on Suribachi is infinitely more notable for reasons that should be self-evident.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 15:41, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>It was the photograph that made the flag-raising a notable event, because it was a striking image. Without the photo, the event would have been not known about and entirely forgotten. A notable event (e.g. the assassination of Lincoln) is remembered in its own right, even though there is no photograph. In both cases, of flag-raising and Marshall, we are recording the power and notability of an image which is symbolic. Proof of this is that no one bothers about the fact that there was an earlier (and smaller) flag raised at the same spot on Iwo Jima. That was the more notable event—but not the notable image. The photo of Marshall embodies values, equivalent, for example, to the tomb of the unknown soldier. Marshall is an individual, but he represents much more than that. To just talk about him standing in a field is reductionism. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 16:43, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The point you are missing is that the other photos cited were taken during notable events; a non-notable person standing in a field is not notable. The photo itself is notable and should be included on Ken Bell's page, the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Highlanders_6992.html" title="Calgary Highlanders">Calgary Highlanders</a> page and on the <a href="../../../s/n/i/Sniper.html" title="Sniper">Sniper</a> page, but Marshall is not notable himself. Nor is the photo all that remarkable; it is often reproduced, but there is no history to the photo the way there is to the flag raising on Suribachi. If anyone can identify the location that Marshall is standing in please post it here. You can't, because even the photographer didn't note the location - it wasn't noteworthy. It's a cool picture, but nothing more, and if you want to start an article on H.A. Marshall Photo then your argument might hold some water. If you are lobbying for an article on H.A. Marshall then you have still not presented any of the wikipedia criteria for notability.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 18:59, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I meant to say is that the photo is all that is remarkable in the case of Marshall, but the photo does not show anything notable. The photo of the Iwo flag raising is not just notable for being a famous photo, it actually shows a famous event - the 2nd flag raising on Suribachi. The men involved have well documented histories, including an upcoming movie. Nothing has entered the historical record about Marshall other than he posed for a picture once and the picture was really cool. Ask yourself - if you can't even type out where Marshall was born, how old he was, or when he joined the Army, much less what he did in the service, how is he notable? On the other hand, Ira Hayes' postwar history is well known and one could probably fill a few paragraphs on his history alone, not to mention the dramatic impact of the flag raising(s) - they came early in the battle but the ships at sea and men on the island that witnessed the flag then and in days after had much to say about the event. Marshall's photo is notable only for being cool - no one knew that it was being taken and it didn't see widespread publication until after the war. It was not an EVENT the way the Suribachi raising or the Kent State shootings were. It is only notable in that it has been widely reproduced despite the subject being not notable.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 20:54, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The interesting "event" in the case of Marshall was <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> in which he <s>lost his life,</s> as did many others. The photo has obviously come to symbolise things about that war, in the same way that the flag-raising photo has. You've put the horse before the cart. That photo doesn't show a famous event. It made the event famous. The only reason the event is famous is because it's a great photo. The only reason the men involved have "well documented histories" is because the photo generated interest in them. They are just ordinary soldiers otherwise. A photo doesn't have to show an "event" to be notable: it can, for example, symbolise values, character, etc. The photo of Marshall is well known and it is only right to give him the dignity of acknowledging who he is. As you say yourself, it has been "widely reproduced". This fact alone justifies the article in wiki terms. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:13, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>HE DIDN'T DIE during the war. DHH website incorrectly lists him as dead but see the list of fatal casualties at www.calgaryhighlanders.com - he's not on it. He lived through the war. I guess he's so notable that no one even knows he lived, eh? Besides I never said the photo wasn't notable. Marshall himself isn't. Doesn't merit an article. The photo can be discussed on Bell's page, the Sniper page, or any of a thousand Second World War related pages. There is nothing to populate a page on him alone.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 02:58, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems unhelpful to quibble over whether an article <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Marshall_8e7b.html" title="Harold Marshall">Harold Marshall</a> or Photograph of Harold Marshall is unacceptable, but H.A. Marshall Photo might be.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, it is stated on the <a href="http://www.calgaryhighlanders.com/history/scouts.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.calgaryhighlanders.com/history/scouts.htm" rel="nofollow">Calgary Highlanders website</a> run by Michael Dorosh, <i>"This photograph of Sergeant Harold A.

<dd>Tyrenius, you're REALLY not getting the fact that any information on the Internet regarding Marshall is a result of my putting it there. The DHH site has a painting of him, and inaccurately notes that he died. Anything else was my doing. And I am stating from a position of authority that this guy, as far as is known, is not notable. I had my reservations from the minute I saw this page was created, but I followed WP guidelines and presumed good faith, thinking that perhaps there was some original research out there to shed light on him. That didn't happen - what happened was someone tried to create an article on a person based solely on a picture caption. So yes, there was questions about notability all along, but because I was presuming good faith, I didn't voice them until it became apparent the article creator had absolutely no evidence of notability - which was evidenced by his bizarre decision to argue the kukri handle. The photos of Canadian machetes are clearly shown on my website. I've examined large blowups of the photo and discussed it at length with museum staff at the regimental museum. Kudos to <b>Sherurcij</b> for being bold; unfortunately in this case, it has come to a dead end in an article about someone lacking notability.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 13:18, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, you know full well that Marshall didn't die during the war becuase you yourself posted at the User Talk for Marshall's page that there is a photo of him taken in the 1970s. So who's not arguing in good faith now?<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 13:20, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I found the 1970s photo reference only after I made my last post here, and put the info where it could do some good on the article talk page, so please again do not make implications. I don't see it as relevant to the AfD debate particularly, nor what kind of knife he was carrying for that matter. It's irrelevant who put the information on the web sites referenced: the fact is that they can now be used as a reference. I would like to congratulate you, however, on your research and your very informative sites. Also the Canadian government has seen fit to give him a page, as a separate source for reference. However, I find it odd that you are "bigging up" the prominence of the photo on sites you run, and arguing the opposite here. I think this discussion has covered the points of view more than adequately, and suggest we agree to now let editors make up their own minds, based on what has been said to date. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 15:30, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I'm thinking the "featuring a spoof of Raiders of the Lost Ark, produced by Andi Peters and Ewan MacDonald" would have been a bit of a clue. Andi is a British media personality that would have 13 years old at the time, and Ewan is a Scottish curler who would have been 8. This passes my "obvious joke" test.

<dd>Hello, Kuru. I was speaking from a policy point-of-view. This article is a probable hoax: it's a pretty elaborate tale woven around half-truths, with the intention to mislead. Past experience has shown that suspected hoaxes are best dealt with on AFD. While most suspected hoaxes will probably be dealt with correctly by administrators working alone, all too often, the eccentric, unusual, or technical appear to be hoaxes to people unfamiliar with them, and can be wrongly deleted—I remember seeing articles on rare medical conditions nearly deleted in the past because people thought they were hoaxes. Editors and administrators of WP come from all over the world and from different backgrounds, and things that may be familiar to you may not be familiar to another. The above article is somewhat illustrative. The people who believe it is a hoax, i.e., all of us, think so because we are aware of certain facts that cause us to suspect the veracity of the article as a whole. Some of these are better reasons to suspect it than others—the conjecture that a British media personality could not possibly have produced a short ad in his teens is actually a pretty bad one, by the way: it is only really useful if one knew for certain that the individual in question did not, in fact, do any such thing. By opening the matter for discussion on AFD for a period of at least five days, we are less likely to make a mistake than a lone administrator considering the matter by himself for a few moments, without the benefit of other eyes and brains. I do not want us to do anything that will encourage that type of deletion of items suspected of being false, which is what we'll be doing if we start speedily deleting suspected hoaxes, no matter how ridiculous it might seem to some of us to hang on to it for a few more days. Speedy deletion is for material of whose unsuitability there is no doubt, and which does not require much research or interpretation. —<i><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;"><b>Encephalon</b></span></a> 22:04, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</i>

<dd>Many thanks for the very comprehensive answer - you have changed my way of thinking about this aspect of the deletion process.

Motivated by my contribution to that, I completely rewrote the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_R._Dewey&amp;oldid=44651362" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_R._Dewey&amp;oldid=44651362" rel="nofollow">this incredibly awful version</a> of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_R._Dewey_8f73.html" title="Edward R. Dewey">Edward R. Dewey</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_R._Dewey&amp;oldid=51326824" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_R._Dewey&amp;oldid=51326824" rel="nofollow">this version</a>, which includes a section sketching some things which the modern theory of dynamical systems have to say about (valid) notions of cycles, precisely in order to demonstrate the sharp contrast between a mathematical theory and Dewey's vapid numerology. We are in a pickle here, because while <i>I do not feel that Dewey is notable for his accomplishments in life, he may be notable as a kind of posthumous hero of a somewhat noisy contemporary crank organization</i>. To wit, a passionate fan called <a href="http://ray.tomes.biz" class="external text" title="http://ray.tomes.biz" rel="nofollow">Ray Tomes</a> has been enthusiastically championing Dewey's loony obssesive claim that "cycles are present in everything which has been studied" for many years in UseNet postings, and more recently their websites and now at Wikipedia, where he or persons apparently belonging to his organization have created a half dozen or more extremely cranky articles, including <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonics_Theory_c757.html" title="Harmonics Theory">Harmonics Theory</a>, and more recently Cycle Theory and some others. For that reason it may be that conclude that <i>two things</i> are required of WP:
<ol>
<li>an article which:
<ul>
<li>contains only verifiable biographical information (if any can be found--- Deville, the reason for the qualifiers is that all information about Dewey which I could find on the web appears at one of Tomes's websites, and cannot be considered as independently unverifiable until reliable, independent, and unbiased sources can be found),</li>
<li>points out that so-called Cycle theory and Harmonics theory promoted by Tomes are not theories at all,</li>
<li>points out that in the modern theory of dynamical systems, a <i>real</i> theory of mathematically defined notions of <i>cycles</i> can be found, and then some dynamical systems contain no cycles whatever,</li>
<li>point out in particular that Dewey's alleged claim that</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>continual monitoring thereafter to revert cranky pro-Tomes POV-pushing edits.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I am of two minds about this because I dislike the idea that simply by being very noisy at (among other places) the WP, some crank can promote himself to notability, but on balance I tend to think that <i>creating</i> and <i>maintaining</i> a balanced article which points out specific problems with Tomes style pro-Dewey propagandizing may be a good idea, as a service to our readers. ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 02:43, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yet another contested prod. This page was originally flagged as a non-notable bio to which the prodder could have added borderline vanity page. Deprodded on grounds that the subject is <i>obviously notable as (the) director of (a) film commercially released by Lions Gate.</i> So we are bringing it to AfD for review. Here is his IMDB entry <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0775043/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0775043/" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. Personally, I think simply having your film picked up for a direct-to-video release by Lion's Gate is not obviously grounds for notabality. The film received all of <b>one</b> review from the extensive press covered by Rotten Tomatoes <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1153447-bloodline/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1153447-bloodline/" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> and almost none of the top-billed actors have appeared in more than 2 films (except the co-director, a minor TV actor). Of the subjects other claims, his 2000 spoof generates some 300 hits, many of which however, are either ifilm spawns and the great Oz himself saying that <i>Being Ozzie Osborne is great, but I don't sing about the f*&amp;^%$ devil or bats or whatever.</i> (Love that quote.) The Spike Jonez claim made on the page is unverifiable, and deceptively worded to make it look it was delivered in the context of the film winning an award. Which it didn't. In fact, a search on the film + awards, without the ifilm guss produces 0 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Being+Ozzy+Osbourne%22+%22Independent+Spirit+Awards%22+-ifilm&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Being+Ozzy+Osbourne%22+%22Independent+Spirit+Awards%22+-ifilm&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. Of the other claims, script tune-up for the Simpsons and South Park is both unverifiable and not notable (he could have been adding commas). Good wishes to David for future success, but in my view he does not yet meet notability standards. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 15:36, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Most articles/biographies on people have looked like resumes. What is the difference between someone's resume and a biography? A 'resume,' by definition, is simply a summary of facts, which I hardly find different than an encyclopedia article. If Bachrach44's intention is to imply that the author of the article is using wikipedia for the sole purpose of applying for a job, then it would appear that the article is a resume.

<p>On the other hand, I have expressed interest in learning more about the present/past Presidential Interns at AUC. My interests are fueled by the desire to know what the past/present year's fellows have done professionally and academically, both in their past and at their time at the American University in Cairo. Whether the user created a page about himself or not, such information provides further important and detailed insight to those that work as Presidential interns and at the American University in Cairo. {{--Zoomer99 16:25, 28 April 2006 (UTC)unsigned|217.52.14.105}}</p>

<p>While it is a good suggestion to merge the information, maybe it would be a better idea to create a sub-article for the Program. The people picked for the program are the leaders of their fields in Middle Eastern Studies from the recent college-graduate pool of students. If 'merging' means to include the specific interns biographies into the AUC site, the AUC site is not developed enough to include that information as of yet. I still think that separate articles are necessary for the interns.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Zoomer99 (<a href="../../../z/o/o/User_talk%7EZoomer99_e9a6.html" title="User talk:Zoomer99">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zoomer99_140d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zoomer99">contribs</a>).</small> 16:42, 28 April 2006</p>

Just because the interns or their supervisors may not qualify in your personal standards (RGTraynor), that does not mean that they do not warrant their own articles. Within the AUC community the interns' supervisors act at the highest level of University adminitration and the interns are under the ultimate supervision of the Office of the University President and the president himself. AUC, a major international institution, has significant importance within the Middle East. The sub-articles and articles' lack of development (both of AUC, the administration, the interns' supervisiors, and the actual interns) will be attended to. The interns are published authors, as well as award recipents (all of which is verifiable). Only time is needed to develop the articles.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Zoomer99 (<a href="../../../z/o/o/User_talk%7EZoomer99_e9a6.html" title="User talk:Zoomer99">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zoomer99_140d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zoomer99">contribs</a>).</small> 17:24, 28 April 2006</p>

<p>My argument is simply that the intern's supervisors are noteable within their cultural context (e.g. Egypt and the greater Middle East). The interns might merit their own article by the virtue of a 'notable award,' but i can see how at that point it is better to be merged with the American University in Cairo article. However, I still maintain that the interns by virtue of receiving a 'notable award' are validated. however, that's a subjective point.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Dominicbocci (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dominicbocci_e4d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dominicbocci">contribs</a>).</small> 18:22, 28 April 2006</p>

<p>I think what the editor is attempting to do is fine. it "should be" the situation where the supervisors' profiles are being created as we speak. however, time is the main constraint here. i believe the editor is suggesting that for AUC, the Presidential Internship program is the 'notable award' (as far as AUC is concerned). So, the question becomes how 'notable' does the award need to be? Just because someone knows the difference between a Rhodes scholarship and a Fulbright, doesn't mean that either is more 'notable' than the other. I say, give the 'wiki'-writers time to develop the AUC site. Hopefully, what we're posting is being helpful and will greatly inform the writers' skill when writing these articles. as far as the last comment about the supervisors' notarity...after reviewing many professors 'biographies,' the articles do not adequately (as per wikipedia's requirement) really pass the Professor Test. So, give the writer's time...i'm sure it will all work out.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Zoomer99 (<a href="../../../z/o/o/User_talk%7EZoomer99_e9a6.html" title="User talk:Zoomer99">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zoomer99_140d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zoomer99">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I started this article. There was already an <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Qadir_c086.html" title="Abdul Qadir">Abdul Qadir</a>, about a cricket player. Then I discovered an earlier, existing article - <a href="../../../h/a/j/Haji_Abdul_Qadir_9414.html" title="Haji Abdul Qadir">Haji Abdul Qadir</a>. The only problem with <b>redirecting [[Abdul Qadir (Afghan leader)]] to [[Haji Abdul Qadir]]</b> is that <a href="../../../h/a/j/Haji.html" title="Haji">Haji</a> is an honorary title, and, conventionally, honorary titles aren't part of the names of biographical articles. I thought moving the existing article to a name, like the one I picked, was desirable. AIUI, moving an article, with its edit history, requires the new article name to be un-used. Therefore deletion seemed in order. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 16:34, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Userfy</b> it into the author's space for improvement. Additionally, this article sounds as if it were copied from another source. Deleting the POV in this article would leave maybe a line of information. As much as I liked his singing in Fatboy Slim's "Song for Shelter", this article needs a major overhaul before it belongs in articlespace. <a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a> 18:01, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The nom is self-defeating by stating that the subject is notable. In this case it needs rewriting, not deleting - even if all that is left is one line. A badly-written article on a valid subject is not grounds for deleting of the subject altogether. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 18:04, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Not merely a neologism, but a badly-written, self-contradictory article. --<a href="../../../b/a/u/User%7EBaumfabrik_141d.html" title="User:Baumfabrik">die Baumfabrik</a> 06:39, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>So, let me understand this. First, Jaber thought it was non-original. He/she proved him/her-self wrong on that point, and Devill had to rescue him/her by inventing another excuse to stick to the <b>Delete</b> recommendation. Neologism? As in <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Love_b882.html#Santorum" title="Savage Love">Savage_Love#Santorum</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrosexual.html" title="Metrosexual">Metrosexual</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/i/Bling.html" title="Bling">Bling</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Whale_tail.html" title="Whale tail">Whale_tail</a>, and innumerable others? These were all "neo" words before attaining mainstream. The fact that they are all allowed to live on wikipedia sugggests that "neologism" is a recently invented excuse for petty hackery. The <b>Delete</b> recommendation was made and approved in bad faith, and I am very curious as to the real reason: because you didn't come up with it first? And, Baumfabrik, your recommendation would have credibility if you could simply point out the "self-contradiction" you observed. iyaburo</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> WP:BAND is a guideline, not policy. These people are more than simply a band; they are a cross-cultural phenomenon. They have been covered in the press, and are notable in science fiction circles. Were they not labelled "band", the article would not be subject to this AFD. —&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">JEREMY</a> 04:19, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> WP:BAND seems a better guide to 'must have' status than an exclusion reference. Wikipedia can spare the space neede to document historical phenomena that may otherwise become lost.

<li>Just a comment.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> just because a list can grow to infinity, does not mean it ought to be deleted -- see the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_from_California_fa8f.html" title="List of people from California">List of people from California</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_left-handed_people.html" title="List of left-handed people">List of left-handed people</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people.html" title="List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people">List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people</a>, e.g. And just because Nana and the guy next to you have perfect pitch doesn't make them notable enough for inclusion in the list, just like had they been left-handed or lesbian/gay or from California instead. And bias toward musicians is not problematic -- the quality is more rewarded in music than say, a boxer with perfect pitch &lt;sarcasm&gt; of course a pitcher with perfect pitch may be worth noting &lt;/sarcasm&gt;, just as the left-handers list tends to overinclude sports professionals. All that aside, unless someone (Mindspillage?) is going to source the folks with citations like they do at the gay-lesbian list, it is probably better to see this one off to the bit-bin. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 22:56, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> You cannot be serious. We keep articles about newscasters from local stations in Boise, Idaho, but you want to delete one of the top few people at one of the main media organizations in the world!!!!???? According to his BBC profile he is the chief executive of the BBC's commercial arm, which made profits last year of £145 million (about <a href="../../../u/s/%24/US%24_8dea.html" title="US$">US$</a> 260 million), so it must have had revenue of many times that, and that is only part of his responsibilities. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumahoy_3c13.html" title="User:Sumahoy">Sumahoy</a> 03:12, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh no! So now every middle manager on the planet is going to have their own Wikipedia article??? Lord preserve us. What are our criteria of notability for managers?

<li>I don't feel all <i>that</i> strongly in this particular case, but being one of the top movers and shakers in a mega-major public organisation like the BBC seems to me a lot more notable than being some bunch of kids who've done one or two obscure CDs but admittedly with a genuine commercial label, or being some obscure writer who has nonetheless had a few (not-very-well-known) novels from reputable commercial publishers with reasonable print runs. Then there are all the articles about relatively obscure fictional characters in the better-known comic books (I've created a few article stubs like that myself). All of those are uncontroversially notable. As for civil servants — civil servants at the highest levels of the administrations of sizeable countries wield vast power and influence, and should certainly be considered notable IMHO. This is not directed at you, but a comment about the Wikipedia culture in general — don't you think we sometimes judge things too much from the viewpoint of what is important to adolescents, rather than from an adult perspective on the world? That said, this article can stand or fall on its merits, and I won't lose sleep, but your comment got me thinking. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 06:22, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What are our criteria of notability for managers? I just find it so depressing thinking that tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of managers are now going to get their own article. BBC managers are in effect civil servants: which is even less notable that managers working in real industries. There is also a massive risk of systematic geographical bias here: how many Japanese, Bolivian or Iranian TV execs are ever going to have a Wikipedia article? It is a silly precedent to set. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 05:58, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I could add some Swedish TV executives at some point (not that I think I will do so anytime soon, but who knows?). I see no reason we shouldn't have Japanese, Iranian and Bolivian ones, as well. In terms of long-term influence, TV executives may be far more important than the anchorpeople, presenters etc who may be more familiar to the viewers. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 07:18, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would have thought that the BBC has more influence than all but a handful of commercial companies in the world. And i think you have the systematic bias argument completely the wrong way round.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Ok, there seems to be some heated discussion on the talk page, and a small bit of edit warring (although I've seen much much worse) but neither of those justify deletion. Moreover, a quick perusal of the talk pages suggests to me that the nominator has been involved in said warring and at the very least has several edits on the article. Of course, editing an article does not preclude someone from later nominating it AfD, but I have to say that I find it incongruous that someone feels it's worth their time to edit an article and make several discussions on the Talk page, and then later things the article is worthy of removal. But aside from all that, this seems like a reasonably-sourced phenomenon in the literature, and thus satisfies <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and doesn't break <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. --<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 23:27, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. None of the cited policies support deletion. This is, as far as I can see, an actual phenomenon that is notable and so warrants a Wikipedia entry if one can be written. That an article is currently dead-locked by POV warriors is not reason to delete either. Yes, the article appears to contain a lot of original research—that is a basis for rewriting and remove the OR though, not deletion. Furthermore, from the Talk page, this appears to be a bad-faith nomination by an editor frustrated by a lack of consensus support for their ideas (thus the "strong" keep on principle; otherwise it would just be a keep). — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 23:31, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> This is one of those cases where most people know it exists, but there aren't any good sources to back it up, so original research and personal opinion creep in.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I agree that an "Asian Fetish" is a real phenomenon, but as written, this article is basically a soap-box for Political Correctness, among other things. Also it veers way off-topic. For example, there's a section entitled something like "Stereotypes of the Asian Male" which goes on to describe how this particular contributor believes Asian Males are portrayed in American Media, which has nothing to do with an "Asian Fetish". Also, the term is thrown around way too often at any White male who happens to be dating, or married to a female of Asian descent and has develped a derogatory meaning. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">WilliamThweatt</a> 02:23, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete.</b> This article is clearly taking only one point of view, it has been written with reference only to white men (which is racist with no rational basis). Although there are numerous citations, a closer look reveals the research is poor quality and/or poorly reflected in the document and the title. The very title "Asian Fetish" carries racist undertones and an unbalanced negative point of view. This article should no more exist than one called "White Stupidity". Who has the authority to distinguish "Asian Fetish" from natural "inter-racial" (whatever that means) love? The term "Asian Fetish" is clearly nothing more than a racial insult. People either have "hate of asians" (are racist) or "attraction to asians" (neutral/positive). The term "Asian Fetish" is oxymoronic!

<li><b>Keep</b> I just did a Google search on "Asian fetish" and our article was the number one search return, right underneath the "asianfetish.com" porno ad. This thing hurts my brain; it's a textbook case of what <i>not</i> to do when writing an article. Nevertheless, I don't think there's much doubt the phenomenon exists, though whether as an activist meme or real cultural issue is anybody's guess. We should have an article, just not <i>this</i> article. Burn it down to the ground, banish the POV pushers to WikiGehenna, and upon its ashes let a new stub grow. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 00:00, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> The disclaimer at the top notwithstanding, the article is basically an attack page against white (male)-Asian (female) relationships. A good many of the sources cited are badly-written intensely POV opinion pieces, not even pretending to be scholarly in any way. (People should read them before stating the article is well-researched.) To take just one, frankly I find the "Racist Love" article, which is quoted extensively, to be an idiotic, hate-filled rant. The authors attempt to link racist hate-- say, lynching and dragging a man behind a pickup because of his race-- with white men marrying Asian women. Obviously there is racism involved here, but it comes from the authors of the article, not those (myself included) who are involved in interracial relationships. The authors project absurd motives upon white-Asian relationships, stating that they are based on stereotypes from a century ago. (No, all your "well-researched" opinion sources aside, I did <i>not</i> marry my wife thinking she was Anna May Wong in <i>Thief of Bagdad</i> (1924).) The article is POV, a soapbox for racist activists, rife with original research and conjecture, and "owned" by a male, Asian American activist who does not hide his intent to mold the article to his own POV.

<li>I wasn't citing it as a source, I was giving it as supporting evidence of notability - and even though it's in Russian I can make out some other aspects of his notability from it.

<li>I agree.

If someone is looking up "germ", I think it's hard to say what they're really looking for, but my guess would be that the pathogen and germ theory pages would be at least as likely to satisfy them as the microorganism page. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 02:34, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
