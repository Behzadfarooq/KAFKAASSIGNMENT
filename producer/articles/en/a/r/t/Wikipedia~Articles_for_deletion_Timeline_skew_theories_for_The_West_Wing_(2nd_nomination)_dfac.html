<dd>It can't be OR if it's just a comparison of the two timelines, the real one and <i>The West Wing</i> timeline: "This is <i>The West Wing</i> timeline, this is the real world.

<li>I disagree that any substantial progress has been made. You have cited basic facts from the series, however, you have failed to address the far more important concerns regarding the synthesis of these ideas into more complex conclusions.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Phil Sandifer and Opabinia regalis. GassyGuy 03:13, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> - Excessively original research. The article consists of unobvious and dubious conclusions drawn from basic data, which is most clearly a violation of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. There are citations for some of the basic facts, but then these are extrapolated in a fit of assumptions, fan theories, and other unverifiable synthesis. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 03:39, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I would like to see this material kept in some form. A quick look through the references currently in the article shows that attempts to resolve the timeline skew do exist in published media. However, a lot of the current content could be pruned, and perhaps this article should be merged into another. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 04:09, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, as a vote that hopefully carries some weight as I was the nominator in it's first AFD. This subject requires coverage, given the importance of dates in politics (especially a show modelled after real-world politics).

<li><b>Keep</b>. Harmless and interesting. All statements about the show are supported, and most of the theories presented are based on other sources. There is, I suppose, some analysis of claims put forward by others which is arguably OR, but I would guess that one could source it, at least to message boards and such. I suggested before that the best solution to this would be to include a discussion of the timeline skew in an article more broadly about the fictional universe of <i>The West Wing</i>, and I think that that would still be the best solution, but nobody seemed to care. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 16:21, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The subject of the article is just OR. The citations provided are just the episodes, and all they can be used to reference are the <i>facts</i>; they do not have any bearing on the <i>theories</i> advanced by the article. The timeline skew theories themselves remain uncited. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 16:23, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Googling "West Wing" timeline skew gets a total of 313 results that are not from Wikipedia. Most of these turn out to be irrelevent or reposts of Wikipedia content that doesn't follow the GFDL. I can find exactly one LJ post by a fan that attempts to create a timeline. In other words, <i>there are no sources here</i>. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:07, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>Put a brief discussion in the main article for the show, if sources that are not OR can be found. The cites to the actual episodes from which infrences are made do not avoid OR synthesis.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 22:18, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> even if it is not Origial Research, the dates have little notability in themselves. Any notability is in the real-world events that are compared. Half a list is no list. Delete. 168.103.119.81 14:55, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Theories are a completely valid and already covered material for wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreemarket_071b.html" title="User:Freemarket">Freemarket</a> 16:27, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Even after the attempt to source material, it is original research - none of the conclusions or speculation are sourced, just what was on the show when. It is also non-encyclopedic. After this much time (the first AFD to now) with the verifiability of the article under challenge, it is safe to presume that it is not verifiable. The only source <i>about</i> the timeline that is cited is the TV Zone article, so there is no evidence of real world significance or notability. As a side problem (but not an additional reason for deletion) the article does a poor job adhering to the manual of style guide requiring articles about fiction to be about the real world significance of that fiction. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 14:04, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as far as I could tell, only one of the sources actually makes the arguments upon which the whole article is based, <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 00:41, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The altered election date is a significant and unavoidable aspect of the WW. Because of that, it must be recognized with an article.
