<li>[author's response] Who are these defamers of the American citizens who stand for the constiution and the Republic. Who are these racists against Whites, whom they do not want to preserve themselves? Who are these parasites of America who want to trample upon the liberty of the citizens? Who are these censors of freedom of speech? Be they identified by name and address so that they can be brought to justice. They deserve to be charged with suppression of American rights and provisions which are spelled out in the Constitutions. Come into the open, you mischievous and treacherous rabble. (I have copies of what i wrote. So, don't bother ALTERING my contents, which will stand as rightful before any court of law.)

<li><b>Comment</b> It is nonsense, though arguably not <a href="../../../p/n/_/WP%7EPN_ca1e.html" title="WP:PN">nonsense</a>; it is a rant; it is posse comitatus tinfoil hattery. But if it is a real movement with any more than a handful of adherents it probably ought to have its very own article just like the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Aryan_Resistance_9416.html" title="White Aryan Resistance">White Aryan Resistance</a> and the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_Christian_dd66.html" title="Church of Jesus Christ Christian">Church of Jesus Christ Christian</a> and oh so many others, no? -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 21:13, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree that a movement, even a small one, should have an article. This article provides no evidence of any movement beyond that occurring when the author sits on the toilet. The artile does not even refer to a movement, but rather to an "ideology", which kind of supports Gazpacho's point that it is a personal manifesto. The fact that the author made ridiculous threats of legal action, and has already made aggressive and inappropriate edits to the article tells me that this is not someone we want around. Will anyone be allowed to edit this article to NPOV it or bring it up to Wikipeida standard? Or will this guy just keep reverting and blustering about? <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 21:22, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>(Author's comment). I wrote my name in full in a message which has got lost in the shuffle. My full real name is also in my registration. DELETE those who wish to delete my message, since they are racists, suppressors of freedom of speech, enemies of and within the Republic, which must be save from them.</p>
<p>If you were American citizens, you would want to join in this freedom movement; you are on the other side, children of the trators of the Constitution, from Wilson to Bush, the servant of a foreign power, the cohort of those who are striving to make the American cizens servants of others. Delete yourselves from this Land!</p>

<ul>
<li>You're all correct, of course. Googling the supposed author's name (helpfully provided on the article's Talk page) turns up a bunch of neo-Nazi rants, but nothing to suggest that "Catechism" is a notable movement worthy of an article. <b>Delete</b> OR, nn. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 21:58, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>[Author:] Deletion, placing on the Index, and burning at the stake for good measure, have been methods of self-defense. You are aliens to the Constitution and the rights of the citizens, part of the scourge which has been afflicting the United States. Do what you must but we shall meet again.</p>

<p>[Author:] Ground Zero was the result of a plot by three parties, none of which involved American Whites. Treason from here and treason from there.....Ah, but I am going off on a tanget.... you still have to understand a word of anything I wrote in the article.</p>

<li><b>Strongest Possible Delete and Ban User</b>&#160;: This article is nn. Granted, I find the author's ideology abhorrent, but if he started an article about an ACTUAL and NOTABLE hate group, and followed the rules of Wikipedia (NPOV, civility, no legal threats, etc.), he'd have as much of a right as anyone else on here to add to our project. However, in this vfd alone, he's broken several Wikipedia Policies on numerous occasions. If he sockpuppets and continues this kind of behavior, he should be banned again. Maybe eventually he'll eschew his hateful nonsense and learn to play nice with others. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a> 04:49, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>COMMENT:</b> I'm worried about the immediate impact this might have on wikipedia. A minute passes that this crap stays on wiki, the more likelihood that someone will take offense and sue wikipedia? I'm not a lawyer (tm) and cannot say with authority what would happen then, but are we not responsible at least partly for the contents that even anon vandals place on it? It's blatantly obvious that this anon vandal's agenda is racism, so there should, in theory, be no discussion about its validity, since it IS racism and not just TALKING ABOUT racism, and the last time I checked, racism is illegal. I suggest that we at least quarantine this article first and make it inacessible or something. This might be something I wanna bring up at the vfd reform too. -<a href="../../../h/m/i/User%7EHmib_4096.html" title="User:Hmib">Hmib</a> 05:07, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We can't be sued, and it is in no way illegal, however this kind of hate rant does give Wikipedia a bad name. <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUber_nemo_c380.html" title="User:Uber nemo"><font color="black">→ubεr nεmo</font><font color="#3399FF">→</font></a> <a href="../../../u/b/e/User_talk%7EUber_nemo_e4f4.html" title="User talk:Uber nemo"><sup><font color="#EEEEEE">lóquï</font></sup></a> 05:57, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Don't know what country you're in, Hmib, but in the USA racism is definitely legal. at least insofar as what you say or write. —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 06:14, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's legal? Hm... Land of the free eh? Perhaps a bit too free... next the right to murder would also be included in the definition of free... Bah but I digress.
