<li><b>Comment</b> While I will agree that this article is not written from an out-of-universe perspective, it is not original research. The Harry Potter Lexicon has <a href="http://hp-lexicon.org/timelines/timeline.php" class="external text" title="http://hp-lexicon.org/timelines/timeline.php" rel="nofollow">compiled this timeline</a>; the Lexicon is a site which the series' author J. K. Rowling <a href="http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/fansite_view.cfm?id=14" class="external text" title="http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/fansite_view.cfm?id=14" rel="nofollow">uses to fact-check information</a> while without her books and writing; the films' producers also <a href="http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/films/lex-op-set-teaser.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/films/lex-op-set-teaser.html" rel="nofollow">use the site</a> almost every day for reference. As for the significance of the timeline, perhaps it would be better to merge all this information into appropriate articles, but it is appropriate somewhere. I know that articles, meant to be written from an out-of-universe perspective, would not include this information, but to mention this as a "within the series" sidenote is something I feel is okay. I don't have a strong vote for keep, nor for delete, but <i>the information</i> is what is important here, and I feel it belongs somewhere on Wikipedia. --<b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">Fbv</a></b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">65</a><i><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_Esperanza_2f4a.html" title="User:Fbv65edel/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">del</a></i> / <a href="../../../f/b/v/User_talk%7EFbv65edel_60e2.html" title="User talk:Fbv65edel">â˜‘t</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fbv65edel_f6f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fbv65edel">â˜›c</a> || 02:45, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fancruft is "a selection of content is of importance only to a small population of enthusiastic fans of the subject in question." Now, correct me if I am wrong, but the amount of editing and input into that article - including from admins who, surprise, surprise, didn't view it as unimportant - would suggest that it is of importance to more than a few. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michael</a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelsanders_ec6a.html" title="User talk:Michaelsanders">Sanders</a> 16:29, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The fact that admins have edited the article doesn't mean much. Personally, I'll edit articles that probably should be on the chopping block, just 'cause I can't stand all the terrible grammar in some of these things. (Worst is when they write a multi-clause sentence and lose track of or ambiguate who the subject of the sentence is) Now, if you want to bring said admins into this discussion and have them explain why they think the article should stay, that would be different...<a href="../../../z/a/k/User%7EZaku_kai_3334.html" title="User:Zaku kai">Zaku kai</a> 16:51, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just a question â€“ you are aware that, though this is what one would term a "fan site," it is supported and recommend by Rowling for research relating to her series? She has a close relationship with her fanbase and knows how to sort out the right from the wrong in terms of reliable sites. --<b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">Fbv</a></b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">65</a><i><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_Esperanza_2f4a.html" title="User:Fbv65edel/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">del</a></i> / <a href="../../../f/b/v/User_talk%7EFbv65edel_60e2.html" title="User talk:Fbv65edel">â˜‘t</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fbv65edel_f6f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fbv65edel">â˜›c</a> || 03:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>And I think you know that that argument is a thoroughly stupid and childish argument. The standard for inclusion in wikipedia is sources and notability. The article is sourced - not well, but since it all comes from the books or Rowling's site, it can be improved - and it is about a fantastically popular and widespread phenomenon. Whereas no-one googles to find your cat. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michael</a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelsanders_ec6a.html" title="User talk:Michaelsanders">Sanders</a> 17:04, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No rules are being bent. There is no Original Research in the article - the information all derives from the books or from Rowling herself. And whilst the style is slightly poor, it is hardly abysmal. On the other hand, there is no way - unless your cat has been the star of a few films and books - that an article on your cat (let alone its birthdate) would be at all notable. And such facetious arguments are hardly to your credit. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michael</a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelsanders_ec6a.html" title="User talk:Michaelsanders">Sanders</a> 18:37, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>The information all comes from the books, and as such is all sourced, or in principle could be, to the relevant reference to a book/chapter.(or comments by Rowling) A similar list was compiled and published by HP-Lexicon on their website. This list was adopted by warner bros, and included in the DVDs of the films which they have issued, so again the timeline itself has also been largely published separately and is accessible by anyone with a copy of the film DVD and a computer. To be more precise on this claim of authorship, Warner have acknowledged privateley assistance from HP-Lexicon in creating their films, but have not publically acknowledged where they got the info. However, Lexicon maintain their claim, which is published on their website, and also comment that a mistake in their original posted timeline was reproduced precisely in the one published by Warner. The information collected in this way is useful to any reader wanting to better understand the events of the books. It is not a plot summary, as it does not summarise the plot. Rather, it analyses the information and presents in a more useful way than simply re-telling the story. It is not OR, firstly because it is merely a tabulation of dates extracted wherever they occur, but secondly because it has been published elsewhere. As to e.g. when broomsticks were first used for transpot, I fancy this comes from the book by Rowling 'Quidditch through the ages', so is sourced. A lot of trivia about HP has been released by Rowling either in these ancillary books, or in her continuing posts on her website, e.g. 'wizard of the month'. As far as I am aware, being in- or out- universe is no criterion for deleting anything. It might argue for rewriting, but I'm not exactly sure how you would propose rewriting a list of events. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandpiper_0787.html" title="User talk:Sandpiper">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sandpiper_bbed.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sandpiper">contribs</a>) 15:06, 29 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<dd>Also, <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">WP:USEFUL</a> is an essay, not a policy. And there is a difference between making wikipedia a phonebook and providing information about a <i>very</i> popular book, which a lot of readers want to read about. Remember, we are here to serve the readers, not the opinions of those editors who dislike 'low-brow' articles. And there are plenty of readers who want to be able to find out information which is important to the novel. And it is better that <i>we</i> provide that information - since we can ensure that it is trustworthy and reliable - than allow readers to slope off to a website that may have wrong information. Is that not the point of wikipedia? Otherwise, why bother? Let the readers go to Britannica or Encarta for information on science and history, let them google for information on their favourite soaps and pop-stars! What is the <i>point</i> of wikipedia, if we do not write about <i>everything</i> that we are interested in - provided, of course, that it is notable enough, and is sourced. This article is on an extraordinarily notable subject, is part of a phenomenon. It is not well sourced, or well written; that can be improved. But if there is any purpose at all in wikipedia, it is to ensure that we provide as thorough articles and subjects as possible. Which this article goes towards fulfilling. We all know that wikipedia's strengths lie not in its accuracy, or writing style - how could it? - but in the breadth and depth of the subject matter. This attitude only destabilises that strength. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michael</a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelsanders_ec6a.html" title="User talk:Michaelsanders">Sanders</a> 16:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Transwiki to Wikibooks and delete:</b> This is a tough one. On the one hand, it <i>is</i> true that the page is in-universe and therefore doesn't comply with the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">fiction style guide</a>, and that nothing on the page independent satisfies the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability guideline</a>. On the other hand, failure to comply with a style guide is normally an issue for clean-up, not deletion, and there's a good argument that since Harry Potter as a whole is notable, this particular topic, if encyclopedic, would be appropriate for a sub article under the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_series_3a8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Article series">article series guideline</a>. Ultimately, though, I think it's appropriate to delete for the following reasons:
<ol>
<li>The list is unacceptable <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html#No_original_research" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">original research</a>, because many of the dates are obtained through a series of deductions based on various references in the text.</li>
<li>The list is, IMHO, overly detailed for Wikipedia, which is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. However, the list probably <i>is</i> a good choice for Wikibooks, which has an <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" rel="nofollow">excellent and detailed analysis of Harry Potter</a> and would benefit from the addition of this list.

<dd>Unless multi million dollar films and the companies creating them are considedered unreliable sources of information, it is not OR. The description of how the dates were originally derived is accurate, but they have in any event been adopted as official.

<li>Thanks. The original data, then, is copyrighted either by Warner Brothers or by the website that alleges that they copied its material; in either case, it's not public domain. If the page were attributed to the DVD, that would resolve OR problems, but, IMHO, raise copyright problems. Even with minor rewording, I don't think the page would avoid copyright issues.

More generally, if Wikipedia is copying Lexicon material, then it's just <i>wrong</i> for Rowling to be directing traffic to us; we should have a link to the Lexicon, and <i>they</i> should get the hits that their work has generated. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 21:32, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
