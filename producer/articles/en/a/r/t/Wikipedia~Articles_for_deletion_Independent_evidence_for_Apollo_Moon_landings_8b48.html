<p>Non-notable subject, silly given the stipulation of using "independent" evidence, and original research. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 20:22, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am puttin this article up for deletion for numerous reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is non-notable (see Wikipedia's definition of notability <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">here</a>). A quick internet search shows that all the topics related to this subject are about the "Apollo Moon landing hoax". The act of refuting these claims by using "Independent evidence for human and non-human Moon landings (that is, evidence not presented by NASA or its subcontractors)" is not one of the common ways to refute these hoax claims. Such arguments, if they exist, could easily be incorporated into a pre-existing article under the domain of wikipedia. Such evidence would probably be no more than 1 paragraph long, and would not be an undue burden on, say, <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations_8812.html" title="Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations">Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations</a>.</li>
<li>By "Apollo Moon landings" any reasonable person would infer that this refers to the Apollo program to put <i>humans</i> on the Moon, and not the possibility that Apollo might have landed on the Moon, but with no people inside the LEM. As the article states, the only proof that can be used to definitively show that humans walked on the Moon is to take pictures of "boot prints" from orbit (but only if these come from an non-US governmental agency spacecraft!). However, it is quite clear that such evidence does not exist now, nor will it for a long period of time. Thus, there is no possible proof that humans walked on the Moon (given the constraints of this article).</li>
<li>I know of no reputable publications that are primarily concerned with "Independent evidence for human and non-human Moon landings (that is, evidence not presented by NASA or its subcontractors)" Any attempt to make an article based on primary sources that are only tangentially related to this theme would constitute <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. In the words of Wikipedia policy, original research <b>includes unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories, or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position — or which, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales, would amount to a "novel narrative or historical interpretation."'</b></li>
<li>As has already become clear from the talk page, the definition of "independent" is sufficiently vague that almost anything, or nothing, could be placed under this article. For instance, would the results of a European scientist who analyzes "Moon rocks" supplied by NASA be considered independent? Would evidence from ESA be independent, even though they collaborate with NASA and rely on NASA to participate in the ISS?</li>
<li>Any independent evidence that might exist could easily be refuted by a skeptic. For instance, let's say that telemetry data was collected at an Australian station. How do we prove that this telemetry stream came from the Moon, and not from "over the hill", or from a tape recored souce that was plugged into this instrument?</li>
<li>Finally, this article is trying to make a point (see <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>), and the intended audience is not going to believe it!</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Bad faith nomination by a POV warrior who has tried systematically to disrupt the page. Evidence for the Moon landings is non-notable? I've never heard anything so stupid. Dividing up evidence from NASA and from others is useful, especially given the quantities involved. This article was started from a series of repeated discussions on the Apollo Hoax page, but is also a stand alone article not linked directly to the hoax accusations. A list of observations, tracking, testimonies etc that confirm the landings is appropriate and useful. Not one bit is original research. It is ALL well sourced, and published to death elsewhere. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 20:27, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> Assuming the information in this article is true. The <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations_8812.html" title="Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations">Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations</a> are certainly a noteworthy concept worthy of an article, and a rebuttal of them seems natural to me. In fact, the nomination seems to want a merge anyway.

<dd>A merge would not be too bad, except that the evidence for it does not presume a hoax accusation. Listing the evidence is a useful tool for anyone, not just hoax enquirers. Also, that page is already tagged as being "too long" and in the process of being split into sub-articles. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 21:34, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Then that is actually an omission because, otherwise, there really is no need for the article since all you need is to cite the New York Times or whatever's coverage of the applicable manned moon landings. The only reason why people feel the need to cite evidence is because of people citing evidence to the contrary, so this topic is better served as part of the hoax article. I'm actually tempted to change my vote to delete as unnecessary, however, I'm content to leave my vote as is having looked at the article again as requested. <b>Reconfirm merge</b>. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 21:17, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

My interpretation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> does not provide for making separate articles for cited POV's. If the information is notable, then it should be cited and reside right next to the contrary position's notable and cited content. By making separate articles each catering to a particular POV, you may avoid conflict between editors, but you do the reader a disservice. Some readers are likley to read just the one article, which devoid of a balanced NPOV, is unfair. If the article is too long, then consider trimming out the fat... if there is no fat to trim, then maybe it is ok to be long... or maybe the article needs to be split up, but not based on the POV of the content. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 02:04, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I disgree. If you want to neutral article, you should call it "Evidence for Apollo Moon Landings." Within such an article you could give the official NASA story, as well as the "independent" evidence. The two types of evidence could be clearly separated, and it could be mentioned that some people do not believe the official evidence because of conspiracy theory reasons. If such an article were to grow so large that it needed to be split in two, so be it. As is clear from the present state of this article, though, this will probably never happen. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 08:08, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For everyone saying 'merge', for one thing, the Hoax accusation page is flagged as 'too long', and the consensus is to create sub articles. In addition, this is NOT a sub article of the hoax page - it has nothing to do with the hoax. It's odd to suggest that only hoax advocates are interested in evidence for the Moon landings. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 15:59, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In my opinion, there is nothing to merge, so I don't think that there is need to worry about the hoax page becoming too long.

<dd>Clearly, since you want to suppress factual, verified information. You are also convinced that the only reason someone would want factual information about Apollo is if they are hoax proponents. This article is not about the hoax, it is about evidence. If anything, it should be merged into <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Apollo_b4b9.html" title="Project Apollo">Project Apollo</a>. Both of those pages are too long already though, and there is consensus to split them into sub-articles. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 16:59, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a factual, neutral article of interest to anyone interested in the Apollo program - it is not a hoax article and should not be merged.

<li><b>merge</b> (Apollo moon hoax and Apollo program page) This isn't a separate topic.

The question is to whether this subject matter is (among others) notable enough to have a wikipedia entry. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 18:12, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There. You've demonstrated your bad faith. Since when is the only evidence in determining whether a subject is suitable peer review? Never. These are credible, non-hoax sites that are concerned with independent evidence of the moon landings. That's what you asked for - now follow through, or be exposed for the POV-warrior you are. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 18:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please stop your ridiculous crusade. This page is already too long to merge into any other page, and is filled with well sourced, reliable, factual information. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 19:29, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Reconfirm prior delete or merge salvageable info&#160;!vote</b> I was asked to reconsider the article in the light of further revisions. In my opinion, it still seems to be a POV fork. We shouldn't have competing separate "For" and "Against" articles on the same subject unless there are severe practical space issues (I don't see that here - the use of space and formatting could be far more economical especially with the pruning of unnecessary information). Furthermore even in the same one article the case for each side should be summarized but the article should not be turned into an evidence collection space for each side's cases. Wikipedia is not a soapbox. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 20:04, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is <i>not</i> a POV fork, any more than <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Apollo_b4b9.html" title="Project Apollo">Project Apollo</a> is. It is a list of undisputed evidence, there are no POVs in it. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 20:06, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Then start a NPOV page called Evidence for Apollo Moon landings, as I have suggested to you several times already. While such a new entry would not meet Wikipedia's notability requirements, and might be nominated for AfD, it would not suffer from the other points raised in my AfD nomination that you have so far failed to address despite your large number of posts to this debate. The title of the current page implies that NASA's evidence, as well as that of the thousands of people that were implicated in Apollo or the analysis of data afterwards, are not reliable for some unknown reason that is apparently not related to the Moon landing hoax. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 12:47, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reconfirm prior delete or merge salvageable info&#160;!vote</b> I was also asked to reconsider the article in the light of further revisions. I want to reiterate that I do not have a problem with the content or context or notability of the article in question. What I do have a problem with is segregating it from the hoax article. Maybe this AfD would have been more tolerable to more people if the other article was nominated for deletion and we all voted to merge it's contents here... I dunno. But I am reconfirming my&#160;!vote to merge these two articles, under any name the merging admin chooses. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 20:38, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
