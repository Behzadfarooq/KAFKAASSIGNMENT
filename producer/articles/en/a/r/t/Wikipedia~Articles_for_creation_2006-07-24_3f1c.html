<p>A contemporary of the BAe 748 and Fokker F-27 Friendship, the Handley Page Herald was an unsuccessful attempt at providing a replacement for the ubiquitous Douglas DC-3.</p>
<p>The Herald was designed by Handley Page's Reading facility, which was formerly the Miles Aircraft Company. Bearing a superficial resemblance to the smaller and older Miles Marathon, the Herald originally was powered by four 650kW (870hp) Alvis Leonides Major radial piston engines.</p>
<p>Handley Page optimised the Herald design for operations from underdeveloped airfields with operators which it thought would prefer piston rather than turbine power. The first Herald prototype flew on August 25 1955, a second flew on August 3 1956.</p>
<p>However, by this time the Vickers Viscount had proven the reliability and economical operation of turboprops and consequently Handley Page made the decision to switch to turboprops in May 1957. Both of the original piston powered prototypes were converted with two RollsRoyce Darts in place of the four Alvis Leonides Majors. The first flight of a Herald in the new configuration occurred on March 11 1958. The first Series 100 production Herald flew for the first time on October 30 1959.</p>
<p>Only four Series 100s were built before production switched to the larger capacity and stretched (by 1.09m/3ft 7in) Series 200 in late 1961. The prototype 200 flew for the first time on April 8 1961 and it became the major production model. The only other Herald derivative built was the Series 400, a military version of the 200 for Malaysia, which took delivery of eight.</p>
<p>The Herald failed to attract any significant sales success, its poor sales further contributing to the decline of Handley Page. Herald production ceased in August 1968, while Handley Page collapsed in late 1969.</p>
<p>In 1998 Channel Express in the UK operated what is believed to be the last Herald in service. Registered G-BEYF it is due to retire in March 1999.</p>

<p>On June 28, 2006 New Line Cinema announced the casting of Dakota Blue Richards as the lead role of Lyra Belacqua in the upcoming His Dark Materials: The Golden Compass movie. During the first two weeks of April, 2006, four open casting sessions were held at Cambridge, Oxford, Kendal, and Exeter, England. Dakota went to the Cambridge auditions and, like many other hopefuls, was asked to go to call-backs in London, England where she was subsequently chosen. As of yet, the Sraffies, or His Dark Materials fans, still do not have a picture or statement from Dakota. They eagerly await it. All that is known about Dakota is the afore-stated and that she is a twelve-year-old schoolgirl. Philip Pullman, the author of the series, has commented highly on the casting. "I'm delighted with the casting of Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra. As soon as I saw Dakota's screen test, I realized that the search was over. Dakota has just the combination of qualities that make up the complicated character of this girl, and I very much look forward to seeing the film take shape, with Dakota's Lyra at the heart of it," he said in the announcement. Chris Weitz, the current director, also commented, saying, ‚ÄúDakota made what should have been an extremely difficult decision quite easy. We wanted a completely new face for Lyra, but I was surprised that any young girl, especially one without training, could light up the screen as Dakota does.‚Äù The film is set to start filming on September 4, 2006 and has a US release date of November 16, 2007. Rumored to be involved are Paul Bettany, Nicole Kidman, Claire Higgens, and Adam Godley.</p>

<p>The value of stocks can be estimated based on the unique Vedic Theory of five elements: Panch Tattvas (Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Sky) and three properties: Trigunas (Sattva - Equilibrium; Rajas - Activity; Tamas ‚Äì Inertia).A good stock like a healthy human body contains the five elements and resultant properties in balance and harmony.The stock's elemental composition is intrinsic to Value and a Value Index can be calculated to know the value content in a stock.It can be derived from market and financial data by an algorithm for optimizing term investment return.The combination of Air &amp; sky create the sattva(equilibrium),water &amp; fire create Rajas(Activity) and earth &amp; water create Tamas(Inertia).BIRDINFO Stock Rx ,a blogsite namely www.birdinfostock.blogspot.com for the first time uses this theory to recommend stocks containing value at the current market price and traded on National stock Exchange of India.</p>

<p>Us Dandy Men are an elite group that have an affinity for the finer aspects of life. We celebrate the arts, and display proper conduct when needed. We have the ability to invent a witty idea or comeback at a moments notice, and have the mental capacity to carry on a normally boring conversation for as long as we wish. We change our surroundings to best suit us. We mold people and situations to our preferences, so they will benefit us more than they would in their present condition. Unless carrying on an intellectual conversation, we are generally men of very few words. Despite your mood an appearance of blatant arrogance is required at all times. A knowledge of linguistics in several different languages is a desired trait for a Dandy Man as well. To be truly dandy, one may choose to follow the un-enforced Dandy Man dress code. This consists of conservative, dark attire, presented in a sleek, form fitting way. Dandy Men might also find it desirable to purchase a mask of their choosing. This is also not required. We sincerely hope that this group can teach you something about how to achieve a state of un-interrupted, arrogant, happiness. Thank you and goodbye‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Art, Apathy, Arrogance</p>

<p><b>David Tench</b> is the name of a television advertising program promoting David Tench.</p>
<p>The advertising campaigne is being run by Network 10 in Austrlaia.</p>
<p>His quotes are currently apearing at the end of addvertising breaks. At the momnent Network 10 has not released any further details. More information is due to be released at the big brother grand final 2006.</p>
<p>There is a advertising campainge currently running advertising this new program. The advertising program uses quotes from "David Tench" to interest views and entise them to find out what the program is about. The advertising program begins at the end of advertising breaks.</p>
<p>The normal campaigne runs like this.</p>
<p>The screen goes black and white writing begins to type on the screen. The typing is normaly a quote from "David Tench" but is sometimes a quote from a magazine or newspaper stating somthing like "at last someone real on Television".</p>
<p>Some more recent advertising programs contain a 5 sec long movie of "David Tench's" desk. Showing a huge "in" box and a tiny "out" box.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Some Quotes are as follows</b></p>
<p>"I'm just waiting for the day breaking news is beyond repair!"</p>
<p>"Some people think iPods are good. But anything that can hold 10,000 Britney Spears songs must be evil."</p>
<p>"Why are people so worried about nuclear reactors? If X-Men has taught us anything, it's that mutations can be fun &amp; sexy."</p>
<p>"I don't care how nice the song is, I'm not going to catch Ben Lee's disease. I've already had it twice and it takes ages for the rash to go away."</p>
<p>"It's essential to preserve our rainforests. Future generations need something to log."</p>
<p>"If a tree falls in a forest and there's nobody around to hear it, it's probably safe to log a bit more."</p>
<p>"Now we've harpooned the Japanese, let's go wax some Brazilians."</p>
<p>"I always thought the Socceroos were sissys. But what great sissys. Go the Socceroos."</p>
<p>"People wonder whether Britney Spears marriage is in trouble. Does she realise she's married to Kevin Federline?"</p>
<p>"I think gay people should be allowed to marry, but only if they're of opposite gender. For example, Ellen DeGeneres can marry Sir Ian McKellen."</p>
<p>"How long do I have to wait to take the Socceroos flag out of my car window?"</p>

<ul>
<li>Tim - Bobby Auyeung</li>
</ul>
<p>Tim is a executive forensic guy. Iono how to translate that. He leads and trains his team to different crime scenes to retrieve evidence, do experiements, and go to court as a professional person. (don‚Äôt know how to translate that either), helping the police force solve crimes. He is calm, smart, strong in noticing things and leads his team to cracking numerous cases in which he gains fame.</p>
<p>When Tim was young, his mother was really sick. One time, his father made an accident, causing tim‚Äôs mother to die from poison. When the police asked, tim‚Äôs father claimed it was an accident. Tim remembered that moment and for a long time, he didn‚Äôt like his father.</p>
<p>The same thing happened to him. His wife was paralyzed and had cancer. One day, his wife ate something that Tim gave her and she died. Sam suspected Tim.</p>
<p>Right when Tim had no idea what to do, Tim‚Äôs father suddenly admitted that he killed his daughter-in-law. Tim saw something wrong with the evidence and found the real murderer. Tim was touched by his father and asked his father once more of he killed his mother. He found out that he had mistaken his father for a long time and they got over the past.</p>
<p>In many cases, because of Tim‚Äôs intelligence, You (yoyo) was amazed by his work and uncontrollably fell for him. Right when Tim thought it was time to put down the past and start a new relationship, Tim was involved in a case in which all evidence seems to point to him as the murderer. Would Tim prove himself innocent?</p>
<ul>
<li>Leung Siu Yau ‚Äì Yoyo Mung</li>
</ul>
<p>Yoyo is a police officer (high level one). Because she lost her mother at a young age, her father was like a mother and was very protective of yoyo and her brother.</p>
<p>Workwise, Yoyo and Tim were partnered together in many cases. Yoyo‚Äôs way of solving cases is not letting go any suspects, which was different from tim‚Äôs. Tim believed in slowly and precisely examining all evidence to make sure that nobody is wrongly accused. Sometimes, even when Yoyo is about to press charges, Tim would suggest that what he said was wrong and ask to look at the case again, causing yoyo to get really mad.</p>
<p>Yoyo and Sam broke up and continued with her work. At this time, she bumped into her old lover, Jeung. Because Jeung was involved in a case, he lost his ambition. Yoyo, in helping to get his ambition back, decides to help jeung solve the case. With the help of Tim, the real murderer was put into jail.</p>
<p>At the same time, yoyo‚Äôs father was suspected of killing Hing Jung (dunno who he is). Tim and Sam re examined the evidence, and finally found the real murderer. The evidence showed that yoyo‚Äôs father was just a scapegoat. Yoyo was very thankful for what Tim did and slowly started to like him.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sam ‚Äì Frankie Lam</li>
</ul>
<p>As a kid, sam lost his parents and grew up with only his sister at ‚Äúyi tong ji ga‚Äù (I think like an orphanage.) Sam hung out with the wrong people and became really bad. He even got a tattoo on his arm, becoming part of a gang. Once, Sam‚Äôs sister saved Sam causing herself to be hurt by sam‚Äôs enemy. From that day on, sam awoke from his dream and went back to being good and studied med.</p>
<p>Right now, Sam became a famous ‚Äúfat yi‚Äù and writer. Besides work, he does a special voluntary program to help the society.Sam and his sister‚Äôs husband are also very good friends.</p>
<p>Sam was attracted by yoyo‚Äôs ‚Äújing yi gum‚Äù (kinda like fighting for the good kinda thing) and they went out. In everybody‚Äôs eyes, they are a perfect match but at the end they broke up ‚Äúpeacefully‚Äù. Afterwards, Sam started to have feelings with the young and cute ‚Äúding ding‚Äù or Linda. Both of them are made for each other but, unexpectedly, linda‚Äôs love for sam brought her to danger.</p>
<p>Lum Ding Ding ‚Äì Linda Chung Linda, because of work purposes, met Sam. Later on she realized that the writer that she liked was sam and fell in love with him.</p>
<p>In work, Sam always encouraged Linda and Sam was attracted to Linda‚Äôs happy personality. After being together for awhile, they started to like each other and became a couple.</p>
<p>In the city, numerous murder cases were happening the deaths were similar to Sam‚Äôs novels. Linda found some evidence that leads to the murderer, causing her to be in danger.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sum Hong ‚Äì Raymond Cho</li>
</ul>
<p>Ray is under Yoyo. When Yoyo became his superior, ray was unhappy with yoyo‚Äôs way of treating her team. But in a case, Yoyo jumped into the water first to arrest a man, causing ray to look at her from another perspective and respect her. After cooperating together, ray also found that yoyo was very serious about work, smart, and understands her team‚Äôs feelings.</p>
<p>But because Yoyo insists of having Jeung in his team, Ray was not happy. Later, because of Yoyo helping Jeung out, Ray completely changed his perspective on Yoyo. He also hoped that under Yoyo‚Äôs leadership, their team would be the ‚Äúbest of the best‚Äù.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yvonne ‚Äì Florence Kwok</li>
</ul>
<p>Yvonne is also in the forensic department. In the eyes of everybody, she is a happy married woman, having a great relationship with her husband but Yvonne wouldn‚Äôt easily have children due to an incident that happened in her childhood.</p>
<p>Yvonne‚Äôs family was poor when she was young. Her parents were forced to give Yvonne and her sister to her uncle/aunt to take care of us. In the end, yvonne‚Äôs sister was abused to death by them. Because of this incident, Yvonne was hit hard and in her heart, it created a dark shadow.</p>
<p>When Yvonne comes across a cause involving child abuse, she would be very ‚Äúgik dong‚Äù and gets really mad at the suspect. Yvonne, because of this, didn‚Äôt want to have children. But because of this, it gave her husband a reason to have an affair, ending in a divorce.</p>

<p><i>Anopheles culicifacies</i> sensu lato is one of the major malaria vector found mainly in Indian subcontinents and responsible for about 65% of malaria cases in India specially in rural areas. It prefers to bite on cattles and rarely bite human but due to very high density it is able to maintain malaria transmission. The <i>An. culicifacies</i> is now known to be species-complex consisting of 5 sibling species--species A, B, C, D and E which is distinguishable on the basis of banding pattern in polytene chromosome. Species A and D are efficient malaria vector species and species B is poor vector or non-vector. <i>An. culicifacies</i> is known to be resistant to all commonly used insecticides (DDT, BHC, malathion) including synthetic pyrethroids which poses serious challenge to malaria control programme.</p>

<p><br />
The Volkswagen RV Code inline four cylinder engine was manufactured from 1987-1992 and saw duty in the popular Golf and Jetta of the time. The engine retained the traditional 8 Valve, single overhead cam design that had been popular with VW engines since the mid 1970s. A replacement for the GX Code 4 cylinder engine, the RV code engine saw a 15 horsepower increase over it's predacessor. Largely due to Volkswagen's Digifant engine management system, the RV code engine saw increased power with better fuel economy. Digifant used a common fuel rail with four fuel injectors, each firing at the same time. The older CIS (Continuous Injection System) fuel injection system used on the GX engine was slower to react to changes in the operating environment.</p>
<p>The RV Code engine has enjoyed a reputation for durability and reliability. As the engine retains a common design to other Volkswagen 4 cylinder engines, parts and service are inexpensive and easily performed.</p>
<p>The RV code engine was fitted to the Golf CL, GL, GTI and Jetta GL models. A small number of 1990 Model Year Jetta GLIs built for the Canadian Market were fitted with the 1.8L RV engine, however they are rare vehicles and highly deisreable to collectors.</p>
<p>The RV engine also had a higher performance spinoff; the PF Code engine. The only difference between the RV and PF engines was the use of a freer flowing exhaust manifold which allowed for a 5 horsepower increase.</p>

Peter Baxter is currently President of Slamdance Inc., President of Slamdance Media Group and a filmmaker in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In 1995 Baxter co-founded Slamdance as an independent alternative to the Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Since its inception, Baxter has been responsible for developing and maintaining all areas of Slamdance including the Festival organization, On The Road screening events, a top-ranked screenplay competition, finance and business affairs. As Slamdance‚Äôs President, he has built a potent and unique American brand synonymous with the discovery of emerging filmmaking talent that includes Marc Forster (MONSTER‚ÄôS BALL) and Chris Nolan (MEMENTO). Baxter also put in place a digital film production initiative dubbed $99 Specials, from which has developed the Bravo networks hit series SIGNIFICANT OTHERS. In 2004, Slamdance received more than 2,800 film entries, 1,500 screenplays and went On The Road in three continents. NPR‚Äôs Elvis Mitchell has called Slamdance ‚Äúmore than a festival and less than a movement‚Äù.</p>
<p>Peter made his start in film with the short documentaries VISIONS OF LONDON and DERBY DAY after completing postgraduate studies in the fine arts from St. Catherine‚Äôs College, Oxford University. In 1994 he moved to the United States and directed Martin Sheen in a short film called THE GARDEN. He next produced the theatrically distributed feature LOSER that the Los Angeles Times film critic, Kevin Thomas, called a ‚Äú‚ÄôRebel Without A Cause‚Äô for the 90‚Äôs.‚Äù</p>
<p>In 2004, Baxter launched the distribution and talent management entity Slamdance Media Group.</p>
<p>In 2005 Baxter began a new Games initiative for Slamdance as well as producing the independent dramatic feature Big Fat Lady starring William Atherton, D.W. Moffet and Gil Bellows.</p>
<p>In 2006 Baxter produced and directed Wild In The Streets, a feature documentary about Royal Shrovetide Football.</p>

<p>Dane Dickinson or daniel as he has become known was born in 1985 to the loving american parents Warren and Thera Dickinson. From a young age Daniel embraced American traditions and is now knowen as a staunch patriot of his homeland. When Daniel turned 4 Wazza and Tez made the decision to move away form Denver Colorado and reside in Wellington New Zealand.</p>
<p>As a young lad, playing softball and frequently attending church school on sunday mornings, daniel soon became part of New Zealands open policy on immigrants, with his neighbours welcoming both himself and his family and often extending invitations for get togethers and barbeques.Daniel was proud of his heritage, but also tried his hand at becoming a maori, which failed significantly.</p>
<p>Skipping a few years, following attending Wellington College and unfortunately failing bursary, Daniel let his long waivy black hair down and ventured down into the deep south, to firstly attempt a bridging course before being accepted to study science. It was here that he began to flourish, and by 2006 Daniel had accumulated an impressive B- grade point average. At this stage Dane has set his sights on a career as a secondary school science teacher but his options are wide open and the world is his oyster.</p>
<p>In 2003 whilst attending a beer fueled teenage keg party in Kelburn, Wellington, Daniel caught the attention of a young indigenous girl named Mahuru. The sparks soon began fly and within a few months the pair were inseperable. However in 2005 a scandal emerged regarding an argument the two had. Rumour has it Daniel physically struck her and she fled the scene in tears. However these rumours cannot be verified.</p>
<p>Dane has also become increasingly interested in all things aeronautical and he has even begun a 'Gliding' phase. This hobby looks set to become a big part of this impressive youngster's future however he has been known to be somewhat flippant and often chops and changes with his views. But for the time being Dane is sailing the skies and loving it.</p>
<p>Dane has also been outspoken with his views on religion. Despite his Christian upbringing Daniel has renounced catholisim and instead has adopted islam. He now reads the Koran for several hours a day. So critics argue that Dano's anti-christian sentiments might stem from a early childhood experience involving a drunkern priest named John Bain III.</p>

The term Gentleman of Crime is a nickname used to describe a comic book criminal whose costume consists of a suit, tie and (in some cases) a hat, rare among comic books due to most villains using bodysuits and other flashy costumes. The most prominent criminals in this category (and the ones for whom the term was created) are the enemies of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>, more specific</p>

<p>Yum Tong Siu, born in Guangzhou, China in 1943, has been the dominant figure in the mathematics of several complex variables, for a quarter-century. He has mastered techniques at the interfaces between complex variables, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. For example, he applied estimates of the complex Neumann problem and the theory of multiplier ideal sheaves to algebraic geometry, in order to resolve various conjectures.</p>
<p>Siu‚Äôs education included a BA in mathematics from the University of Hong Kong, M.A. from the University of Minnesota and Ph.D. from Princeton University, in the period 1963 ‚Äì 1966. He started his academic career as Assistant Professor in Purdue and Notre Dame Universities, but rose fast in the ranks and became full Professor at Yale and then Stanford Universities. In 1982 he joined Harvard as Professor and was subsequently awarded the William Elwood Byerly Chair which he has held since 1992. In addition he also chaired the Harvard Mathematics Department in 1996-1999.</p>
<p>Dr. Siu‚Äôs accomplishments led to academician stature in various American and international academies, viz., the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (foreign member), the Academia Sinica in Taiwan, and The Goettingen Academy of Sciences. He has received numerous recognitions including invited addresses at three International Congresses of Mathematicians (Helsinki, 1978; Warsaw, 1983; Beijing, 2002); Bergman Prize of the American Mathematical Society; honorary doctorates at the universities of Hong Kong and Bochum, Germany. He had also served as Associate Editor of the Annals of Mathematics, and Editor of the Journal of Differential Geometry.</p>
