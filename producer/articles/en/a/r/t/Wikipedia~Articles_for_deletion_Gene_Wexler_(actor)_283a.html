<p>Appeared in one movie and died, apparently with no real role in the movie otherwise. I don't think this qualifies as notability. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 18:13, 6 November 2006 (UTC) "keep" I think this article should be cleaned up, but I see no reason to delete it- keep Stumblemonkey</p>
<p><b>Strong Keep</b>IF YOU DELETE THIS, I will personally feel the need to file a complaint with the owners of Wikipedia because GENE WEXLER is an amazing person and he is the only person that I can think of that deserves to have his own "section" to say the least on Wikipedia. So if you delete this or want it deleted, THINK AGAIN. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 151.204.157.62 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_151.204.157.62_2472.html" title="Special:Contributions/151.204.157.62">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b>I completely disagree with the previous statement. Gene Wexler should be kept on wikipedia for his obvious importance and contribution to society. Nicholas' Gift was a key part of the movement to help support organ donation. Gene Wexler played the young boy, Nicholas, who is possibly the most crucial character in the show. While only having a small part in terms of time, his importance to the movie could not have been more crucial. The only action that should be taken against this wikipedia page is expansion. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.201.html" title="User:205.188.116.201">205.188.116.201</a> 20:53, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Strong Keep</b>-This article can admittedly use cleanup (and I am willing to do it). But the fact is Wexler is an actor with an important role in the movie. And as per the above editor, the movie and more specificly Wexler has made an impact on society. 68.193.95.73 20:54, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>-The argument for deletion is false. This article is very notable as Wexler has made a large impact on society. His role in the movie, although short, flashes back various times. His role is vital in the movie and the plot would be lost without him. Also, he is an established musician, taking part in a variation of Stomp and has been in many musicals and dramas. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.193.95.73 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.193.95.73_96ca.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.193.95.73">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Gene is not only been talented enough to be cast as a lead role in a film, his work besides Jamie Lee Curtis has put him in the same "club", if you will as Dan Akroyd, Tim Allen, Bette Midler, Lindsay Lohan, Chad Micheal Murray, and many others. Wexler's performance inspired children and adults alike to be organ donors, and one may argue that a TV movie may be more widely viewed than a movie in theatres, being that it is offered for free on TV. The point of the previous statement is, if Ben Afflect and erroneous actors and actresses get their names mentioned on Wikipedia, why does someone who has affected a subject so important, such as Gene, deserve to have their entry deleted.

<p><b>KEEP THIS ARTICLE</b> Though the movie was only a TV movie, it still raised much awareness about organ donation. I know a few people who were impacted by this movie and became organ donors themselves. It was interesting to read about the actor who played Nicholas and what he is doing now. Maybe we will see more of him in the future. He did a pretty good job, so i suggest you keep this article!</p>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>: Just because it was only one small part, doesn't mean it wasnt significant. a part is a part, no matter the size. The film, along with Wexler, helped bring transplant awareness up.

<dd>WIkipeadia isn't about awareness of organ donation, cancer, or upcomming actors. Or advertising or making people feel good. It's an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>. It's about knowledge and information. Gene's main claim to fame is a minor role in a TV movie from 8 years ago. Should Gene get his big break or become a notorious murderer or something actually of notoriety I'm sure we'd be happy to have an article on him. Right now I think I get more hits on Google, and I think I've had more screen time from back when I lived in Chicago - and I'm not an actor. I'm just some guy.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobovski_2c2e.html" title="User:Robovski">Robovski</a> 06:05, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
