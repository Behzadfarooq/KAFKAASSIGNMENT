<p>It seems to be a person that doesn't exist. No English Bible I've searched has Aviad untranslated (and as far as I can see, the Isaiah passage is the only place where it would be). In addition, no google hits other than Wikipedia mirrors had anything about Aviad being the peace minister of David or anything like that. The article seems to interpret the Isaiah passage in a strange, incorrect way. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimBentley_fb12.html" title="User:TimBentley">TimBentley</a> 00:28, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>, nice page, but its filled with loads of inaccurate information, and fancruft (Iris doesn;t have a last name!).

<li><b>Strong delete</b>, I've already deleted inaccurate information concerning Megaman Zero from the article. The rest just seems to be fan material, as I cannot verify any of this Thorne nonsense at Megaman Network or other Megaman fan sites. (P.S. It would seem some of the "fancruft" has leaked on to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Mega_Man_X_characters_20ad.html" title="List of Mega Man X characters">List of Mega Man X characters</a> too.

<dd>Alright, let me try another route here. Regarding non-notability, it is, if I remember Wiki’s policy, NOT policy to delete something purely for being non-notable, but instead to mark it as a stub for future expansion. The section regarding webpage notability states that a webpage need only meet one of a list of criteria to be considered notable. In that list is the following: “The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.”</dd>
<dd>As stated in another location, the Bananphone flash animation created by Dave Teatro, original hosted on TFS, was later posted at Ebaum’s World, a page which is well known (434 on Alexa’s listing <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.ebaumsworld.com" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.ebaumsworld.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.ebaumsworld.com</a>), and which, by Wiki standards, must be notable, else the entry (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebaum" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebaum" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebaum</a>) on eBaum would’ve been removed by now. Therefore, on the grounds that TFS is the source of orrigional and notable content, I request that the article not be marked for deletion, but instead as a stub, whereupon, I don’t doubt, forum members from TFS will expand on it.</dd>
<dd>This will also be my last attempt at defending, so please, give it some honest consideration--and reconsideration if you've already voted--on the merits I've presented.Worloq 04:15, 14 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, but ebaum reposts just about anything flash. I don't think ebaumsworld means a whole lot for notability.</dd>
<dd>And I believe you are mistaken concerning "stubbing" a non-notable article. An article is marked as a stub when it is lacking information and could greatly benefit from some extra information. Not when the subject is not notable. -- <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERediahs_3520.html" title="User:Rediahs">Rediahs</a> 04:17, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see the POV. These are (mostly) <b>very</b> commonly used phrases by football fans. Providing a list, while it does have editorial decisions in it, doesn't condone the nicknames or suggest they are correct, which I would think would be a necessary component of POV. Anyone can add any nickname they've heard of here. Notability should probably be a consideration, but I promise you, most of these are well known. -<a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbarr_c295.html" title="User:Jcbarr">Jcbarr</a> 02:49, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unverifiable, probable hoax. A week ago I left messages on the article's talk page and the talk pages of the editors (an anon IP and an account which has only made edits about this album) asking for sources but none have been forthcoming. No apparent Google hits for the name or for any new Delta Goodrem album of this description. I can't find any references on Sony's site or Delta's <a href="http://www.deltagoodrem.com" class="external text" title="http://www.deltagoodrem.com" rel="nofollow">official site</a>. The only reference I can find is a thread (which was started the same day the article was created) on her official forum where someone states there is a rumour about such an album and asks people to make mock-up album covers <a href="http://forums.deltagoodrem.com/index.php?showtopic=193782&amp;st=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://forums.deltagoodrem.com/index.php?showtopic=193782&amp;st=0" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. The person who started the thread later cites this Wiki article as the source of the rumour. And the so-called album cover appears to be a mock-up of a picture on Delta's official site.

<dd>SwapSimple is an entirely unique peer-to-peer trading concept, making a dramatically positive difference in the lives of students across the United States, and it deserves it's place in the Wikipedia, just as Peerflix, Netfilx, and the like do. SwapSimple's trading concept was developed in 2003, and began providing service in late 2004.</dd>

<li>This is a book exchange company. Okay, actually book-and-other-stuff, but it's a company.

Despite the claim above, I can find nothing "unique" about their business model.

<li><b>Keep</b> FYI - all the press coverage of SwapSimple was unsolicited. Just today I (Elliot Hirsch, President, SwapSimple, Inc.) was contacted by the Boston University Free Press for an interview regarding SwapSimple. Also, as mentioned above, the Utne Reader - a large national magazine, chose to write about us in one of their columns because they believe in what we are doing, and understand that we are only in the beginning phases of development. I believe that the value of this encyclopedia would be greatly diminished if you only allow mentions of businesses who are "large" and well known. That would be a very boring, biased, and narrow view of the world. We have already helped hundreds of students afford the textbooks they need for their educations. Because we have not yet helped thousands or millions - does that still diminish the benefit to those who have used the service - or somehow mean that we simply do not exist? --<a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwapSimple_cd8c.html" title="User:SwapSimple">SwapSimple</a> 2:15pm, 14 January 2006 (CST)

<li>I understand it's frustrating to spend time and effort on an article that you believe should be on wikipedia, only for it to be listed for deletion. However, please be aware that you cannot argue wikipedia's current accepted policies on the notability of companies here, as it won't help your case. There have already been a majority of <i>keep</i> votes (including mine), not because we disagree with the policy, but because we believe your company is indeed notable enough to stay on wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMushin_04d4.html" title="User:Mushin">Mushin</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMushin_bcc2.html" title="User talk:Mushin"><sup>talk</sup></a> 14:43, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

There are lists for every year since 1935, with the odd exception of 1951.

The reason they are part of separate pages instead of on the year page (as Quarl erroneously claims they are in general--they aren't, and if a specific year page has any leaders, they should be moved off it to the appropriate separate list) because the lists are huge (especially state leaders, which is the set of lists that gets the most attention). -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 07:53, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Brad Warner, bass player for this band, wrote a major book called Hardcore Zen. So, although the band itself is not a major one, it does include one member who went on to do a major piece of work. And his membership in the band is relevant to the book. So this page should remain.</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Somehow simply putting the word "list" in front of an article seems to make our normal standards vanish. Where to begin: is this simply meant to be a list of <i>every</i> shock site? If so, delete per Not as above. Since there don't appear to be any standards applied to the external links, delete per NOT a linkfarm. While I suppose that there is some micro-micro stub of a list under there that could be meet WP:NPOV and WP:CITE, it would probably be better served as a category. This will almost certainly prove impossible to maintain, impossible to verify, and what's the encyclopedic aim in this list anyway?

<li><b>Keep</b> - I know that I am biased since I'm the one who created this article, but Yehoodi is fairy significant to swing dancers and is well-known among swing dancers internationally. It is more than just a web site, so searches for "Yehoodi.com" are incomplete. It also consists of a jazz music archive and radio station. A Google search for Yehoodi brought in over 76,000 links and a Yahoo search showed almost 29,000 hits, so the &lt;6000 external links listed above is misleading.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> for strong connection to The Shizz website and considerable difference in policy and quality control from OCRemix ScrewedThePooch 17:20, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> for overall importance in video game remix community, as well as the vital purpose it serves as a way to improve and receive criticism for music works. If it is removed, OCRemix should not be on here either. Alexa is a poor judge of a website's relevance. <a href="../../../z/p/a/User%7EZpatterson_a646.html" title="User:Zpatterson">Zpatterson</a> 18:55, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It has a completely different purpose than OCRemix, so it shouldn't be compared as if they were the same. VGMix is extremely important in helping musicians get their work out in the open, and letting people give criticism so that the musician may become better. nickthenewbie</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As of right now (Jan 19), there are just shy of 11,000 registered users. I'm not sure how many are required before a site is 'notable,' but there it is. It's a niche audience, to be sure, but it's a palpable one.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Not only does this site help less-established remixers get critiques on their work, it was founded as the result of a content dispute over at OCR, from some prominent mixers there. (Note: Not a precisely accurate description, but it can be argued that without OCR, which already has an article, this page would never have existed. <a href="../../../m/o/0/User%7EMo0_25cf.html" title="User:Mo0">Mo0</a>[<a href="../../../m/o/0/User_talk%7EMo0_eb76.html" title="User talk:Mo0">talk</a>] 23:24, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Expand</b>. Just pointing out firstly that I was not directed here by anyone. In as much as one would consider the video game music fan arrangement scene notable enough to be counted here (I would argue it is given the fanbase it has), VGMix doesn't seem to fail notability as it's the second most frequented music site in that scene behind OverClocked ReMix. Many musicians at OverClocked ReMix frequent both sites, and downloads for the most popular music there goes into the thousands, possibly beyond the 10,000s. The article is in viable stub condition and should be expanded in order to further establish its notability. - <a href="../../../l/i/o/User%7ELiontamer_20aa.html" title="User:Liontamer">Liontamer</a> 07:39, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Because I can't find this list anywhere other than in the magazine itself (i.e., as a non-subscriber, nowhere). OK, so that's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> not <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. But in any case, it <i>is</i> listcruft. All it tells us is the names of women who have appeared in a soft-porn magazine. Do you really think Britannica would include that if only it wasn't paper? I sure as hell don't. This is "indiscriminate information" per <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a>. I don't buy the comparison with Playboy lists either because Playboy is a household name and in the 60s and 70s was much more than just a wank mag, it carried short stories by some of the greats of Science Fiction, for instance, so a list of people <i>other than models</i> who appeared in Playboy would actually be interesting in a way that this list simply is not, and if the models list is what you want to go by, here's a quick reality check: consider who is the Marilyn Monroe de nos jours, and see if you can find her in this list. Playboy has featured Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and others; in this list I can't even find anyone I've heard of, let alone a household name - like I said above, almost none of these women are notable enough to have their own articles. There is nothing in this list, not even trivia, which adds in any way to the sum of human knowledge either about these women or about the magazine, and anything encyclopaedic which was added would probably be unverifiable anyway. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 20:40, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - Lists of Playboy Playmates I can see, as they typically can get legitimate favourable mainstream exposure (especially in their hometown area). Penthouse Pets I can argue should be considered in the same category, as Penthouse strived for many years to be the equal to Playboy. Perfect 10?? I'm sorry, but to most people that's just another skin mag. The pictures may be of higher quality, and the ladies certainly are very attractive. However, if the list is to be kept, it should be renamed for clarity. <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 22:07, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>For the sake of accuracy, I'll have to disagree with the above categorization. Penthouse magazine is and has been much <i>more</i> "skin mag" oriented, as it has shown explicit sex scenes, urination, etc. Perfect 10 pictorials are topless and artistic nude. A number of P10 models have received "legitimate" exposure, many working as mainstream models and some appearing on television. Additionally, Playboy Special Editions is just a skin mag by any measure, with no articles whatsoever, many editions focusing on college girls or amateurs entirely, but <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Playboy_NSS_models_9b06.html" title="List of Playboy NSS models">that list</a> exists as well. There are also the lists given by Joe Beaudoin Jr. to keep in mind. The Perfect 10 models list represents neither the most hardcore nor the most niche interest of already accepted model lists, and compliments the main Perfect 10 entry. --<a href="../../../a/l/s/User%7EAlsayid_cf2a.html" title="User:Alsayid">Alsayid</a> 06:56, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe that the descriptions on the page are wholly inaccurate of the scale of Lolicon. Basically put, this is drawn, simulated Child Pornography. The links on this page go directly to sites where immense amounts of this stuff are available. Lolicon can also be used in the process of grooming children over the net for Sexual Contact by Pædophiles. Whilst I appreciate that Wikipedia is not censored for minors, and is subject to the US First Amendment (Freedom of the Press), there is a line which can be crossed in my opinion, and this article totally crosses it. How would Wikipedia react if someone created an article which linked directly to a site depicting genuine pædophilia? There would be hell to pay, I suspect. I nominate this article to be deleted. <a href="../../../t/m/a/User%7ETmalmjursson_5155.html" title="User:Tmalmjursson">Thor Malmjursson</a> 17:19, 14 January 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../t/m/a/User%7ETmalmjursson_5155.html" title="User:Tmalmjursson">Talk to me</a></p>

<dd>He may be on a youth or academy contract/scholarship rather than a full professional contract. Alternetively, he might well be a pro, I don't know. I would love to find out, but he is not amongst the 40+ players listed in the club's youth/reserve squad <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?article=233921&amp;lid=Player+Files&amp;title=Reserve+Squad" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?article=233921&amp;lid=Player+Files&amp;title=Reserve+Squad" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> so I can't find out: as I said, <i>there is no evidence</i> that he is a pro. As far as I can make out, there has been no mention of him since July/August 2005. There is nothing on the club website which suggests he is on their books. If Arsenal's own website doesn't have any information about this player, then why should Wikipedia? <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 19:24, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I mean, this could be a real micronation, or not, but there are times when previous articles have been deleted but have turned out to be true (especially me).

<p>Hi, this is Janusz Karpinski. I decided to start this voting for deletion because of how having the aetherometry entry makes Wikipedia look bad. I think the entry should be deleted until literature about aetherometry appears in mainstream scientific publications, or until aetherometry becomes popular and known and can be found in reliable outside descriptions. Right now it just lowers Wikipedia reputation, at least in my surround.</p>
<p>I give three reason why aetherometry entry should be deleted:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Serious not solvable problems with Undue Weight policy</dd>
<dd>2. Serious not solvable problems with Verifiability policy</dd>
<dd>3. Because of above not solvable problems, what is done with the entry causes impoliteness, unscientific behaviour from Wikipedia administrators, is unable to get out of same spot ( like wheels turning on ice), and gives bad impression to public.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I will now elaborate these reasons a little.</p>
<p><b>Ad 1.</b> The Undue Weight policy says:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a viewpoint is in the majority, then it should be easy to substantiate it with reference to commonly accepted reference texts;</li>
<li>If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents;</li>
<li>If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article) regardless of whether it's true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I see about the situation of aetherometry is: it has some students and supporters which make very small minority of general population. Outside of this, some neo-Reichian people and some cold-fusion people have said something about it and nobody else. It is not part of culture or counterculture. Nobody in scientific community made an examination or published about it, so none at all majority view is documented. So only thing Wikipedia can say about "viewpoint in the majority" on subject of aetherometry is that there is not any that can be substantiated. Everything else in article would have to be viewpoint of very small minority. How is it possible not to give undue weight to minority viewpoint? You would have to repeat the one sentence about the not being any majority view thousands of times before the policy would let you write even one sentence saying anything about minority view. That's why there is the third point: if the viewpoint is held by an extremely small minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia. Aetherometry has a viewpoint held by very small minority, and which does not have a majority viewpoint.</p>
<p><b>Ad 2.</b> The aetherometry.com website is very large and contains many writings by creators of aetherometry. Many one has to pay for. What I saw uses new language and new way of thinking and is very difficult. I think it is impossible to verify without much understanding of some of these writings whether what is written in the Wikipedia aetherometry entry is accurate portrayal or somebody's interpretation, since there is not an accepted interpretation of aetherometry with which the entry can be compared. It is also impossible to sincerely and scientifically put aetherometry in category as science or not science. I see that many Wikipedia administrators want to say aetherometry is pseudoscience. Pseudoscience means it has been alleged by scientific community to violate the scientific method. Scientific method has to do with how you collect empirical evidence and how you make it the basis for theory. Without studying aetherometry materials and even maybe reproducing experiments it is not possible sincerely and scientifically to evaluate how aetherometry does this, and it has not been alleged anywhere by scientific community. Violation of scientific method may be suspicion that these administrators have, and it may be correct suspicion, but it is just opinion and cannot be verified at this time, because of absence of supporting literature. Some administrators say that aetherometry has been around for 5 years and nobody in mainstream science got interested means it is pseudoscience. But this is also only suspicion, not verifiable. Aetherometry is big and does have new language and mainstream science may see no reason to make effort. Nobody pays mainstream science to make such effort, except in military cases and then it is not always publicized. So I am sorry, but silence of mainstream science is not scientific verification that aetherometry is not science. Wikipedia with its own means cannot verify that aetherometry is science or is not science, and no other means exist.</p>
<p><b>Ad 3.</b> Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales in his Personal Appeal writes: "Thousands of people, all over the world, from all cultures, working together in harmony to freely share clear, factual, unbiased informationÉ". This is very different from what work on the aetherometry entry looks to the world. Work on this entry is full of impoliteness, bitterness, non-factualness and opinion. This is on all sides, and is not fault of those sides. It is fault of not solvable problems with undue weight and unverifiability. As a result, the discussions make Wikipedia administrators look as if more interested in sticking opinion-based label on aetherometry than in learning what aetherometry is. This is a bad thing in encyclopedia, because it does not provide for the public a leadership and example of love of knowledge. When public looks at aetherometry entry, the not solvable problems make Wikipedia administrators look unprofessional, not scientific, not interested in knowledge, and just wanting to force into Wikipedia their own opinion, even when unverified. For what have this? Sincerely, Janusz. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanuszkarp_b09f.html" title="User:Januszkarp">Januszkarp</a> 20:16, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Reply</b>. Hi, this is Janusz. I hope contributions are evaluated on such criteria as truth, honesty, accuracy, strongness of argument, not previous edits. I will be happy to make many edits in future, if I see hope that Wikipedia will have serious, honest attitude to verifiability and scientific accuracy . It does not have such attitude now, and without it I will certainly not participate.

<dd>Currently we have tons of rebuttals as it is. The aetherometrists in fact, (as of the last afd), want this deleted, because it disparages their theory.

<dd>Hi, pardon if I am direct, but I think perhaps you are so wanting to hurt aetherometrists that you forget responsibility as encyclopedia administrator. It is not place of encyclopedia administrators to rebut scientific theory, but only to quote reputable scientific sources, if they exist, that rebut theory on credible scientific basis. Otherwise, it really is simply disparagement. Sorry I have to say this although I am not prejudiced for aetherometry. Disparagement has no place in encyclopedia. To call theory pseudoscience or pseudophysics without quoting respectable sources examining it through credible scientific process is just using power of administrator for own bias. I hope this is not your purpose. Sincerely, Janusz. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanuszkarp_b09f.html" title="User:Januszkarp">Januszkarp</a> 23:19, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've commented to jossi, that cutting Aetherometry loose <i>for now</i>, would at least give Wikipedia a chance to re-set it calibrations on Varification, Peer-Review, Citation and Reference without Aetherometry screaming in its face about the self-archival system used by the Correas as a necessary building block for scientist, one even ISI is now having to re-consider in its value metric. Until such time, the existence of Aetherometry in Wikipedia is simply and open sore to be picked at by everyone not as familiar as you, with the importance of reference when using such an emotionally evocative word such a pseudo. Sincerely I ask you, please re-consider your vote. TTLightningRod 06:53, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, I read some of the aetherometry web page and these people are clearly nuts. They may have gone nuts because they have discovered something important and no-one else will acknowledge it. Or they may just be nuts. Their stuff about the mysteriously charging capacitor seems to be explained by current scientific knowledge, though. They would be much better advised to write within the canons of scientific method and avoid hysterical ad hominem rantings against people they feel have slighted them.

Articles existances can not be justified on the basis that it will balance what there is already. Beside, the last few days when I've read about the subject, I haven't really seen counter answers to the theory, which meens that the theory is not enough known to be criticized. In fact, the citation index, or digital periodicals includes how many times papers have been cited, and this is a good indication of the notability of papers. If we can not criticize papers by using the critics of those in the field, it simply means, that the subject is not notable enought. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 22:07, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b>. I continue to believe, as I did in the first AFD, that this is significant enough as a pseudoscience to warrent a wikipedia article. My basic reasoning for believing so can be <a href="../../../d/r/a/User_talk%7EDragons_flight_cbbc.html#Janusz_question" title="User talk:Dragons flight">read here</a>. In terms of some of the specific criticism rendered here, I would reply that for describing the theory itself there is no more reliable source then the published volumes of its main proponents. I would also object to the standard that describing psuedoscience requires peer review scientific literature. Obviously if something is unfit for publication, it will never be discussed and debated in the peer review context. It is as silly as asking for papers debating the merits of a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">flat Earth</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiromancy.html" title="Chiromancy">chiromancy</a>. However, I agree, there is a response problem. How does one deal with a field where there isn't a published literature of criticisms? Well, I think we can all pretty much agree how an encyclopedia article on this subject ought to read, roughly: Aetherometry is a theory advanced by X that claims Y. It has no significant support in the scientific community as verified by its failure to appear in abstract database Z. Some specific claims are A, B, C; as acknowledged by aetherometry's advocates these conflict with established scientific principles D, E, F. I don't really see any reason to go inventing counter-arguments since the supporters themselves admit to requiring changes to the establised views. Having said all of that, I'm not actually going to vote keep, as I have no intention of personally contributing to the further development of this article. Since it is a topic that has generated such acrimony, I prefer to defer to those involved as to whether they want to see the continued existence of this article. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 23:13, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Second reason to dump it from Wikipedia is; If Aetherometry is EVER uncovered to contain ANY merit, Wikipedia treatment of the material to-date is a serious black mark (especially considering the two books written already by the targets of this extraordinary Wikipedia bias).

<dd>"Keep" the bollocks, and get to work quick on the New Article documenting how it's one of the most complex pseudoscience frauds ever attempted by a couple of pseudoscientests from Canada. Forget Canada, it's actually one of the most complex pseudoscience aether theories of all the world. This new article will be a smash hit for the soon to be faltering popularity of Wikipedia, I guarantee. A most sneaky con, because the perps had been cooking it up for twenty years before they so cleverly pooped it into the Wikipedia. Yes, tens of thousands of carefully crafted pages were used to build the con, that is, before they executed the masterful stoke of offering the bait-n-switch free stuff to Wikipedia. Climbing to the top of the Google charts, where 18 actual people were actually swindled out of 23 dollars and 87 cents Canadian, each! Yes, the greatest con, NOT because of its success as a money swindle, but because so few people actually lost money buying the junk science papers and the perps didn't even recover their cost in staples. The most elaborate con ever, and no one would come forward to persecute the dastardly confidence tricksters after they went to all that trouble.</dd>

Or... are you sure you weren't trying to <i>uphold</i> some group-think there? You shouldn't feel guilty about laughing, a good sense of humor is a great thing.

<dd>Hi, Randwicked, this is Janusz. You say internet is not so serious and to be much cared about. I often hear this view. But you know, many children who want knowledge spend now much time on internet trying to learn, and this is very serious and to be cared about. When my son sees website like aetherometry.com, this is not so serious because he knows this is just point of view and if he has interest he can ask more questions and after while form own judgement. But when he goes to Wikipedia, he wants to take it as model of making of real knowledge. When Wikipedia makes judgement by consensus, what kind of consensus is this? There are very different kinds of consensus. There is consensus of individuals who each judge carefully and in most serious way, from own conscience, own love of truth and own love of justice. This is noble consensus. But there is also consensus of cattle, where people join because of authority of leader or fear. And worse, there is consensus of pogrom, where whole villages by consensus start killing Jews and each individual follows own sadism under excuse that everybody else did the same. These kinds are shameful consensus. When my son sees judgements such as pseudoscience in Wikipedia articles by consensus, I cannot lie and tell him consensus is of noble kind, because I know in my heart that people executing judgement, such as you, did not do it in noble way. I am not saying you are not noble, but these actions in Wikipedia are not noble, and when they influence children and teach them to judge without seriousness and conscience, it is serious and not responsible. I am sorry if I am too direct. Sincerely, Janusz. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanuszkarp_b09f.html" title="User:Januszkarp">Januszkarp</a> 17:12, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I fully understand <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanuszkarp_b09f.html" title="User:Januszkarp">Januszkarp</a>'s exasperation over the long list of items and discussions that are unverified and do not follow <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. That was the reason I started a discussion at Talk:Aetherometry#Current_state_of_article. However, the timing of this AfD and this comment in <b>Ad 2</b>: "<i>Some administrators say that aetherometry has been around for 5 years and nobody in mainstream science got interested means it is pseudoscience. But this is also only suspicion, not verifiable.</i>" seems to indicate you are unhappy with this effort (I am not sure). Anyway, I just wanted to clarify that obviously <b>all</b> consensus in that discussion needs to be based on verifiable references, nothing was meant to be based on suspicions. Our efforts at WP depend on insisting on that principal, as you correctly point out. What seems to have stirred part of your critique must have been my sentence that a theory can be called "pseudoscience", when it purports to be scientific but "<i>(c) the proponents never seriously tried to have it evaluated</i>" (to quote myself). If this is proven in the bounds of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, I contend one can call this theory "pseudoscience". This is to close the "loophole" of a theory avoiding exposure to the scientific community so no "scientific verification that this theory is not science" will ever exist. Now, I might be wrong with my definition (and you can change my mind with a good reference), but there is nothing here that is not supposed to be verifiable. To conclude my rambling, we can write a meaningful article even on such a contentious theory, when we do our homework regarding verifiability! It is just more work digging out the sources compared to a simple Google search... I guess, since I looked at this for only four days, I'm <b>neutral</b> on this AfD. <a href="../../../a/w/o/User%7EAwolf002_16a4.html" title="User:Awolf002">Awolf002</a> 23:37, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi, this is Janusz. You taught me very nice new word, "exasperation". Thank you.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The sentence that you quote from my AfD reasons, that if aetherometry has been public for 5 years and nobody got interested, then it is pseudoscience, was referring not to you but to Pjacobi, who said this in response to me on his talk page. This seems actually complement of your argument, which is that if aetherometry did not try to be evaluated, then it is pseudoscience. So in short, by putting your two arguments together, if nobody evaluated aetherometry because either aetherometry was not interested to be evaluated or nobody was interested to evaluate it, then it is pseudoscience, i.e. it violates requirement, essential to scientific method, of proper iterations and interleavings of experiments, quantifications, hypotheses, and predictions. I am sorry, and I hope I dont offend you, but this logic makes me think of Polish word "kretactwo" (written with little hook under "e"), that means twisting, rotating in order to bypass truth. It is creating untruth sideways, not even an honest lie, but a sideways lie. I dont mean that you personally are "kretacz" - twister - but you are not disagreeing to be involved in Wikipedia "kretactwo". I will explain by giving example why I am exasperated. Look at aetherometry history in past few days. What percent of activity is reverting to category "Pseudoscience"? Every day there is reverting several times, except special treatment of Natalinasmpf, who is "insider". And who does reverting? Who is Randwicked, Constantine Evans, Rlove, No Guru, Batmanand, A bit iffy, TestPilot, Calton, El C, Ducharris, Salsb? Why do they revert? Do they know something about relationship of experiment to theory in aetherometry, or about reputable literature discussing this relationship? If they know, why do they not tell, discuss? I think they know as little as I. So why do they revert, on what basis? Why does Wikipedia administration permit them to do this without basis, and not discipline them for unverifiable claims? To the contrary, many Wikipedia administrators, as you know, do same, and perhaps some of names I mentioned are administrators also!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But this is not all. This reversion, every day several times, is now going on many months. It is just matter of fact, as if erasing claim that aetherometry is pseudoscience is like saying that sun rises in west, a vandalism or craziness. And all this time there is not even smallest verifiable evidence that aetherometry is contrary to scientific method! And all these months administrators and almost-administrators come in and make great effort at "kretactwo", at twisting and rotating truth, in order to make category "Pseudoscience" look legitimate for aetherometry. So FIRST they put category in and make sure it stays in, by constant reverting, and THEN they try to bake a justification! Does Wikipedia policy really permit this? And now you join with your complement to Pjacobi, and Philosophus joins with his trap questions, and maybe a new generation will soon join also and have fresh, better ideas for this "kretactwo". For what all this? To hurt the aetherometrists, as Natalinasmpf said? In my opinion, it is hurting a lot more yourself, Wikipedia, and the readers of Wikipedia that trust it for education. It is similar to corrupt polish politics, which most of all hurts country and its people, and gives example to young generation of future corrupt politicians. I hope you do not interpret this as personal offense and understand better now my exasperation. I think in case of Wikipedia it is situation, not individual people, that takes fault for corruption. Perhaps in case of Poland also, I dont know. But situation of Poland is very complicated, while Wikipedia situation is much simpler and can be fixed, in my view, by not accepting such problematic articles.

<li><b>Delete</b> I've expended a great deal of energy on this article -- one of the prinicple authors of the current version. I don't agree that Aetherometry is at all crazy, but it's certainly intellectually shocking. Whatever my judgement about the subject, Janusz is right. Without secondary literature on both sides there's no way to satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> so even if the article was a perfectly accurate description of the subject there'd be nothing to reference against but a complete survey of the primary literature. So this is the kind of article Wikipedia was just not meant to do, and that's alright. I didn't really understand this in the last AfD when I voted to keep.

If it appears, maybe then I am in error that claims about aetherometry are not verifiable. But statement is a bit surprising after so many months and needs some additional information. What are these journals and who writes in them about aetherometry? Why are they not referred to in Wikipedia aetherometry entry? I would like, if possible, also opinion of Dr. Connolley about this. Dr. Connolley, do you know about these journals, what they are and what they say? Are they reputable and in accordance with Wikipedia verifiability policy of minority and majority view?

<li><b>Comment.</b> Hi, this is Janusz. I think Dr. Connolley's position is very correct. People who vote to keep article should take responsibility for their vote, otherwise it is just cheap words. They have to be able to make commitment to sanity of article that they vote to include in encyclopedia. "Sanity" means reputability, honesty and verifiability. It means that no statements should be permitted that are not supported by reputable external sources, for both of majority views and minority views. So far, Natalinasmpf, Obina, Terence Ong, Psychologesetz and GangofOne voted to keep article, so they need to make commitment insuring reputability, honesty and verifiability. How will they insure this? It has never been done in this article before. Perhaps I will write to them personally and ask.

It's quite clear form policy that Wikipedia is not a publisher of firsat instance, either of theories or of their debunking. The most we can say about it from the sources cited in the article (i.e. none) is that it is a theory promoted by a small group of people which has never been subjected to peer-review and is thus not accepted by the scientific community at large. Instead we have this long and rambling argument which belongs on a personal website, like the theory itself. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 19:18, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, mostly per Pgio. My reasoning: we don't need to go on about peer-reviewed journals; a quick Google search reveals that no one, except a few bloggers, have written about "Aetherometry"-- and they don't count. Forget science. The article is nothing more than an absurdly in-depth review of a website with an Alexa rank of two million. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 01:27, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Google count of 40,000 means it is notable enough. People will look to Wikipedia to find out what is known about this topic, and what is merely asserted or alleged. If we can't verify facts, we can report on their absence. For example, "No paper on Aetherometry has ever been published in a peer reviewed journal", which, by-the-way, is exactly what the current article says. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 01:32, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is unfortunate that we can't always write the articles we want. It would be great to educate the public on all kinds of issues, but this here is an encyclopedia. There does not exist the material that would allow us to write an encyclopedia article on Aetherometry; and since we cannot, we shouldn't try. The only kind of Wikipedia article that might belong at wiki/Aetherometry would be an article on the website, which is what we currently have, don't kid yourself. But the website itself is not notable enough to deserve this treatment. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 01:45, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. Interesting to read about. For those who are concerned with the 'reliability' and 'reputation' of Wikipedia, I see it as a place that has something to say about everything. Now for real information i could reference in a paper, I go to written books and published encyclopaedias. I'm not allowed to reference Wikipedia. But I am appreciative of the things that can be read about, whether or not they are congruent with scientific theory blah blah blah.

<li><b>Delete</b>, sadly. I think Janusz is right: for scientific topics, if there is no standard, generally accepted literature to work with, the topic does not belong in Wikipedia. I don't understand why the original submitter of the entry was not simply told this, at the very start, and the entry promptly, courteously and neutrally deleted. There is some crucial piece of procedure missing here. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankZappo_ec43.html" title="User:FrankZappo">FrankZappo</a> 16:10, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aetherometry_026a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aetherometry">this</a> is your answer. People have bent over backwards to be fair to this article, possibly to the point where they can't see the light. For me there is one crucial question to answer: is this about a scientific theory, or about a kook website? If the former, it has never been published in a reputable peer-reviewed journal; deletion is a no-brainer. If the latter, it is so far short of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> that again it's pretty clear-cut. Much of the argument above seems to be defending Wikipedia as a source for publishing critique of the theory - but that assumes the scientific theory interpretation, and not only is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a publisher of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original thought</a>; as a scientific concept it falls at the first hurdle, well before you get into the merits of how <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> the article is, or the edit wars, or other questions.

<p><b>Comment</b>. Hi, I would like to make observation/question. With topic such as aetherometry, with no secondary acceptable literature, all information comes from people who read primary sources. It cannot be certain if what they say is not just their interpretation, but it is certain that without them there cannot be entry, because there is no secondary information at all. In case of aetherometry such person now is Pgio. And there also cannot be entry without majority scientific view described. This job in case of aetherometry is completely impossible, but much of it rests on shoulders of Dr. Connolley. There are also people constantly doing work to clean from entry unverifiable bias inserted every day, and FrankZappo is one such person. Here is situation I want to comment about: I see voters on this page coming in and just saying "entry should stay because is interesting" or "entry should stay because is high on Google". These voters do not suggest any solution to problems of verifiability and they cannot do job of Pgio or Dr. Connolley in work on entry. Do their votes count same as votes of people without whose work entry could not exist? If they do, then people like Pgio, Dr. Connolley, or FrankZappo, because they care about quality of entry, are in position of forced labor. Even if they say "we prefer entry deleted because we are in impossible situation", anybody can walk in and say "no, you must continue to be in impossible situation because I think entry is interesting or high on Google". In this way people who have passion to keep entry "sane", as Dr. Connolley said, and who because of passion do work on entry, can become prisoners of anybody who comes in and frivolously says "keep".

Every edit on it just leads to endless repetitious insanity.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The thing is, Stonehenge is 46Kb even without this. By all means vote to delete it as I don't think it adds anything to the article that couldn't be said in a sentence, merging it back in just wastes a load more valuable bytes I could use to say other things about the monument in my view.

<li><b>Comment</b> The subject of this vote (i.e. an article about the individual John Warren) seems to be getting confused with the subject of "ex-convicts becoming schoolteachers in Australia". The latter may well be notable enough for an article, and it is this subject that the quoted source relates to. Nobody has written a book on John Warren, rather he appears in a book on the subject of ex-convict schoolteachers. Creating an article for each person mentioned in a book on a notable subject seems to be stretching the notabilty test. With regard to the notability test of <i>"Has the person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in the specific field?"</i>, in what way is John Warren's contribution widely recognized (as opposed to the contribution made by the ex-convict schoolteachers as a whole)? <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigerShark_1e1f.html" title="User:TigerShark">TigerShark</a> 12:22, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think <a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigerShark_1e1f.html" title="User:TigerShark">TigerShark</a> is disputing the validity of the field, just Warren's notability within it. Until he got a bit part in a 1983 book, he seems to have been completely unremembered, in any field. How can that be construed as "widely recognised"?

<li>Okay, so the field is valid. And anybody wishing to do research in the field "ex-convict school-teachers of Western Australia" would have only 39 individuals to study, and so are hardly likely to dismiss any particular individual as not making a significant contribution to the field. I assert that 100% of people that ever have or ever will do research in the field of "ex-convict school-teachers of Western Australia" will recognise Warren as having made a significant contribution to that field. To the extent that "widely" can be used accurately in what is obviously a narrow field, I should say that 100% is wide enough.

<dd>Apparent "sheer sophistry" is bound to accur when you're forced to justify the existence of an article against a criterion that you think is rubbish. I have had that blessed sentence quoted at me numerous times on this page; since it is apparently the be-all and end-all of notability, I have no option but to work within its constraints. If you don't think the "specific field" is appropriate, then I'd like to see you provide a definition of "specific field" that doesn't result in a circular definition of notability.</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, Rica Erickson thinks that ex-convict schoolteachers in Western Australia is a sufficiently notable group to write a book chapter about them. You dispute this. On what grounds do you claim to be a better judge of the notability of a Western Australian group than the State's most respected social historian?</dd>
<dd>As for your suggestion that I solicited biased views, I think you're getting dangerously close to assuming bad faith here. In my view, the people who hang around AFD tend to be more likely to have a deletionist outlook. My stated intention was to get input from a wider range of people than the usual AFD crowd. Since the article is Australian, that is a reasonable forum in which to do so. I was very careful to state that I was looking for debate rather than support. What exactly is your objection to that?

<ul>
<li>I absolutely agree. Merging historical figures into books makes no sense. However, this article is about an individual whose only proof of notability seems to be that he is mentioned in this book. Daniel Connor, if mentioned in The Brand On His Coat, should absolutely be <i>mentioned</i> in the article about the book, though if he's notable enough to have his own article, he should have it. As for the Biographical Register of Members of Parliament of Western Australia, I'd say, knock yourself out! I'd argue only that it would conflict with the current apparent scheme of listing them nationally, and not regionally: <a href="../../../m/e/m/Members_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives%2C_1998-2001_dd91.html" title="Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 1998-2001">here's one for 1998-2001</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/m/Members_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives%2C_2001-2004_f999.html" title="Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 2001-2004">here's one</a> for 2001-2004.... Not only are they listed here, but many (if not all) of those members also have their own page. This is far more like redirecting, say, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Pirrip_338a.html" title="Philip Pirrip">Philip Pirrip</a> to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Expectations_11b3.html" title="Great Expectations">Great Expectations</a>: we wouldn't have anything to say about Pip or John Warren if it weren't for the respective books they're in. I must say I also agree with Tearlach's assessment of this being cherrypicking by calling him notable among the ex-convictts during a certain time period who became Australian schoolteachers, and with TigerShark's point that the book that is being used to show Warren's notability <i>isn't even about Warren,</i> but is simply about the group of people of which Warren was a member. On his own, without this book, he's entirely non-notable. The book still doesn't make him notable enough, but the book itself is worth discussing. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 23:59, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Okay, since this is a discussion and note a plain vote, what exactly makes John Warren notable? Surely you are not saying <b>everyone</b> mentioned in <b>any</b> book is notable, are you?

<ul>
<li>I'm not really a big fan of making such sweeping statements, but in general, yes, I do think that any person who is mentioned in a reputable book is notable. If that is not sufficient for you in this case, I say again that he as one of a very small number of convicts who overcame the social stigma of convictism by obtaining a respectable place in Western Australian colonial society via a job as a school teacher. As I understand it, objections to this are based on the premise that I have only made Warren appear notable by providing a non-notable field in which to assess his contribution. As I've said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FDaniel_Spillane&amp;diff=26586705&amp;oldid=26584444" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FDaniel_Spillane&amp;diff=26586705&amp;oldid=26584444" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>, you never know what fields people will want to do research in in the future, and if there is <i>any</i> field in which a person should be considered notable, then the person should be considered notable for Wikipedia purposes.

<ol>
<li>"It cites a reputable academic source, people! How can it be non-notable?" (Then let's make an article about the book, eh?)</li>
<li>This article <i>isn't</i> promotional or vanity. (... which is why it wasn't speedied, but that doesn't make it notable.)</li>
<li>There aren't a lot of ex-con teachers in this particular time period. (Please please please tell me this means I get to write my JDoorjam article because there aren't a lot of quarter-German quarter-Norwegian half-Polish California-born East-Coast residents who went to school in up-state New York, and so I'm pretty sure I stand out in that field... but I digress.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Are there any other arguments? Because these don't really compel me to say this article is keep-worthy. The delete/merge arguments, meanwhile, seem rather valid: if you zoom out even a little bit, to, say, Australians in that time period, or teachers in that time period, or ex-convicts in history, this individual doesn't really seem to stand out.</p>
<p>Is this how it all breaks down at this point? It seems like an obvious delete/merge, despite the passion from the Aussie Posse here. (Sorry, it rhymed. I had to.) <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 02:04, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Um, your bracketed comments are coming across as ridiculing the "pro" position. If you want this to lead to a productive discussion, I suggest you re-factor. Also, the statement "it seems like an obvious delete/merge" may be your opinion, but it can hardly be considered a statement of how this discussion breaks down. We currently have 17 keep votes, 10 delete votes and 4 move/merge votes. Right now the only thing that's obvious is that there is no consensus.

<dd>You needn't apologise for the levity. I have no objection to your comments <i>per se</i>. I do, however, object to them being presented as a summary of the discussion.</dd>
<dd>Your response to point one doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I concede your second point as no longer relevant. The third point is an inaccurate representation of my position so you can say what you want about it.

<dd>Therefore my proposed summary of the "for" arguments is:
<ol>
<li>Warren is notable because Rica Erickson wrote about him in a book a century after his death.</li>
<li>Warren is notable because he was one of a very small number of convicts who overcame the social stigma of convictism by obtaining a respectable place in Western Australian colonial society via a job as a school teacher.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Feel free to summarise the arguments against, but please, I think levity is not constructive at this point.

<dd>For point 1, is it really that notable that <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rica_Erickson_bcaf.html" title="Rica Erickson">Rica Erickson</a>, herself red-linked, wrote a book mentioning this individual? For point 2, How many overcame the stigma to become merchants? To become day laborers? To work for city government? To do any job that requires any sort of trust? The way you paint it, you make it sound as though nearly 10,000 people tried to become schoolteachers. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 03:00, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Merchants? - I don't know; a few. Day laborers? - I'm not familiar with the term. City government? - Virtually none. Jobs that require any sort of trust? - In a book I recently read, Brian Peachey said around five percent; i.e. 450. "The way you paint it..." - You can't have it both ways; I was happy for the notability of the article to speak for itself, but that was apparently unsatisfactory.

<dd>I don't know the first thing about Samuel Périvier, David McCullough or <i>The Path Between the Seas</i>. In my view, every sailor who came to the Americas with Christopher Columbus is notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Needs rewording a bit but its a viable article. As someone who done quite a bit of research on British convicts in Western Australia, I know that we wouldn't know that much about the guy unless he was notable. You are lucky if you can find out anything more than their name, age, religion, crime and place of conviction. We aren't going to have a flood of these.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 04:04, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Some of the arguments for keeping seem to be rested on the idea that, for example, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Pasteur_5462.html" title="Louis Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> has an article but The guy who lived across the street from Louis Pasteur does not, and that is some sort of "imbalance" that needs to be "redressed". Quite untrue. If a book were written about the guy we might have something, but being mentioned in a book really is not. I can pick one of any number of biographies or history books off my shelf and find hundred of people mentioned therein, does each and every one warrant an article? It seems the main argument here is "few convicts became teachers", making him something of a rarity. Well rarity is not the equivalent of encylopedicness or notability. Few common convicts become well-respected people today. When they do they do we writes on them? This seems to be an example of using a semi-random person as an example to write about an important subject (convicts in Australia). It's the subject that's important; he's just an illustration of that. Calling him a "historical figure" is a stretch. If he is, then just about everyone who lived back then was; only no one's mentioned most of them in a book (yet). If someone put their mind top it they could get as much significant information about anyone. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:45, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

Here's a guy who got <i>24 votes</i> in a primary election. I bet any person reading this could get that many votes in an election if they got a handful of signatures and were willing to spend pretty small amount of money. Seriously, if we're going to have an article on him, we should have an article on just about every person on the planet. I got about 50 unique googles when searching his name -wikipedia, and not all of them even appeared to be him.

<li><b>Keep</b>. as was stated in the last AfD, Proposer has moved that Katz and other candidates in the June 14th primary be removed on the grounds they did not do well. Katz has an article to make a complete record of the election. It is inherently unfair to decide legitimate candidates for an important office do not merit articles because they did not do well in the campaign. Some people previously proposed for deletion have won local offices (e.g. Eric Minamyer) and if we delete them, then we'll have to prevent nearly all local officials from getting any attention at all. (apologies to pedantically speaking for copying his previous answer and altering it, but I couldnt put it better!) <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 22:30, 15 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all, the notion that we can't delete Arthur Stanley Katz because Eric Minamyer has held another office is a non-sequitur, and downright ridiculous. Merely running for an office is not in itself notable. There is plenty of precedent for this. We don't have articles on every single person who ran for the governor of California last time, and that was a much more notable race. Nor, as you seem to indicate, do we delete people's articles just because they didn't do well in an election. <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caleb_Carr_0995.html" title="Caleb Carr">Caleb Carr</a>, I recall hearing, recently ran for a local office and did poorly; we do not now delete his article. We do delete people whose sole claim to fame is that they ran for an office and got a dozen votes (two dozen, in this case). This guy made a <i>very</i> sorry attempt to run for an office. Impact on the world: zero. In addition, we do not have articles on every local officeholder, nor should we ever try to. There are just too many of them, and most don't do anything significant to a large degree. There are thousands of villages, towns, municpalities, cities, etc in the world (54,000 Rambot articles gives you an idea of how many there are in the US alone). Pretty much each and every one of these has local officeholders, from a handful to 50 or more. With a turnover every several years, going back hundred of years in some cases (thousands, in some countries) we're dealing with hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people. Attempting to cover them all would be a futile attempt to double the size of wikipedia without any increase in quality. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 00:54, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Neologism. As noted in the talk page, there is at least one person who has lived in Japan and never heard this.

<li>Heh, maybe&#160;:) The hypothesis in the webpage I linked below says: <i>OAV was the original term used by the anime industry, but since it was so similar to "AV", some people in Japan got confused and linked OAVs with adult videos. In response, anime companies adopted OVA as the industry standard acronym instead of OAV (though some places still use OAV, I think).</i> If that is true then there may have been no bad faith on anybody's part.

<li>Have read indicated link. Does this cover foreign sources, such as the Mexican media, which was the primary media that reported the incident with the flying humanoids&#160;? In the US., it was some of the Texas media that reported the people in the US videotaping these things. Appreciate the reminder Android79.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Jimmy Wales said there are very few situations in which an article is legitimately deletable, or that only in very rare cases is there a reason for deleting an article, or something like that... yes, this article has no references, along with 95% of the rest of wikipedia: if it wasn't a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> I would put <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustine_Volcano_8fb1.html" title="Augustine Volcano">Augustine Volcano</a> up for deletion because it too has no references, only external links like this article. Both articles need references added, and so do roughly 800,000 other articles on this wikipedia - or do you wanna delete them all instead? I don't think the deletionists do, but all evil is hypocritical and I suspect all deletionists are profoundly evil and growing eviller by the minute as they hunch over their keyboards and stuff good donuts after bad so as to step up their sugar-rush and thus their deletionism.

<li>Appreciate whoever you are for voting to keep this article. The primary sources for the article is the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican.html" title="Mexican">Mexican</a> media and the Texas media. Both sources are found on Jeff Rense's website/homepage. I, in turn, found them on <i>his</i> webpage. The videotape of the one shot in the US has some language issues, since the guy was shocked to see this thing. There are even depictions of these things in Aztec art.

<p>I created this article because of arguments at <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Christmas_1f94.html" title="War on Christmas">War on Christmas</a> that there was more to the secularization of Christmas than the Fox News campaign regarding the subject. I thought that, if there were more to say about it, if the topic were worth exploring, the proponents of such an exploration could do so here. They did not, and the article has sputtered into POV original research, if anything. As I said I would upon creation of the article, because the article has not proven its merit or Wikiworth, I hereby nominate it for deletion. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 23:44, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep separate, delete if article doesn't eventually prove itself</b>. I agree with your sentiments JDoorjam - there is more going on than the Fox News campaign, though this article doesn't really show it (at this stage). I think there is also a significant problem with the title '<a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Christmas_1f94.html" title="War on Christmas">War on Christmas</a>' - it is inherently POV.

<dd>I agree with merging; as for POVness, I don't see how usage of the term by those involved makes it an NPOV term.

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>. In and of itself, "Secularization of Christmas" may smack of less POV, but since we have only original research to say that such a thing exists, I believe it's actually more neutral to limit the article to what IS verifiable (and largely refutable), which is the description of secularization outlined by FOX, et al. Consider these options for article titles: "Secularization of Christmas", "Perceived secularization of Christmas," "Purported secularization of Christmas," -- these all carry different POVs, whereas "War on Christmas," as the title of an influential book, is undeniably "a thing" which can be discussed without POV. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 15:03, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Delete This site has a small amount of members.Don't let the member count fool you.A lot of the members are inactive.Also,most of the members live in the same area.It's like the early eBaum's world,when it was just for Eric Bauman and a few of his friends from School.This site is hardly deserving of a wikipedia article. <a href="../../../7/7/b/User%7E77boy84.html" title="User:77boy84">77boy84</a> 00:25, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Hello all this is 77boy88 he will be included in our history section and I think if you check your logs you will see he has allready screwed with this page. He has a thing against us as he is one out of three members we have ever banned. You have reviewed us once for deletion and made a desision so please do not allow this resentful child his game. Our statistics speak for ourselves with our post count well above fifty thousand and our member count 6 away from 300. ~Steven Burkeland</p>
<p><br />
I have nothing against the site.The posts may be above 50,000,but does that mean you get a load of posts a day?Also,6 from 300 means nothing,when half of them aren't active members,and when almost all of them are from the same school.If I remember correctly,a few days ago,several Half-Life 2 mods were considered for Deletion.If a Modification,wich takes a lot more effort to make than a site,isn't worthy of a Wikipedia article,neither is a small site on the internet.~77boy84</p>
<p><br />
77boy84 has been banned from the site in the article before for causeing trouble and breaking several rules. I consider this an attack on the site. As a member I am very distraught over this. Thank you. ~Enzeru</p>
<p><br />
77boy is an idiot who just wants to get our wiki page deleted as a personal vendetta against the site. If you allow him to have his way with this, than you might as well let the general public have thier way with the "Religion" entry and see how that goes. He's just trying to get back at us like the petty little kid he is. Please, don't delete our article just because he says. At least take a good look at it, and if you say to do it then, then go ahead, but don't let him screw with it just because he's a bitter little boy. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 00:59, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I'm an idiot? You guys accuse me of making attacks on the site(wich I haven't)and then make attacks on me.Wonderful.I'm not trying to get back at anyone.I'm trying to make sure Wikipedia isn't filled with useless junk like articles about websites,such as the RP site.~77boy84</p>
<p><br />
Oh, so blanking an article we had to fight to get on here, replacing it with insults and shit like that, and then demanding it be deleted isn't an attack? Oh, and I'm sure the fact that we've had to ban you four times is just coincidence. You're doing this for the good of Wikipedia, not to get off on a little power rush because you could inconvenience us. I suppose then that you're upset about the HL2 mods' articles being deleted because you honestly think that those being here is important, not because your a little fanboy.--<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 01:21, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
How about we stop talking to each other and let a wiki admin decide? They can visit the site and decide for themselves. After all, we know the truth. ~Enzeru</p>
<p><br />
Guys let craer handle this if he needs to otherwise lets just step out and wait for an offical statement instead of making ourselves look like fools. Because when you fight a fool its hard not to sink down to their level. Steven Burkeland</p>
<p><br />
I never replaced it with insults,where are you getting that from? I don't want a power rush,like you're trying to make it look like. Oh,and the HL2 nods weren't deleted,just put up for deletion.I'm suprised you,of all people,would call me a fanboy Craer.~77boy84</p>

Does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_RP_Site_%28role-playing_forum%29&amp;diff=35215896&amp;oldid=35189131" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_RP_Site_%28role-playing_forum%29&amp;diff=35215896&amp;oldid=35189131" rel="nofollow">this</a> look familiar to you? Mayhaps you've forgotten? You've been rather busy, as shortly after that, you blanked it. Wiki records the history on these things, you think you could get away with it and claim to have not done it? --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 01:38, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Oh,so showing a few things you don't want people knowing about is considered "replacing it with insults"?:D I didn't replace anything,I just added something.~77boy84</p>
<p><br />
We prefer a factual history. Like how you lacked to mention the fact that after banning you we had an anonomus poll on craer about should he stay an admin and he won by a far margin? But I grow tired of your lies allow us to let this sit for now and see the ruling before commenting further. I do however doubt that it will be ruled against as this happend once before and it seemed they ruled for it to stay. ~Steven Burkeland</p>
<p>Oh, so saying that most of the site is illiterate isn't insults? So giving your own bias as hell views on the staff's actions is just "adding something"? Oh, alright then. If bias is justifiable, I might have to be a bit more creative with my description of the site history, won't I? Oh, and blanking it so many times was also really mature of you. Way to go. That certainly showed us who was the clever one. That certainly helped out the Wikipedia community as a whole. Bravo.--<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 01:48, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I only blanked it once.Of course,egon.I should have added that,even though I was IP banned,wich stopped me from seeing anything on the site.I should add more information the next time I put something in a wikipedia article.Bias?They weren't bias.I made that information as un-biased as I could. But if you want a biased article on the site,then I'm sure I could do something.~77boy84</p>
<p>Seeing as you can't actually SEE the site, I'm sure that that makes you very much qualified to make some comments. Go ahead. Do what you want. I only hope that what you put is as bias and insulting as what you had before, so the Wikipedia staff can see that what you're doing is petty revenge on us.--<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 01:56, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh,it is as biased before.Trust me.~77boy84</p>
<p>You made some "Misspellings" that I thought I ought to "correct" for the "good of Wikipedia" and the article as a whole. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 02:11, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good,wikipedia articles should not have misspellings,even if the articles don't have a place on wikipedia.But smith was a good RP'er. I think it was because everyone said he godmodded.But seeing as the strongest characters at that moment in time were a bunch of squirrels,it's no suprise people called him a godmoder.~77boy84</p>
<p>I'll admit, there were worse RPers than him, and a lot of the members we've had over the years, especially said squirrel, (who egon breifly made staff and I had to FORCE him to remove him) Were a bit out there. But you blame the staff far too much. This site is a great community. It deserves an article. Egonboy got himself in a major article, we got a ton of members, and I don't think that us getting put up for deletion just because you have it out for us is fair.--<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 02:19, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You may have near 300 members,as a member count,but how many are active members? I doubt the other invisionfree roleplay sites with twice as many members have wikipedia articles.300 may seem like a lot,but on the internet,it's very miniscule.~77boy84</p>
<p>However, this site has a lot of unique things. It's a roleplaying site that has its own webcomic. It has a frappr that shows it's membership spans three continents. Of the 300, plenty are active. We get over 100 new posts each day. And like I said, Egonboy was featured on CBS GameCore. The site has a lot of unique things about it, like the "server" system, which, as far as any of us know, is entirely unique to the RP site out of all of the Invisionfree Forums. As well, it is a much more open Community than the typical RP forum, which generally are a lot more xenophobic than we are. This site deserves an article, as it has many unique features that not many other Invisionfree sites have.--<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 02:30, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The wikipedia article mentions none of these "unique" features. Maybe if the article actually highlighted these features and actually explained in detail what it is,then the article would have a place on wikipedia.He's featured on a site,do you want us to worship him or something?I don't really see how that makes him special.~77boy84</p>
<p><br />
We mentioned in the discussion prior to this one that the article was not finished. Here is a list of reasons why the article should stay:</p>
<p>1. It was already decided by Wiki Staff to stay. 2. Our members span 3 continents. 3. The owner and Site was mentioned by CBS, and many other websites that get over 50k hits a day. 4. We have approximately 300 members. 5. We're actually fighting to keep this up. 6. We have a frappr and a webcomic.</p>
<p><br />
Now about 77boy84:</p>
<p>He has spammed (multiple) forums, and tries to torment us on the daily. He's a 12 year old, immature little boy as he can't except the fact that he is ever wrong, and quite frankly acts like a prick. He simply won't leave us alone and is looking for ways to harrass the RP Site. - Hatiatsu, Administrator @ The RP Site.</p>
<p>I don't torment you on the daily. I do it when I feel like it.~77boy84</p>
