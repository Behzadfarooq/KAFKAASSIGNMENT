<p>The article is about a neologism and thus should not be included in Wikipedia. Please read <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. The article <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manscaping.html" title="Manscaping">Manscaping</a> is definitely a neologism, and admits to being so when it states in "Manscaping is a neologism that was brought into American homes in the early 2000's..." The article does not cite its sources, and merely attempts to "track the emergence and use of the term". <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 21:33, 28 March 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 21:33, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately you did not address the main problem, which is: "The article is about a neologism". Do not you accept "Manscaping" is a neologism? How can you refute <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>? <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 00:00, 29 March 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader</dd>

<dl>
<dd>To respond to the links you provide, the first states "This new word 'manscaping' appears to date from Hollywood, 2006." Further proving the term is a neologism. The third USA Today link says "Or 'manscaping,' as Queer Eye for the Straight Guy's Fab Five call it." Which is more evidence of it being a neologism. There may be many news stories that use the term manscaping, but that does not mean there should be an article on it. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 00:00, 29 March 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader</dd>

<dd>I can elaborate as to why we should not have an article on a neologism on Wikipedia, but I recommend you first read <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 00:00, 29 March 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader

<dd>I have read <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> thanks, I don't need to be condescendingly told to. As for your specific objections, I can only assume that while you were busy re-reading <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> you failed to actually read the articles themselves, which are, in order, about: 1) the international emergence of manscaping as a trend called "manscaping," along with a reference to an additional source; 2) the results of a search for the best manscaping in New York City; 3) the lowering of resistance to manscaping and other forms of hair removal among men; and 4) the health risks associated with manscaping. Here's another source from <a href="http://www.meghandaum.com/latimes_column/2006/040806_surveying_manscape.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.meghandaum.com/latimes_column/2006/040806_surveying_manscape.htm" rel="nofollow">Los Angeles</a>, possible the additional source mentioned in the Australia article. I never suggested the word isn't new. Just because a word is new does not mean that it automatically runs afoul of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> and the sources exist to support this article. Indeed, we have entire <a href="../../../n/e/o/Category%7ENeologisms_e4fe.html" title="Category:Neologisms">categories</a> dedicated to neologisms. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:12, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Note</b> <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> states "To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term."

<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_removal.html" title="Hair removal">Hair removal</a>. This term is in use but does not warrant an article of its own. The article is really about trends in the removal or non-removal of male body hair, not so much about the term itself, and thus the content should be covered at the general article for this topic. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 02:44, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> that the article has now been substantially re-written.

<dd>Unfortunately the so-called revised article did not have "sources and everything". In fact some of the new material that user Otto4711 added is OR. Furthermore user Otto4711 removed important information. For example, the fact that it is a neologism was removed. Even though there are sources that say it is a neologism. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 23:35, 29 March 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader

<dd>Thank <i>god</i> you called attention to the so-called fact that there was an unsourced sentence! Good thing you just took it out instead of either asking for a so-called source or taking four seconds to find a source through so-called google yourself. Added back with source. But I took out the bit about its being a neologism because it wasn't sourced. Source for the goose being source for the gander after all. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:41, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please read <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>, it states "Any unsourced material may be removed". I am a bit amazed that you re-added the sentence and added a source that has nothing to do with the sentence. I will assume good faith, and I assume this was a mistake. I hope you did not intentionally add a reference that has nothing to do with the sentence. If it was not a mistake please paste the part of your "source" that you think pertains to the sentence "The word is a portmanteau of "man" and "landscaping." here. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 02:06, 30 March 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader
