<dd>On <i>Old Belarusian'</i> in main article <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanian_Metrica_9ad2.html" title="Lithuanian Metrica">Lithuanian Metrica</a> it is mentioned, that it was written in Ruthenian. What's so vital in in mentioning <i>Old Belarusian</i>? IMO it cerates unnecessary mess, because by that formulation it is that nowadays Ukrainian language is also descendant of <i>Old Belarussian</i>.

Now about translation – why reinvent machine when it already invented.

<li><b>Merge</b>. Lithuanian Metrica - not original, but the conditional name of a complex of documents. However this name is standard. "Ruthenian language" - not language, and the conditional general name of slavic languages in territory Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Ruthenian = Old Belarussian + Old Ukrainian. Lithuanian Metrica it is written basically Old Belarussian language, later Polish language. Only some documents are written Old Ukrainian language, but there are some volumes completely written Old Ukrainian language (so-called Volynian Metrica). --<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximLitvin_f05d.html" title="User:MaximLitvin">MaximLitvin</a> 18:55, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
<dd>Firstly I want to ask you – do you think name Lithuanian Metrica is bad for article or maybe you have other solutions?</dd>
<dd>I see you touched Volynian (Luck), but I feel duty to expand and a bit and adjust your comments. It is linguistically proven (Ch. Stang; Z.Zinkevičius; etc.) that Ruthenian lang. used in chancellery of Grand Duchy of Lithuania was dominated by Volynian until mid XVI century ( some linguist say that Volynian dominated until end of XVIc.). This conclusion was drown after analysis of Ruthenian documents issued by Grand Duchy of Lithuania chancellery. Second decisive moment is that when central dialect of present-day Belarus territory (roughly) was used – chancellery and spoken languages remain with notable differences; so it should be also clear division between chancellery and spoken languages – so it is another issue why terms with “old” can’t be applied without tremendous exceptions when talking about chancellery issues. <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 14:48, 13 July 2006 (UTC) p.s. when talking about languages of metrica don’t exclude Latin (German as minor).
<dl>
<dd>Moved the section on "" to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Talk%7EBelarusian_language_772a.html" title="Talk:Belarusian language">Talk:Belarusian_language</a>. Let's have a talk there. ---<a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a> 21:50, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please, do not move comments elsewhere leaving here nothing, you can copy comm. and paste in different place, but don’t leave here nothing cuz it is important to this case here. Regarding Belarusian lang. article – it is a separate issue which should be taken with care cuz it have some major systematic mistakes. I will make comments after few days (or weeks), I have a bit intense timetable so I can’t work on several cases at once (his why I did not reply to your note on my talk) <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 10:22, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. Lithuanian Metrica - the standard conditional name (already it is above written by me). This name is necessary for using in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>2. "<i>… until mid XVI century … - … until end of XVI century.</i>" - a mistake. Correctly - "<i>until mid <b>XV</b> century - until end of <b>XV</b> century</i>". It speaks that Vitaut's Office was completed with the personnel on Volhynia in 1380-s years, and has then moved together with it to Vilnia. The Volynsk language influence was limited to the period of a life of the Volynsk personnel.
<dl>
<dd>Actually there <b>is no mistake at all</b>&#160;! I check and double check these conclusions and there are confirmed in other sources (“Definition problem of Slavic chancellery language in Grand Duchy of Lithuania”; “Inaccuracies of History approach” {my translations}; etc. etc. etc.). And all have <b>point of XVI</b> century as key moment. And analysis <b>was not only</b> Vytautas chancellery but much broader.</dd>
<dd>Second moment – not chandlery personnel lifetime, but lifetime of ruler, monitoring shifts of dialect. <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 12:57, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>3. Old Belarussian and Old Ukrainian - not colloquial languages, but literary languages. Spoken languages were not used in office-work MDL. However, spoken languages influenced on literary - it distinctions between Old Belarussian and Old Ukrainian. Old Belarussian speak and Old Ukrainian were generated on the basis of Ruthenian language under influence of local dialects. Therefore in clause instead of "Latin, Ruthenian, Polish and German languages" it is necessary to write "Old Belarussian, Polish, Old Ukrainian, Latin and German languages".
<dl>
<dd>Here you confusing something, but not going to details - contemporary and scientific term Ruthenian taking into account all these “Old” with most care, so I convinced that chancellery issues should have Ruthenian definition.<a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 12:57, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually Ch. Stang and Zinkevičius provided landmark scholar works which are recognized as facts and there are not POV.</dd>

<li>&lt;sigh&gt; Dear (Lithuanian) collegues. Some time ago, I'd noticed a dangling link to Metryka in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarusian_language.html" title="Belarusian language">Belarusian language</a> and reasoned that there's no article if the link remained empty for so long. So I'd made a stub with the info most pertinent to the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarusian_language.html" title="Belarusian language">Belarusian language</a>. I hadn't receive any notification from anybody that there is already a similar article. Maintainers stamped the article with categories etc. Then, out of the blue, this request for deletion happens. Frankly, I don't quite understand your problem.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I did stamp it with categories because you forgot to do it (it's for a more convenient way to find it). After that it was dicovered and proved, that it is a redundant dublicate.--<a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokyz_fe40.html" title="User:Lokyz">Lokyz</a> 08:11, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>The article on <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanian_Metrica_9ad2.html" title="Lithuanian Metrica">Lithuanian Metrica</a> you are pointing me to, is, in all truth, just another stub. Decorated with secondary issues and portrait, I'll give you that. About 80% of the volume is dedicated to the geographical moving of the books. However, the article somehow manages not to mention the important (and confirmed) fact of the prevailing languages of the issued documents, the several previous publications influencing the contemporary historiography etc. The fact that "L.M." isn't even a name, but a conventional denotation, isn't mentioned.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Oh please! With your “criticism” - “About 80% of the volume is dedicated to the geographical moving of the books” just shows that you do not ready any articles about Metrica history, don’t you? Actually the scholars who wrote publications sometimes even divide Metrica history by it`s geographical location. You also making the mistake - <i>fact of the prevailing languages of the issued documents</i> - don’t you ever mixup archive of Metrica documents and issued documents as such. It is quite different things.</dd>
<dd>Metrica – is not a controversial name (even the Byelorussian scholars who worked (now not working due to lack of resources (finance and material) AFAIK) on international project “Lithuanian Metrica” agreed on this name), the true distortion and fantasy is name Myetrika of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogitia (if you tried to imitated the contemporary name – you badly failed)<a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 12:01, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please answer my question - I'll repeat it for third time - was Old Belarusian proto-Ukrainian language? Don't you think, that statement about "Old Belarusian" language in lands of Podole or Halicz is errr... a little bit overexagerated?

<dd>And how is your repeated question related to <b>my</b> statement on relevant matter of the supposedly good article Lithuanina Metrica being shoddily done? What are you talking about at all here?? I'm saying those article misses important and confirmed true data. Your relevant answer, please. Or no answer please. ---<a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a> 09:36, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>I know well there are places where Lithuaninan historians don't dare to go. That's not other peoples problem however. And I completely resend the claims of incorrectness of the use of the "Old Belarusian" denotation. The concept had been proved scientifically 100+ years ago in the seminal work of Karskiy. And nobody is "obliged" to use the archaic names of the languages. Again, I know quite well about discomfort such revelations cause in average Lithuanian reader, but is that <b>everybody's</b> problem?</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ruthenian – is not an archaic term, yes it is has contemporary base plus it is an scientific term which was used and still it using by linguist and less accusing notes would benefit to discussion.<a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 12:01, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, isn't the place where Lithuanian historians do not dear to enter "The Old Belarussian state Litva", a sweet dream of Ermalovich? I do repeat my question for another time: who is Karskyi, and why do you not give any reference to him?--Lokyz 07:56, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, the place they don't dare enter (one of them) is the fact that Belarusian nation did not spring from the ground overnight in 1918. The attitude of the Lithuanian historians on these matters was a running joke in Soviet times. I guess now it's not too different, as you guys both express the ol' familiar POV on "Belarusians not really existing till very very very recent time". ---<a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a> 09:36, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please show me at least one Lithuanian publication where it is said, that Belorusian nation sprung in 1918. AFAIK, term Belarus is known form XVIII th century.

<dd>The research is already done by professionals and we have their publications. Google is the tool of search. This means that with help of google we can see the spread of term in internet, books and this means that we have the greater chances that average user would be familiar with one or another term/word so in this order they could faster found this article in wiki.

<dd>Well, I don't yet know how to do it, procedurally, but I'm going to request the renaming of the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanian_Metrica_9ad2.html" title="Lithuanian Metrica">Lithuanian Metrica</a> as a misleading and informal. Any kind of word metrika in the main name (my version included) is misleading, actually. Metrika or whatever isn't even a word, it is just a very local convention only historian would recognise. The appropriate name would be smth. like <b>Archive of the G.D.L.R.S.</b> with various metrika* entries serving as a redirs into it. ---<a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a> 09:36, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Aha this is new development. Now lets remind to ourselves that <a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">user:Yury Tarasievich</a> said a bit earlier - <i>represents the verbatim translation of the lead from the academic publication (encyclopedia of literature)</i>- and now - <i>Any kind of word metrika in the main name (my version included) is misleading</i> -. So we have several possibilities – <a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">user:Yury Tarasievich</a> <b>lied</b> to as then he said that he used academic sources or <b>deliberately ignored</b> the facts or <b>deliberately chosen to mislead</b> reader. And this is one more argument why article <i>Myetrika of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogitia</i> should be <i>deleted</i>. <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 12:01, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please, <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a>, credit me with some intelligence and knowledge of English. The text of the disputed stub is verbatim translation of the lead etc. But any rendering of "metrika" in name is, in fact, misleading for English reader, as it represents un-scientific, although conventional among specialists, name, which means nothing for non-historian and is not guessed easily from Polish or Cyrillic rendering. Just see how I missed when searching WP before creating the stub.</dd>
<dd>BTW, googling on Metrica <b>without</b> wikipedia yields at least 5 pages of Lithuanian-originating sources with 2 or 3 non-Lithuanian authors. So much for the established name. And I've seen the Lithuanian name is "metrika". Why the difference then?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yury&#160;! You perfectly know that I can’t credit you intelligence, wisdom - these are goals of lifetime. I suggested you only to take more care that other editors are saying and asking; I also suggested to take a look in English sources how they formulating definitions. And now I also suggest you to relax a bit&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>About Metrica – are you sure that it is “un-scientific”? About “only historians would recognize” I asked for few people to provide history schoolbooks to me and you know these books talk about Metrica (of course in appropriate tongue).</dd>
<dd>About number of google sources in first page I counted “a bit” more then 2-3 sources of non-Lithuanian authors, while Myetrika none at all. Also you can see some of them of in English academic (academic +-) sources page. Why not “Metrika” there is several key points why is “Metrica” picked up one of them - see published metrica books of English part….<a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 12:57, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, when I tell you that googling <b>without</b> the word wikipedia yields 5 pages of Lithuanian-originating sources with 2 or 3 English or German, you may just dismiss that.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>Like I've said before, the creation of Myetryka* was not the best move on my part and was conditioned only by not finding anything under the L. metryka or L. metrika. Creating the Archive* (understandably, now it would be created as a redir) would be much better for the common reader.</dd>
<dd>I know what I've seen, however (and I've saved all of the non-Lithuanian refs -- precisely for such occasion).</dd>
<dd>Yes, the decision on Metrica with native Metrika still seems strange to me. After all, this isn't translation (Archive is). Also, I don't know what the "appropriate tongue" would mean in such context.</dd>
<dd>The concept of "L.M." naming itself being un-scientifical isn't mine, it's moved by the researcher Halyenchanka in his ~5000 words encyclopedic article on L.M.</dd>
<dd>I've added the entry on the naming of the Old Belarusian preferred by Lithuanian researches. Let's have some names and refs there. ---<a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a> 15:59, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
