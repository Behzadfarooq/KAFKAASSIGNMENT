<p><b>Delete</b>: This article should be deleted according to the "no original research" policy. Please read the article and check the links in it before voting. The recuring defense to keeping it is the large number of sources, but if you read the sources they don't talk about this. For example the NASA link talks about electricity in our atmosphere causing light effects and such, and not about this. Also several facts in the article are obviously wrong, like the fact that craters are caused by lightning bolts instead of meteors, which has direct evidence against. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElfguy_25ac.html" title="User:Elfguy">Elfguy</a> 18:18, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"<i>The recuring defense [..] but if you read the sources they don't talk about this</i>" The Electric Universe concept covers many areas, including the idea that electricity plays a much greater role in the universe than generally accpeted. In this respect, the theory is consistent with many existing and accepted theories.</dd>
<dd>"<i>several facts in the article are obviously wrong</i>" The article does not present this idea as a fact, but as a theory; I am not aware of any evidence that proves that craters can not be created my electical discharges. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">Iantresman</a> 20:10, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed. Elfguy said that several facts "are obviously wrong" without any substantiation. And many statements <i>may</i> be falsified by an "ugly fact", but without either, it is just opinion. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIantresman_3a2c.html" title="User:Iantresman">Iantresman</a> 21:40, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep:</b> I'm not a believer in the Electric Universe theory, but I suggest that this article remain. I don't mind an having an unreviewed scientific theory present as long as the issue is known on a global scale (The number of Google hits and the number of editors on this article suggest it is) and it is said in the article that the theory is unsupported by the scientific community. My reasoning behind this is the article can still have a historic value even if it no longer has a scientific one. It also appears from the talk page that deletion was discussed before and a consensus was not reached. I hope we are not simply debating the same points we did before. -<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolarusdude_2019.html" title="User:Solarusdude">Solarusdude</a> 19:10, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Many of the references appear to be wrongly appropriated. Others are unscientific. So the question seems to me to be whether this is a notable social phenomenon (as it's not a scientific theory). I don't think it is but I'm open to being convinced otherwise. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> 19:30, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep:</b> I agree with Solarusdude. In my opinion, the whole Electric Universe thing is crackpot psuedoscience that's been picked up by the oddball fringe, but it does have a significant group of followers (for whatever reason) who are good at making noise. As long as the article clearly states that this is not mainstream science and is widely dismissed and riduculed as lacking merit by most every mainstream physicist, I'm fine with it being here. I do think, however, that the article has gotten badly out of control, and that someone needs to wrestle it back into having some semblance of objectivity. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">Cory Maylett</a></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b>: As the main author of this article, I should mention that it has <b>already</b> gone through the Votes for deletion process, where originality was discussed. See previous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Electric_Universe_model" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Electric_Universe_model" rel="nofollow">Votes for deletion</a>.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Rename</b> "Electric Universe (theory)" - I have heard of it, and don't agree with it, but think it is worthy enough to retain. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 20:44, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>From the 20 July closing: "The result of the debate was <b>no consensus</b>." Lack of consensus in a previous VfD does not establish a precedent to keep. Saying it "survived the vote" is a stretch not equivalent to "achieved consensus to keep". <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:51, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: It doesn't explain what the electric universe theory is supposed to be about. Electricity is not a new discovery and electrical charge is considered in many theories. The article doesn't identify what's supposed to be missing in the mainstream theories. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 21:02, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> per <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a>. Other than that, it is very clear to me that this is a very real pseudoscience, and the right course of action is to remove any portions of the article that are OR or unsourced. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> 23:30, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Yes, it's a total crock, but it's a common one. We should have an article explaining what it is and why it's wrong. --<a href="../../../a/p/y/User%7EApyule_9559.html" title="User:Apyule">Apyule</a> 01:29, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, analogously to <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_earth.html" title="Flat earth">Flat earth</a>. The Electric Universe stuff is likely pseudoscientific BS, but this article seems at least equally devoted to presenting the critiques and failure of the theory, not cheerleading for the junk science. As with <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_earth.html" title="Flat earth">Flat earth</a>, it is possible to cover junk science without <i>being</i> junk science. -- <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 06:54, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> this is exactly the type of article we <i>should</i> be keeping, providing it gives a clear picture of the particular concept, it does not matter two hoots about it being a notable <i>unscientific</i> thingamabob.

I would say yes. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_alf_522c.html" title="User:Wiki alf">Alf</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWiki_alf_56f1.html" title="User talk:Wiki alf"><font color="green">melmac</font></a></sup> 20:02, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's what I said. We can't include each and every crackpottery on Earth. From what I see, this particular one is very minor, non-notable in the extreme. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 11:31, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For what it's worth, I had seen mention of this crackpottery before I ever saw the Wikipedia article.
