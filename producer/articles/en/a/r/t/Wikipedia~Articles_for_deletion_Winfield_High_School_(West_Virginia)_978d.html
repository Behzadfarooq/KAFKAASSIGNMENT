<dd>A thought about media coverage: Rich communities have money to spend, which means advertisers can support more local newspapers, which means more articles get written about local high schools, making it easier to meet Wikipedia notability guidelines. Newspapers in poorer communities may not have a Web presence or have as many of their articles on the Web. That may not overcome the objection about notability, but it's something to keep in mind. The Web, and therefore to an extent, Wikipedia, tends to emphasize what the rich have, de-emphasize what the poor have. I don't know about Winfield, but it doesn't appear to be wealthy.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 16:40, 18 February 2007 (UTC) Additional comment: This school doesn't appear to be in a poor community at all (and wealthier than most of West Virginia) and it does have some coverage from several local papers) I've added a couple of small bits of information to the article. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 17:33, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, a school is just like a grocery store in the same way that a home is like a dormatory, a mother like a jailer, a father like a boss, a sister like a coworker. That's why we have grocery store yearbooks, homecoming celebrations for watermelon season and class rings for the store employees. Ah yes, I'll never forget marching down the canned vegetable aisle in my cap and gown to hear the commencement speech in the deli section. My point isn't that the metaphor is flawed so much as the idea is flawed: schools aren't school buildings just as homes aren't houses or apartments. Schools carry a lot more importance than that in the lives of students and communities. That's a good part of what makes them special. We allow Wikipedia articles for local communities because we recognize their importance to people, not because they're all significant far beyond their boundaries. High schools get seared into the memories of those who go there, whether they love the experience or hate it. They have a natural importance which I call inherent. When that basketball team won the state championship it was important to the community at large. How do I know that? Because it always is. Even to people who had no kids in the school at the time. Even to people who never went to the high school and had no children. High schools are one of the things that communities put their money, their interest and their hopes into. Take out the high school articles that don't identify some notability for people far beyond their borders and you really just diminish Wikipedia.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 05:04, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
