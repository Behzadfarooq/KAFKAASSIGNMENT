<p>The subject of this article appears to be non-notable with fewer than 1,000 ghits total. The page is unsourced and several attempts to source it have failed due to a lack of reliable sources. Furthermore, the page has become a magnet for disruption as one or more editors, and/or sockpuppets, have continously attempted to add unsourced defamatory material which could result legal liability for wikipedia. In short, there is simply no way that the presence of this article justifies the disruption and potential liability it represents. The best thing for the project is to delete this page. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics"><font color="green">Tropics</font></a> 19:15, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The link you listed provides a long, detailed article about Gracenote, but only 2 very brief mentions of Steve Scherf, one of which refers to him as a "helpful buddy". My motive is to remove an article with limited encyclopedic content.

<li><b>Delete</b> Doc asked me to take a peek, and nothing I see in the article at this time seems to justify inclusion.

<dl>
<dd>Exactly. If we really and truly are doing something wrong under tort law and we could be liable, then it's a valid reason, regardless of the actual probability of a lawsuit occurring. If, however, there's merely a concern that maybe, possibly, we might be doing something wrong or that there might be a potential someone could accuse us of doing something wrong, then don't use that as a pre-emptive reason to try and fix something that verywell might not be broken. But, that whole debate is moot here, since there's ample reason for deletion regardless. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 23:45, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The only reason the man is notable is because he is in charge of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gracenote.html" title="Gracenote">Gracenote</a>. This article about him was a very short stub until recent attempts to continue an edit war started on an article about his company. Let's keep the edit war confined to the article on Gracenote and the associated request for mediation. If the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gracenote.html" title="Gracenote">Gracenote</a> edit war ever dies down and an acceptable version is hammered out, then perhaps we can see if he is notable for anything else besides Gracenote and if an article longer then 3 sentences can be written about him personally. ~ <i><b><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="background:#0cc;color:#fff5ee">ONUnicorn</span></a></b></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup> 21:00, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Notability guidelines recommend multiple, independent reviews whose primary subject <i>is the individual</i>. While Scherf's <a href="../../../c/d/d/CDDB_038d.html" title="CDDB">CDDB</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gracenote.html" title="Gracenote">Gracenote</a> contributions may just border on being "<i>part of the enduring historical record in [his] specific field</i>" (see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>), most of his notability is covered in the company articles and, if deemed notable enough, <b>possibly a redirect</b> could be used. Still, I lean primarily toward a deletion, since someone doing a Wikipedia search for him will find him in those articles anyway. As a final note, it might be interesting to observe that almost half of the unique Google hits (about 150 of the 330) relate to a specific news story, as evidenced in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22steve+scherf%22+-wikipedia+%22record+straight%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22steve+scherf%22+-wikipedia+%22record+straight%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">this Google search</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDallben_6fdb.html" title="User:Dallben"><font color="blue">Dall</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDallben_fcd0.html" title="User talk:Dallben"><font color="green">ben</font></a> 21:51, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

The service quickly became extremely popular amongst early Internet users who shared it with their friends, who in turn, submitted their own CDs to the service. Due to the viral nature of the online database, it quickly grew to include all kinds of music genres, including international CD submissions from 130 countries.... The service is now used in over 140 million devices globally, ranging from PC media players, portables as well as home and car stereos</td>

<li><b>Keep</b> - First, the subject of the article is far more notable than many subjects here on Wikipedia. Just for his creation of CDDB and the huge controversy surrounding it would be sufficient, but also his company Gracenote is a substantial current player in the digital music scene. Second, it doesn't bloody matter what the subject of the article wants. This isn't about his wishes. And he does not make any assertion of his own non-notability. Quite the opposite; He asserts that he is SO notable that the article would be a vandal target. If we cave in to this, what else will we cave in to? The integrity of Wikipedia depends on being independent of the wishes of its subjects.--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 20:46, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

They were almost certainly brought here by today's slashdot activity and may be attempting to interfere with the process of deletion out of malice. That an article may be a target for vandalism seems a very poor reason indeed for judging it noteworthy. This person does not appear exceptionally noteworthy otherwise. Also, there may be legal problems here, per other user's comments above. At most it should link to the Gracenote article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The only vague assertion of notability comes from a computer company he is involved in, and a minor scandal about its sale. After existing for over 2 years, this "article" consists of <b>only 6 sentences</b>. Don't "clearly and obviously" notable subjects normally have more than 6 sentences, especially after that period of time? If he is so inherently controversial, where are the huge numbers of allegations and citations that such things involve?

<dd><b>Delete</b> See above. barnamink And yeah Doc Tropics before you point it out, I have few edits, but I am a heavy Wikipedia user, not a troll. As such I'm interested in having factual and unbiased content.<small>— Barnamink (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Barnamink_d41f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Barnamink">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Glen. The amount of controversy over this guy should make clear that it's not just his company that's making news, he personally is doing so as well. Wikipedia should therefore have an entry on the fellow. <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Taron_97ef.html" title="User:Philip Taron">Philip</a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilip_Taron_76a6.html" title="User talk:Philip Taron">Respond?</a>)</sup> 21:25, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The presence of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">SPA</a> tags appended to the comments of new contributors is not an attempt to discount their comments, nor does it imply trolling or other improper behaviour. These tags are widely used as a service to the closing admin, to provide them with background information potentially relevant to the discussion. I felt it was appropriate to use them here, despite the fact that the new contributors are supporting my nom of this article. Thanks for participating in the discussion; I hope you stay and make further contributions to <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a>. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics"><font color="green">Tropics</font></a> 20:13, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
