<li><b>Keep</b> Paul Thompson is notable, but the article needs POV removal badly. I think remove POV, cleanup, wikify, expand.

<li><b>Speedy keep, bad faith nomination</b>. This article survived a previous Afd from the same nominator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Chris_Faiers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Chris_Faiers" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, and this nomination was made only 10 minutes after the previous discussion closed. Nominator placed inappropriate tag on article so prior discussion would not be visible. Subject of article is clearly notable, founder of notable Canadian small press specializing in poetry. See related discussion re proposed deletion of <a href="../../../u/n/f/Unfinished_Monument_Press_c12c.html" title="Unfinished Monument Press">Unfinished Monument Press</a> (which also survived the same nominator's AfD effort) . <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 16:35, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> per <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a>. Bad form on the re-AfD, Ardenn. I doubt most of us are really equipped to judge notability in poetry, where even highly significant poets may publish with small houses. Unless we're prepared to say poetry is inherently non-notable, I think we should let this one stay--it makes a good prima facie case for notability in my opinion. <b><span style="color: #f33">· <a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #666">rodii</span></a> ·</span></b> 19:12, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

(Note, after writing this, I then decided to go and read the article) In addition, this sure as hell didn't happen in canonical New Jedi Order. Also, there is no General Luke Skywalker, he never beat Commander, quit less than five years after the movies, and by the time the Jedi came back into favour in the New Republic, it was the Galactic Alliance, and Tsavong Lah had less than three months to live. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 10:43, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Glyconutrient(s) is a term coined and used by con-artists to bilk cancer patients out of their money. There is <i>no such thing. Every last claim they make is bogus.

There is no way they should be allowed to use Wikipedia to try and give the topic more credibility. These charlatans repeatedly offer money support to <a href="http://www.glycobiology.org" class="external text" title="http://www.glycobiology.org" rel="nofollow">the Society for Glycobiology</a> and their offers are repeatedly refused because legitimate scientists would never allow themselves to be associated with this in ANY way.

<li>censor? The entire web is filled with this crap. Search the term on google. This is an ENCYCLOPEDIA. It could remain and be appropriately described which would only serve as debunking the con, and then it would be POV. Why should anyone have to devote time to debunking this? The "glyconutrient" crowd go out of their way to imply scientific validation where none exists. It is not appropriate to state something and provide a list of scientific articles as references when NONE of the scientific articles say anything even remotely close to what they are implied to say. That is FRAUD. The only reference you could provide for this is self-serving books written by the fraudsters or their websites. How is that appropriate? I just decided. I'm the second coming. Bow down to me. Worship me. Reference...ME! Clearly...POV. As is the term "glyconutrient" by it's very FRAUDULENTLY MANUFACTURED nature. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Stauffenberg (<a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStauffenberg_fc75.html" title="User talk:Stauffenberg">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stauffenberg_182d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stauffenberg">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<dd>These are strong arguments - for improving the article via consensus editing. They are not grounds for deletion.

No. Since those things are true, why should you know about them, but not the Wikipedia reading public?

<li><b>Delete</b> Seconding Bobby's argument. They're a very good set of criterio, and I expect they'll wind up back in WP in a few years - but for now, they don't meet the guidelines.

<dd>FYI, the fact that summability is supposed to refer to an array that grows polynomially with respect to the number of candidates has AFAIK never been made explicit by Mike Ossipoff. One has to indirectly infer that from e.g. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041010135731/electionmethods.org/evaluation.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20041010135731/electionmethods.org/evaluation.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050309014225/www.electionmethods.org/IRVintegrity.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20050309014225/www.electionmethods.org/IRVintegrity.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. That means that either in the article the criterion is too loosely defined to mean anything concrete or filling in the gap there becomes <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. -- <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDissident_e7c0.html" title="User:Dissident">Dissident</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDissident_8a12.html" title="User talk:Dissident">Talk</a>) 20:00, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Why I Listed the Wasted and Believe They Belong</b> (updated by <a href="../../../g/n/h/User%7EGnhn_5e26.html" title="User:Gnhn">Gnhn</a> 12:46, 27 February 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>1. The career track record of Stephen Gaylord: while the Wasted only have one full-length and one EP to their credit thus far, this band is the current outlet for his recorded work, which includes four albums with Beef (a couple released and recorded on "major indie" labels) and four other albums with other bands. Beef was written up in "Entertainment Weekly," and Gaylord's a cult songwriter whose work has been covered by others.</p>
<p>2. I also was trying to tap the element of a net phenomena associated with the band which has a large reach. I have removed that element from the listing since it probably belongs more as a net meme thing than part of a band listing.</p>
<p>3. I have been a print music critic in the Upstate New York market for ~15 years. This is the most impressive/important band and songwriter I've seen the community produce during that time.</p>
<p>4. I am in no way affiliated or associated with the band or the other bands mentioned, other than as a community observer. They didn't ask me to list them, and I'm not part of their promotional team.</p>
<p>5. The Wasted/Stephen Gaylord meet this Wiki Music Standard: <b>"Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city."</b> In Albany, the "Upstate Wasted Bands" community (with the Wasted at the top of the heap) is well organized, well respected, and well known, and draws as well as anything else in the market.</p>
<p>6. This reference, <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/pazznjop/04/critic.php?criticid=593" class="external text" title="http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/pazznjop/04/critic.php?criticid=593" rel="nofollow">Wasted in Village Voice Pazz &amp; Jop</a>, demonstrates how seriously I take this band as a music critic and contributor to one of the more influential American music polls. I'm not spamming WP with bands. I'm not trying to sell anything for the Wasted. I am documenting an important artist, as I have done before in other media.</p>
<p>Therefore I respectfully vote . . .</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I am not sure I understand the "allmusic test". I'm a new member here and haven't been able to find a reference to this rule. Is it an informal one? (Could someone link to this rule from this page?) I agree with Gnhn regarding the artist's importance. The band is one of the most influential New York state artists north of New York City. The original Wikipedia article states that the artist's website is an, "important and influence-wielding online outlet for the New York Capital Region's underground and independent music community." References to the bands popularity in the Capital District, which has a population of about 800,000, abound. The largest alternative weekly in the area, The Metroland, has covered this band again and again. A recent cover story on the band can be found here: <a href="http://www.metroland.net/back_issues/vol28_no48/listen_here.html" class="external free" title="http://www.metroland.net/back_issues/vol28_no48/listen_here.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.metroland.net/back_issues/vol28_no48/listen_here.html</a>. In support of the "net phenomena" Gnhn discusses, the band's website (the stats are not password protected) has had 2,442,765 hits in the past year. I should add that, like Gnhn, I am not part of the band's promotional team. I live in the Capital Region and discovered the band through Stephen Gaylord's other projects (particularly through Beef).

<dd><b>Comment</b>The Village Voice list mention that Gnhn linked to seems pretty impressive to me. The Voice is not on the 'major music media' list, but you have to be fairly important to make the Pazz &amp; Jop Critic's Poll. If you're not that familiar with The Village Voice, I don't think it's a stretch to say that it's to alternative weeklies what The New York Times is to major daily papers. (Unlike other weekly papers, you can pick up The Voice in other states and countries.) The fact that this critic is able to post his list there speaks for his authority in musical matters. And appeal to authority is what your listing guidelines are about in large part. I'd also note that it's the Village Voice that's often quoted in bands' press kits and web pages. Some of the other publications you list -- Exclaim! for instance -- are not nearly as selective. &lt;a href="<a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com" class="external free" title="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pitchforkmedia.com</a>"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt; (which most certainly should be listed) or Spin or Rolling Stone, along with The Voice, have a reputation for noting remarkable bands.--Jim Germaine 16:29, 28 February 2006 (UTC)208.139.7.64 15:54, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Though I'd be very surprised if articles will be created for many of the Bishops of Clonfert, so a protected deletion would not be likely to get in the way of anything.

<li>Gentlemen (and ladies if any) I appreciate your debate very much, and cherish your vote "to Keep" my entry in the Wikipedia. It is indeed an honor. TinTin1107 is right in that my first name being very common in India and my last name being a suffix to denote a place ... the Indian version of the Central Asian suffix "-stan" or the German equivalent of "-baden" I think. Hence, for a search on my name to be relevant, you have to search on my name as a phrase within quotes. Regardless of party political affiliations, it is a great privilege to serve the Executive Office of the President of the United States and recommend ways in which the country can continue to improve its share of world exports or trade. My real achievement is working for Mother Theresa in 1971 some 34 years ago when she was hardly known to anybody outside India. I was her leader for the South India team of volunteers. All other reasons to be in the Wikipedia pale in comparison to working for this great taskmaster for 3 wonderful years. Once again, let me stop here and express my thanks to all of you for entry-ing me into the Wikipedia. PrakashPuram</li>

<p>Procedural nomination. This was marked for speedy (and previously deleted under A7) but being a member of President Bush's Export Council is an assertion of notability. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_26.html" title="February 26">02-26</a> 10:57Z</small></i></span></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> as notable for reason listed above, and has &gt;59,000 google hits (although being conservative, maybe 5,900 of those are his).

<p>I've got slightly mixed feelings about this one: I think WP should have a good coverage of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Baccalaureate_b6c1.html" title="International Baccalaureate">International Baccalaureate</a> system, but at the end of the day this is just a completely unmaintainable list.

<li><b>Comment:</b> We can't possibly have articles on all of the nearly two thousand schools.

<li>I know all about WP:SCHOOL, but I find the whole concept of giving each and every educational establishment an WP article a bit of an unfathomable concept. This list has no absolute point, to be frank, and it could be merged with the International Baccalaureate article, I'm sure.. <b>Merge</b> but a more important issue is the SCHOOL policy.. Can't it be looked at again? <a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktorbuk_af25.html" title="User:Doktorbuk">doktorb</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/k/User_talk%7EDoktorbuk_4b6f.html" title="User talk:Doktorbuk">words</a> 16:47, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - I think there is a use for this list that a category would not provide. For example, this list is nicely organized by country, state, etc., and a category would not contain that, unless a messy slew of categories ranging from "IB Schools" to "IB Schools in New York City" was created. I like the elegance of this list - a prospective IB student/parent/educator could find this list, locate their region, and find detailed information on schools in their area that offer the program. If the list were deleted and a category created instead, this would be a lot harder to do unless one knew the names of schools in their area or happened to chance upon the category and navigate from there. Yes, the IBO has a list of all IB schools, but it's not a very friendly search to perform. This list is superior to that. Yes, there are more IB schools than are listed here, but that's why this page is constantly being edited by worldwide Wikipedians. There is no good reason to delete this list; doing so would delete neatly organized and useful information and instead create disorder and inefficiency, so those searching Wikipedia for this topic wouldn't be able to find what they're looking for. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabricationary_b588.html" title="User:Fabricationary">Fabricationary</a> 18:27, 26 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What do you mean it's not a 'very friendly search to perform'? You go to the IBO main page, select the country and state/province from the drop-down menu, and you get a list of all the IB schools in that area. And that list will actually be correct, unlike the one we've got. On Wikipedia, you have to find this list, figure out which programme you're looking for, and then scroll down this 51-kilobyte list (which will take ages to load on slower connections) to find the area, and you'll get a list of schools which is incomplete at best, maybe even erroneous. This is far from 'superior'. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information, and I don't see why we should try to 'beat' the IBO webmasters in their job. - ulayiti <font color="#226B22"><small>(talk)</small></font> 19:17, 26 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The IBO list provides practically no information about the schools, other than possibly their location and which program they provide. At Wikipedia, editors can link the names on the IB list to the school's Wikipedia pages, which often present much more detail about the IB program at that school - for example, enrollment, success rates, specific courses offered, etc. I looked up the IB school from which I graduated on IBO, and their information about courses offered at my school is incorrect - thus, IBO is not a superior source in that respect. With this Wikipedia list, users can easily navigate the selections and choose the school they're interested in to gain correct, complete, and relevant info, often times more accurate than that provided by the IBO. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabricationary_b588.html" title="User:Fabricationary">Fabricationary</a> 19:24, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This TV series, though having concluded its final episode, is not "unsuccessful". In its inaugural season it received 5 <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy_award.html" title="Emmy award">Emmy awards</a> (2004). including "Outstanding Comedy Series", "Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series", and "Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series". Per Zellin's provided reference - the TV series has an article and season summaries - so the next step is episode summaries. The nominated article is a stub, and needs to be expanded. —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 16:45, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Deleting the article, or similar articles because of "low google hits" undermines the whole idea behind Wikipedia, thats is, Wikipedia is about providing free, accurate and truthful descriptions/explanations etc., and not about "Google Hits". example: The extinct bird "DoDo" has low google hits, doest that mean it should be deleted?. The Free Encyclopedia "Wikipedia" is NOT and should NOT be about adding pages/articles because similar terms/phrases/keywords have high google hits/ratings. Adding marketing/commercial value to Wikipedia can be done differently, not by adding or deleting articles based on "google hits ratings".</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The <i>article</i> doesn't have to prove notability within hours; its <i>subject</i> does. I could create an article about my pet hamster, but it wouldn't qualify as notable whether it was one line long or contained 10,000 words. As for UFOs and black triangles, that's a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> argument. The fact that dubious article X exists doesn't mean that dubious article Y automatically gets a free pass. By the way, the <i>quality</i> of an article does count for something. For example, I would probably change my vote on 9-11: The Road to Tyranny if the article was written in an encyclopedic fashion. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 17:42, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>See my comments below -- the quote on the newspapers that Barrie Zwicker was a writer for is taken from the Vision TV web site, and is not correct in my opinion. It is a big stretch to say that Barrie Zwicker is a mainstream journalist; I'm pretty sure that he's a freelance journalist with an alternative view whose articles were picked up by many major newspapers -- Samir ∙ <sup>T</sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samir_grover_e7b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samir grover">C</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> 23:28, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I see nothing on the page indicating that he's a local political figure or that he's received significant press coverage. As a corollary, widely recognized is very dubious.

<p>The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> does not demand a 5000 audience. It says: "The following types of people may merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them." and among them is the 5000 criteria. The flaw with the 5000 figure is that major publications have minor authors. Does everyone that publishes an article in the New York times get a pass? Including the local section editors, or the style columnist? If anything, I think it's a particularly flawed analysis. The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Daily_News_8d56.html" title="New York Daily News">New York Daily News</a> has several million readers. I can't think of more than 10 current writers on their staff worthy of an article. The wiki only mentions 8 historically. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 16:01, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I've seen Barrie Zwicker on Vision TV and read (although disagreed with) his articles. He's legitimately notable in my view. If you apply the college professor test (he was a prof at Ryerson in Toronto), he's more notable given his media contributions. This being said, the article is very POV: <strike>(1) I don't think "he was a writer for the Globe and Mail....", despite what other web sites say. I'm pretty sure that he was a freelancer whose articles were picked up by other newspapers.</strike> (see below) (2) Also, calling Barrie Zwicker a member of the "mainstream press" is a bit out there, he's clearly an alternative voice in Canadian media. -- Samir ∙ <sup>T</sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samir_grover_e7b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samir grover">C</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> 23:28, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> on principle. If wiki admins are going to go after individual, valid memes, then there's no sense in even recognizing them in Wiki.

<li>What I am getting at is that wiki admins are playing god in deciding which memes they want to stay on wiki and which ones they dont, almost arbitrarily. Pokemon Kid had over 13,000 google hits and was featured on IFILM, eBaums world, and several other notable websites, but was deleted in spite of a majority vote to keep because wiki admins wanted it gone. And just look at the fight over Brian Peppers. This is a matter of principle.RudyLucius 18:24, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page should be moved from the mainspace to a Wikipedia:Internal page. It is only fair we apply the same exacting standards of inclusion on ourselves. If there were, say, an Amazon.com logo article, there would be a forced merge. Someone argues that there are a lot of Google hits for "wikipedia logo" (300k+), but typical of all Internet brands--"Amazon logo" gets 3 mil+--the numbers are high for whatever user. <b>move into the internal space</b></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b>. We absolutely should apply our own standards to articles about Wikipedia and Wikipedia-related phenomenon. Wikipedia is the premiere internet encyclopedia and one of the most popular websites on the internet by traffic. It is also an internet phenomenon. The article as written uses an encyclopedic tone and is clearly meant as a complement to the article <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. It's not a project: namespace or meta article by any stretch of the imagination as far as I am concerned and it's certainly not something we should be wanting to delete. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 19:08, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>. <i>Landeshauptmann</i> is just the German word for president of the state government. A Landeshauptmann in Austria does not have any special area of responsibility or importance than presidents of provinces in other countries. There is no article about <i>Landesregierung</i> (German word for state government) either. This is no dictionary. (Never mind the article's current condition. In case we decide to keep it, I will rework it to be as informative as possible, which is not much.) <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlady_2f34.html" title="User:Dreadlady">Dreadlady</a> 19:01, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, can be expanded into a useful article mostly about the functions of the Landeshauptmanns by using information from <a href="../../../../de/l/a/n/Landeshauptmann.html" class="extiw" title="de:Landeshauptmann">de:Landeshauptmann</a>. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 19:13, 26 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My main concern still is that Landeshauptmann is no unique form of political duty. As I said it is simply the president of the state government. It appears more useful to me to keep the article under a different (English!) name. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlady_2f34.html" title="User:Dreadlady">Dreadlady</a> 19:27, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>So would you like to merge this into <a href="../../../s/t/a/States_of_Austria_6e05.html" title="States of Austria">States of Austria</a> or rename it to <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governors_of_Austrian_states_075c.html" title="Governors of Austrian states">Governors of Austrian states</a> or something like that?

<li>I'd prefer an article like Austrian state politicians, summing up all kinds of state politicians. Seems more useful to me.

<li><b>Keep</b> with its German name. Anybody researching this particular office of government may use this term. If it were to be exchanged for <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governors_of_Austrian_states_075c.html" title="Governors of Austrian states">Governors of Austrian states</a> than the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Tyrol_30d1.html" title="South Tyrol">italian province</a> would be ignored. Pages with the english titles could be created, but they should redirect to this one. As for the state of the article, it concentrates mostly on the use of the word, with a special emphasis on the feminist attributes. Obviously its scope should be expanded to encompass more information about the title itself and what the job entails. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby1011_3500.html" title="User:Bobby1011">Bobby1011</a> 00:24, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The fact no one can see the album page is enough for me to be serious and that's cause i never contribute to any articles you wrok on and when i am contributing to Wikipedia i usually don't log in unless i need to upload a photo. I am contributing, I put up a template ready to go, to be edited as soon as new details surface, now it has to be created all over again because you want it to be done once the rumor mill has stopped turning. It takes time to build a house right and most of all to compose an album, If you get my drift. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgy_9a43.html" title="User:Borgy">Borgy</a> 1:09, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. You have to make a difference between your wish to keep your work and keeping an article on Wikipedia. As you said, the article is just a placeholder, a "template ready to go". But creating an article as a placeholder is just the wrong way. But don't panic, your work does not have to be lost. =) Just copy the code to user space or to <a href="../../../b/j/a/BJAODN_feba.html" title="BJAODN">BJAODN</a>. The article itself needs to meet the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>-criteria. So don't take it personally that the article was nominated for deletion. And by the way, I would appreciate if you accepted that I am not the mastermind behind this nomination. I am merely one of the long time and frequent contributors of the Tool article, and usually, I have only good in mind. If a band related article sums up a lot of speculation and rumors (which are not <a href="../../../v/_/_/Wikipedia%7EV_8457.html" title="Wikipedia:V">verifiable</a>) it gives the maintainers a really hard time keeping the article up to par with <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">our own standards</a>. I hope you understand my POV as well.. Rest assured that I will be one of the first with helping you with your article, as soon as it qualifies. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyw_7c9e.html" title="User:Johnnyw">Johnnyw</a> 14:32, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

In particular, if the disputed term was used less than 30 days in the past, it is available on the web via the Rush 24/7 service; older references would require going to an archive, of course. — <a href="../../../d/l/j/User%7EDLJessup_f14d.html" title="User:DLJessup">DLJessup</a> (<a href="../../../d/l/j/User_talk%7EDLJessup_a6a0.html" title="User talk:DLJessup">talk</a>) 15:40, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't hate Limbaugh (or are even very familiar with him) . . . my vote was due to the fact that the article seemed like a list of new words coined and that WP is not a dictionary or list of slang, although there are lost of entries that seem to violate that idea.

<li><b>Keep</b>, here's why:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It's about <i>Limbaugh</i> not about the <i>words</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article is not a <i>dictionary</i>, for that would be the standard definitions of these words. Some of the jargon is not <i>neologism</i> but puns, slang, cultural references. In its own context, it is very useful. It's all <i>cited</i> and both suporters and critics of Limbaugh are contributing, and it is <i>above all, useful</i> to the fans or those simply curious about the show. In terms of the structure of the Wikipedia, it has a <i>natural origin</i> since his jargon began to get entered into both the bio article and into the the show article, making a third article as a spin off necessary. If <i>keep</i> loses, the editors of that page will in all likelyhood, recreate the article again if the pattern we saw in 2005 repeats in 2006. The simple analog would be the <i>episode guide</i> and <i>character guide</i> articles of other creative material. And what's <i>motivating</i> this AfD, anyway? Is this a Wikivote on who likes Limbaugh? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatsw_2d50.html" title="User:Patsw">patsw</a> 03:33, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Way to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>.... No, it shouldn't be a wikivote on who likes Limbaugh. It should be on whether it satisfies WP policies. It's one of a great many lists of slang and jargon that were put on AfD in mid to late Feb, including <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Internet_slang_772f.html" title="List of Internet slang">List of Internet slang</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_US_railfan_jargon_f700.html" title="List of US railfan jargon">List of US railfan jargon</a>, all of which should have been deleted if policy were what truly mattered. So no, particularly considering the context of all those other noms, I think the nom is pretty clearly not a case of anti-Limbaugh bias. There is no doubt a place for all of the lists (internet, railfan, Limbaugh jargon, etc.) somewhere on the web, just not here. I don't know where you get the idea the Limbaugh list is all cited; aren't there just seven cites on the page?</dd>
<dd>It needs a lot more context. When Limbaugh uses these nicknames, how does he use them? Does he say something like "So and so, or as I like to call him, (insert puerile pun here)" or does he say the nickname without ever using the person's real name at all? If the former, or in the cases where the real name is obvious, or context makes the real name obvious, there's really no reason for the list. Also, some of the names seem to indicate faults he finds in the person, but others don't convey any obvious meaning at all. If his fans want to get really <i>encyclopedic,</i> rather than engaging in fanlistcruft, they'd try to: (1) establish when the name was first used by him (2) if he invented it, or if it was in prior use by others (3) what the name means (if not original research), (4) document whether the name was used more than once, and if so how often (otherwise definitely not notable), (5) whether the use of the name has spread beyond his fans (otherwise hardly notable). If all those conditions could be satisfied, possibly the reasons I cited above for why the page should be deleted would not apply. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 04:23, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> As others said, if it merged with another article it would be to one that is already long enough. Given the importance of the show, and the need for someone to already know what he means, this list is necessary.--<a href="../../../b/e/d/User%7EBedford_bc5c.html" title="User:Bedford">Bedford</a> 03:58, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article is misnamed. It may contain references from the show, but it's not <i>jargon</i> so much as schtick. Some of it is manufactured terms, some are portmanteaus and some are just puns, but it's almost all part of Limbaugh's satire and sense of humor/comedy routine, none of it is about creating new definitions or establishing new jargon. It's about commentary, satire, editorializing, etc. In many ways, Limbaugh's manufactured terminology is a defining characteristic of his show, just as such terminology often is with any show. At most, I'd merge it back into the Show article (e.g., South Park's "jargon" schtick is all contained within the show's main article). We have an entire article dedicated to what various abbreviations in World of Warcraft mean. That's far closer to documenting definitions than this article is, and I think neither needs to be removed per policy. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 16:07, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I clicked the link and it took me to "64.70.52.115," which doesn't look like "familyguy.com" (but then again I'm not a DNS computer). But if we accept what it says at face value, it doesn't rule out that "Barely Legal" could be a working title that could get changed to something completely different some time between being sent to the animators and being released on DVD, nor does it rule out that the episode could altogether be discarded without the production code 5ACX03 ever attaching. So based on this evidence alone I'm not ready to change my vote, but I'm willing to consider it if more credible evidence turns up. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromulent_Kwyjibo_1af7.html" title="User:Cromulent Kwyjibo">Cromulent Kwyjibo</a> 00:02, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> It's either a hoax or we are breaking out the crystal ball, either way it should be gone.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The blog entry is treated in such an ephemeral way (c'mon, it's barely two months old and already it gets shuffled off familyguy.com) that the information contained in it can't be treated as all that permanent. I have a feeling the episode will wind up with a completely different title, and the title "Barely Legal" won't take hold in the public consciousness (the way "European Road Show" did for "Road to Rhode Island") so that it won't even merit a redirect. But if there does turn out to be an episode with the title, the article can be created again, no harm done, IF AND WHEN AN AIR DATE OR RELEASE DATE IS ANNOUNCED. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnton_Mravcek_8ffd.html" title="User:Anton Mravcek">Anton Mravcek</a> 22:39, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - might as well delete it i agree its crystal ball-ism and the episode may not reach final production or change names but no it's probably not a hoax it was announced by a director on a subdomain of the offical domain name (granted not hosted by them). non-notable? only because its crystal-ballism. Anton (European Road show/Road to Europe btw) im not the creator of this article i certainly wont recreate it until its aired i dont see the point in stubs on future episodes. I'm only defending it from being labelled a hoax because as far as im aware hoax pages can be locked even if the show changes names it may deserve a redirect.<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDiscordance_cb21.html" title="User:Discordance">Discordance</a> 04:05, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per discussion on article talk page, the sub-list of notable historical people who are claimed to be Rosicrucians is by itself sufficiently notable to justify keeping the article. The list is poorly sourced, but not known to be incorrect. The other sub-lists (of people who were senior Rosicrucians) aren't sufficiently notable for an article outside the main Rosicrucian article, but should be left as-is with the justifyable historical notables list. I will withdraw this objection if the list of notable historical people who were Rosicrucians can be verifyably shown to be incorrect, but until that point, keep. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 21:40, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, please re-read. The list of people in the article are easily widely verifyably claimed to be Rosicrucians throughout many different sources. WP:Verifyability requires that you be able to show that such sources in the real world exist in order to presume facts are correct. Making that verification takes close to no time with any reference material on Rosicrucianism, and I have done so. My point is, that I don't know those sources to be <i>accurate</i> and I'm defending the article because of a rebuttable presumption that they are. Perhaps the article should be retitled <b>List of people claimed to be Rosicrucians</b> or some such, per cases where non-RC sources on their claimed membership aren't substantial. Or the list split further into well-known, claimed, and internal RC members. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 03:57, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Many different groups have called themselves Rosicrucians and many of those groups have claimed historical people as their own to gain prestige. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 13:52, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Clearly true. And there are groups sometimes lumped in with Rosicrucians which would prefer not to be, such as some of the Masonic orders and the like. However, that's not the specific question, which is whether there are sources for the Rosicrucian (in this case, AMORC) claim that the specific list in the article represents prior members of historical notability. Extensive AMORC and related Rosicrucian writings document their claim to that effect, and probably the most central single source available is linked right off the top of the list. It's sourced referenced material, period, and the reference is right there. My position is, given that source reference, it's neutrality-enhancing to claim that the list is of people Rosicrucians claim were members but may not otherwise verifyably have been, and counterevidence to those names would argue that the source isn't to be trusted and therefore isn't a useful reference. I support a NPOV edit disclaimer per above, but don't support deletion unless we can show the list was defective (with references more credible than the Rosicrucians themselves). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 20:11, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If one has so many different groups running around calling themselves Rosicrucian and claiming various people as their own, its a fundamental verifiability issue/definability issue. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:08, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I believe (based on the work of William Poundstone) that AMORC is not a reliable source to document such claims. If you can find an independent source to document your claims, fine, but I don't think a piece of what non-Rosicrucians would consider propaganda qualifies. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 21:26, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The book <i>Bigger Secrets</i>. Essentially presents AMORC as a possible fraud. What it comes down to, though, is that AMORC, irrelevant of whether it is a fraud or not, is not an objective source.

The more recent events mentioned in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_gay_art.html" title="Singapore gay art">Singapore gay art</a> are probably verifiable online. According to the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_public_gay_parties.html" title="Singapore public gay parties">Singapore public gay parties</a> article, the 2004 Nations party was mentioned in Time Magazine and the 2005 version was mentioned in the Sydney Morning Herald;so, it is sourced and somewhat notable. . Where references are wanting, it looks like they might be added. The films article mentions Bugis Street, a Hong Kong-Singapore co-production about Singaporean transvestites, and Rice Rhapsody about a Singaporean gay divorcée; so the topic of the article exists. I think it is acceptable to make an original compilation of information that is verifiable; that is what most articles are. The ban on original research is directed at unverifiable information. The articles are not indiscriminate collections, though the film article is a bit weak here. Pulling the information together adds informational value. Taken together, the articles give a picture of LGBT culture and life in Singapore, which I find to be an interesting topic. <a href="../../../w/u/z/User%7EWuzzy_9768.html" title="User:Wuzzy">Wuzzy</a> 02:35, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>The literature, art and film articles have at least 2 writers. The parties article has only one writer, but was only started in Nov 05. I don't think the fact that an article has only writer makes it a soapbox. It is obvious that the author has an interest in the topic, but that in itself does not make the article a soapbox, not unless the article is argumentative and one-sided. <a href="../../../w/u/z/User%7EWuzzy_9768.html" title="User:Wuzzy">Wuzzy</a> 15:10, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Bad idea because categories without articles in them get deleted very quickly. So the correct order is to first write a few decent articles and when they need some legitimate categorization, go ahead and first see if there are already pre-existing categories that foot the bill and only then decide how to create suitable new categories. But do not "blaze away" with categories if there is nothing to put into them. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 11:35, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
