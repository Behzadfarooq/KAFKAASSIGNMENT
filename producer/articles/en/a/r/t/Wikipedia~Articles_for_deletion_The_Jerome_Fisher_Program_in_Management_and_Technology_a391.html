<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. This appears to be nothing more than an abbreviatied college catalog description, somewhat in the nature of an <b>advertisement</b> or <b>recruitment</b> materials. There does not appear to be any historical, social, academic, or political accomplishment or achievement of note atributable to this program. Not that it's a bad program, it seems perferctly fine, but it's not appropriate for an article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B.</a> 06:00, 4 June 2006 (UTC) Alternatively <b>Redirect</b> to Wharton B School page as discussed below by Alex S, who has cleaned up the article quite a bit. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B.</a> 01:20, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> The Wharton School is considered by many to be the best undergraduate business program in the world. Information from the program's website <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/fisher/about/classroom.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.upenn.edu/fisher/about/classroom.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/fisher/about/faculty.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.upenn.edu/fisher/about/faculty.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> shows notability in its faculty and in the accomplishments of its alumni. This is clearly a program with an international reputation and impact. Should not be deleted. If necessary, should become a <b>redirect</b> to the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wharton_School_7af3.html" title="Wharton School">Wharton School</a>. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_S_5f20.html" title="User:Alex S">Alex S</a> 02:28, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b> I'm aware of Wharton's reputation. If WP has a practice of including coverage of programs within articles covering educational institutions (seems sensible enough) then a <b>Redirect</b> may be the best resolution. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B.</a> 01:20, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Edited the page for NPOV, notable facts, and general cleanup. I think it's also noteworthy that Metropolitan90 is nominating this article for deletion because he believes that Ivy League programs in general are not notable (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Brooklyn_College_B.A.-M.D._Program" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Brooklyn_College_B.A.-M.D._Program" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). <i>"If you find any Ivy League affiliated joint degree programs with individual articles in Wikipedia, let me know and I will submit those articles for deletion too." --Metropolitan90 01:12, 20 April 2006 (UTC).</i> Wikipedia has <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_Era_Mobile_Units_e1af.html" title="Cosmic Era Mobile Units">87 articles on fictional Japanese giant robots</a>, I think it has room for programs that produce many of our country's future leaders, in business and otherwise. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_S_5f20.html" title="User:Alex S">Alex S</a> 17:45, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. My objection is to joint degree programs in general having articles, not to Ivy League topics. After all, if a university offers <i>n</i> different degrees, it could have up to 0.5<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> - 0.5<i>n</i> different joint degree programs, and I don't see the need for that many separate articles. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 02:03, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> in response to Metropolitan90: <i>Could</i>. But the fact is, they don't. Penn, which is known for its emphasis on interdisciplinary programs, has only five.

<dd><b>Comment</b> in response to Ande B.: Take a look at the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html#Residential_Houses" title="Harvard">Harvard#Residential Houses</a> and <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale.html#Residential_colleges" title="Yale">Yale#Residential colleges</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - 1) That <i>"An individual academic program at a university is generally too narrow a topic to warrant an article of its own"</i> is a point of view of your own. hundreds of people apply to these programs and having been one of those i would dearly love to see an objective source about it other than from its own website and very dubious entries on collegeconfidential. 2)<i>"This appears to be nothing more than an abbreviatied college catalog description, somewhat in the nature of an <b>advertisement</b> or <b>recruitment</b> materials. There does not appear to be any historical, social, academic, or political accomplishment or achievement of note atributable to this program."</i> that could be because nobody has put any in yet, or it is still too early, call me biased but i am sure at least some kind of "accomplishment or achievement" will happen sometime in wikipedia's lifetime and should a wikipedian wish to record it down he will happen upon this article. something that doesn't meet standards for an article now doesn't mean all of it should be deleted. don't throw the baby out with the bath water. 3) the last argument that there could be too many JDP's to cover as wikipedia articles... well.. i hear alex S on that one. actual PEOPLE spend years going thru these programs and even more years after seeking employment and a place in society based on the credentials and experience they gain from these programs. It is a life changing decision to join one, and i would at the very least prefer a resource on wikipedia to research. the seeming consensus on redirecting it to the wharton page where there it merely mentions <i>"Wharton Undergraduates may pursue a dual degrees in engineering through the Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology (M&amp;T) and international business through <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Huntsman_Program_in_International_Studies_and_Business_feaa.html" title="The Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business">the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business</a> (ISB)."</i> is not going to help a lot. and yes i declare my own interest in this to the extent that i have gone and put up a huntsman article, which is far from perfect (i am quite new to this) now but could be a lot better with a lot more work. go ahead and list it for deletion if you want, but i hope more people support me on my rebuttals of points 1-3 and find that it actually does deserve an article by itself. over to you. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawnthe1_9203.html" title="User:Shawnthe1">ahwang</a> 03:00, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I should note that I submitted a previous article about the Huntsman program for deletion (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Huntsman_Program_in_International_Studies_and_Business_af2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business</a>) and it was in fact deleted just 8 days ago. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 07:08, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>hm noted. didn't know cos i only started surfing around this corner of wikipedia i think 2 days ago. well anywaes, i hope the present incarnation is far more wiki-worthy. i shall be waiting around to have a feel of its general reception before working on it some more next weekend, got to go back into my dull dreary army camp soon&#160;:( and by working on it some more i mean reworking what is publicly available from the official site into something that people can truly use and is not quite so verbose. i'm somewhat cheered that you didn't immediately AfD the new article. any pointers? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawnthe1_9203.html" title="User:Shawnthe1">ahwang</a> 10:09, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
