<p>This article is a mess, reads like a drug-abusers' manual, and in my opinion has no place in Wikipedia. The entire article is basically a reworded copy of the DXM Faq available at the "Vaults of Erowid" website, <a href="http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_faq.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_faq.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_faq.shtml</a>. Sufficient information on recreational DXM use is already available in the main <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html" title="Dextromethorphan">dextromethorphan</a> Wikipedia article.

<li>Delldot and I have gotten to work on this, so I urge anyone who's already voted "delete" to go back and look over the article. It's substantially better now, with far more citations and less OR. <a href="../../../j/o/l/User%7EJolb_9efd.html" title="User:Jolb">Jolb</a> 22:48, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article is two years old with a long history. In 2004, the article apparently <a href="../../../n/o/n/Talk%7ENon-medical_use_of_dextromethorphan_ae62.html#Cleanup." title="Talk:Non-medical use of dextromethorphan">had an alarmist tone</a>, which appears to have been corrected. The pendulum apparently has now swung the other way. However, I don't see inherent problems with the topic itself at all, balance in the article can be brought with some cleanup effort. There seems to be plenty of valuable information on this page still, and since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>, anti-social topics should not be banned as long as the big three content policies (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>) are followed. Finally, the merge process does not involve AfD. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 07:41, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a very real topic that deserves its own page. There's plenty of media coverage of DXM abuse, and I'm sure that some people might find this a useful source of information.

<dd>Though some parts are well written, this article reads much more like a "how to" guide for abuse than an encyclopedia article on the history of a specific substance non-medical usage. The message seems to be focused on detailing safe recreational usage protocol, riddled with weasel words and what appears to be original research. A complete rewrite may be in order. --NEMT 06:19, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to Wikipedia:No original research and other content policies, all additions to Wikipedia must have sources - that is, they must be previously published by a reputable source. This article is subject to many edits that add nothing more than personal slang, personal opinions, and other original research.

<dd><b>Now from me</b>: Almost the entire article is originally sourced or sourced from the DXM Faq at Erowid, which although it is widely used due to the lack of reputable information elsewhere on the topic, is still arguably not a reputable source in itself. Should the article be kept I would continue to help clean it up as I've already started doing, however I still question its merit as a standalone article. The actual reputable information that doesn't consist of original slang can be sufficiently represented in the "Recreational use" subsection of the <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html" title="Dextromethorphan">Dextromethorphan</a> main article. Since the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-medical_use_of_dextromethorphan.html" title="Non-medical use of dextromethorphan">Non-medical use of dextromethorphan</a> article is basically just a rehash of the DXM Faq at Erowid, an external link to that site would be a better conformance to Wikipedia's "no original research" policy and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style" rel="nofollow">quality standards</a>, while still providing that external information to those who would like to judge its reputability for themselves. The content's merit as "encyclopedic content" is very questionable. Equazcion 16:45, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If the article has problems, this is not a reason for deletion, we can just fix them. Remove OR, unsourced statements, and text that is too similar to copyrighted text, stub down if necessary.

But I find that highly unlikely.

<li><b>The reasons for deleting the article exceed the simple low quality of its content</b>, although I haven't properly stated that. Cleaning up the article will only produce a copy of the <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html" title="Dextromethorphan">Dextromethorphan</a> recreational use section. It simply isn't warranted to have two articles that describe a single drug. Although the LSD article may contain similar information on abuse (a point stated above), there is still only one article, rather than one describing the medical use and one describing the recreational use. If the non-medical article were stripped down to only valid, verifiable data, and rewritten so as not to be a "how-to" on abuse, what's left would be information that is already contained in the existing "Recreational use" section of the main <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html" title="Dextromethorphan">Dextromethorphan</a> article. Even the recreational information in the <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html" title="Dextromethorphan">Dextromethorphan</a> article is largely unsourced, although I feel much of it is worthy of being left in since it is largely common knowledge, and its lack of reliable sources is only due to its lack of proper public studies. In other words, clean up the non-medical use article, and you'll be left with the dextromethorphan article's "recreational use" section. A separate article for that purpose is simply redundant, and does nothing more than create a dumping ground for tips on abuse and more unverified information.

<li><b>Comment</b> - If cleaning up in this manner does produce a duplicate, I'd suggest a merge and redirect. That way it wouldn't have to be deleted, and the potentially valuable history 2 year old would be left intact. Also, folks that come back looking for the old article will still be directed to a useful article. Redirects are cheap, there's no reason to delete outright here. (For the record, though, I still think there's enough here to merit a separate article). <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelldot_cc92.html" title="User:Delldot">delldot</a> | <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelldot_82a5.html" title="User talk:Delldot">talk</a></small> 03:44, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>My earlier OR claim was unfounded; the article carries numerous links to apparently-reliable sources. Erowid, though far from ideal, could be thought of as a reliable source for reasons that are out of scope for this discussion. "Bad writing" ranges from inappropriate use of SI abbreviations ("mgs") to comparisons with other illegal drugs that are probably outside of the average reader's sphere of knowledge. I have some free time tomorrow to change this article's tone a bit, assuming someone else doesn't beat me to it. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlakeloaf_bedc.html" title="User:Flakeloaf">Flakeloaf</a> 23:31, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I've added a few 'Citation Needed' tags and will continue to do so. Take a look through the article to find them as those are examples of specific complaints. In response to Erowid being a reliable source, Erowid itself is a collection of articles written by the community and sometimes cited with reliable sources. However the specific article we're talking about is not Erowid but the DXM Faq written by William White, which originally had nothing to do with Erowid; it is just featured there now, among other places on the web. Much of White's research, while it may make sense, is based largely on original experiences reported in by people who emailed him their stories or posted on forum message boards. No one even knows who William White is, what his credentials are (if any), or even if that is his real name. I admit the lack of genuine legitimate studies in this field makes the task of separating reliable from unreliable information very ambiguous. However without reliable sources, the encyclopedic content drawn from the DXM Faq should be very limited, and again, I think what's in the main <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html" title="Dextromethorphan">dextromethorphan</a> article does that job already. I've been reading through the non-medical use article, and fixing it would mean rewriting it to basically look like the dextromethorphan article. The history section is perhaps the only significant thing this article adds, so maybe if everything else were eliminated we could re-title the article "History of recreational DXM use" and save it for that sole purpose.

<li><b>I've removed the cleanup tag</b> as the article's quality has seen a vast improvement in the past couple of days. If the prospect of having the article deleted served as motivation for its improvement then it has served its purpose. I admit I'm not sure where that leaves us. I still feel merging is an option, as is making the article purely for the purpose of the history of recreational use, since the non-medical use's history section is still the main significant contribution that article serves. However as I see it, leaving the main DXM article as is, while simultaneously keeping the non-medical use article as a source of expanded recreational information, would be fine at this point. Please take a look through the 'newly renovated' <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-medical_use_of_dextromethorphan.html" title="Non-medical use of dextromethorphan">Non-medical use of dextromethorphan</a> and post your opinions on what should be done.

<li><b>I've also proposed the deletion of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_C_d4b6.html" title="Triple C">Triple C</a></b> in favor of replacing with a redirect to <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-medical_use_of_dextromethorphan.html" title="Non-medical use of dextromethorphan">Non-medical use of dextromethorphan</a> (assuming this article ends up staying) since all of its content has effectively been merged here already.

<li><b>Merge and Redirect</b> It <i>is</i> well-referenced but the article, at it's essence, is about the drug (without the drug, there could be no non-medical use). The info regarding use of the drug, regardless of prescription, should properly be on the page of said drug.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">William Thweatt</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamThweatt_8c60.html" title="User talk:WilliamThweatt">Talk</a></sup> | <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WilliamThweatt_f34f.html" title="Special:Contributions/WilliamThweatt">Contribs</a></sup> 01:24, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>The argument against merging</b> is that it would make the main DXM article too long. As it stands now, if the non-medical article were merged into the medical article, it would make the medical article contain more recreational content than medical content. However, after the redundant information between the two articles is eliminated, there wouldn't be much left to merge aside from that History section; hence my suggestion to make the Non-medical article for historical info only, changing its name to "History of recreational DXM use," and leave the other scientific recreational info in the main DXM article.

<li>My argument is that because the <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html#Recreational_use" title="Dextromethorphan">Recreational Use</a> section of <i>Dextromethorphan</i> is so poorly written and poorly referenced, that section should be cut down. People will then click the "main article" link in that section and be directed to <i>Non-medical use of dextromethorphan</i>, which is more thorough, referenced more thoroughly (and therefore less OR), and more NPOV. <a href="../../../j/o/l/User%7EJolb_9efd.html" title="User:Jolb">Jolb</a> 03:14, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The question of which to keep shouldn't regard the content itself but instead the merit of having two separate articles in the first place. Recreational use of a drug traditionally falls under the main article for that drug and not to a separate article. The history here may merit a separate article, but otherwise, there is no reason to have a separate article just to describe recreational use. Furthermore I don't think the <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html#Recreational_use" title="Dextromethorphan">Recreational Use</a> section of <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html" title="Dextromethorphan">Dextromethorphan</a> is poorly written or poorly referenced. Even if both were true, it would be in the same state as the Non-medical article was just a couple of days ago, and similar corrections could be made there as they were here (and as far as references I've already done much of that). If it still needs additional references then please add appropriate cn tags, as was done for the Non-medical article before. The argument for keeping the Non-medical article was that a lack of references and poor writing is no reason for deleting an article, and the same holds true with the recreational section of the DXM article. Given the choice between fixing the recreational portion of the DXM article or simply eliminating it in favor of an outside article in order to correct the problem of it being poorly written/referenced, it makes much more sense to simply correct the recreational use section of the DXM article. There just isn't a need for an entire separate article about something that would normally be a section of another article.Equazcion 03:33, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Although, again, no merge at all would also be fine. Both could be kept, with the Non-medical use article as a source of expanded information on recreational use, for those who are interested, as it basically is currently. Now that the article has been fixed up I think that would be a legitimate option. Equazcion 03:48, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
