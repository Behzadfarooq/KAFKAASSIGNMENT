<dd>As for the list you give. Matthew 4:14 is not John 20:16, it isn't amongst John 20, it isn't Matthew 2:1-16, it isn't Genesis 1:1, it isn't amongst Matthew 1, so really much of that is a red herring. --<b>User talk:FDuffy</b> 14:46, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think anyone could argue that articles on the Gospel of John should be kept does no also mean that articles in the Gospel of Matthew should also be retained. The worthiness for encyclopedia articles is identical. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 14:52, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is just a <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">red herring</a></b>. Those votes ended without consensus. They discussed too many articles at once.

<dl>
<dd>As with the others this may be a stub, but there is still considerable room for expansion. It is also useful to have this article for ease of readability, as some readers will want to read several verses in order. While this verse might be short, those around it are quite substantial. Deleting the stubs breaks the navigation bar at the bottom of the article, and prevents readers from moving from <a href="../../../1/3/_/Matthew_4%7E13.html" title="Matthew 4:13">Matthew 4:13</a> to <a href="../../../1/5/_/Matthew_4%7E15.html" title="Matthew 4:15">Matthew 4:15</a> and beyond. Having the ability to read verses in order is an important compromise for those who feel these subjects need more context than a single verse offers. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 15:02, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The navigation bar at the bottom of the article is POV. It seems to suggest that there is something automatically noteworthy about all verses in the bible. Verses were created in the mediaeval era. The division is entirely artificial, as acknowledged by many modern bibles which re-arrange verses into paragraphs and quotes, reading verses in order is NOT the purpose of an encyclopedia. --<b>User talk:FDuffy</b> 15:50, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Organization by verses is still the universal scholarly standard. It is far better to go with this than try to develop our own divisions, which would infinitely more POV. All verses may not be noteworthy, but there is no notability requirement. Verifiability is a requirement, but with the vast literature on Biblical criticism, writing a verifiable non-original research article on each verse is quite straightforward. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 16:02, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is simply not the way to treat books of the bible. Talk about subjects like the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy_of_Jesus_8dec.html" title="Genealogy of Jesus">Genealogy of Jesus</a>, not the verses one by one. The verse structure is a mediaeval construct. Often the books were divided into verses and chapters simply in such a way as to get a nice or significant number of them, like 50 (n.b. one of the gospels, I believe it is Mark, has <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_of_the_beast.html" title="Number of the beast">666 verses</a> in total), rather than trying to respect the original sentence divisions. The only reason they weren't deleted/merged half a year ago is because the closing admin was biased and chose to count the vote as a keep despite the fact that twice as many people voted to delete and/or merge the articles than did to keep them. --<a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">Victim of signature fascism</a> | help remove biblecruft 01:53, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, whoa whoa whoa, guys, I'm not religious at all, but the Bible (and the New Testament as part of the Bible) is the most obsessively studied and interpreted and commented upon book in human history.

<li><b>Merge/Delete</b> per nom. Wikipedia is easily changed if this article ever provokes any discussion, but we don't need hundreds of articles on bible verses when there's not much more than the verse itself there. The only bible verse article I would support is <a href="../../../1/6/_/John_3%7E16.html" title="John 3:16">John 3:16</a>, no other verse is a widely known. - <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPureblade_Main_f0b5.html" title="User:Pureblade/Main"><span style="cursor:crosshair">Pureblade</span></a> | <a href="../../../p/u/r/User_talk%7EPureblade_98a7.html" title="User talk:Pureblade"><sup><span style="cursor:help">Θ</span></sup></a> 18:21, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: We appear to have articles on every verse between Matthew 1-6 and John 20. I don't know if it's too much work to delete them all; deleting some of them piecemeal will leave us with a random collection of red wikilinks in the "next verse" segment of the page. It's too late for me to unravel this. <b>No vote</b>. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 03:00, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
