The consensus has been that restaurants (and stores, malls, and most other commercial operations) aren't in the same class of importance, and (partly to avoid advertising) WP keeps their articles only if some broad notability is verified. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 05:15, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>This place is a landmark and has cult status. Its not just some restaurant. Whats with comment after my post? Im just a guy who edited this page and my name is Tom. I'm not registered because I wanted to provide useful information, unlike "per nom" before an entry gets deleted by people who don't know anything about it. Since when is Google the be all and end all for posts on Wikipedia? If thats the case, then why does Wikipedia even exist? Also, what does "beware of socks" mean? If you have something to say, then say it, or is Wikipedia just about some elite group of insiders who use some kind of WikiSpeak to get rid of entries they simply dont know about or dont like? Like Biermacht mentioned, Pat's has been written upn in the New York Times, as well as commented on on espn.com. I've been to Pat's, I've talked about Pat's. To some people it's legendary. I have no financial gain whatsoever to Pat's being listed on Wikipedia. If you have a valid entry to make, then say it. If you think this should be deleted "per nom" than take the time to support "nom"'s argument, otherwise, shut up. <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom.html" title="Tom">Tom</a> 10:45, 28 September 2005 (UTC) <small>this user has made no edits ... not even to this page?</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the author of this article. It is noteworthy, verifiable and doesn't fall under any of Wikipedia's categories of problems that require deletion. Nom's statment that "It is a restaurant there are hundreds of thousands of those out there Question is does [sic] we want an article on those hundreds of thousands of restaurants" is unhelpful and contrary to Wikipedia's own policies ("Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia. This means that there is no practical limit to number of topics we can cover other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page"). Furthermore, any contention that this article is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_propaganda_machine" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_propaganda_machine" rel="nofollow">advertising</a> is contradicted by the lack of an address or phone number in the article, and the fact that the business doesn't even operate under the name "Pat's Hubba Hubba" anymore. Any concerns about this article involving a "very small 'garage' compan[y]" is satisfied because the information is third-party verifiable (and reported in the widely circulated New York Times, among others). The NY Times articles describe the cultural phenomanon that is Pat's, and are not simply restaurant reviews. The "broad notability" requirment mentioned above is thus satisfied. And finally, just because commentators like Dr. Alf thinks the information in this article is boring does not mean that one should prevent the information from being posted. Others may not share his sentiment about the content of the article. In short, don't limit readers' access to information by broadening Wikipedia's deletion policy because you yourself aren't interested in the articles contents.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I verified the New York Times article. Port Chester is about 31 miles from New York, so that means something. The article is: "Everybody Comes to Hubba's.

<li><b>Comment</b> If you can't write more than 2 letters than please don't bother to become part of a discusssion. I vote to delete this 'comment' as it's utterly worthless. And by the way, the what does someone born in the UK and living in France know about the legitimacy of a an entry for Pat's Hubba Hubba? Have you ever even been there or heard about it? I haven't been or heard about a lot of relevant places in France, does that make them worthless and not notable. Why not take the time to write some kind of opinion besides a cowardly "nn". - Tom</li>
<li>I happen to live in a free country Tom. I'm entitled to express an opinion even if it is one you disagree with. I don't need to explain my reasons to you or to anyone else. In this case, given the little I can find out about the place, I consider it a non-notable restaurant and thus not worth keeping. Hence the delete. I'm sorry if you find nn too brief.

"<i>I consider it a non-notable restaurant and thus not worth keeping</i>" Again, Not-Notable is not criteria for deletion. How many times does this have to be pointed out to people? - Tom</li>
<li><b>Comment to Marcus22</b> Biermacht the author here. Actually, you <i>do</i> have to explain your reasons when voting on a listing for deletion. You might want to brush up on the rules for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Commenting_on_a_listing_for_deletion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Commenting_on_a_listing_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">commenting on a listing for deletion</a> before voting again. You might have missed the important stuff in the rules; I mean, it it was only <i>emphasized in italics</i>. "When expressing an opinion, please include <i>your opinion, your reasoning,</i> and sign (with four consecutive tilde characters)." If you don't want to "explain your reasons to anyone else" then I suggest you stop voting, because your votes are unhelpful. Biermacht 14:49, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Votes with <i>no</i> comments are often counted, never mind votes that simply say "not notable" (which is what "nn" stands for). So don't count on this vote going down on that basis. By the way, Tom, I suggest making an account rather than just linking to the article on <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom.html" title="Tom">Tom</a> all the time.

<li>Well, thank you Lord Bob, JAranda and Marcus 22 for turning the bold idea of WikiPedia into nothing more than a popularity contest and ego trip for users. Have fun. I won't waste my time making a login as this experience has made it clear that WikiPedia is just another metafilter.com or slashdot.com, and not the impartial, objective resource it was intended to be. I mean some guys in Florida and France actively go after the deletion of an entry for a legendary local restaurant in New York they have never heard of or been to, without offering much, in Marcus22's case, no argument at all. Why? It's just sad really. - Tom
<ul>
<li>Like all of Wikipedia, AfD rests on the assumption that a group of people can come to reasonable judgements on subjects in which they are not experts by the use of due diligence, basic scholarship, and simple research. Your argument that only people with direct knowledge of the restaurant should participate in discussing is like saying that only people with botany degrees should edit articles on trees. For better or for worse, Wikipedia doesn't work that way. You don't need to know Hubba to express a valid opinion on whether a restaurant that is famous in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Chester%2C_New_York_0b71.html" title="Port Chester, New York">Port Chester, New York</a> and a surrounding area—probably greater than a county but less than state—needs an article of its own. Personally, I think a paragraph in the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Chester%2C_New_York_0b71.html" title="Port Chester, New York">Port Chester</a> article is probably what is appropriate. What is your compelling case for needed a separate article rather than a section in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Chester%2C_New_York_0b71.html" title="Port Chester, New York">Port Chester</a>? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:24, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's not what I'm saying, that's what you're inferring. "participate in discussing", as you put it, is the problem here. Writing "nn" or "per mod" is pretty much the same thing as "trees suck, huh huh huh". I see a lot of "valid opinion" for keeping the article and lot of posting "Delete" so they can get a link up to thier profile page. To me writing "nn" or "per mod" is nothing more than self promotional comment spam. - Tom</li>

<li>Me, I'd vote to <b>keep</b> it, despite the writer's best efforts at annoying all and sundry. It does seem to be something of a local landmark, judging by the links. Then again, I'm in England and haven't been to this restaurant, so maybe my vote shouldn't be counted either? <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 13:11, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment to All, and Lord Bob in particular, from the Author</b> - As stated above, lack of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> is NOT a criterion for deletion, nor is it even being considered as a criterion for deletion. I thus call on the administrators to give no weight to the nominators post, and all the posters that parroted him/her. They are per se invalid. Let's stop this nonsense of of using false criteria for deletion right now! Limiting information is a very powerful thing, and to do so arbitrarily or based on made-up rules is completely contrary to Wikipedia's mission. I am very troubled that an accurate, verifiable article that doesn't violate Wikipedia's rules and guidelines is in danger of being deleted because of negative votes that offer no valid discussion and no valid basis for deletion. Comments that the article is worthless, useless, and boring are not helpful in the discussion because they are opinion. Furthermore, regardless of whether notability is a criterion, the subject of the article was reported in widely circulated and well-respected media outlets. The subject is widely known in the largest metropolitan area in North America. It has been called a "landmark" by the New York Times. It's notability is unquestionable. And one more thing, I am the author of the article. Tom is not the author, nor is he my sock puppet. What I think Tom is saying is that if you are from Canada, France, Florida or anywhere outside of the New York City metropolitan area, don't say that the article is not notable without reading the sources first. Otherwise, when you post "nn" you are simply saying "I have not heard of this place, and I don't find it important to me." Take the time to research an article before voting to prevent the information from being published.Biermacht 10:40, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Notability has always been and still is a de facto criterion. It has never been formalized as policy because nobody has ever been able to agree on criteria. Therefore, judgements of notability are hashed out case by case in individual discussions, without the benefit of codified policy, leading to contention. Notability <i>is</i> a criterion for some categories of articles, e.g. biographies. You say "I am very troubled that an accurate, verifiable article that doesn't violate Wikipedia's rules and guidelines is in danger of being deleted." However, many items of information that are accurate and verifiable, yet unencyclopedic. And nobody is preventing the information from being published. In fact, nobody is preventing <i>you</i> from using <i>Wikipedia</i> to publish it. This information can go in the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Chester%2C_New_York_0b71.html" title="Port Chester, New York">Port Chester, New York</a> article, in a suitably abbreviated form, and you are certainly free to put the entire article on your personal user page, which you do not presently seem to be using for anything else. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:17, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Dpbsmith, I appreciate you taking the time to express your viewpoint in a reasonable and rational manner. I only wish the vast majority of "delete" posters took the time to do the same. If someone believes that the article is not notable, then they should say <i>why</i> it is not notable. I believe that is all the more important because notability is not an official requirement. Taking five minutes to explain one's point of view is not too much to ask when they are voting to delete information from Wikipedia. I do disagree with you about them not preventing information from being published. You are the only person that took the time to offer an alternative method of information distribution. Everyone else voted to shut down the article, period. Censoring the flow of information is a very powerful thing, and voting to to do so deserves more than the glib response that the majority of "delete" voters gave. And once again, I maintain that Pat's Hubba Hubba is notable and deserves its own page. It is a landmark in the largest metropolitan area in North America, as verified by several major media outlets. But thanks for providing me with alternatives.Biermacht 12:15, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, you want to know why I think this restaurant is not notable? Because it's a restaurant. That's all it is. There are millions of restaurants. What's special about this restaurant? I examine the article, and the closest thing I can see to being special is a glowing endorsement, in passing, of one of its dishes from Bill Simmons. I like Bill Simmons, when he isn't interviewing two-bit authors instead of doing his job. But, in my opinion, this article does not establish that this restaurant is any more special than millions of other restaurants. Having really hot chili and a former chain smoker for a proprietor does not notability make. And why didn't I write this all in my original vote? Because when I say something is "non-notable", I very seldom have to go into considerable detail of why it is so because people can see it for themselves. Perhaps it's notable to people who eat at it, but Wikipedia is not Westchester County, New Yorkpedia. Being a landmark isn't notable, there's a freakin' <i>hill</i> in my hometown that's a landmark. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 16:57, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am guessing that the New York Times, and the Victoria Times Colonist for that matter, never wrote an article on a <i>hill</i> in your hometown. If they did I would say that your hill is obviously noteworthy, since they took the time to <i>note</i> it in their newspapers. BTW, I linked Google's cached version of the NY Times article, so if you have had trouble getting access to it, why not read it? It might change your mind. Also, I am not trying to turn this into New Yorkepedia, but since when is national or international notoriety a requirement? Isn't it more important to put things in Wikipedia that aren't universally known, so that people can <i>learn</i> about them?. Isn't that the point of an encyclopedia that is not bound by paper pages?Biermacht 14:23, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Everybody's definition of what's notable varies, from my experience. The hill in question has been articled several times, although not in the New York Times (nor the Times-Colonist since I wasn't born in Victoria and the hill isn't there), but I don't think everything in the Times is notable because it was in the Times. There are many people who think that local notice is enough, and as <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> pointed out below, there are enough people who think this restaurant is notable that it is almost certain it'll still have a Wikipedia article when this AfD closes. I respect people who say that local notability is enough, but I disagree with it, which is why I voted delete, above. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 18:34, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A hill that's a landmark and has been written about in articles. Now, that really sounds interesting. This must be one special hill. It's too bad there's no WikiPedia entry for it. Seriously. - Tom</li>

</li>
<li>Biermacht, just in case you aren't aware... I presently see eight <i>keeps</i> and eleven <i>deletes.</i> That means that <i>my personal guess</i> is that the article is probably not going to be deleted. When a sysop "closes" a discussion, he or she looks at the discussion and judges whether there is a "rough consensus for deletion." Barring voting irregularities and special circumstances, most of the time most sysops take a 2/3 majority as a guideline. AfD tends to bring out the very worst in Wikipedians. The reason so many comments are curt is that there's no very good way to decide what should go into Wikipedia and what shouldn't, so anyone who participates in AfD has heard it all dozens of times before and everyone tends to be curt and short-tempered. That's not an excuse, just an explanation. I see someone's added references to the article. That's a Good Thing. I see someone else has edited to tone down the promotional language. That's a Good Thing too. Cheers.

You can find the website <a href="http://maze.studio-zoe.com/" class="external text" title="http://maze.studio-zoe.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, its Alexa ranking is <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=maze.icomix.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=maze.icomix.com/" rel="nofollow">over 600,000</a>. A google search for irritability webcomic, without quotes gives 100 links, and nothing which suggests notability. And if we take a look at what links here for irritability, we find that the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Irritability_7699.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Irritability">majority of links are</a> for the medical condition! Looking at this, we must ask ourselves, why does this website deserve an article? What makes this website any more notable than every other website out there? Just because a website has been running for 6 years, does that instantly make it notable? <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 01:24, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Effort has been put into this article. That can not be denied. But we should not judge whether to delete it because of the quality of the content, but what that content actually refers to. The webcomic, which can be found <a href="http://www.mangagaga.tk/" class="external text" title="http://www.mangagaga.tk/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, has zero alexa stats. The deadspot forums can be found <a href="http://cosmic-hero.com/forum/" class="external text" title="http://cosmic-hero.com/forum/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Note that the forum is shared between 3 webcomics, and has less than 100 members. The claim that there have been 150,000 visitors to the site since its inception is due to the shoddy nature of their webcounter, you click refresh and it updates! I have probably added about 5 to it just by browsing around the site, and the none existent alexa numbers back it up. Moderate success on newgrounds? Is the "Daily 4th Place Award - 08/13/2004" moderate success? I could write a great article on the lamppost outside my house, that doesn't mean it's notable. Same for this webcomic, nothing here suggests why its more notable than any other website. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 01:40, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

So, basically your entire logic for the need for this article’s deletion is because you don’t think that enough people care about the subject matter? That’s completely absurd for an online encyclopedia that exists for the sole purpose of providing information for people on as large of a scale of subjects as possible. I’d agree with you that an article on the lamppost outside your house should be deleted, as it covers a subject that would be just about identical to every single lamppost in existence (other than location, of course). Comparing said lamppost to a webcomic, no matter how small however, is an utterly gross exaggeration of the situation at hand. The purpose of an encyclopedia is not to only make individual articles that will only be popular to as large of a degree as possible; an encyclopedia’s purpose is to provide a plethora of all types of information so as to allow anyone who comes with a reasonable and legitimate interest in a subject matter to learn more on the topic at hand. That’s one of the great things about Wikipedia! The fact that anyone can submit material and create articles on whatever they wish allows for the online material to grow larger and larger and let the amount of possible material to be covered to become more and more complete as time passes. Simply saying that a subject doesn’t deserve coverage because it’s not popular enough goes completely against the essence of Wikipedia at large. Your logic that we should delete article because of the content regardless of the quality is likewise flawed because it suggests that a horribly written article on Star Wars would be on a higher level than a very well-written article on a relatively unknown novel. Sure, more people would be interested in a Star Wars article, but does that immediately discount the people who would have a legitimate interest in a smaller subject matter? If it does, then I’m obviously missing the entire point of an online encyclopedia. – <a href="../../../r/p/h/User%7ERPH_0dcc.html" title="User:RPH">RPH</a></p>

<li><b>Reply</b> - No, a horrible article on Star Wars would, and should be kept. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. The place for very obscure and unnotable webcomics is not wikipedia. The lamppost may be a poor analogy, but judging from the links given above, there is nothing which would lift this website above any other website. I am sure that there will be some teenage girl's livejournal with a larger readership than this. Do you know about comixPedia? It <i>is</i> the place for none notable comics to go. And Manga-Gaga is <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Manga-Gaga" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Manga-Gaga" rel="nofollow">already there</a>. For those wanting to find out about comics, comixpedia is great, and Manga-Gaga belongs there where those who want to find out about comics can go. If it attains notability beyond other websites and other webcomics, then it would be worthy to import it back to wikipedia.

<li>Actually, deletion precedent is on the side of keeping the Manga-Gaga article on Wikipedia. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Precedents#Internet" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Precedents#Internet" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] The term "notability" is used as the key for keeping webcomic articles on Wikipedia, and Manga-Gaga clearly meets the citeria listed there. The only mention there is of the need for a webcomic to have been updated once a week for at least a year for it to be considered notable. There is no mention of a webcomic's popularity in regards to its notability. As of now, Manga-Gaga has had three full seasons, each one averaging out at one comic a week for a full year. Therefore, using that logic, keeping the article on Wikipedia is in concordance with the regulations and precedent set by past decisions by the site's administrators. - <a href="../../../r/p/h/User%7ERPH_0dcc.html" title="User:RPH">RPH</a>

<li><b>Reply</b> - Please see the talk pages on <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a>, they have been criticised for being overly lax. Compare those guidelines, (guidelines, not policy), to say <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The guidelines were not set by administrators, and did not take into account past deletions/decisions. By the webcomic guidelines, every comic with 100 strips would be included. This is clearly wrong, what about bloggers with 100 posts? wikipedians with 100 articles? I still maintain that a webcomic with no alexa rank, no mentions of notability on google and only 98 forum members in a shared forum does not meet common sense notability criteria. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 03:15, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You may think that if you wish. Heck, you can even try to change the Wikipedia guidelines if that's what you truly believe, but the fact of that matter is that is the policy that has been set by precedent for webcomic articles on this site. In your previous post you even said that "standards of notability had to be maintained," and Manga-Gaga fits the standards laid out by the site itself. It may be different for other types of popular (or unpopular) media, but it's not for the individual users to make arbitrary decisions for the deletion of articles based on what they may or may not see as important by themselves. However, even if we used the guidelines proposed in your link [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:COMIC#Alternate_Alternate_proposal" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:COMIC#Alternate_Alternate_proposal" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>], they clearly state that a comic that has been regularly updated for three years deserves a place on Wikipedia. Manga-Gaga fits under that guideline, arbitrary though it may be. <a href="../../../r/p/h/User%7ERPH_0dcc.html" title="User:RPH">RPH</a>

<li>Well, you may be right about that. I really don't know as I've never followed the deletion patterns on Wikipedia. All I know is that the official discussion on the subject matter defends Manga-Gaga's place on the site, so unless there's listed evidence elsewhere, it deserves an article on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/p/h/User%7ERPH_0dcc.html" title="User:RPH">RPH</a></li>

Also, the more-than-one-author rule of the alternate proposal of <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> goes against this article, in this case, so using it to support an argument wouldn't really help (as Nifboy said earlier, the 100-comic rule has never saved a webcomic article). However, in a sense, that is beyond the point, as it isn't even a guideline. What those proposals seem to be are ways to make the deletion of non-notable webcomics easier. The rest is personal, logical judgement. This is mine. -<a href="../../../n/a/m/User%7ENameneko_fd06.html" title="User:Nameneko">Nameneko</a> 05:42, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> You said: <i>The deadspot forums can be found <a href="http://cosmic-hero.com/forum/" class="external text" title="http://cosmic-hero.com/forum/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Note that the forum is shared between 3 webcomics, and has less than 100 members.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The forums have had to be reset several times (IIRC around 3 or 4 times, due to things outside the author's control), its only split between two webcomics,the second webcomic is pretty damn new, and the merger of the forums only occured when Manga Gaga moved servers at the suggestion by the new webcomic author. So citing that as a reason is pretty moot considering the circemstances. Manga Gaga does not have mulitple authors (unless I have mis-read one of the arguements here), and the only time other artists have taken over is during Guest Comics, which nearly every webcomic has periods of. So that arguement is moot. As for the faulty nature of the hit counter - there aren't many hit counters around that provide Unquie vistor stats period. At least none that I know of. And if the comic wasn't popular - why do I seem to see it mentioned in lists about "My Favourite Webcomic" on the many forums I visit? Every time I see the topic, theres around 3 - 4 people mention it. That seems popular to me.</p>

<li>Your very arguements DO seem flawed, is no-one seeing that? Mind explaining how a faulty counter is grounds for deletion? (and please, point us in the direction of a counter that counts truely Unquie hits.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Or how a recent merger and reset of a forum which is ISN'T dead due to the moving of hosts, and has plenty of well posting members, is grounds for deletion? Check your facts first, its a forum for two comics, and as stated above, the one has barely begun its run. If its the POV stuff in an article (I can see some words that aren't very, ahem, neutral), then remove the POV stuff. It's notable enough for me to see it mentioned on many forums. Personally I find your other arguements for deletion moot. Care to convince me otherwise? And ESkog - we're trying to have a serious discussion here, take your stupid comments elsewhere.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorry, but I really haven't seen that logical of an argument for deletion of the Manga-Gaga article yet. The only legitimate complaint against Manga-Gaga's presence on Wikipedia is the question on it covering too small or specific of a subject, which I don't see as fair or legitimate as the site's servers have changed multiple times over the course of the comic's creation. Simply put, there is no legitimate count of the comic's fanbase or interest level. Sure, there can be no denying the fact that Manga-Gaga has a relatively small fanbase when compared to the titan webcomics (8-Bit Theater and Penny-Arcade, just to name two), but where on Wikipedia is there a stated size limit for websites to be listed as articles? All I've seen covering this matter has been on discussion topics, and this particular comic has fit the requirements listed there. In absence of such a requirement, I believe that a quality argument would be the only legitimate argument against such an article. In regards to Manga-Gaga though, it has already been admitted that the article has had a lot of work done. If people don't believe that it has a neutral POV or should not include the number of visitors to the site, then the logical conclusion would be to merely alter the article, not delete it. What should also be remembered is that the article has existed for almost three full months and has been updated by eleven different people (not including Hahnchen's suggestion for deletion). As many other worthy topics, my own <a href="../../../d/e/p/DePauw_University_fed0.html" title="DePauw University">DePauw University</a> being one such example, have received about the same or less attention over a similar time period, I don't believe that one could legitimately claim that this article hasn't been receiving an adequate amount of traffic as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>.... oh, and I believe that ESkog's and Marcus22's statements for the deletion should be ignored due to a lack of reasoning (which is required on a discussion for the deletion of an article), as should Dottore So's (as it seems heavily biased in favor of Hahnchen, suggesting that they're either close friends or even the same person!). Last time I checked, an "unimpeachable argument" wasn't based on mere arbitrary personal views on what belongs on a site that are contradicted by a discussion that he himself posted. And sorry.... I just realized that I forgot to put the time and date at the end of my previous statements.

<li>Perhaps you should start your own tyranny somewhere? Where I come from a person has the right to vote or express an opinion without having to explain him/herself. However, this once, and just for you, I shall make an exception and expand on my previous 'nn'. NN means not (or non) notable. Thus, in my view, the object of the article is not notable and hence not encylcopedic. What more can I say? It is my view. My opinion. OK now?

<li><b>Keep</b> - The fact the visiters of the web site were unwilling and/or unable to install the Alexa toolbar (or just never heard of it), is not a reason to deem the web site non-notable. Alexa is not Neilson. It's a partial count, not a representive sample. Alexa is occasionally useful at confirming/rebutting claims of huge popularity of web sites (like those claiming milliions of visitors). It's useless in a case like this. The comic seems to have a regular following and the content of the article is worthwhile. Also, this will be a good place to re-direct future fictional character articles, without bothering with the AFD. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 22:10, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - While it's true that Manga-Gaga hardly has a huge fan base like many other web comics, have a look at the list of pages set up there for web comics: <a href="../../../w/e/b/Category%7EWebcomics_03f4.html" title="Category:Webcomics">Category:Webcomics</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now no one can surely tell me that all of those have been ground-breaking internet cultrial markers like..say Penny Arcade, Chugsworth, Dinosaur Comics etc have been. I also doubt at least a few of these have been running as long as Manga-Gaga. Also, that's not the first hit counter the sites had, I've changed it over the years at least 3 times, and I really don't see why it's so important or such a problem.</p>
<p>I mean, look at this comic's entry for example: <a href="../../../i/n/d/IndieTits_8f53.html" title="IndieTits">IndieTits</a></p>
<p>"IndieTits is a webcomic by Jeph Jacques. It was first published on April 1, 2005."</p>
<p>I don't quite see why it should be taken down, myself. I doubt it's really taking too much bandwidth up, or something.</p>
<p>Oh, and there's also the fact that issue 100 got sprend about the internet quite a bit. I saw it pop up at such places as 4chan, loads of flash portal/blog sites where they linked to the newgrounds file etc. So people may be wanting to know what it's about. 217.42.9.137 08:07, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Reply</b> - Someone may of already mencioned this, but in the "Remarks on notability" section of "Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents", it clearly states that "Webcomics are notable if they have had frequent (weekly or better) updates for over a year" which it has been doing for at least that long, if not longer. On that matter, your statement on webcomic "superfluous fluff" here does not count for much. 81.152.235.72 17:01, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Hahnchen is trying to reverse the precedent of keeping any webcomic that has been updating for X amount of time, regardless of a claim of actual notability. This is not an influential comic in the webcomic community, and this isn't notable in a newsworthy sense or a historical sense. It's just a generic webcomic of little importance, and, while I'm glad the author is proud of it and the fans are happy with it, Comixpedia is the place to write these sorts of articles about minor webcomics, not Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 05:54, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Alexa uses a biased sampling method and extrapolates. If a <i>lot</i> of people both use the Alexa toolbar <i>and</i> visit a site, it's a good indicator it's a notable site. This would be Alexa ranks of under 5K with confidence, under 10K with some trepidation. If <i>almost no one</i> has the tool bar and visits the site, it's a good indicator that the site is not notable. This would be Alexa ranking of anything from 500K to 2M. Anything between that really means very little.

<li><b>Keep</b> I really think that this has potential.

Second, a google search for "factbites.com" gave me 'about 1,770,000' results, with a lot of new stuff from news and tech sites, meaning that the search engine is picking up speed. I'm not sure when the site went online exactly, but it may also be too new to feature on the Alexa rankings.<br />

<li><b>note</b> as the creator of this site I will not vote, I just want to say that this is the key event used to justify the invasion and the "meeting" is still controversial - there are still appearing new information (or new points of view <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/comments.php?comments_id=3203" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.americanthinker.com/comments.php?comments_id=3203" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>) ....so it could have it´s own site - to enter more points of view -the main page Hussein-Al-Qaeda is yet too long to enter details about it. The term "prague connection" is not used very often, but it is the only used name of this meeting <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22prague+connection&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22prague+connection&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></li>

<dd>Thanks for the links - I had not seen the one about the Spanish trial. But I read it and I am not sure what it has to do with the Prague meeting information, other than that the author uses the Prague information as some kind of analogy. Anyway, the google search delivers 720 hits - to me that is not enough to say this is a notable phrase, especially since many of the hits land on copies of this page. A search of the Nexis database of "Major papers" for "all available dates" gives me 26 hits on this phrase, only fourteen of which actually deal with Atta. I think you're right that the alleged meeting belongs on wikipedia, but it is already here on the timeline on <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_and_al-Qaeda_e217.html" title="Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda">Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda</a>. I don't think the phrase "Prague connection" is that notable. By the way, I think you can vote, even though you created the page. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 04:16, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I agree with you. Just the main page is very very long (that´s not good). I remember that time ago the term "prague connection" was used very often in NewsTV (so I used it), bud it´s right that Google should give more results for it...</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b>. Presently WP has no article Masculine name or Feminine name. The articles <a href="../../../g/i/v/Given_name.html" title="Given name">Given name</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_name.html" title="Personal name">Personal name</a> do not discuss the "gender" of first names.

<li><b>Delete</b> per NR and Z. Request addition of new content as suggested by Acjelen, <i>not</i> a merge of this unencyclopedic list. In some language groups this (naming conventions by gender, not -a in particular) is a minor topic that people such as the list's author assume to be standards.

<li><b>Delete</b> Did a google scholar search for his work, found two articles on the first page (which I think is an indication in itself), the first one being cited 17 times and the other 9. Lets hope google scholar did its job and found the most significant articles he's published, if this is true, then his research is nothing but standard, and not desrving enough (IMHO) of an entry in an encyclpaedia. Going as far as New Zealand is no big deal, know quite a few researchers here in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> who frequent Canada and the UK for their universities (conferences and such). However, if someone can prove me wrong (or if i've just mucked up with the google scholar search somehow) and he is notable (i.e. the article is expanded to reflect this) then I'll change my vote to keep, but for now it's <b>delete</b><br />

<dd>Don't forget the textbook chapters he co-authored (somehow Google Scholar found them too), and those have been cited 40+ times each (never thought I'd see a textbook cited in a published paper, but there you go). By your standards, how many publications and/or citations would be required to establish notability? Also, by other measures (eg.

<li><b>Delete</b> Hey Pyenos. It is obvious that you have put a LOT of work into that article, however Wikipedia has a policiy on not listing original research (as it is an encyclopaedia, so it has to go with commonly accepted facts). However, if you are able to show real-world/practical applications of Fp code and its advantages/disadvantages to other programming languages, I would be happy to change my vote. It is, however, important that articles in Wikipedia are on notable things so that it does become a research source. I hope you don't get discouraged by all of this, as I'm sure you would be able to contribute to a lot of other articles out there.cheers, <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.alf_97b5.html" title="User:Dr.alf">alf</a> 11:04, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I purposely didn't use jargons and to me, although it is not important, it is consistent and complete. I could elaborate further, especially its application in computation but I thought this is for general audience. MCB, it is incomprehensible to you, probably because I didn't explain it using conventional logic, which was my intention. Why is it a nonsense if it works? It can work with a very simple program and it will automatically reduce to an outcome. Sorry if I made a mistake in writing this article. It seems you guys prefer me being a machine than being a human. I have a tendancy to think like a machine but I thought that was not appropriate. Do what you like with articles, but I could fill twenty or more full articles with the foundation of what I have wrote in Fp code, which I chose not to. My understanding was that this is for general audience and I had an interesting idea so I wanted to share it. I could do much more without being technical, such as to write a decoder program like in Geek Code. That may well happen if I do decide to develop this concept further. Please do understand that it was not my intention to post a garbage article. Bye. <a href="../../../p/y/e/User%7EPyenos_a65b.html" title="User:Pyenos">Pyenos</a> 23:53, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There seem to be plenty of articles on Oxbridge political societies that have produced alumni that have gone on to be famous - such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OUCA" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OUCA" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OUCA</a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OULC" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OULC" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OULC</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Union" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Union" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Union</a> - and I used these articles as the template. What are the grounds for deletion? There are quite a few MPs and Peers among the alumni, and it's a long-established society with over 100 members and 2,000 registered supporters on the 'interested' list - both exceptionally large figures for Cambridge, and making it one of the largest and best-known societies in the University. If you want to edit it to conform to a higher standard, by all means do so, and feel free to make suggestions for improvement and expansion, but I can't see this as something needing deletion.</p>

I'm thinking a reasonable compromise — inspired, incidentally, by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Caruso_recordings_%28various_articles%29_25d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Caruso recordings (various articles)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Caruso recordings (various articles)</a> — would be to create a single page, for such artists, to include all their compilations (or at least all the ones that don't contain original material) at, say, ARTIST NAME compilation albums. Any thoughts? In Chesney's case, this <i>Greatest Hits</i> album seems to be his <i>only</i> compilation <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;searchlink=KENNY+CHESNEY&amp;uid=MIW060510012103&amp;sql=11:ci5ibks96akx~T21" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;searchlink=KENNY+CHESNEY&amp;uid=MIW060510012103&amp;sql=11:ci5ibks96akx~T21" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. And, moreover, it looks to contain 4 previously unreleased tracks <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:4srx28gi055a" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:4srx28gi055a" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. So I'd argue that this particular album deserves its own page. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowerparty_4b7e.html" title="User:Flowerparty">Flower</a><a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFlowerparty_6764.html" title="User talk:Flowerparty">party<font color="#CCFFEE">■</font></a> 03:06, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>In principle the Caruso model seems OK, but there's a big difference: <i>all</i> Caruso albums are compilations, and they overlap with each other to a large extent. I'm not really keen on the single article (it contains massive redundancy), but it's better than twenty or thirty individual articles, each one offering nothing but a track listing. One of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html#Key_policies" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">key policies</a> is: "<b>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia</b>. Its goals go no further." As a corollary: "<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information</a>." Hundreds of articles on greatest-hits compilations seem to me to go against both of those. When we consider what should be included, we shouldn't be asking "why not?" but "why?"; "why not?" leads to indiscriminate collections of information, while "why?" leads to an encyclopædia. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 12:07, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this page should remain, it seems that any video incorporating hyperlinks and embedded interactivity can be called hypervideo, and there are many sources on the web using this terminology. Of course I think the article should be expanded, but definitely not deleted. What other terms can be used to describe this development?</p>

<dd>To be an advocate of the devil, does this mean that all linkable content be preceeded with hyper? A clickable image becomes a hyperimage, a clickable filename becomes a hyperdownload, and so on? With respect, perhaps the most telling reason for why this article should be deleted comes from your own post which asks "What other terms can be used to describe this?", a question that seems to cement the suspicion that this is original research. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 14:50, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Originally, a "link" was a "hyperlink", and the "hyper" prefix was abandoned as the short form gained momentum and went mainstream. So I imagine "hypervideo" might end up being "video" if the technology becomes adopted en masse. With respect to the original reserarch and neologism argument, there are dozens of seperate entries that came up in a dogpile search, some academic and some commercial, dating back to 1998. While the definition is not yet standardized, it appears to be a term that is in use, and Wikipedia should offer information to those who seek to learn more about it. "Hotspotting" is also a term used in several articles in the media, though this term is too ambiguous and generic to describe the specific characteristics of this technology. --Maestro44 16:20, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> what we really need in order to keep it is some evidence that it is a term commonly in use. You refer to Dogpiled articles that demonstrate the use of the term - link to them in the article and verify that the term is not 'original research' or a 'neologism', and you'll have a very good case for the article being kept. I should warn you that when it comes to new terminology Wikipedia usually keeps terms that are <i>very</i> common, and the case you make should reflect this. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font><font color="black">iggurat</font></a> 22:16, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I've inserted links to commercial publications, academic papers, several producers of hypervideo software and solutions... I could do this all day, what is the threshold needed to justify the term has been around for many years? Just because you may not have heard of it doesn't mean it's new. It might just mean that you're ignorant. That's why I'm spending the time writing this article, to inform people about something that is becoming very important. Take this deletion notice down.--Maestro44 17:11, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The deletion notice is there so that people can discuss whether to keep the article or not, and this page is here to debate that. Thank you for adding links, and hopefully this is sufficient to sway people to vote for a keep, but the notice is generally not removed until people have finished discussing it! <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font><font color="black">iggurat</font></a> 23:16, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> there is evidence that this is a term in use (e.g. <a href="http://www.byte.com/art/9701/sec18/art6.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.byte.com/art/9701/sec18/art6.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, <a href="http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/proceedings/&amp;toc=comp/proceedings/icalt/2004/2181/00/2181toc.xml&amp;DOI=10.1109/ICALT.2004.1357433" class="external autonumber" title="http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/proceedings/&amp;toc=comp/proceedings/icalt/2004/2181/00/2181toc.xml&amp;DOI=10.1109/ICALT.2004.1357433" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> ), but also that it is sometimes used as a copyrighted term (e.g. <a href="http://www.itvt.com/glossary.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.itvt.com/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>). The article should reflect that it is also used by some companies, but there is sufficient evidence that this is a piece of genuine terminology. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font><font color="black">iggurat</font></a> 23:35, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Good point, I clarified that there is a difference between "hypervideo" and "HyperVideo" or "Hyper Video". I also put in some links to the academic papers. --Maestro44 13:42, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The author advised me of his rewrite and I feel the content now is quite good. My concern above, however, remains: this is an attempt to <b>encyclopedify a commercial neologism</b>, thereby granting it an apparently independent and objective substantiation. As an encyclopedic project, WP needs to be vigilant about reflecting, not helping to define, such concepts and while I note Ziggurat's point that there is evidence that this concept has been used, I think that this is a reflexion of commercial placement. I therefore maintain my vote above to <b>delete</b>, although I think the author should add whatever material s/he feels is relevant to the <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypermedia.html" title="Hypermedia">Hypermedia</a> article, which is currently a stub. When the moderator comes to close this, I might suggest it be relisted for further discussion, seeing as this has attracted less attention (3 votes + author) than it deserves and raises some interesting points. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 07:34, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have no problem adding some of this to the Hypermedia stub, even though I think it deserves an entry in its own right. Regarding the "neo" I think 1996 is quite a long time ago. Also, regarding commercial intent, why does Wikipedia have pages such as <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_vista.html" title="Windows vista">Windows vista</a>? I see a double standard, since articles such as the one just mentioned are clearly new products, but this term is used by many in academia as well as various commercial entities (not just one as in the MS example). --Maestro44 23:36, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was very close, so some weighing of arguments here is needed. As far as vote count is concerned, I see seven votes to delete, and three or four votes to keep, depending on whether the anon should be counted or not (I am usually willing to count anon votes if I don't suspect sockpuppetry, and in this case I don't suspect it). In addition we have a comment leaning towards keep but declaring that it is not voting.</p>
<p>The argument for deletion has been that the text is original research, in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. A rebuttal to this has been made by pointing to a JROTC link. However, it has also been pointed out, by <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a>, that this is only one of several such typologies which exist and that there is nothing special about the typology presented in this article which distinguishes it from the others.</p>
<p>In sum I cannot see a consensus that an article on the <i>subject</i> leadership styles is invalid and should <i>never</i> have an article, but even some of the "keep" voters here have expressed concern with <i>this particular</i> article. Because of that I will close this debate with a <b>delete</b> decision. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 13:13, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

To the question "What are the four Winning Colors and what strengths in terms of behavior, communications and attributes are associated with each?" it answers: "Green is Fox/Planner and is a creative thinker.

<li><b>Merge</b>, I think that this is definately a notable topic for wikipedia. For example, look at the number of mainstream media articles about one seduction community guru in the media: <a href="http://www.mysterymethod.com/InTheMedia.aspx" class="external free" title="http://www.mysterymethod.com/InTheMedia.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.mysterymethod.com/InTheMedia.aspx</a> . This area truely has an extreme danger for promotion however. Essentially, even though for example this mystery person has had a lot of articles about them, the majority of the techniques and lingo of these style organized pickup artists evolved from a ton of community interaction primarily on websites, making the particular notability of any one of them more suspicious. Therefore I propose we merge this and all current and future articles on particular individuals of this community into one article. The only articles I know of in wikipedia on individual members are on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Deangelo_370e.html" title="David Deangelo">David Deangelo</a>, mystery, and Ross Jefferies. Any new articles which crop of for other "gurus" should be merged into the one article. The question is what this one article would be called. As the first person noted, there is not a widely used name for this phenomenon as yet, either by outsiders or by those in the particular groups. I propose that we stick with this article name for now and rename it to whatever seems more apropriate as time goes by. As a final argument, wikipedia voted to keep the seven styles of lightsabre fighting article, which essentially voids all delitions for notability as being hypocritical&#160;:). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.127.176.41 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__68.127.176.41_ada2.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 68.127.176.41">contribs</a>).</small><small>same IP block as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seduction_Community&amp;diff=24131000&amp;oldid=23704349" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seduction_Community&amp;diff=24131000&amp;oldid=23704349" rel="nofollow">main contributor</a> to this article.

<li><b>Keep</b>This is an underground trend that should be discussed in a balanced way. The few Internet sites mentioned are the most independent ones available and probably most representative of the community being described. Let's discuss how to make the article more informative, as the subject matter is of interest. I agree with the previous comment that the subject matter has a danger for promotion. Individual members such as Deangelo, Mystery, Badboy and Jeffries are commercial interests, and may not merit having their own page. These people are four among the most well known of the commercial seduction coaches. The term "seduction community" is probably the best and most common description used. This is how the community currently describes itself. See the term's use in a recent popular book on the subject (this week THE GAME is number 15 on the NYTimes Bestseller list). This book is being widely reviewed. An alternative title for the page such as "Seduction Strategies for Men" only sounds more promotional. <small>&lt;-- Unsigned comment by <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 06:26, 2 October 2005 (UTC), c. 03:30 UTC - this user has edited this article and <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction.html" title="Seduction">Seduction</a> and inserted as well as deleted affiliated links.</small></li>

<p>Hadal, upon what do you base this "viral marketing" charge? If you prefer to remove these links in favor of other, more neutral ones, please suggest them. The subject itself is worthy of an article, although it is true that there are link spammers active in this area.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm going to quote User: Fubar here: "Wikipedia needs to be able to reflect all verifiable human knowledge." I fail to see how a page describing a big Irish department store or a popular video game called "Ghosts and Goblins" has more interest and value than an article about the seduction community. Suggest criticism be given to help REVISE and avoid deleting information. Everything written on this page is not intended to be promotional, but purely descriptive. Please verify information provided.

<p>Personally, I don't see the harm in keeping the article. With the inevitable release of this film from the box office, many people will wonder what the word actually means.

<li>No, it's not intensive insulinotherapy - that's just a more frequently dosed version of standard insulin therapy for diabetes. This article is apparently referring to a single experimental cancer treatment that a single company was using in Mexico, until the FTC shut them down<a href="http://www.healthwatcher.net/Quackerywatch/Cancer/Tijuana-quacks/sdut010214crabtree.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.healthwatcher.net/Quackerywatch/Cancer/Tijuana-quacks/sdut010214crabtree.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, in which they induced insulin coma for unclear reasons. I don't think this is any more notable than any of the thousands of other quack cures out there, and it <i>certainly</i> shouldn't be described with the broad title "insulin therapy". If we keep the title, it should just be a redirect to <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insulin.html" title="Insulin">insulin</a> - or we could use it to split out the "insulin as a medication" section of that article. But the current content is totally misleading. (It's as if we had a <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiation_therapy.html" title="Radiation therapy">radiation therapy</a> article that only discussed "controversial" uses of radiation such as clipping toenails, tuning pianos, and bestowing superpowers.) <a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob"></a>←<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_a862.html" title="User:Hob">Hob</a> 21:34, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete:</b> This has been an interesting article to deal with. When I first saw the article, it was an obvious sales pitch copied from the Synergy website. I copyvio'ed it but a week later the anonymous user who wrote the article insisted that she was a representative of the company and asked to have the copyvio removed on the condition that the article will be written in NPOV. So I gave them a week or two and when nothing got done, I put up an advertisement warning to remind them that this article still needs work. Obviously, they still haven't done anything so I say it's time to ax it. Besides, who wants to read an article about a company written by the company's marketing rep anyway? <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolarusdude_2019.html" title="User:Solarusdude">Solarusdude</a> 19:15, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep:</b> I'm the "anonymous user" referenced before. I apologize for not following protocol -I am just learning how to use this site. I have since created a log in. Solarusdude, I actually did completely revise the article after the comments that it was too marketing-oriented. In fact, I had an independent user of the language write an unbiased description of it. (Perhaps this is the "Large number of edits of dubious value from author's IP" described by Interiot.) This is not intended as an advertisement. I am simply trying to create an accurate description of the product for people who look it up, and because it is linked to from another article. If it still appears too "markety," I would be happy to revise it. sde 15:55, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep:</b>It seems a simple description of the product - a tool for the development community that has been in place for 20 years. It's an appropriate entry and pales by comparison to the numerous entries one finds under Microsoft <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_Studio_5230.html" title="Visual Studio">Visual Studio</a> and other related tools.--JDukr 16:11, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
