<li><b>Definite keep</b> This man has been sadly neglected by history, and one of his few epitaphs is this small page. What a travesty. <i>He bought Lennon his first harmonica</i>, and encouraged him musically, unlike Mimi, who nearly destroyed the fledgling Beatles with her negativity. Don´t forget that Lennon played harmonica on <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_me_do.html" title="Love me do">Love me do</a>. His presence is as important in musical history as McCartney´s mother, father, Lennon´s Mimi, Julia and Fred. Are the tourists that visit Menlove Avenue not told about him?

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I read the article three times to make sure I hadn't missed anything but I still couldn't find any notability whatsoever. This is one of the least notable relatives I've ever come across on AfD. Less notable than Beckham or Pitt/Jolie kids, less notable than relatives of early Islamic figures. Those relatives get deleted routinely and I can't see anything here at all notable. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 08:40, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, I suppose this really depends on how well-known you are with a given person or subject. Personally, I find someone who apparently was a big influence on one of the worlds best known artist <i>much</i> more notable than the kids of random famous people, of which it is still unknown whether they will ever do anything significant or influence anyone else who does something significant. If it is not kept, a merge and redirect to <a href="../../../m/i/m/Mimi_Smith_4c4b.html" title="Mimi Smith">Mimi Smith</a> would be the best solution I suppose (per Grutness). <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, this is why I ensured that I included the mention of the Islamic relatives. There are some editors who believe that parents of Islamic figures are more notable than someone who apparently had an influence on a musician - this is not recentism on my behalf. At present, the article does not contain a single assertion of notability. Even if there was some influence on Lennon, that does not mean that the person themselves is notable. The article states that he was the uncle of Lennon, and that Lennon lived with George Smith for most of his childhood. It then asserts that Smith lived a non-notable life before dying when Lennon was 15. None of that is even a claim of notability hence my statement that this is the least notable relative I have ever seen at AfD. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 09:27, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm sure they pop up in about a hundred Beatles biographies, but you should still list them. The article also needs de-cheesifying. (<i>George delivered milk by pony and trap in the Woolton area. The milk was held in a large churn which was ladled out to customers into their own bottles and receptacles</i> is not of particular encyclopedic interest.)
