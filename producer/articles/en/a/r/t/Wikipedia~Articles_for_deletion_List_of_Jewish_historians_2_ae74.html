<li>Or any of the other historians, for whom we lack pages? How does someone quickly find a historian for a given period with a category, since it lacks a description?

<li>The same way an anon writes anything else on articles that don't exist: he uses articles for creation, or he registers an account. Perhaps you could post a notice on your userpage offering your assistance in this process, or lobby Jimbo to change his mind about anon article creation. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 10:47, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There don't seem to be many people complaining about adding non-articled people to Wikipedia because of all the dreadful (sarcasm) categories --- since, you know, they could just go to any of the infinite amount of country lists and put them there under the historians or social scientists sections. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 11:01, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>So your reason for keeping this list is because you think eventually all Jewish lists will be deleted from Wikipedia? Hmm - Odd logic.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't see what's wrong with having both a list and a category. (Personally I'm amazed we don't have a list for ancient Greek and Roman historians/playwrights/etc.) The list of Irish historians organizes them into time periods, which is information you couldn't get with a category. It's also easier to add info to a list (don't have to create an article). I would love it if every contributor spent the time to create an article, but the reality is that most people won't. If a name is added to a list then at least a seed is planted. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFang_Aili_a8ed.html" title="User:Fang Aili">Fang Aili</a> 17:18, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's a relevant field of history and or segment of historians that can use expansion. That there isn't say a List of ecclesiastical historians or List of African-American historians is just because Wiki still lags a bit with history and the humanities.

<li><b>Comment</b>: the list got created alongside with new category <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_historians_02a3.html" title="Category:Jewish historians">Category:Jewish historians</a>, being mostly copy.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I've got nothing against having both categories and lists, since lists allow for more structure, though this list does not make use of this. However, this list doesn't say how one gets to be a Jewish historian: is one a histoiran who is jewish (apparently), or a scholar of jewish history. The latter list makes more sense to me.

<dd>well I agree that for many occupations nationality or ethnicity is a bit irrelevant, such as opera singer, classical musician, travel writer among others. But as Jews did not have their own state until the creation of Israel and were often denied citizenship or worse in countries in which they lived and most certainly had an identifiable culture of their own it is as justified to allow the Jewish people to have their own categories or lists as it is any other state. Arniep 01:41, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I never disagreed with that. I believe completely that Jews should have their own lists and categories, but I think that some users a while back seriously OVERDID the listing - and I know others have noticed that too. As a matter of fact, I think the <i>categories</i> for Jews are underrepresented when they shouldn't be. <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> should be treated as an ancestry and should have it's own category under people by ancestry. But the listing is truly overkill. Many other ethnic groups function fine with their own country lists, and Jews have the most country lists of anyone. If a Jewish historian with no article was to be added to Wikipedia, then it takes just as much effort to find out if the historian is Jewish than to find out if the historian is Jewish-German (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_German_Jews_3595.html" title="List of German Jews">List of German Jews</a>) or Jewish-Hungarian (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hungarian_Jews_6259.html" title="List of Hungarian Jews">list of Hungarian Jews</a>). I can see the rationale behind a list of Jewish historians who profess their Judaism in their writings in some form. That makes sense. The list as it is DOES NOT. If you truly agree with me on the fact that Judaism and being a historian have a connection than you will see that the way they are listed here will not work. If the majoriy of Wikipedian ethnic groups HAD lists of historians, then this list is completely fine, but they don't. Unless it is changed to reflect those who profess their religion in their works, it is truly overkill. I can't see how you can disagree with me. If you do, then please please help me understand because I seriously don't. My efforts here are not to "delete" all Jewish lists as <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">User:JJay</a> and you believe, it is to delete ALL lists that are overkill. Jewish lists, anyone will agree, have been the most overmade. I think LGBT lists are a problem too, but there are less of those.

<dd>I don't think that's the intent. Many of those working on these lists are Jewish.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I tend to agree with <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">user:antidote</a> that lists should only be created when a person's ethnicity/religion is relevant to their occupation. If <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_historians_499c.html" title="List of Jewish historians">list of Jewish historians</a> only contained historians whose Judaism was relevant to their work, I wouldn't have a problem with that. Also, the articles that the list links to should justify their inclusion on the list. To take an example from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_historians_499c.html" title="List of Jewish historians">list of Jewish historians</a>, the article for <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugen_Weber_fc04.html" title="Eugen Weber">Eugen Weber</a> only hints that he is Jewish in the works section, and does not make any other connections between his Judaism and his work, so he should not be in the list. I'd probably support the inclusion of this list if it only contained historians whose Judaism is relevant to their work. Or maybe it could be moved to list of historians of Judaism and modified accordingly. <a href="../../../p/i/a/User%7EPianoman87_cd5d.html" title="User:Pianoman87">Graham/pianoman87</a> <a href="../../../p/i/a/User_talk%7EPianoman87_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Pianoman87">talk</a> 10:49, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks. If you don't know much about them you should try to learn more. Most if not all the Jewish historians on the list will have addressed the Jewish condition in their work. In all cases, their relationship to Judaism is relevant. The list, if properly expanded and annotated, can provide context in a way that a category never can.

<dd>It isn't at all clear that the connection to Judaism is relevant from the description of the list.

<dd>It’s relatively facile to cherrypick names from a list until you manage to prove a point. Given the theological impact of Kuhn’s paradigm, I think his relationship to Judaism is relevant. I would also note that a google for Thomas Kuhn + Judaism gives <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Thomas+Kuhn%22+judaism&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=pRn&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Thomas+Kuhn%22+judaism&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=pRn&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">28,000 hits</a>. Despite the hysterical reaction of <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> (should we delete African-American lists because the Klan exists?), I'm still waiting for an explanation for the google results I listed above.

<dd>No cherry-picking involved. I picked three names I know well from the list: one is a historian of Israel, one did little historical work explicitly on the Jewish people, but is clearly relevant, and one looked to me entirely irrelevant. What theological relevance is there to Kuhn's work? He's a relevant name to invoke on the question of whether science and religion could be counted as having incommensurable domains of expertise, but to say that this says something about <i>Jewish</i> theology is rather strained. Is there more that can be said?--- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 19:55, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Have you already forgotten Marx? We could also debate whether Kuhn is a historian or philosopher. These are secondary issues. Why don't you edit the list? Furthermore, when Jewish nobel prize winners are listed, as is routinely the case, what does that say about Jewish theology?-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 20:06, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
