This third nomination derives from a content dispute on <a href="../../../a/r/y/Talk%7EAryan_Nations_0162.html" title="Talk:Aryan Nations">Talk:Aryan Nations</a> in whch some editors feel they are "real" members of the Aryan Nation but Williams is not. The leader of the revert war seems to be 24.171.16.151 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.171.16.151.html" title="User talk:24.171.16.151">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.171.16.151_212d.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.171.16.151">contribs</a>) (see below). Regarding <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, Williams is quoted in the Chattanooga Times Free Press in articles dated October 2004 and October 2005 as "Jonathan Williams, Aryan Nations communications director in Atlanta" and "senior pastor of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian/Aryan Nations." It seems like there has been a split within the organization and this AfD is the result of one faction trying to suppress the other. Based on the newspaper quotes I believe he is notable as well, although I can see why it was a no consensus previously; its a borderline case. <b>Keep.</b> <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 17:22, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The appears to be a content dispute between a group that considers itself to be the "true" Aryan Nations and a splinter or dissident group that also self-identifies as Aryan Nations; Williams is part of the latter group, see <a href="../../../a/r/y/Talk%7EAryan_Nations_0162.html" title="Talk:Aryan Nations">Talk:Aryan_Nations</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 11:53, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually there's an awful lot in the article that is at least unverified. "His views differ little from those expressed since the 18th and 19th century," or "His Pentecostal beliefs weakened as he became more involved with Conspiracy theorists" or "Williams holds degrees in theology, as well as political history, which makes him seem easier to stomach than some of the same element." For a more notable person his views on religion, politics, and so on might be recorded in multiple media interviews or published biographies. In this case I'm not sure what we can rely on; someone listening to his radio show I guess, or hearing him in church. Which I why I think this is a borderline case; he seems to be quoted in the local papers and is verifiably a Christian Identity minister, but can we verifiy his other statements and beliefs? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:53, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not only a Fraud but not popular enough. The only reason Williams would have ever been even in a local newspaper "if that's even true" is because of his fraudulent claims, Williams only fame is being a Fraud. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.37.104.200 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.37.104.200_3fb0.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.37.104.200">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> That is all hear say, Thatcher you act like you have some personal ties to this Williams Fraud, please refrain from posting POV's, need not comment everytime someone votes to delete this kid, people do not need your persuasion here. Williams openly admits is not &amp; never has been a Member of the Aryan Nations. And is not &amp; was not @ anytime a Aryan Nations pastor as to be a Aryan Nations Pastor you must be ordained by the Aryan Nations therefore he can not even claim to be what he's trying to be known famous for. Williams is just a highschool kid, he don't no Degrees in Theology LOL &amp; that's besides the fact he's never even met a Aryan Nations Pastor or Leader. Jonathan Williams is a 20 year old kid who lies &amp; has not only no credibility but no proof or fame @ all. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.171.16.151 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.171.16.151.html" title="User talk:24.171.16.151">talk</a> •</small></li>

<li><small><b>Keep</b> per neutrality! The above comments, other than maybe 2, were all posted by the same user. Williams is cited in just as many articles as Kreiss. The fact is, if you go to other racial websites and see who they acknowledge as successors, it looks as if they think Kreiss is a "joke". Nonetheless, I say keep both sites listed and both individuals listed out of fairness. Everyone involved watching this revert war take place is fully aware that it isn't going to end unless these pages are permanently protected. 24.171.16.151 is the only person vandalizing these articles. If you follow the history of this IP address, you see that this person is a "Daily" VANDAL.
