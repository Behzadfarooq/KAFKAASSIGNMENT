<li>Both of them? I realise there is policy on family members that applies, but mightn't this one usefully run on a bit? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 19:37, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This vfd was placed by anon user and I see it as simple vandalism of the article to cause a stir. I say we should not take this vote seriously as Benedict XVIs father has been in the medai extensively over the past two days. I took off the tag, but will differ to an Admin if they <i>really</i> think that is a deletable article. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 19:42, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>FOLLOWUP: I saw the anon user might have been a legit person. Thats fine and Im sorry for taking it out. If so, the tag should go back in. We just have SO many problems with anons going through adding VFD tags and Dispute notices that they are often taken as vandalism. My statements about this man stand on why he should ahve his article, with the situation with <b><a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html#Hitler.27s_family" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler's relatives</a></b> a perfect example. The Hitler pages lists relatives down to the <i>half nephew</i> and all of them have articles. If this article gets deleted then, by rights, all of those would have to go as well. I vote <b>KEEP</b>. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 20:30, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is not AT ALL vandalism, thank you. We frequently have votes for deletion of non-notable relatives. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 22:36, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I vote <b>Keep</b> for now, since a merge later is an easy option. But I think it can be argued either way, so I disagree with <s>above</s> the comment that this doesn't need a vote. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 20:28, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There's already so much information here that to merge it into either or both of his son's articles would detract from their quality. Better to link to the father and cover it once, in one place; there's also the likelihood that more information will be added here, making the proposed merges yet more cumbersome. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 20:48, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with Georg's article under a title Biography of Pope Benedict XVI; if it's eventually decided that Georg would have qualified for an article on his own, this would probably still be an appropriate place to shift material from the Pope's main article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 22:36, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> The article can stand on its own. Notable person, esp. now. I agree with <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> that a later merger is likely, but that would only be appropriate after this topic matures. -<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasito_3c90.html" title="User:Casito">Casito</a>⇝<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECasito_0bf9.html" title="User talk:Casito">Talk</a> 22:57, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>. No evidence has been presented that he is independently notable.

<li>Quit silliness. Georg Ratzinger is a famous musician, who directed a world-famous choir, the eldest in the world, for many years, has made numerous famous recordings, and is a prelate in the Catholic Church. --83 <i>unsigned comment by anon user:83.109.158.50</i>
<ul>
<li>That is, of course, a judgment call. However, he held that position for quite a long time and until his brother was a strong candidate for elevation no one considered Georg noteworthy enough to create an article. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> wasn't really written with classical music in mind but it's interesting to note that none of the inclusion criteria appear to apply.

<li><b>Keep.</b> This article is well written, and I personally think that because of some efforts of this gentleman, the Pope's thinking and actions will forever shape our world. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> 23:07, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> If what is on the page is true, I would want to find this information on its own page--even if the page was no longer than what it is. Apparently, the issues of the father are different from the issues of the son. And the examination of issues about pro- or anti-Nazi expression is clearer to me on two different pages in this case. ---<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERednblu_c10b.html" title="User talk:Rednblu">Talk</a> 02:10, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. He's notable and it's good that we have an article on him. However, I'm concerned that the article cites no sources whatsoever. It even says things like "various sources state" and "the majority of media sources later made it very clear".

<li><b>Keep</b>. Paryly because that <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> article will expand to a stage that more articles have to be created to condense information.

<li><b>Keep</b>, per reasons listed by Tan. He has two notable sons, so I'd relax the "family members" rule over that. However, if he were just an uncle or something, I would delete. Keep this one. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 15:13, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I'm not too familiar with the family member policy, but we must consider that he may become notable / more notable after his death, and then the fact that you have two sons in Wickipedia; My biggest concern is that if we merge now, we will find ourselves de-merging in the future -- It's simply too soon to make a definitive decision <i>unsigned comment by anon user:138.88.41.120</i></li>
