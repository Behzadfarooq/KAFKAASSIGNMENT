<p>No console of this generation is even in development yet, leaving the page nothing but speculation. Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. This page was deleted once before.

<li><b>Keep</b> That section of NOT begins "Wikipedia is not a collection of <i>unverifiable</i> speculation" and verifiability was also lacking in the previous AFD. It has sources now and other than a bit of original research at the bottom that I'm removing, the article is well-written and well-sourced.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 09:14, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, most of the article is unverified speculation. The dates given for the generation are unverified speculation, the sources on the camera technology has to do with speculation related to the 360 only and is therefore no source at all, making the camera information unverified speculation, and the timing of any attempt by Apple to enter the market and therefore what generation a console by the company would belong to is not known, making that unverified speculation. This bascally leaves the article with the only verified information that a PS4 will exist and that a next-gen Nintendo console will include high definition. That is not much of an article. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 09:34, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> i don't know if i'm allowed to vote since i'm the article’s creator, but not a single thing in that article is not located in one of the sources i've sited. With the exeption of Apple each of the companies in question have made some announcements or statements concerning their eighth gen console. i waited to post this article until that was the case. The Wii 2 will have HD capabilities, the 720 is on the backburner at the moment, and the PS4 is going to be released after 2010. o, and thanks for the complement Kchase. <a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 09:24, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> While i am a fan of video game consoles, i agree with the points stating that it is far to early to create an article on a generation of consoles that haven't even been released yet, and will not be until the distant future. Given the article is based on <i>History</i> of gaming consoles, it seems to me ridiculous to classify yet-to-be released consoles within a history-based article. When we reach that generation, of course, but now isn't that time. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 19:01, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - per <a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase T</a>. While this article is speculation, it is verifiable speculation with confirmation from the director and manager of Nintendo, the president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, and the vice president of technology at Sony. Consoles are planned years before they are released. <a href="../../../j/e/c/User%7EJecowa_587b.html" title="User:Jecowa">Jecowa</a> 19:42, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> - I initially thought this page was a bit pointless - I thought it was just ropey speculation about stuff that doesn't exist yet - but it's got sourced statements and there definitely is some useful content. The gaming companies are already planning ahead to the next-gen and as time goes on more and more solid facts will arise. Cut out or source the more ropey speculation about names and particularly speculation about Apple - there's barely any evidence at all for an Apple console. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESum0_5bbc.html" title="User:Sum0">Sum0</a> 20:00, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The problem is that the solid facts won't arise for a few years, and even if companies are currently planning on releasing sequels (which the no doubt are since none of them are going to leave the business without reason) that might change depending on how well each console sells. There was lots of speculation about the Dreamcast 2 afterall. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKoweja_a591.html" title="User:Koweja">Koweja</a> 20:14, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong neutral</b> There's no doubt that there will be another generation of consoles, so this article will eventually have content and importance. Unfortunately, although the text in the article is sourced and verifiable, it is so intensely speculative that it is of little value. What's the use of keeping such an article? But what's the use of deleting it, only to have to recreate it when more information arrives? <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 03:33, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> because it will be years before this page needs to be recreated and none of the information on it will be valid or will be so trivial that it won't be included anyway. Not even the names of the systems, except the PS4. The other two are just names made up by fans. I'd be willing to be money that the next Nintendo system will not be called the Wii 2. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKoweja_a591.html" title="User:Koweja">Koweja</a> 03:44, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Gaming companies plan their next system many years in advance. By having this article readers will know what information is available. We will not know everything for sure until these systems are released, but we can mention they companies have planned. I don't think the article was trying to say that the successor to the Wii will be named "Wii 2." This is just what the console is referred to at this time. <a href="../../../j/e/c/User%7EJecowa_587b.html" title="User:Jecowa">Jecowa</a> 04:16, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Except that this page is not needed to get that information. There is nothing wrong with the pages on Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft including what little information is known about next-gen systems. This page, however, will never consist of more than idle speculation for several years and therefore goes against the crystal ball policy. Besides, I think a member of the general public looking for this information has no idea what "generation" of systems we are currently in and is more likely to look on the company pages anyway. When the generation exists, or at the very least has taken a concrete form, then we can have this page. An enclyclopedia is about facts, not rumormongering. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 04:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>According to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>, future events should only be included if the event is notable, is almost certain to take place, is verifiable, and is not original research. The eighth generation of video game consoles is notable, and it is almost certain to come about, so we just have to make sure to include verifiable sources and exclude original research from this article.</dd>
<dd>I don't think an article being hard to find is grounds to remove it, but we can make redirects from "Xbox 720," "Xbox 3," "PS4," "PlayStation 4" Playstation 4," and "Wii 2" to this article until there is enough information available on the individual systems to warrant separate pages. Also, if we let this article remain Google will index it, allowing this article to show up in Google searches for the queries "Xbox 720," "Playstation 4," and "Wii 2." Many users of the internet use Wikipedia as a primary source for information as it is much easier to find information on Wikipedia than it is to search through a bunch of web pages for it. <a href="../../../j/e/c/User%7EJecowa_587b.html" title="User:Jecowa">Jecowa</a> 05:12, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

The article complies with WP policies and theres no doubt more details will trickle in over time - not years, more like scraps per month.

<dd>In which case, wouldn't an article of this sort be better suited in a <b>Future of video games consoles</b>? The current title and significant quantities of the information are, as stated in above arguements, speculated, and are of little or no use to someone reading it, given the information could completely change when we reach closer to this generation. When we have some concrete information about this generation, i would support such an article, but again along the lines of <b>Future of video game consoles</b>. I may have even supported a rename of the article if there was less speculation and more concrete information. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 09:26, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, accurate information about upcoming consoles is extremly hard if not impossible to get, for example in the current generation accurate information about the consoles didn't appear until months before the consoles themselves were released. It is entirely plausible that final specs for the first 8th generation console won't be released until 2011. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 09:33, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Move to <i>Future of video game consoles</i></b> or something similar. Article is fine, but it's not really history.

However, speculated information (such as some console names and dates) should be removed, even if that leaves only a stub of information which is at least verifyable and can be confirmed. As for those who say changing the name of the article would disrupt the sequence, I would much rather support an article with a name that reflects the information contained within it, as opposed to an article name which is misleading (History of), with content which is of the complete opposite. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 13:24, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Yeah, I see how the word "History" in the title would confuse people. Maybe we should move it to "Future of video game consoles" like Bungle44 suggested. It would make the History of videogame consoles infobox more clear to have generations of the past labeled "History" while the generation of the future is labeled "Future." Maybe along those lines we should also move "History of video game consoles (seventh generation)" to "Presence of video game consoles (seventh generation)"</dd>

<li><b>Seriously Strong Keep</b>, because the article concerns something of cultural and economic importance, that <i>is</i> indeed being planned by console makers and gamers alike, and barring the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse.html" title="Apocalypse">apocalypse</a> will come about.

<li>I still support a delete or possibly a weak rename/move on the above suggestions, but certainly not keeping it in it's current state. There have been too many valid points raised in opposition for it to stay, but with the same respect, a few valid points for support. I still support deletion of the article, but maybe a rename with unverifyable information removed might be a fair outcome. If the latter however, chances are it would remain a relatively small stub for quite some time yet, and may just be worth deleting the article, until such a time comes when there is sufficient official information that will suffice reasons for the article's existance. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 21:49, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Its not all speculation, its not even half speculation. with the exception of the names, the entry on the Wii 2 is pure fact along with the one on the PS4. the speculation that is included is backed up with 2 or more sources. the names aren't speculation as no one is saying they will be called by these names. all the article says is that these are names that are being used for the systems at present. If i were to include all the speculation you guys seem to think is in this thing it would be longer than the one on the Wii.<a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 22:10, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>"The eighth generation in the history of video game consoles will begin at the end of the seventh generation, <b>probably somewhere between 2010 and 2014."</b> If that's not a crystal ball situation then I don't know what is. The entire article is pure speculation, no one knows what can happen a year from now, much less 7 years from now. I remember when Nintendo said the Gamecube would be their last console, and now we have the Wii. I remember when Sega said Dreamcast would not be their last console, but that certainly changed when the PS2 launched. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 22:22, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>first, i have moved the article to "Future of..." and i checked all of the pages that link to it. if i broke some rule than i'm sorry and will be happy to put it back if i did. second, Dionysius, you just dislike me, it has nothing to do with the article, but i will humor you anyway. it has already been agreed by every user on here but you that this is not crystal balling. it is well sourced and verifiable. And when a company says that they will do something it is not speculation for you or me to then turn around and tell someone what the company said it would do. also, speculation can not be done on fact. that is to say, i would not be speculating if i said the sun is going to rise to marrow. It wouldn't be specializing because we all know the sun is going to rise tomorrow. The statement "the Eighth Generation will start at the completion of the Seventh" is a fact, not crystal balling. if you don't believe me than go read the article on it.<a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 22:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would now more so drop my possible weak movement of the article and fully stand by my deletion decision given that statement above. Far too many things can change in what we currently have many years until we can at least expect concrete information as to whether these consoles are going to be developed, and who by. Maybe in a year or so time, we can review what information there is, and if decided there is enough solid concrete information, then under a name other than referring to it as it's history. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 08:25, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. J.L.Main posted on my talk board asking me to reconsider my vote because "the PS4 has been confirmed, not just hinted at and i never claimed any of the others were confirmed". My two problems with this statement are that not only is there no citation on the PS4 claim, but things like this NEED CONFIRMATION.

<dd>It's not so much the fact that there are external sources citing parts of it's content, but that such cited information could very easily change, and indeed has done in the past, so it is near impossible for those sources to in fact accurately predict what will and what wont happen in the next gen of gaming consoles. As stated in previous comments, the article should remain non-existant until we are well into the current console generation, when there is more of a likely chance that external sources (and console creators for that matter), have a better idea of whether they are going to participate or not, and with which consoles. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 17:23, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep</b> Regarding the crystal ball, "Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. If preparation for the event isn't already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented. Examples of appropriate topics include 2008 U.S. presidential election, and 2012 Summer Olympics. By comparison, the 2028 U.S. presidential election and 2036 Summer Olympics are not considered appropriate article topics because nothing can be said about them that is verifiable and not original research. A schedule of future events may also be appropriate." It's notable, certain to happen, and there is certainly preparation going on.

<dd>Oh, excellent. That would be the perfect thing to add to the article! Thanks for finding it. If you want, I can add it myself. -<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanbomber_10a1.html" title="User:Ryanbomber">Ryanbomber</a> 16:59, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>- One problem, although I'm sure you already thought of it. This article says it's about the <i>history</i> of the 8th Generation of video game consoles, not what analysts predict is going to happen. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 18:45, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
