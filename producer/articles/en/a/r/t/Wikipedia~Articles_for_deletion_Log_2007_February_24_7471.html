<li><b>Keep</b> This list is incomplete, but it's not listcruft and it's not even close to indiscriminate. As for the charge that the list imparts no information -- it clearly does. And haunted hotels and talking toasters are in different parts of the list for that exact reason. Items that are possessed or sentient are not two incompatible concepts. The point with both is that they are "animated inanimate objects."--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 22:19, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's lovely, but it would be nice if somebody could show us where the government of Iran had documented this.

<li>The page lunchtime soccer should not be deleted. It is a good place for people to reference when they are in dispute of the rules which they play by. Particularly at my school the players are very passionate. They have even become violent because they are not clear on the rules. This page is a reference to stop these things happening. It is also a log of luchtime soccer/football communities around the world. There are many other wikipedians i know who have found this page a good reference. Therefore it should not be deleted because it doesn't breach any of the wikipedia rules and it only ever helps people. The verifiable source is other wikipedians. And the millions of people across the world who play the beautiful game, the world game. A reaonable person would know how popular soccer/football across the world is. More people play unofficial soccer than any other sport. - jensen 198 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensen_198_4321.html" title="User:Jensen 198">Jensen 198</a> (<a href="../../../j/e/n/User_talk%7EJensen_198_238c.html" title="User talk:Jensen 198">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jensen_198_afb9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jensen 198">contribs</a>) 2007-02-24 01:43:42 (UTC)</small>

<li>Agreed, This is for the minors. To share their experiences on a minor scale. Why should Frank lampard or Ronaldinho get their own page but not us? They are not special and nor are they more importatnt than us. At our school (the Friends' School) it is great fun and very passionate. Sometimes weve even stayed fifteen minutes after were supposed to be in class! What you say about our school and its competitions is dirtying our legacy. We want people to know just how important, soccer(thats not even on a major scale) is to the people in a small city in Australia. There is nothing wrong with this page, anymore than there is something wrong with Harry Kewell's page, it is merely us sharing our views off soccee andwhat is wrong with that?

<li>Frank Lampard and Ronaldinho both have won awards for their expertise and performance in soccer and Harry Kewell has had media coverage from multiple, verifiable sources- just look at the articles! Importance does not put one in Wikipedia, notability does. Also remember that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a group of proses. I find nothing offensive or wrong with your article- morality does not govern whether an article stays or not. But verifiability and notability through multiple sources keeps an article in Wikipedia. <b><a href="../../../s/r/1/User%7ESr13_af5f.html" title="User:Sr13">Sr13</a></b> <b>(<a href="../../../s/r/1/User_talk%7ESr13_4dc1.html" title="User talk:Sr13">T</a></b>|<b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sr13_98de.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sr13">C</a></b>) <sup><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Sr13_d5bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Sr13">Editor review</a></sup> 02:30, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment-</b> How is <i>notability criteria guideline</i> not Wikipedia rules? Again, you contradict your argument by saying "...everyone plays soccer during there breaks.

<p>Fry and Oats are famous Quakers. I'm sure if you google search their names you will get some information on them. The rules for soccer do not vary and they are not for an individual school.

There's an international dimension of some sort, but no expositions at notable galleries or museums; and there's an award (or two) of unknown notability.

Recently, Survivors who finished SECOND AND THIRD in the show have been going through afds and losing, so it was only a matter of time before somebody targeted this article. I'm sick of the wikipolitical philosophy that articles that survive 2 afds should automatically be kept, if people who finished THIRD and SECOND aren't considered notable, how is a guy who was voted out fourth and was in a couple episodes of a low-rated cable show notable? -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 01:59, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Taking your points in order: 1) "Precedent" is certainly something to consider, but each article is to be judged on its own merits. This article has been judged on its merits and the consensus was to keep it. That some other contestants may end up deleted is irrelevant to whether this article should be kept. 2) This article was last nominated for deletion on January 30. It was nominated by you 37 minutes after the previous AFD closed. The second AFD closed on February 5. Today is February 24. It has been 25 days since the article was nominated for the second time and 19 days since that second AFD closed. 3) Yes, he did something very notable on JDMA. He came out of the closet on national television and landed the cover of an internationally distributed magazine. 4) <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">Notability guidelines</a> require that a subject be "the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself." Calderon has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, including as previously noted an internationally distributed magazine. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:19, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>But was the entire series focused around his coming out of the closet?

<li>The entire series doesn't have to be focused on his coming out for his participation to be notable. And I'm honestly not sure why you are not grasping the concept that <i>every article stands or falls on its own</i>. Every single article on every single person who ever even <i>heard</i> of Survivor could be deleted tomorrow and it means nothing to whether the Calderon article is kept. If you think some of those other contestants should have pages, and you have the requisite multiple independent third-party sources for them, then write the articles and if they get AFDed I'll stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you to defend them. But for god's sake, stop using them as the whetstone for the axe you're grinding over Calderon's article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:53, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Once again, I had nothing to do with the nominating of this article. I think the nominator is a newer editor who had no idea the article had previously nominated. I didn't nominate it because I knew people would just use the "It's survived before, let's keep it" principal, which is why Wikipedia is stuck with some pretty useless articles. It's insane to think that there are many TV characters from well-known shows that don't have pages because they aren't "individually notable" and yet, this guy has one. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 05:36, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> POV fork. I've seen discussion on how having the "controversies" article is a POV fork (a way to keep the negative stuff out of the main article). So why are we forking out content again? The large majority of the material is copied from the controversies article, so there is a lot of redundancy. This makes me think that we do not need a spinout article for this already spinout article. Also, the creation intentions (and some recent editing over at the controversies article) leads me to lead that this is nothing more than a POV fork. I'd like to hear a defense of this as a simple spinout article. -<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 03:26, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> All of the stuff here has at one time or another been inserted into the "Al Gore controversies" article and subsequently deleted because the info is either not notable or spurious.

<li>All of the information on here is sourced and documented. Actually any info on here that was on Al Gore controversies was removed because of people saying it was non notable or it did not generate a 'storm of controversy'. How is it not notable when it appears in major news outlets?? Not every story that makes the news generates a storm of controversy, yet is very important, especially political stories that do not get front page news for political reasons. All the stories on here are from major news sources, the Washington Post, Newsweek, the New York Times, etc. At least these stories should be merged on Al Gore Controversies and not wholly removed.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_great_grape_ape_is_straight_out_of_the_know_f1b1.html" title="User:The great grape ape is straight out of the know">The great grape ape is straight out of the know</a> 02:16, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: "I get the idea from comments about politically controversial articles that merely addressing a controversy is itself POV." No, that's a fairly frequent misconception, but addressing a controversy is not POV. What <i>is</i> POV is addressing only <i>one</i> side of a controversy, or trying to arrange boundaries of discussion of a controversy that would limit discussion to one POV.

<li><b>Delete or Merge(parts)</b> The article is actually a good read and theres a lot of references but its too much of a POV view, especially since hes a living person. I think that some of the content has merits and perhaps the most well written, notable and well reference of it could be merged into a critique on the actual Al Gore article. . In any case this is just far too much, mostly non notable, criticism for an encyclopedia, espcially the Al Gore quotations criticized by the media section. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordHarris_aa9b.html" title="User:LordHarris">LordHarris</a> 04:08, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> I've said it before and I'll say it again...why is Al Gore not allowed to have a criticisms section, either as a separate article or (better) on his main Wikipedia bio page, when almost every other public figure from Presidents to stand up comedians on Wikipedia does? The "controversies" page is not a criticism page, it is an obnoxious fork intended to split off and then remove criticism of Al Gore from his Wikipedia biography. How can we justify treating him completely differently than any other public figure and still argue that the main article has a shred of neutrality? As it stands now, his Wikipedia biography reads like a press release for an upcoming election bid. -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.82.38.150 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.82.38.150_0053.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.82.38.150">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would suggest that both articles be returned to the original under the title "Controversies and Criticisms", as was suggested once before, and they can then be summarized and NPOV'ed by the usual editorial process. As it is, both articles basically exist outside of the Wikipedia process and represent dueling POVs. There is information in both articles that, unless it in some way represented in Al Gore's main biography, gives us an incomplete view of the man. If we continue to allow this kind of splitting off (even at the short term gain of some civility or stability in the editorial process) we'll lose the heart of the main article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> No criticism pages. Really those are the worst things you can do to wikipedia. It's just my humble opinion but no living person should have a criticism page. They are nothing more than pov magnets. Controversy pages are fine (Al Gore does have one) because there has to be some sort of legitimacy behind accusations. This page has little or nothing to merge. <a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiffypopmetaltop_3d5a.html" title="User:Jiffypopmetaltop">Jiffypopmetaltop</a> 04:40, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I understand your feelings about criticisms pages/sections, we are probably all sick of them. But the fact is virtually every article on Wikipedia on a major living public figure contains a criticism/controversy section. I'm not sure how we cannot have one on Al Gore and argue that we are being neutral. As you say, they are POV magnets but that doesn't remove our responsibility for addressing these issues in a NPOV way in the main Al Gore article. It sure makes it easier not to have them in the main page, but it doesn't make the article better, it makes it worse. I'm very leery of just having a section called "Controversies" without the term "Criticisms"; semantic debates on the definition of the term "Controversy" have been used in the past to delete large sections of biographical material on Gore, and it's become a sore point for some contributors. I'm not saying those sections shouldn't have been deleted or edited, I just would have liked a better argument for dumping them than that they don't fit a strict definition of the term controversy. I think our primary focus should be on making better articles, even if that sometimes makes things harder for us, having to deal with POV nuts and flamers. As things stand now, I'm worried we are copping out of our responsibilities. No doubt, the Al Gore page is a magnet for attack right now because of his visibility, but many pages go through these periods and still maintain a civil discussion process and ultimately a neutral POV. If we have problems with this article and the "Controversies" article, I think it is best to return them to the main page and deal with them there, fact by fact, issue by issue. Just deleting them or favoring one over another is going to cause a justifiable resentment to the whole process. We'll have avoided dealing with the issues and over time it will just get worse.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Holy cow, I've read the main Al Gore article I don't know how many times and never connected the fact that, in an article where we don't allow a criticism section about its subject, there is a long criticism section of another public figure (Bush). I guess by logic, if we want to see public criticisms of Gore or his administration we need to go to the Bush page. In all seriousness, I think this illustrates the problem with not having a criticisms section. As it stands right now, the article allows Gore's criticisms of other public figures and topics, but doesn't allow any criticism of him or his actions. This policy just can't be regarded as fair or non biased and its a recipe for long term disaster. Ultimately it will make the article one sided and neuter the subject.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If we can get back to the discussion now, I see that the main Al Gore article has had the above discussed "Criticism of Bush Administration" section removed. I don't see how this helps things or the article; these are Gore's own words and personal beliefs, I can't think of much more essential to summing up a man. I think we are better suited by publishing Gore's criticisms of other people and the criticisms of him, just like every other public figure on Wikipedia. It is essential that we have both sides of the story if we are going to understand him as a man and try to give a clear view of his life. At this rate the article will have absolutely nothing left except that Al Gore owned a dog, and then that section will be removed by someone who owns a cat. BTW, so that everyone can clearly know my bias on these issues, I own a cat.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Articles must establish notability through achievements or external coverage, and furthermore must provide validation through verifiable references. There are 3 refs - 2 to Youtube, which is not acceptable, and 1 to a Greek site. I have asked for a translation. However, 1 ref is not enough. If Alf photoman's comment that he "had his 15 minutes of fame" is true, then we should keep the article, as once notability is achieved, it is not removed as far as our purposes are concerned.

<p>The paper that defined this wasn't published in a peer-reviewed journal, nor, as far as I can tell (from citeseer/citebase) were any of the three article which cite it (and two of those are by the author of the original paper). It has a reference from New Scientist (<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6924" class="external text" title="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6924" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which is offline, see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060425170800/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6924" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20060425170800/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6924" rel="nofollow">archived version</a>) and one from Baseline (<a href="http://www.keepmedia.com/pubs/Baseline/2005/03/07/762800?extID=10051" class="external text" title="http://www.keepmedia.com/pubs/Baseline/2005/03/07/762800?extID=10051" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which I've never heard of, and which may have been written by the author of the original article as well). I believe that the lack of references from reliable published sources independent from the author of the article which originates the term indicates that this isn't a notable term. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 03:19, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s>. Vitanyi is an established scholar; I'm not concerned about the lack of peer review yet. But though his paper has attracted around 20 citations in Google scholar, it's not clear how many if any of them are about this "Google distance". A better source would seem to be <a href="http://eprints.pascal-network.org/archive/00002784/01/tkde06.pdf" class="external text" title="http://eprints.pascal-network.org/archive/00002784/01/tkde06.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Google Similarity Distance</a> by the same authors, but that's also a preprint with no citations yet.

<li><b>very Weak keep</b> The present evidence for N is that New Scientist thought this worth an article. Many items in this field are now published only in arXiv, even by the very best scholars. But since this isn't peer-reviewed publication, they would have no be established by citations of the articles from unquestionable sources. All the alternatives to conventional peer review make use of subsequent citation as the test for quality--which is reasonable because such citation is from the same group from whom the reviewers would have come. I would consider one additional one to New Scientist enough. I think if necessary this might prove to be a good test case for how to deal with these non-conventional quality control systems, but it would not do so until it has been widely cited in convention publications. I suggest re-creating it at a later date with the references that will have accumulated. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 07:55, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree that enough citations, even from non-peer-reviewed sources, would make this worth keeping. I'm only just on the side of deleting this, which is why I mentioned everything I could find in the nomination; a few extra (reasonable) sources would make me think this ought to be kept. It is written (somewhere, probably, I think) that things published by known scholars on e.g. their own webspace should be considered also as probably reliable. I just think that this probably isn't notable enough, yet. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 12:38, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - With all due respect the arguments for deletion strike me as weak.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The article provides more than a definition by providing the algorithm used for measuring Google Distance and this is of some interest. What's provided may be insufficient but this merely justifies a Stub tag and not deletion.</li>
<li>I'm just flummoxed by the suggestion that this concept is irrelevant since the way Google measures website popularity and related notions has been in the news and the subject of lawsuits.</li>
<li>If there is confusion between the concepts of "Google Distance" and "Google Similarity Distance" then that should be cleared up. But I don't see how that in itself is grounds for deletion.</li>
<li>The article mentioned by David Eppstein is in the IEEE Transactions of Knowledge and Data Engineering , <a href="http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/trans/tk/&amp;toc=comp/trans/tk/2007/03/k3toc.xml&amp;DOI=10.1109/TKDE.2007.48" class="external text" title="http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/trans/tk/&amp;toc=comp/trans/tk/2007/03/k3toc.xml&amp;DOI=10.1109/TKDE.2007.48" rel="nofollow">The Google Similiarity Distnce</a></li>

<dd>Also, four articles came up on the ACM digital library in regards to "google distance", and, what can I say, found over 800 hits when I googled "google distance". There is no question that the article needs to be improved, but I'm not seeing how any of these are grounds for deletion. Could something cite the specific Wiki policy that they think is relevent here? <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EAbcarter_3034.html" title="User:Abcarter">A B Carter</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/b/c/User_talk%7EAbcarter_86c3.html" title="User talk:Abcarter">talk</a>)</small> 17:24, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The policy I was concerned about when I nominated it was <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Specifically, the part about being the subject of multiple independent non-trivial works. Granted that a google search for "google distance" yields a few hundred results, but a fair number of those are unrelated, and many of the related ones are from blogs and such. I agree that the case for deletion is pretty weak--I just also think that the case for keeping the article is pretty weak. Basically, especially given how happy the media is to report on google, I'd expect that if something like this could be called notable, a couple of newspapers/magazines (in addition to new scientist) would have mentioned it. That may have happened, and, if so, we ought to keep the article; however, I couldn't find such mentions.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, as far as I can tell, this Google distance isn't Google's celbrated sorting algorithm that they use (i.e. pagerank), but some other thing which happens to use google as a tool. So, I don't think that the notability of google necessarily implies that this is notable. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 01:50, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed, I was initially confused on this point. I would also agree that as a consequence notability is an issue, though I'm still for a weak keep. <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EAbcarter_3034.html" title="User:Abcarter">A B Carter</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/b/c/User_talk%7EAbcarter_86c3.html" title="User talk:Abcarter">talk</a>)</small> 02:34, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> "… some other thing which happens to use google as a tool." It's a measure of lexicographic similarity. It's one of the first attempts to use the actions of a large number of individuals (their choice of words for web pages) as the basis of artificial intelligence. If you haven't looked at the article recently, you might want to read it again. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCBryant_f1d6.html" title="User:DavidCBryant">DavidCBryant</a> 13:00, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Not all that convincing. I only got 19 references of which 6 referred to articles by Vitanyi, 3 to "google distance learning", 2 to Poesi which appear to offer a different notion of "google distance" and 5 of unknown origin.

<li><b>I think we have a winner!</b> Merge is an excellent option. The entry is clearly on the cusp: I wouldn't have given it an entry but now that there is one I'm reluctant to simply delete it.

<li><b>merge</b> into something and leave a redirect to that page. Reason: reading the article I actually found what is the formula.

<li><b>Delete</b> "techie" is vague, and the list is filled with vague inclusions.

<p>This article has several problems. Chief among them is that it does not <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">cite its sources</a> and relies on <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Since it refers to popular usage its assertion of notability is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. Most importantly, there are <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">living persons</a> issues, since it implies an accusation of drunkenness. It has been transwikied to Wiktionary, but I doubt much of this material will be used there for the same reasons. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 03:38, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b> per nom, which is a shame since it's kind of entered popular culture. It <i>might</i> be possible to dig up some citations for people being described in this manner, but then there's the issue of figuring out whether it's being used euphemistically or whether the individual was really just tired and emotional. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 03:51, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</s>

<li><b>Keep</b> now that sources have been added and the potential (which IMO is always going to be there, but there's nothing we can do about it) for a BLP violation reduced. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 04:49, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup as there appear to be plenty of sources showing the origin from Private Eye and its currency (i.e. discussing same) as a bit of newspaper jargon (as opposed to slang, which it isn't clear it is).

<p>Entirely non-notable vanity entry linked from and to article creators only other (unrelated) article. Apparently it is just an affiliate's idea of running tournaments at various sites. Even if it were something other than advertising, the first event was just a few days ago so it has established zilch notability yet.

Hmm, not sure what the correct procedure to respond to this is, if I'm doing something wrong here, by responding here, please let me know the correct method. Was surprised to see someone marking the article for deletion before I had even finished writing it, but I'll respond to the concerns here. Firstly you mention linked to an unrelated article, as clearly indicated on both articles, the relationship is that the company it is linked to is (UTC)sponsoring the page in question.</p>
<p>The site is clearly content based, with a small number of advertisements for companies supporting the venture. It is primarily a community for enthusiasts to compete in a worldwide competition and a site with tutorials and guides for new players.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Julesl (<a href="../../../j/u/l/User_talk%7EJulesl_e3fa.html" title="User talk:Julesl">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Julesl_91de.html" title="Special:Contributions/Julesl">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Alright, yes, I'm going to be completely biased because this is my high school, and I am the author of the original article.

The notable alumni definitely helps my cause... it's not every opera singer that pops out of a conservative NW Kansas school. If you haven't been here, let me tell you, not succumbing to the pressure to be a farmer or housewife is an accomplishment (we live in 1950).

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article does not have adequate independent references; since this is a bedrock requirement in our community the article fails. I don't feel that the claim of notability on alumni grounds is adequate, as everyone has to be educated somewhere. If notability transfers from a student to a school, why does it not transfer from a customer to a shop&#160;? I do note that both cited alumni are musicians; if it can be shown that the school specifically develops musical talent in its pupils I'd be inclined to change my view, but otherwise I feel this should go. The assertion that all schools are notable I have addressed in many previous AfD debates; I am opposed to the idea that we should relax standards of notability for the special case of schools. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b>: Responding to comments above: all films are clearly linked by the topic of pedophilia - sometimes as the major them, sometimes as a minor theme. A much more detailed list with back up infomration and links etc can be found at <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia_and_child_sexual_abuse_in_films.html" title="Pedophilia and child sexual abuse in films">Pedophilia and child sexual abuse in films</a>. That article, which I 'maintain', is divided into sections and is quite long. This list, which is (I agree)to some extent a duplication, puts all the films into one alphabetical list and so may be more useful for some wikipedians. It is easy to verify all the films though the above article and by visiting Imdb or Amazon etc. Most wiki lists are structured like this one. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sandel_9801.html" title="User:Tony Sandel">Tony</a> 17:03, 26 February 2007 (UTC)Tony ps Haemo is strickly correct on the grammar, but 'List of films with a pedophiliac theme' would be clumsy and most learned articles on pedophilia now use pedophile as an adjective as well as a noun. Pedophiliac is seldom used.</p>

<li>So far, I've never seen you argue to keep a list, and much of the time, most of your reasons given in arguments to delete lists boil down to little more than "lists are bad." Furthermore, knowing something about the sheer volume of list-related deletions you're involved in right now (most with a canned statement of flaws when you were the nominator) may put your comments here in context. If you wish to use strong accusations such as calling me a liar, please go to my talk page for it instead of cluttering this AfD. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 03:31, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> Other contestants who were voted off of American Idol have articles, so why not Rachel Zevita who has already accomplished more than most musicians and is on her way to being very successful. At least give her some time. Is it a requirement that an artist be famous to have an article on Wikipedia? She is obviously notable by that fact that her fans keep reposting for her and do not want her deleted. If Wikipedia is only a place where people can come to look up information on people they already know everything about, then what is the point of it all anyways?'<b>Moellering2007'</b><small>— <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoellering2007_6795.html" title="User:Moellering2007">Moellering2007</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoellering2007_db4c.html" title="User talk:Moellering2007">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Moellering2007_63f6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Moellering2007">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small> <small><a href="../../../a/w/y/User_talk%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3248.html" title="User talk:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Awyong J.</a> <a href="../../../a/w/y/User%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3b01.html" title="User:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">M.

<p>Article on <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_Haussman_a309.html" title="Sky Haussman">Sky Haussman</a>, a fictional character in the <i><a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelation_Space_4475.html" title="Revelation Space">Revelation Space</a></i> series, is nominated for deletion because individual characters are not encyclopedic topics by themselves unless they're major enough according to <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, which this is not really. There is already an entry for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Revelation_Space_c1c1.html" title="Characters in Revelation Space">Characters_in_Revelation_Space</a>, and I have already moved this material to the listing that was already there for this character, at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Revelation_Space_c1c1.html#Schuyler_.22Sky.22_Haussman_.2F_.22H.22" title="Characters in Revelation Space">Characters_in_Revelation_Space#Schuyler_.22Sky.22_Haussman_.2F_.22H.22</a>. Even if it were argued that this character were of enough encyclopedic interest under <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> for his own page, there are several much more notable characters in the Revelation Space series than this one, and they are all happily on the omnibus <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Revelation_Space_c1c1.html" title="Characters in Revelation Space">Characters_in_Revelation_Space</a> page; those more major characters would all have to be convincingly shown to be major enough for their own pages before this character. For example, while this character is a major character in one of the 'RS' novels and has a cameo in a second one, the character Nevil Clavain is a major character of two of the 'RS' novels and the central character of two of the 'RS' short stories - if any 'RS' character were to get his own article, it would be him. - <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReaverdrop_37ac.html" title="User:Reaverdrop"><b>Reaverdrop</b></a> <small><font color="green">(<a href="../../../r/e/a/User_talk%7EReaverdrop_ce3e.html" title="User talk:Reaverdrop">talk</a>/<a href="../../../../nl/r/e/a/Gebruiker%7EReaverdrop_a5b4.html" class="extiw" title="nl:Gebruiker:Reaverdrop">nl</a>/<a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPACE_cbae.html" title="WP:SPACE">w:s</a>)</font></small> 04:33, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>ONCE again.</b> there's a difference between a garage band and a band that has nottiblity in a different state that you live in. do you live in Indiana? do you know band that are from Indiana? didn't think so. my statement stands just because you haven't heard of them doesn't mean they're not nottible.<a href="../../../s/c/u/User%7EScubster_8ff7.html" title="User:Scubster">Scubster</a> 08:22, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Maybe they're "nottible", but around here, we're concerned about <i><a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">notability</a></i>, and there is none here. Can you show some published articles about this band? Do they have an album? There's notability guidelines that you're more interested in ignoring than checking out.

<li>I had considered userfying it, but with the edit history (which includes an apparent variety of editors), it just seemed odd that it would be such. Also, I can't tell if the ongoing edits by individuals are vandalism or not... everyone seems to change the entire context of the article and its very basic facts each time around. Not a single source when at least something is dearly needed. This seems to fail the Google test -- definitely doesn't seem notable. I'm somewhat thinking that all the editors may be personally involved with the individual which the article references. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThisisbossi_e64b.html" title="User:Thisisbossi">Thisisbossi</a> 04:57, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> for the present person--his HS athletic accomplishments if real are probably N, though the bio is Vanity. There are 2 independent sources although not of high quality on Google, after searching for "Ben Andrews" Parkrose. His MySpace page link doesnt work. Per Dhartung, it does seem like someone is playing an elaborate multipart hoax at out expense, looking for different people of this name. First step is to change the titles so we can tell them apart, and relist. Alternatively, just delete this and watch if they start again. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:09, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>. This article is merely a list of names and how to abbreviate them (i.e. a word list) with no prose or explanatory text or encyclopedic purpose. Wikipedia is not a dictionary. This is the kind of thing that Wiktionary is made for, and so they have been transwikied to Wiktionary and may now be deleted. There is strong precedent for this kind of deletion; recently, all lists of given names have been moved to Wiktionary and deleted.</p>

I got no hits on Google News, which leads me to believe there aren't a lot of independent articles about it. The site gets a ton of Google hits, but only twenty of them are unique. The site contains no original content. All videos are linked from other sources, such as YouTube and Google Video. The site's former name, "Google Idol" gets a good number of hits, but they're all blogs and ads. Again, no usable sources. The article is written like an ad. --<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">Djrobgordon</a> 05:45, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is a stub, and has been for over 2 years. It has no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and it is pretty clear that material to expand this does not exist or is scarce. I have moved all the relevant material on this article to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_worldwide.html" title="Christmas worldwide">Christmas worldwide</a>, where stubs on this topic belong. Are we to have an article for every country in the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_worldwide.html" title="Christmas worldwide">Christmas worldwide</a> article? There simply isn't enough material to warrent this having its own article seperate from <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_worldwide.html" title="Christmas worldwide">Christmas worldwide</a>, especially since some of the other countries Christmas traditions listed in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_worldwide.html" title="Christmas worldwide">Christmas worldwide</a> have more content than this article, and they still don't have their own article for Christmas traditions. <a href="../../../s/e/f/User%7ESefringle_0106.html" title="User:Sefringle">Sefringle</a> 06:27, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's NOT a hoax. Dozens of online tour guides refer to tours of "Clamecy Cathedral" (<a href="http://www.europeanhomerentals.com/france/barges/property_belle_epoque.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.europeanhomerentals.com/france/barges/property_belle_epoque.cfm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and <a href="http://www.hotelbarges.co.uk/france/belle_epoque/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hotelbarges.co.uk/france/belle_epoque/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, for instance). Clamacy has a collegiate church, but for something like 600 years it was the home of the Bishop of Bethlehem! (Yes, that Bethlehem.) The cathedral is 13th century and may now be known as the Collegiate Church of St. Martin. If so, and if tour guides call it a cathedral, it's a legitimate entry, at least as a historical seat. By the way, for those who aren't Catholic, a "cathedral" is merely a church that is also the seat of a bishop. It doesn't have to be big or fancy. Given that the original creator appears to be a major contributor to articles on French churches, I suggest that this is legitimate and that the cathedral really does exist, at least as a historical entity. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 07:42, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> - Thanks for all the good input to my nomination. I'll concede the article is not a hoax but I do believe there's been a mistake--there is no church with the name Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Clamecy. There is a Collegiate Church of St. Martin in Clamecy (started in the 13th or 14 century); There is a Church of Notre Dame in Bethleem (built in 1926 or 1927); and there was another (smallish) church in Bethleem that may have technically been a cathedral at one time but has since been partially destroyed and converted into a hotel. <a href="http://www.vaux-yonne.com/article.php3?id_article=101" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vaux-yonne.com/article.php3?id_article=101" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> The article as it has been rewritten in the past 24 hours seems to be a pastiche of all three of these churches. My new vote would be to <b>rename</b> the article to one of the two existing churches and then add a second article to cover the other. The interesting and notable info about the Bishopric of Bethlehem could go with the Bethleem church or even stand alone as a third article.<a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlendoremus_892f.html" title="User:Glendoremus">Glendoremus</a> 17:35, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I found out the domey church was actually 1926 at some point yesterday, but I was too busy to follow up on my confusion. Interestingly, it is considered a landmark of 20th century architecture in Bourgogne<a href="http://bourgogne-franche-comte.france3.fr/emissions/8514013-fr.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://bourgogne-franche-comte.france3.fr/emissions/8514013-fr.php" rel="nofollow">[15]</a><a href="http://fr.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0016588" class="external autonumber" title="http://fr.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0016588" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, so probably deserves a listing. It isn't *the* former cathedral, but it's obviously the one with the frescoes! Now, the bit about the hotel seems to be that there is a chapel in what was a 12th century hospital established by Guillaume IV at the same time. It isn't clear to me that the hospital and chapel itself was the seat of the bishopric, but that seems to be what has become a hotel. Argh! --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 11:43, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

That seems to be the clincher -- wish I'd found that 24 hours earlier! I think that the name Ancienne Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-Bethléem (or Former Cathedral Notre-Dame-de-Bethléem is best; that is supported here<a href="http://www.culture.fr/culture/inventai/itiinv/cathedrale/cat_bourgogne.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.culture.fr/culture/inventai/itiinv/cathedrale/cat_bourgogne.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>.

<p>This article is blatant free advertising for a private business enterprise. Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia--not an online "yellow pages."

<li><b>Creator Comment</b> Seven Cycles clearly meets the criteria for a company to be included in Wikipedia. It has recently appeared in several independent magazine articles, a list of which can be found here: <a href="http://sevencycles.com/about/press.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://sevencycles.com/about/press.php" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. If citations are a problem I can add them, if wording is the issue it is a wiki and open to anyone to help. Also, it's possibly worth noting that the nominator has (impropery) nominated almost every page i've created for AFD because I nominated an article of his that was deleted as <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> (AFD debate here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gharrio" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gharrio" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>). <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodnightmush_2887.html" title="User:Goodnightmush">Goodnightmush</a> 03:59, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete unless sourced</b> If there are magazine articles, please add them to the article, for at the moment is has no sources not derived from the business--there well might be, for there ought to be product reviews. Even so, the existing article with the extensive catalog of models is unsuitable. There;s also the problem that the sources would have to indicate that the company was a major manufacturer, either in quantity or in terms of notabliity for special quality or other features. Might be possible--go try. There is no point in talking about personalities, because if the subject can be sown to be notable it will be approved. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:43, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>UPDATE</b> I have added numerous links to assert the importance of the subject of the article in the external links at the article. If I had more time I would incorporate them. However, in that section alone they should suffice to close this debate in favor of keep. Here are a few examples: <a href="http://www.bicycling.com/article/0,6610,s1-1-2-13693-1,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bicycling.com/article/0,6610,s1-1-2-13693-1,00.html" rel="nofollow">Review of the company in Bicycling Magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-1-2-15115-1,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-1-2-15115-1,00.html" rel="nofollow">Bicycling Magazine article about one model</a>, <a href="http://www.velonews.com/tech/report/articles/7220.0.html" class="external text" title="http://www.velonews.com/tech/report/articles/7220.0.html" rel="nofollow">Velonews Article</a> <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodnightmush_2887.html" title="User:Goodnightmush">Goodnightmush</a> 02:37, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is blatant free advertising for a private business enterprise. Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia--not an online "yellow pages." If allowed to stand, this article opens up the door for free advertising touting the product line of all private business enterprises. It constitutes a gross abuse of Wikipedia. Gregory Watson</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The AfD nomination was not complete, so I completed it.

<li><b>Creator Comment</b> I don't why this article qualifies for AFD. There are over 160 pages about cycling manufacturers many smaller than Industry Nine. It has been reported on in independant reliable sources, including the most recent <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirt_Rag_f31b.html" title="Dirt Rag">Dirt Rag</a> and fairly recently in Mountain Bike Magazine. It is a large brand sold in hundreds of stores. I can see that it will need work to be a good article, and that's why its open to the public for merciless editing. I'll put in citations from those articles if the result is keep. Also, it's possibly worth noting that the nominator has (impropery) nominated almost every page i've created for AFD because I nominated an article of his that was deleted as <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodnightmush_2887.html" title="User:Goodnightmush">Goodnightmush</a> 03:55, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. There is no such thing. Svalbard and Jan Mayen are two distinct parts of Norway, they are never treated as the same. They already have their separate articles. Note also the conspicuous absence of any such page at <a href="../../../../no/index.html" class="extiw" title="no:">no:</a> and <a href="../../../../nn/index.html" class="extiw" title="nn:">nn:</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDagnabit_4aad.html" title="User:Dagnabit">Dagnabit</a> 08:40, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Even though Google does give plenty of hits on the phrase, these two things are not well connected in any way. Such "and" subjects are difficult to cover meaningfully without duplication when we already have separate articles giving reasonable coverage, and disambiguation just seems meaningless as was illustrated at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Margaret_Weis_and_Tracy_Hickman_76e3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman">this AFD</a>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:15, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. All meaningful information is already present in the separate articles, thus leaving us with an article which itself admits to being tenuous ("two separate parts of Norway" and the fact that they are linked only by a piece of "trivia"). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:49, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The article explains the rationale for keeping it: there apparently is an ISO 3166 country code "SJ" which stands for "Svalbard and Jan Mayen"; as a result there is also an assigned Internet domain set, .sj, with the same name. Someone seeing this code and not having heard of Svalbard and/or Jan Mayen may enter "Svalbard and Jan Mayen" into Wikipedia, and the search needs to lead the user to an article. Redirecting to either <a href="../../../s/v/a/Svalbard.html" title="Svalbard">Svalbard</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Mayen_c355.html" title="Jan Mayen">Jan Mayen</a> would be inappropriate as the code relates to both locations and there is no basis for choosing the redirect target as between them.

<li><b>Keep</b>. While I understand the two places are distinct parts, the term is used in ISO and many international documents.

<li><b>Keep</b>. For someone who knew almost nothing about the subject other than having seen the name on globes, rather near the top, I found the article quite informative.

<li>
<ul>
<li>I still think that's an overreaction. The information (such as it is) can be moved to the pages on both islands if this article is deleted. Nobody's trying to "destroy access" to anything at all. I also totally fail to see where these "political considerations" are. As far as I can tell, the arguments are based on the validity or lack thereof of the designation, not politics. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:02, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Given that it is a statistical designation used by the UN and many others, it would not hurt to have a semi-disambiguatory article on the subject. The text of the article does not leave any room for confusion that the islands somehow belong together geographically or administratively. Please note that the article does not write that the phrase "Svalbard and Jan Mayen" refers to two islands, but rather that it is a statistical designation. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 17:45, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

This might be made more clear in the article, to avoid the appearance that it is the name of a governmental administrative district or the like, emphasize Norwegian sovreignty, etc., or the whole article might be named something like "Svalbard and Jan Mayen (ISO designation)".

<p>It's actually a shame there isn't an article on American Legion baseball in general. However, I can't see a reason for this article to exist.

<p><a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>. These articles are merely lists of names belonging to a particular language or culture (i.e. a word list) with no prose or explanatory text or encyclopedic purpose. Wikipedia is not a dictionary. This is the kind of thing that Wiktionary is made for, and so they have been transwikied to Wiktionary and may now be deleted. There is strong precedent for this kind of deletion; recently, all lists of given names have been moved to Wiktionary and deleted.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe the discussion here is about whether this is encyclopedic or not. If it is poorly sourced, that should be fixed, but it isn't a critera for deletion. Johnn 7 19:33, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The point i'm trying to make is that it the sources is incorrect and thus should be removed leaving something which is unsourced and also thus leaving nothing there so in a nutshell there is no article. <a href="../../../d/x/r/User%7EDXRAW_bfe0.html" title="User:DXRAW">DXRAW</a> 20:03, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, but <i>not</i> per nom. This is at the moment just a list, and not a useful source of information on things such as how the codenames are given or when they are given. However, I am certain that a point like "some of the information in this article is wrong" isn't a reason to delete it, as that's not what <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> says.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a list, but <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">a list is valid WP content</a> (as opposed to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>).

<ul>
<li><b>...but rename/move</b>. On further thought, if this is primarily a list page (as opposed to a page about Secret Service operations that happens to include some examples), it should probably be named List of Secret Service codenames. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 07:12, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Keep</b>. Although the discussion below is not favourable, the author has made a genuine and thorough attempt to source the articles, and to assert the notability of the subjects, toward the end of this discussion.

<li><b>Delete all</b> - articles don't establish notability, COI issues.

<li><b>Adjust if necessary but to not delete</b> - These series have been available for years and are very popular in the home educator and public school and library envirnment. Many teachers, parents, children and others doing research on the male and female heroes for acamedic purposes might want to know that there are video portrayals of those characters. Since many other children's movie series IMDB listings are included in Wikipedia it seemed appropriate to add those links here. The "long list" of titles has been here for some time, a couple folks (myself included) just recently added the links to IMDB. If ther are specific comments or links that you object to which you belive to be "vanity" or "adverstising" let's delete those - - but let's not remove the entire selection and therefore the ability for kids, teachers and parents that are researching these topics, such as Harriett Tubnman, Geoerge Washingotn, Moses or John the Baptist from finding IMDB references to additional resources.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also, if you think this one is "advertising" then take a look at the Veggie Tales wikipedia citation for comparision. That citation describes nearly every episode indeetail, the actors etc. These sites just link to the IMDB.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by HistoryHero (<a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHistoryHero_5998.html" title="User talk:HistoryHero">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__HistoryHero_ff84.html" title="Special:Contributions/ HistoryHero">contribs</a>) 20:06, 19 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - It would be helpful for you and others interested in preserving these articles to look at the <a href="../../../n/f/_/WP%7ENF_43ef.html" title="WP:NF">proposed notability of films guideline</a> and provide independent, reliable sources that establish notability.

When those sources are provided, I will consider switching my opinion to keep. I don't have a particular objection the the imdb links, but would like to see the article dominated by descriptive prose.

<dd><b>Thank you</b> - As you suggest,I will look into the guidelines and revisit the content. But off the cuff, just so you know, these films are used regulalry for research, homework, lesson plans, etc. by teachers and students. The series and individual titles have received mutiple awards including the family approved seal from the Dove Foundation, The Parent's Choice Foundation award and the National Educational Media Association award, the "Award of Excellence" from the Film Advisory Board, the Director's Choice Award from Early Childhood News, they are endorsed by KIDS FIRST!, and received the highest rating from Practical Homeschooling. These educational movies are used in over 60,000+ public schools &amp; libraries, 100,000+ churches of all Christian denominiations, by counteless home educators, and are streamed into public schools by Discovery Education's United Media Streaming group. They are a great tool for kids researching the heroes of history (Biblical and secular) covered by the series. As you suggest, I will look at the [WP:NF|proposed notability of films guideline]]to see how best to add more content and make it clear that these series and the individual movies are a serious research and teaching tool.

<li><b>Is notability now established?</b> - As requested, I have added more information and background content about the series, its genesis, purpose and the reviews and awards it has garnered. Thank you again for your suggestions.HistoryHero 14:08, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The main problem now, as I see it, is that the information in the article needs to be <b>sourced</b>... where was this information found (what books, magazine/newspaper articles, reviews, etc...) If that can be added to the articles, per <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>, the odds of these articles being kept shoot up. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 23:02, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Things actually have taken a step backwards. On at least three of the articles, there are <a href="../../../c/v/_/WP%7ECV_27f7.html" title="WP:CV">copyright problems</a>. The new text that was lifted directly from commercial promotional material. The copied parts need to come out immediately <s>or this becomes a <b>speedy delete</b></s>.

<li><b>Clarification re attribution</b> The story outlines were taken directly from the video sleeves. Looking at the attribution rules and other examples on Wikipedia, it seems that if I add a foootnote to the Story/Plot Outline section which attributes the source of the outline to the video sleeve and the video distributor all should be okay. Correct? HistoryHero 02:16, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Basically the material needs to be rewritten in your own words. Borrowing complete sentences or rearranging borrowed phrases without permission is considered a copyright violation. Right now it is important to list the independent sources for the parts that assert notability; expanding the text in your own words can come after this AfD is settled in favor of the articles. When the references are added, I will consider changing my opinion to keep. <font color="purple">✤</font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JonHarder_9df4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JonHarder">JonHarder</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonHarder_604a.html" title="User talk:JonHarder">talk</a></sup> 16:00, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My name is <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Cline_ad65.html" title="User:Mike Cline">Mike Cline</a>, I indeed work for a company that teaches and practices the concepts the four articles up for deletion embody. <a href="http://venturist.com/oldsite/news.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://venturist.com/oldsite/news.htm" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> I created the articles in good faith well before the COI was raised. Once the COI was raised I acknowledged it and ceased any work on the articles—therefore they are indeed incomplete and at this point, poorly referenced. The first deletion comment states—“of <i>the company that made this stuff up</i>.” That is not only untrue, but shows a complete lack of understanding of the subject matter of the articles. All these terms are widely used in the context of strategy and have long histories. For example the idea of Strategic Campaign was first introduced by Sun Tzu in “The Art of War. (6th Century BC). At the simplest level, google searches for the terms when associated with the word “strategy” return a remarkable number of hits</p>
<ul>
<li>Orchestration (strategy) (749,000+)</li>
<li>Prime Directive (strategy) (77,000+)</li>
<li>Rule of Engagement (strategy) (10,000+)</li>
<li>Strategic campaign (63,000+)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's a <i>speculative</i> "problem" that <i>might</i> occur in <b>seven thousand nine hundred and ninety-three years</b>. And even then, it could only occur if (1) the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_calendar.html" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a> is still in use at that time (not a certainty) and (2) today's computers are still operational (<a href="../../../c/b/_/WP%7ECB_bcec.html" title="WP:CB">WP:CB</a> comes to mind). But the accuracy of the speculation isn't even the issue. <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a> tells us that we only have articles of future events if they're both notable and verifiable.

<li><b>Keep</b> my gut reaction was to delete, until I remembered that I often find Excel 1900 dates really annoying because they don't go back to BC. I presume anyone dealing with software for astronomy, or anyone holding a database which extends scientific predictions for planets beyond 10,000 would find this a problem. There will be a controversy whether to use 4, 5 even 6 digits because some people do have data for predictions that far ahead and there will be a problem. There may even be some people producing equipment that is needed to last this long (nuclear repositories, space craft leaving the solar system), so there may be people alread having to deal with the Y10K problem - bit of a bummer since the world ends this century when all the fossil fuel runs out - but we can't all predict the future! <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 15:50, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, but that’s not an academic article and it’s not from the ACM. The RFC papers document and standardise current practices, protocols and formats related to networks, including the Internet. <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2550.txt" class="external text" title="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2550.txt" rel="nofollow">RFC 2550</a> is part of the fine tradition of publishing joke RFCs on April Fools’ Day (see e.&#160;g. <a href="http://foo.ewu.edu/jefu/other/april_fool_rfc.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://foo.ewu.edu/jefu/other/april_fool_rfc.html" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> for a nice list, but be warned that some knowledge of the field is necessary to appreciate them fully). Basically, it’s a joke, written by three guys at Compaq who probably spent that year digging through very old code looking for Y2K bugs. In case I’m not being convicing, note that the RFC is identified as being in ‘Category: Stinkards Track’ or simply read it with attention to the details. I’m sorry I’m not being more constructive, but I am still convinced that Y10K is a non-issue. —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 04:19, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>...True, but a name that is tied to a substantial amount of the history of Christianity and of Catholicism in India. It is also a unique name, meaning only members of the family carry it.

<li>Define released. This one was "released" in the sense that it exists, but it was not sold at stores or available for purchase at all except as a sort of concert souvenir or fan club gift. Is that really considered a release? GassyGuy 02:24, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> - I accept that this release had a limited print run and didn't receive general distribution, but I don't feel that this criteria should be a bar for this article's existence, there are many other articles that also don't meet this criteria (eg <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles%27_Christmas_Album_79e9.html" title="The Beatles' Christmas Album">The Beatles' Christmas Album</a>). Ultimately, this was an album produced by the band for public consumption and I feel that the overall Hawkwind article would lack completeness if it were omitted. In addition, if this article is to be deleted, then by extension the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spaced_Out_In_London_662a.html" title="Spaced Out In London">Spaced Out In London</a> article must also be removed. <a href="../../../d/r/w/User%7EDrwhawkfan_0770.html" title="User:Drwhawkfan">Drwhawkfan</a> 11:12, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Actually, demos are more often than not deleted because of their nature, so little is written about them. The article fails to establish why the "album" merits an article.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: A fan will think ever single track or release is important, and nothing will ever change that. However, at least the reason why someone thinks <a href="../../../s/e/e/Seeing_Stars_5caf.html" title="Seeing Stars">Seeing Stars</a> is important has been stated in the article, and whether one agrees or not whether this translates into <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> is another matter, but this is usually demonstrated by quoting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. For the article under discussion, all this is demonstrably lacking, and therefore merits deletion, IMHO. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:18, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Followup: I did some checking, and this is indeed a well-known company with a worldwide presence. The reason some people may not be familiar with it is that its products apparently are used for managing large corporate computer networks. I found references to several articles on it in German and Spanish on top of a vast number of articles in English in various IT publications. An Amazon.com search shows that a couple of books have been written about how to use some of their products and LANDesk is referenced in many others. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 04:38, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> it already. Now having read the previous deletion discussions (both linked to on the article talk page), I think that the television appearances, although not references per se, satisfy <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (name recognition) and meet the standards of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The argument has been made several times that he is the most notable American cosplayer, in terms of media coverage--and that hasn't up to now been refuted in a convincing way. I knew nothing about <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosplay.html" title="Cosplay">Cosplay</a> until I stumbled across this afd, and I think <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man-Faye_81d3.html" title="Man-Faye">Man-Faye</a> puts the entire phenomenon into context for the general reader, much more colorfully than the main article. I also think there should be a strong bias against a third afd in a year, particularly when the second one was argued at length. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 15:08, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Being "known within one's niche" is not a notability criterion, nor is having fans, nor is simply "appearing" on television. Being nominated before is not a keep criterion. If this is sourceable to reliable sources, why have none been added to the article in all this time? As has been noted, this isn't the first time it's been brought to deletion - how many times should we say "keep but source" when sources are not forthcoming? GassyGuy 08:52, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I find a couple of other stories which list this with other leech sites as being affected by copyright concerns affecting YouTube. The site's brief popularity seems to stem form its providing leech links to copyright content, and that's not going to be allowed to continue, so we have no way of knowing if the site will continue to have any popularity, but that's not the issue: the issue here is that I can find only one non-trivial source, the rest seem to be passing mentions of the site as another in a series of sites under the hammer for copyright violation. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 11:37, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

All the rest are links to advocacy sites by followers of the theory. So, we have a guy who has some nerdy sort of noteworthiness for being a comic author, and who has drawn some very limited media curiosity for coupling his comic authorship with his freak pseudo-geology beliefs.

My brief involvement in these subjects, so far, is no indication that I am a single-purpose editor and I intend to widen my involvement out of pure regard for the Wikepedia mission. I have studied the guidelines for conflict of interest and my edits and writings will show I have no POV intentions, rather only contribute to enhancing the scope of Wikepidia content. I do not own "several advocacy" web sites as claimed above, rather only one.

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> (now <i>Neutral</i> as explained below). I tend to support articles about all pseudoscience for which there is any degree of N, either scientific or popular. In this case there appears to be none whatsoever. Every single one of the references is a self-published or personal websites. There is not the least evidence that anyone else has ever paid the least attention to it even to debunk it. The EE Theory, though probably a thoroly disproven hypothesis, was at least promulgated by an actual scientist and has some actual references. A sentence about this one might be appropriate them, perhaps as an external link. It would not bother me the least if you wrote the entire article yourself as a single-purpose account, if only you had some source for any of it, and that others than yourself could be shown to have taken any notice of it. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 09:06, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Innocent Oversight</b>: I do not believe, DGG, that you intentionally ignore the two references to a Wired Magazine feature and the 2 hour interview by Art Bell on Coast to Coast Radio as indicatory of popular notability. I believe rather that this was an innocent oversight. I have since added another such third party unaffiliated reference, The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe Radio Podcast where the subject was also discussed in a lengthy interview. All this in addition the primary sources you and others have mentioned. Regarding your other concerns: I would truly not endeavor to create this article had this material not existed. Though I'm relatively new to Wikipedia editing, I'm familiar enough with the guidelines to understand that this subject fulfills them. I accept being frowned upon for a possible conflict of interest but I maintain that COI guidelines allow editors to walk this fine line as long as no POV or biased material is introduced to Wikipedia content. I believe the article shows that I've remained within these guidelines and have shown due notability to the theory. I would hope now that this is clarified, that you might rescind your objection and support keeping the article, based on your own comments and the above citations.

<li><b>Response:</b> The Wired article primarily deals with the theory. The radio show came as an aftermath of a previous one with host George Noory, (now also cited), both of which dealt with the theory. In between them came the Skeptics Podcast which is also about the theory. This shows a series of subsequent discussion and popular notability for the theory gaining momentum - the last of which was less than 3 months ago. Your original remarks were "...There is not the least evidence that anyone else has ever paid the least attention to it even to debunk it."... and "...if only you had some source for any of it, and that others than yourself could be shown to have taken any notice of it." I believe these requests have been met abundantly. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelNetzer_8517.html" title="User:MichaelNetzer">MichaelNetzer</a> 01:10, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and I want to say that crackpot scientific theories are not deletable on the basis of their crackpotiness, but rather on the basis of their notability. This looks notable. Tag the article for re-writing, make sure it's categorized as fringe science and/or pseudo-science, and keep it. No more problem. If there are edit wars, resolve them somewhere other than AfD.

<li><b>Why Move?</b> This is the name of the theory, by which it is known. "Growing Earth" appears clear and concise, not ambiguous. It states exactly what the theory imparts. I agree the article needs work, though I don't see POV. The reason for its present state is that it was moved as a section from another article.

<li><b>comment</b> The value of the sources is debatable. We are asked to judge the interview by other interviews. The relative merits of borderline theories is endlessly debatable. (My own person way of evaluating is to think of how much surprised i would be if the theory were true, and how much it would contradict very well established theories. Bigfoot would surprise me very much--on the ground of common sense, but it doesn't contradict biology--such a creature <b>could</b> have evolved. This one would both surprise me, and is contradicted by all theories of geophysics. But I am not a RS, and any view I have on the scientific validity is irrelevant. The question is whether this is N, either to established science, or the public. Impossible garbage which gets newspaper articles is N, and rightly so, because people will come here for information. In this situation I think the default might have to be keep, and I have changed my "vote" to neutral on the basis that reasonable people might disagree on the value of the sources--<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> why do people continue to debate the scientific validity of this article as a reason to decide one way or another on the deletion debate? Remember <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability, not truth, is the threshold for inclusion</a>, which is official policy. The extreme crackpotiness of this theory has no bearing on whether it should be kept or not. Notable loons will get articles about them and their theories. The article certainly needs re-writing so it presents itself as "famous crackpot guy claims.... blah blah blah" instead of presenting itself as "blah blah blah is true" but re-writing issues are not by themselves a reason to delete an article. They call for cleanup tags instead. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 03:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>While not wishing to diminish</b> from the gratitude for your support of keeping the article, I'd only like to say that the article itself does not claim the theory to be true, rather attributes its entire contents as being what the famous "crackpot" theorist claims, and says so at almost every turn. The text falls short of attesting any crackpotiness to the theory, or calling the author a crackpot, in order to maintain a neutral POV, as per Wikipedia guidelines.

<p>CCortex is a project to build 'the largest <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neural_network.html" title="Neural network">neural network</a> to date'. Unfortunately there is a lack of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to back up this grand claim. A google search turned up various press releases and mentions on technology websites, but nothing substantial. <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=CCortex+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=CCortex+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> Most notably, there does not seem to be any <i>recent</i> coverage of this project; most of it is from 2003 and it peters out by the end of 2005. Even the latest news on the company <a href="http://www.ad.com/default.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.ad.com/default.asp" rel="nofollow">website</a> has nothing newer than September 2005.

Whilst there are *just* about enough sources to cobble together an article, for example <a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/news/robot-03o.html" class="external text" title="http://www.spacedaily.com/news/robot-03o.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.hoise.com/primeur/04/articles/monthly/AE-PR-08-04-21.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hoise.com/primeur/04/articles/monthly/AE-PR-08-04-21.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.linuxelectrons.com/article.php/20040630204745326" class="external text" title="http://www.linuxelectrons.com/article.php/20040630204745326" rel="nofollow">here</a>, none of them strike me as being produced by organisations with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. More importantly, all these sources are from three or four years ago, meaning that any properly sourced article about CCortex will be forever stuck in a time warp. It's also worth noting that extraordinary claims require extraordinary sources; if this is a project to build the largest neural network to date, where's the media interest? <strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 12:00, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This is not a "bug list". This article seeks to give an overview over which parts of the specifications are supported by each browser and if not, say so and provide a source detailing the problem. This is not OR. Sources are provided for the most part, and if not, should be added. So instead of deleting the article, we should add sources and remove parts that are OR. --Grey 22:14, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It sure looks like a bug list to me - it's concerned with detailing non-compliance with a spec.

<li>Comparison of web browsers is a far more sensible article subject, because saying whether Internet Explorer is/was available for the Macintosh is an easily verifiable statement of fact. The same cannot be said for this page. The analogy is inappropriate - this is not a comparison, it is a bug list detailing non-compliance with CSS. The browser manufacturers do not state their support for each feature of CSS on their websites. Therefore each statement on this page (each grid cell is a statement), such as "text-transform is supported by Windows IE 4.0 and better" appears to be original research. As such it has no place on Wikipedia. If it is not original research it should be sourced to a reliable source. I do not see that there are any reliable sources for this information. Moreover, what content there is on the page does not correspond with available sources (but since the sources aren't given, it's unverifable). For instance, <a href="http://www.webdevout.net/browser_support_css.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.webdevout.net/browser_support_css.php" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> lists problems with many features listed here as "Y". Yet this page also lists bug with some features, yet it doesn't mention others. Doing this implies that the article is in someway authoritative, and bugs do not exist in other areas. This is wrong, and there are many other bugs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For me the thing that makes this article an obvious article to be deleted is that the third-party sources contradict each other. This is because detailing bugs (which is what this page is doing) is a difficult and time-consuming process. Looking at just the first two external links (which I assume the user is intended to reference to verify the information in the article), <a href="http://www.webdevout.net/browser-support-css" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.webdevout.net/browser-support-css" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/contents.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/contents.html" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> there are conflicts. The only way to resolve these conflicts would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> in actually testing the CSS support of the browsers. Since the sources conflict, and statements in this article cannot be consistently &amp; reliably sourced, the sources are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Accordingly, the article must be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> in its entirety, and should be deleted. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 00:28, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Let me first thank you for your detailed response. I will not contest the technical (software) points you have brought up as I admit to having limited knowledge in this area. I will also not contest your claim that the sources are not RS (they looked reliable to me, but again, my knowledge in this area is quite limited). I will, however, note that your conclusions do not necessarily follow from your premises.</li>

<ol>
<li>First, if the sources conflict (I'm not sure how, but I will take your word for it), they are not necessarily both unreliable sources. It could be that one is reliable and the other is not.</li>
<li>Second, if the sources conflict and this conflict is resolved in the article (i.e., one version is chosen over another), this need not be original research as the editor may simply have utilized one of the sources without knowledge of the other (this is working within informational constraints or limited research, not <i>original</i> research).</li>
<li>Third, even if an editor actually tested the CSS support of the browsers to resolve some conflicts (which would qualify as OR), this does not make the article in its entirey OR.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>However, to be more practically address the concerns of this AfD, let me ask this: can the OR, RS, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> issues be resolved? Is there really hopeless disagreement between multiple reliable sources (ignoring non-reliable sources)? If there is such hopeless disagreement, can the article be changed to reflect/discuss the areas where there is disagreement? If the answers to this are No, Yes, No with good reason, then I'll agree the article ought to be deleted. My "keep" comment was in response to your nomination that the article contained OR and lacked reliable sources as both of these problems are (usually) correctible, and also because the article is well-organized. If, however, the OR/RS issues cannot be resolved and portions of the article cannot be altered to reflect the existence of differing viewpoints in published sources, then I will support deletion. I know this is an awful lot to ask to be "convinced" to change my position, and I will completely understand if you choose not to go to all that trouble. However, in the end, my being convinced is not as important as determining whether the article is truly, inherently, and irreparably flawed, or whether it can be fixed/improved.

<li>An illiterate "Does anyone know what this plant is?" discussion on a web log is not a suitable source for an encyclopaedia article, especially given the admission right at the top that this name is wholly made up. The only thing useful on the web log is one poster giving a binomial name, from which we find that we already have an article on the genus <a href="../../../c/i/b/Cibotium.html" title="Cibotium">Cibotium</a>, and are awaiting a <i>proper</i> article on the species <a href="../../../c/i/b/Cibotium_cumingii.html" title="Cibotium cumingii">Cibotium cumingii</a> (named <i>C. taiwanense</i> by Kuo in 1985 but originally named <i>C. cuningii</i> by Kunze in 1841), for which <i>this</i> article is useless as a starting point, since it contains no verifiable content and doesn't even have the correct name. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:45, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>The majority decides</b>. Since I am the writer of this article I feel like apologizing twice: for the article and for the software. Concerning the software: It is indeed <i>a work of single person</i> but while <i>no information is given who (or whether) does use it</i> does not necessarily mean that it is not used. It is indeed used for quite a long within a university (where I am doing my research) and within the next months will be freely publicly available. I suppose that if notability is established by <i>evidence of coverage in independent third-party sources</i>, well yes this software is <i>not being used practically</i> and since <i>WP is not another Freshmeat and cannot cover every piece of software</i> you may proceed and <b>delete</b> it. Concerning the article: I wrote it after searching for similar articles (similar subject/audience/etc) and found plenty of them in a quite miserable state where in no case the <i>current text contains plenty of insightful of information</i>. My intentions were to be as polite as possible (I didn't want in no case to be accused of vandalism or advertisement) and I didn't want to include several pages just to make it seem important but in any case this article is not an <i>unmaintainable article</i>. However if this is what it looks, then you may once again proceed and <b>delete</b> it. In any case I do not intent adding info for the next few days, so if you like please feel free to <b>delete</b> it. <a href="../../../f/k/a/User%7EFkar_f2f1.html" title="User:Fkar">Fkar</a> 02:34, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't intended to be sarcastic or ironic or devaluating. Maintenance of this kind of articles is problematic because the information may get obsoleted at any moment and this is quite a demotivating for people to put their time here. During several years of my presence on Wikipedia I expanded one and only one article about a less known software (<a href="../../../m/e/t/Metakit.html" title="Metakit">Metakit</a>). <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 19:26, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not really someone who would proudly call himself a wikipedian (in fact this was my first contribution ever) as to be familiar with difficulties faced by hard workers trying to maintain stuff like this; therefore I totally <i>agree</i> with you. Speaking about <i>obsolete</i> and <i>maintenance</i> however, please keep in mind that this article was tagged for deletion within the first three weeks from its initial entry. <a href="../../../f/k/a/User%7EFkar_f2f1.html" title="User:Fkar">Fkar</a> 03:09, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I maintain that this article is simply a crystal ball for a future game.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Your assertion is misleading. One of the sources is an article about <i>Twilight Princess</i>, yes, but it includes a mention of the game in question, from back when the Wii was still the Revolution, and LONG before the Wii port of <i>TP</i> was planned. Crystal-balling would be saying that Nintendo’s next system after Wii will have a <i>Mario</i>, a <i>Zelda</i>, and a <i>Pokémon</i>. Of course it will, but nothing about that has been said by anyone from Nintendo. Something <i>has</i> been said about the next <i>Zelda</i> for Wii. Getting mnts is necessary, yes, but I don’t believe it is impossible, I am sure I saw it mentioned during a similar interview on Gamespot too, I think it is likely elsewhere, as well. And, for the record, I didn’t leave a reason on DRV because it says to submit Prod contestations in the format “[Pagename]] - ~~~~”. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidSmaht_d49d.html" title="User:WikidSmaht">WikidSmaht</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidSmaht_41da.html" title="User talk:WikidSmaht">talk</a>) 15:25, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - both sources do appear to be referencing a Wii game that is not Twilight Princess. However, I don't see why this game is deserving of an <i>encyclopedia</i> article just yet. Most gamers know that, at any given time, there is a Zelda game in development (and a Mario game, and Pokémon, and Metroid, etc). The game probably will be released, yes. The game is almost definitely in development, yes (based on the two sources provided, which are reliable). However, that's about it. It's a game that is in development and will be released sometime in the future. So, the question is- do highly-anticipated games (or books, movies, etc) that are definitely in development deserve a Wikipedia article? Should we have higher standards than <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Movie_Database_7ea7.html" title="Internet Movie Database">Internet Movie Database</a>? There is also the problem regarding the lack of multiple secondary non-trivial sources about the game itself, though there eventually will be, so this isn't as big of a problem that some might think. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 18:05, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete pending better references</b> WP:Crystal ball doesn't require you to to wait for an "official announcement" before making an article about a future product, but you do need to have information that comes from referenced, reliable independent non-trivial articles about the product. Unfortunately this article only has a couple of very minor looking references, both of which might not be reliable (one was in a "gossip" section, for example).

<li><b>Cleanup and references</b> I agree with what the nominator says, but don't draw the same conclusion. Can't respect WP:PORN as a legitimate criteria as it has not received widespread support, and BIO is a mess right now. It seems that with the notability assertion of the author there should be sufficient reference material to support an article per the primary notability criteria. I think that it should be tagged for references, NPOV, and cleanup. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 18:51, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - "She is popular for receiving well endowed men in her anus with considerable ease" is not a claim of notability. 500 thousand google hits are par for the course with any porn performer, they only serve to indicate the extent of spamming. It's also doubtful that any sources exist to substantiate the minute extent of actual biographical information presented in this poorly written stub. PORNBIO is at least a decent predictor of notoriety, if not notability, and this actress fails to satisfy PORNBIO criteria ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 08:33, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, per lack of any verification that the school actually exists. If someone can provide a reliable source though, I might change my mind. There may also be a larger issue here -- just because a subject is provably notable in one language (such as the Persian Wikipedia), does not necessarily mean that it is notable in all languages. Even if there are Farsi newspapers which confirm the school's existence, I would argue that if there's not a single English-language source on the school, that it is not reasonable to maintain an article about it in the English Wikipedia. Then again, a case could be made that it might be useful to maintain an English-language article strictly as a <i>translation</i> of a Farsi article. But ultimately, we're an encyclopedia, not a translation service. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">El</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html" title="User talk:Elonka">on</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elonka_1320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elonka">ka</a> 21:21, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't delete</b> - The reason the comic is unverified and non notable is because it is gone. I'm ceartin that there are other stories in this website that no longer exist in published form but the article still remains.

<li>I'm not convinced as to how much weight those sources carry, as I believe them to be paraphrasing press releases. If we were to trust them, then there should be articles on Wikipedia on a whole load of other websites out there (hated-celebrities.co.uk would be an example of a website that got national (multi-page) coverage in several newspapers, but doesn't get a mention on Wikipedia) -- <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatarsed_d93f.html" title="User:Ratarsed">Ratarsed</a> 08:46, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The sources do not qualify if they are "Media re-prints of press releases and advertising". However, from what I can tell, the articles are reviews rather than reprints of press releases. As for the example you note, <a href="http://www.hated-celebrities.co.uk" class="external free" title="http://www.hated-celebrities.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.hated-celebrities.co.uk</a>, I am not familiar with it or its coverage so I won't comment on its inclusion in WP. However, maybe it <i>should</i> have an article. Just as the presence of an article is not necessarily an indicator of notability, the lack of an article is also not necessarily an indicator non-notability.

<ul>
<li>As I eluded to, I'm not convinced that the mentions are not just the result of a press release arriving at a convenient time, or that a marketing budget bought some journo a nice lunch -- the sources more common in the media that I have experienced first hand are those from the Land Registry (government agency), the Halifax (and probably other building societies, but the Halifax sticks in my mind more), and very occasionally Rightmove (I believe they were featured on the Money Programme on the BBC a while back for their house price index. If home.co.uk was really notable, I would expect it to have been mentioned in the broadcast media more, yet it's never even got a mention in a BBC Online news story (Possibly because they just regard it as a meta site with none of its own original content)... Oh, and for the record, I don't think hated-celebrities is worth an article, as it folded without making any substantial impact on the world (short of a few alleged threats from lawyers and multi page spreads in the UK press). In short, I still think I'd need convincing that this article is worth keeping, personally. -- <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatarsed_d93f.html" title="User:Ratarsed">Ratarsed</a> 20:19, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Granted, and I'm not suggesting that hated-celebrities should be included (I know nothing about the site). However, when consider whether home.co.uk was/is "really notable", please keep in mind whether it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> rather than how popular it is. If the sources provided by Uncle G are not independent and reliable, then yes, the website isn't notable. However, I think there would have to be some proof that the mentions were "bought" for them to be disregarded as reprints of press releases.

<p>I'm not universally opposed to high school athletic leagues having articles, but this one asserts no notability, and I couldn't find anything on the web indicating it's unique, or particularly important.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: - A novel technology is not necessarily a notable one, and the granting of patents does not in itself bestow notability. The working draft of the guideline for <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28science%29_196b.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (science)">notability in science</a> says "Wikipedia does not usurp the usual validation processes of scientific institutions such as peer review, scientific consensus, and academic recognition." In the case of "Vibraimage", there is no indication that it has sustained such validation. Nor does "Vibraimage" appear to meet the criteria of <b>Textbook science</b>, <b>Widely cited</b>, <b>Institutional recognition</b>, <b>Prominent advocacy</b>, <b>Press and fiction</b>, <b>Popular belief</b>, or <b>Historical interest</b>. In fact, it's not clear whether "Vibraimage" has received any attention apart from that of its backers and creators. I find the subject of <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affective_computing.html" title="Affective computing">affective computing</a> fascinating, and I would like to read more about it in its many applications.

<dd>A Vibraimage is an image, whose each point reflects the parameters of the vibration (frequency or amplitude) of the points of object in space. Vibroimage is one of the primary specific images (visible light, infrared, X-ray) that informatively characterize the object.</dd>
<dd>Vibraimage records and analyzes vibrations, motor activity, and special features of the psycho-dynamics of a man, by algorithmic conversion of a normal video image into the new vibroimage mode, which informatively reflects the emotional and psychophysiological state of the man. Vibroimage unites contemporary technical achievements with fundamental knowledge in medicine and psychology, and makes real the remote and non-contact automatic determination of the emotional state of the man.</dd>
<dd>The parameters of Vibraimage are also primary and informatively characterize the man as the parameters EEG, KGR or EKG.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(1) "References to great scientists (Aristotle, Darwin, Lorenz, Freud, Ekman) that did not use the term vibraimage". Sure, the vibraimage is a novel term. But it reflects the movement and vibration of body, and all previous science conclusions about body activity are visualized by vibraimage. There are classical works like Darwin "The Expression of the emotions in man and animals" and Lorenz "On Aggression" which described the movement of animals and humans. In vibraimage processing we realized the algorithms suggested by Lorenz, who said that "frequency of movement is proportional to aggression level". Why we could not give the link to Lorenz, if we do it in vibraimage processing? It would be incorrect and I think that links for great scientists, that could not measure movement activity by technics, but analyzed the process in the mind is one of the goals for any encyclopedic science article.</dd>
<dd>(2) "Advertising and not an encyclopedic article". Look strange that primary image could be advertising. Elsys does not claim the vibraimage, we only discovered it. Furthermore, I am sure that if Darwin or Lorenz had web cameras, they discovered vibraimage several hundreds years ago. Also it concerns the great Russian scientist Ivan Sechenov, who wrote in 1853 that “every mind has muscular realization”. The great Brazil psychologist Mira y Lopez suggested in 1950 the theory of miokinetic diagnostics, which also very near to vibraimage, but Mira y Lopez had not web camera and computer for calculations and did manual processing, what is very difficult. So, I think that it is advertising only for science and great past scientists. Vibraimage is only technical realization of great past scientist ideas begins from Aristotle. Also, is very interesting that the word emotion means output of motion, see etymology of <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emotion.html" title="Emotion">emotions</a>. So, I prefer to add more links in this article, but it conflicts with (1)</dd>
<dd>(3) "Hoax". Every could see the vibraimage if you have a low noise web camera and software accumulated frames difference.</dd>
<dd>(4) "Not notable". I do not think that technology that try to do contactless and remote emotion control could be "not notable". Vibraimage analyzes the movement activity, it is the difficult task, because the movements and vibrations are little (microns). Emotion recognition needs to divide psychic and physiological processes, but it is not easy tasks. For example EEG (brain activity) processing exists more than 70 years, but there are many novel methods and ideas for EEG processing. 15 years ago I wrote about biometric passports and a little of people believe in it. Emotion recognition is more difficult than person recognition, but both are real. Elsys concentrates on terrorist detection, but vibraimage must be more open and used in normal life. Everyone could process vibraimage, receive more info about himself and this is one of ideas of wikipedia, to do the science more popular.</dd>
<dd>(5) "Short russian page". VibraImage is widely presents in russian, there are several articles and science reports (more than 1000 pages) in russian language. So I do not think that it is so necessary to have a big vibraimage russian page in wikipedia. The situation in English is the other. I think that vibraimage page could be interesting for readers and thanks for every person discussed this page.</dd>

<dd><b>Reply:</b> 1.) I restored the mention of <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konrad_Lorenz_9562.html" title="Konrad Lorenz">Konrad Lorenz</a>. I didn't restore the reference, because the principal question here is not whether aggression correlates to movement or whether Lorenz observed such a thing, but whether there has been any independent review of "Vibraimage". 2.) Until the thory that vibrations in a digital image correlate to emotional states has sustained peer review, it would be irresponsible (and more importantly, against policy) for Wikipedia to describe it as a "discovery". 3.) The {{<a href="../../../h/o/a/Template%7EHoax_4655.html" title="Template:Hoax">hoax</a>}} tag was a comment on the article, and not a judgment on "Vibraimage" itself. Wikipedia is not in the business of verifying theories either positively or negatively. 4.) I agree that there is great potential in the claims of "Vibraimage". But unverified potential does not confer notability. 5.) Perhaps <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature_%28magazine%29.html" title="Nature (magazine)">Nature</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology_Today_d2c2.html" title="Psychology Today">Psychology Today</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired.html" title="Wired">Wired</a></i> are missing the boat by not publishing articles on "Vibraimage". But it's not the place of Wikipedia to compensate for that. Until there are articles published in the English-language press, there is scant basis to establish notability or to verify anything which could be said about "Vibraimage". -- <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShunpiker_0ed5.html" title="User:Shunpiker">Shunpiker</a> 14:53, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> There is no conflict of interest because vibraimage is not patentable and does not belong to anybody. Firstly vibraimage page has historical links and science explanation, the links to Elsys site and other info about Elsys were done by other users and were taken from open sources. This was done according to Wikipedia policy, but I also do not see reasons for mention Elsys name on this page. For my mind the first reduction of vibraimage page with historical links to Aristotle, Darwin, Lorenz, Ekman and energy emotion model explanation was more right and correct than the last version.

<p>This article unnecessarily publicizes embarrassing events in the life of an otherwise unknown living individual. As noted in the article itself, the Internet publicity given to these events has seriously damaged this person's life and we should not knowingly participate in further doing so. The page, although created and edited in good faith, is the functional equivalent of an attack page against a non-notable person.

<li><b>Keep</b> - the separate sources from the Daily Mail, BBC News and Times Online constitute multiple non-trivial coverage in third-party independent sources per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Therefore, this individual is notable. I don't see how this could be construed as an attack page either; it's not the role of Wikipedia to make subjective judgments about what might have "seriously damaged a person's life" or whether events are "embarrassing". This article is an accurate and factual report, containing no libel, and is sourced to third-party reliable media sources. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 19:27, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete:</b> sure it is sourced and neutral and ticks all our internal boxes. But, Wikipedia is now the largest reference work in the world, one of the top-ten websites and developing into a thoroughly powerful resource. With great power comes great responsibility - we can add to human misery - or benefit human knowledge. Once thing OTRS teaches me, is to remember that there is a real world out there - and we can hurt real people. Some of them just unfortunate non-entities. Ticking internal boxes isn't enough - we need to rise above that and look at the big picture. We don't need this cruft. We don't need to add to this chap's pain. If we delete a thousand articles like it, we'll be no weaker. Does humanity benefit by us taking charitable donations and using them to host sub-tabloid tittle-tattle? No. Let's rise above WP:ABC and WP:XYZ and all our little house rules and set our sights on being great. Does this article further that, even a little?--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 19:50, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> - Wanting to "set our sights on being great" is not a justification for ignoring policy. The "little house rules" are, presumably, there for a reason - so they should apply equally to everyone and every article. There is no policy which says "Wikipedia has a social responsibility to do good for the world". It's a neutral encyclopedia that reports verifiable fact - that's what NPOV is all about. And as for calling it "sub-tabloid tittle-tattle" and "cruft", isn't that a classic example of <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>? <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">Notability is not based on Wikipedia editors' subjective judgements.</a> I just don't see which policy you're referring to in arguing for deletion. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 20:57, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly, I'm not pointing to any policy, I'm putting common-sense and basic humanity over the alphabet soup. Just because something is verifiable, doesn't mean we <i>have</i> to have it. I mean when we've no article on Apollonius The Athenian or the Argentine Basin - will we collapse without this? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 21:20, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>It sounds like you're implicitly invoking <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> in this case, which is fair enough (as it is, technically, a policy) but I'm not comfortable with it. Either that, or you're arguing that Wikipedia's notability policies themselves are wrong and should be changed; which is also fair enough, but the whole point of having rules is that they apply equally to <i>every</i> editor and <i>every</i> article. Please don't ignore the clear policy. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 19:01, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: <i>All subjects of Wikipedia articles should meet the central notability criterion for inclusion, summarized here: The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works the source of which is independent of the person.</i> This clearly applies in this case.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is most certainly NOT an attack page. It is simply a record of a notable individual who has been involved in several events all of which have been reported by several manjor and respected news companies. Whether or not this article is embarassing to the mentioned individual or not is not the issue. It is not Wikipedia's job to ensure all articles project a favourable image of the subject. This like most other pages is an accurate and truthful account of a notable individual's activities in the public spotlight. Wikipedia is going in completely the wrong direction if we as Wikipedia users are expected to suppress the truth just because there may be a chance that it may embarass or offend someone. Wikiepdia has been and will always be a vehicle of the truth. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephLondon_5b80.html" title="User:JosephLondon">JosephLondon</a> 21:19, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the only reason this guy could be seen as notable is because of the blog. It looks like the news items are about the blog. Thus, the guy is not notable, the blog is. We're just contributing to human suffering, not the sum of knowledge, with this one. I could see there being an acceptable article on the blog, hopefully with the guy's full name redacted. The blog is based on actions that the guy has never been convicted of, and is essentially an attack site. We shouldn't blithely repeat the blogger's possible libel. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 21:22, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> - That's not the case. The news articles are not just about the blog (e.g. Daily Mail). This is a notable person, a search on Google or indeed any other search engine will produce copious results.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Looking at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, the (disputed) criteria is <i>"[...] has been a <b>primary subject</b> of multiple [...]"</i> (emphasis mine). Of the four sources I could read, only one of them has him as the focus; the other three focus on the alleged victim. Not only that, there's no reliable source saying he's actually the one who sold the laptop; he could be a innocent bystander (for instance, if he had sold the laptop to someone else, who then resold it to the alleged victim). I also find it interesting that all the sources are from around the same time (30-31 May 2006); this strongly suggests both merely had their <a href="../../../1/5/_/15_minutes_of_fame.html" title="15 minutes of fame">15 minutes of fame</a>, and nobody will care much 100 years from now. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 21:36, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Keep</b>.</s> Tough case considering that it is reasonably current and a living person.

<li><b>Delete</b> - the incident <i>may</i> be notable - though this seems more suited to Wikinews than here as a fairly minor news event - the people involved are not, and most certainly not judging by the sources cited.

<li><b>Delete</b> Per Newyorkbrad, Doc G and Makemi plus common sense and basic decency. Absolutely trivial except to the parties concerned. As Cesarb says, this is "fifteen minutes of fame" stuff.

<li><b>Keep</b> While the circumstances are embarrassing, they are of note and we can not be revisionist historians and simply erase the facts of an event due to how the still living subjects feel about it.

<li><b>Comment</b> Are we really supposed to preserve page-filler like this for posterity just because it made a brief appearance in the tabloids on a slow news day? Does this mean we can now scour the newspaper archives from, say, the 1970s looking to resurrect long-dead disputes among non-notable people which caused a momentary media buzz, e.g. an argument over a garden fence which escalated with "hilarious" consequences. This kind of thing is meant to be forgotten - the media have their "fun" then they move on, leaving the subjects of their attention to go back into obscurity and repair their lives. But now it's apparently the duty of an online encyclopaedia to immortalise such storms in a teacup so some poor guy can be humiliated for the rest of his natural.

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's hard to criticize an organization that isn't on the radar. I think most groups who oppose it simply feel that by criticizing the group they lend it credibility. That's a thought, not a fact. So no, adding a "criticisms section" doesn't resolve the soapbox issue. Removing statements about what the group is for does that. The article should be about who the group is (no mention of its leadership or members is made) and what the group has done or trying to do. It should not be a platform to discuss issues that are described in other articles. The article is more of another forum for the group to make its political points and violates <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> by attempting to couch the neutrality of the article as its actions.

<li><b>Delete.</b> This is bogus. It <i>looks</i> like a well-sourced article, but all the links (with one minor exception) don't pan out. Most are to a variety of PR or self-publish sites. Another is a news service associated with Columbia University, which I assume is place for students to practice their chops; it's better than a high-school paper but not the same as a real commercial news source. The sole neutral third-party source is medicalnewstoday.com, whatever that is. That's <i>one</i> obscure source. The "comments by legislators" are essentially form letters: <i>"Please be assured that I will keep your views in mind should the Senate consider this issue in the future."</i> == <i>"yeah yeah yeah whatever"</i>. I've got to hand it to User:Mgmbill. He'll make a fine editor if he wants to be. Here, he's done an outstanding job of making what <i>looks</i> like a well-sourced Wikipedia article on a notable subject, but in fact is a <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potemkin_village.html" title="Potemkin village">Potemkin village</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Noah is a rather accomplished journalist, having worked for a number of major publications. However, the lack of sources is a problem that needs to be addressed. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 21:53, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> In the above-linked article, he makes a rather good case for his own non-notability (i.e., fails the primary guideline.) However, I abstain as I don't have time to research and verify that this is so. GassyGuy 22:00, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I think <i>Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work.</i> should apply, even though seems most of his reviews are blogbased - and they usually don't agree with what he wrote. I did find a non-blog though by <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=14968" class="external text" title="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=14968" rel="nofollow">Stephen Schwartz, an author and journalist, the author of The Two Faces of Islam: The House of Sa'ud from Tradition to Terror</a>.

<li><b>Response</b> The article <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Schwartz_%28journalist%29_8ef7.html" title="Stephen Schwartz (journalist)">Stephen Schwartz (journalist)</a> will give a bit of background on the political background of the reviewer. My view here is that if people feel strong enaugh to write an article about someone they oppose/don't like/disagree with - it has more clout than 100s of <i>I write nice about you when you write nice about me</i>. Anyway the magazine seems to get used a lot as reference to various statements of a number of journalists.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I hate to use the old argument of "way less notable articles are on wikipedia so this one should be kept" but it is valid in this case. Noah is a notable person with quite a few references. He writes for a varitey of sources and he has established himself in socitey. His personal thoughts and articles about Wikipedia should not even be in this discussion other than to point out his notability. The question of references has been addressed at this point so without a doubt his article should be kept.

These articles are merely lists of names belonging to a particular language or culture (i.e. a word list) with no prose or explanatory text or encyclopedic purpose. Wikipedia is not a dictionary. This is the kind of thing that Wiktionary is made for, and so they have been transwikied to Wiktionary and may now be deleted. There is strong precedent for this kind of deletion; recently, all lists of given names have been moved to Wiktionary and deleted. These are some of the remaining surname lists on Wikipedia.</p>

<li><b>Delete all <s>2 deletes, 1 conditional delete, 1 (temporary) keep</s></b>. Delete the Arora and Swedish lists now. Delete the Korean list after it has been transwikied (I couldn't find it in Wiktionary; would you please provide the link if it is already there?). I suggest nominating the Polish list separately as it has additional encyclopedic information (geographic distribution). I think a transwiki-delete might still be appropriate, but I think there ought to be some discussion of whether the information could potentially be used in the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_name.html" title="Polish name">Polish name</a> article or the individual surname articles (i.e., a selective merge). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:04, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't see the the geographic breakdown as any different than a series of "list of surnames in Greater Poland," "list of surnames in Silesia," etc. And it seems like every time I nominate just one list, someone remarks that I should have done a batch nomination. No one is ever pleased.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 21:36, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do not recall participating in the AfDs of those two articles, so I cannot comment. I actually prefer bundled nominations in these cases, but I thought the Polish list could potentially be useful for whomever is working on the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_name.html" title="Polish name">Polish name</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/w/Nowak.html" title="Nowak">Nowak</a> articles, and that's why I suggested a temporary keep. However, after checking the source at the bottom, I think it's easier to work with that, so this list becomes unnecessary. I have changed to "delete all". <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:06, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

All sorts of fringe candidates file papers but it doesn't make them Wikipedia material.

Not blanket coverage like Obama, but it still goes to create notability. Perhaps the article simply needs to take the dozens of article links on the Website and link them directly, thus veryfying these articles really exist (for example, <a href="http://www.iowapolitics.com/index.iml?Article=89604" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iowapolitics.com/index.iml?Article=89604" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>. And Kucinich, be he an elected Congressman or an elected dog cather, has zero chance of winning the Dem. nomination, and is a perpetual loser by your own definition. He has no business listed with other candidates if this is the standard you're setting, although I realize we're actually discussing a more drastic measure - deletion of an article - and not just unlisting him, which is much more draconian. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 15:50, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

As compared to Cox whose own article indicates has never won a primary, let alone a local election, let alone a national election. If it gets you all riled up that I called Cox a "perpetually losing candidate" then fine, I withdraw the observation.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I did a google news search for <i>"John cox" president republican</i> (I figure that was a pretty good way of weeding out the billion other john coxes in the world) and got 11 unique google hits, almost all of which mentioned him in passing, at least one of which didn't mention him at all, and most of which were local to Chicago (where he's from) or Iowa (the one place he's really campaigned). So we've got no real info from these sources other than that he's a "long-shot" (duh), and we seem to have nothing from any news source of national renown, which is odd for someone running for president of the nation. That's what I found on the internet, anyway. I'm not going to vote on this yet. If he really is only one of a handful of people to have filed the appropriate papers for running, then he might be worth keeping just for that, but if this turns out to be like the California recall election, in which everyone and his mother field the paperwork and gave it a shot, then he's probably deleteable. I guess the question is, what stops anyone from running? If there were a couple hundred yahoos wanting to take a shot at the governorship of California with no real chance of winning, I can't see why there wouldn't be 100 times more taking a no-chance run for the presidency, just so they can say "hey, I'm running for President!" What has set this guy apart? In any case, I think he should probably be removed from the 2008 election template for now. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:51, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Okay, just saw Nhprman's link, and that does seem to be a legitimate national story that is actually about the candidate (I didn't see any evidence it was front page, but I could have missed that, also not sure why googlenews didn't display this). However that aricle says "As of early September, 75 people had filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission declaring their intention to run for president," which seems to make Mr. Cox 1 out of 75 rather than 1 out of 10 or so (and since September that 75 has probably increased dramatically). Is there any reason why this guy is more encyclopedic than any of those other folks? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:03, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Beacuse he's actually campaigning, and not pretending to campaign? Because he's amassed dozens of news articles, making him, um, notable? Because he's included on nearly every list among those top 20 (check a Technorati search next time.) As for "long shot," Duncan Hunter, Mike Hucakbee, Tom Tancredo and even Sam Brownback are all often labeled as "long shots," and they are all elected officials, or formerly office-holders. What's the point bringing that up? This MUST NOT be about politics.

<li>The reason I mentioned "long shot" is because of all the mentions I could find of him from news sources (not many) that was the <i>only</i> description of him I got. Basically <i>no other words</i> were said about him, other than his name. I realize that being a long shot does not mean he should be excluded (or else we wouldn't list anyone except Obama, Clinton, McCain, Guilliani, and perhaps about 3 others at this stage); I'm not arguing that. My question is, if this guy's <i>only</i> legitimate claim to fame is that he's running for President (unlike everyone else mentioned, who already have articles based on other accomplishments) why is he different from the 75 (now probably more like a few hundred) others? Is it because he's actively campaigning? Perhaps that is the main distiction. I'm not arguing against it, I'm just asking questions here. Are all those other's not campaigning? Do we know that? Does he have "dozens" of news articles about him, as you stated? I've seen one. Sure, I've seen his name mentioned with others, but just as a name on a list, no real info. I'm also cusious as to why he's listed more than these 75 others. Any chance it's an example of his name getting picked up haphazardly by one source, and then repeated by others? I really don't know, but there does seem to be a dearth of information about Mr. Cox that's not from his campaign. That's my main concern. And before you jump down my throat about this, keep in mind I haven't voted to delete the article, and I'm leaning towards keep right now; I just think this matter deserves a certain amount of scrutiny. I guess it boils down to two questions: 1. if this guy is not any more of a serious candidate than a hundred other folks, why is his name being mentioned substantially more than the rest? and 2. if he is a legitimate candidate, why don't we have any real information on him from reliable, neutral sources, with the exception of a single LA Times article? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 06:40, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is a tough crowd when an LA Times article isn't considered notable enough, but I see your point. You can find many articles about this guy on his MEDIA page (note: these are not "press releases" - that's a mischaracterization someone is making.) The fact that one article is linked from the article means it's a poorly done article, not a poor or unknown, non-notable candidate, and that alone shouldn't doom him. Yet, because it has few links, the candidate is being judged by it. Suffice it to say, he <i>seems</i> less trivial than the 75 others, but less known, obviously, than the top or 2nd teir of the GOP candidates. That may change. Let's wait, not rush to delete everyone we don't like being on WP, as some are suggesting. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 05:47, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Should the hundreds of people whose vanity pages we delete every week all be allowed to stay if they announce their candidacy?

<li>Well, Whacky McDoodle hasn't campaigned relentlessly in each of the three early primary/caucus states, and doesn't have DOZENS of news articles to his (fictional) name, as Cox does. In short, Cox apparently has not created a "vanity page" and your assessment seems dead wrong. This doesn't mean I'm saying he's going to win - let me stress that. That's utterly beside the point. This means he is NOTABLE, that he is being COVERED, that he is CAMPAIGNING in some place other than in his own mind, unlike the many, many of those you note, correctly, whom have simply filed papers. I would note the difference between a "guideline" and a "policy" (notability is the former) and the *huge* caveat in the header of the Notability page saying that it is not "in stone" and its meaning is in dispute. That little fact is frequently ignored by over-eager editors who apply this as some kind of strict, clearly-defined <i>Policy</i>. Rubbish. But even so, Cox fulfills the criteria, if only we would stop trying to zealously stamp out those we believe to be undeserving pretenders.

So far there has been one source of any substance added to the article and none of the information in the article is actually attributed to that source. The article is sourced entirely by the candidate's web page and self-generated press releases. I have no idea why you've tried repeatedly to make this about politics. I know next to nothing about the politics of this gentleman (which frankly is another failing of the article) and my nomination is based entirely on policy and guidelines. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 13:23, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You've repeatedly made this about whether someone is viable or not, or whether they are "a loser" or a "long shot" or how much money they have <i>does</i> make it about politics, rather than policy. These are very subjective standards and have no business in this discussion. As noted below, a person can be notable for losing often (<a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Stassen_6238.html" title="Harold Stassen">Stassen</a>) and this man was a radio talk show host in Chicago. Notability right there. That this is a poor article is conceded. But can you point to a <i>perfect</i> article here, or are they ALL subject to deletion, since even stubs can be improved? Deletion is not the answer, improvement is. Let's spend our energy as editors improving, not running around deleting articles. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 05:47, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Um, actually, no I have not made this about whether someone is a viable candidate or not, despite your insistence on dragging in other cnadidates with no chance of winning as if they were in some way relevant to the discussion. I nominated the article because at the time it was nominated <i>it was sourced by the candidate's website and by a press release</i>. You got all hung up on the "perrenially losing candidate" phrase and completely ignored the fact that the article did not meet Wikipedia policies and guidelines. You're the one making this about political viability, not me. And as for your suggestion that I point to a "perfect article," I am not required to and the suggestion is ridiculous and has nothing to do with the article under discussion. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:32, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The bottom line is that this article needs improvements and an expansion. It's clear at this point that this is the consensus, and an outright deletion never made any sense here. I'll let the record stand on your numerous characterizations of the candidate's viability (i.e. comparing the candidate to a fictional "Whacky McDoodle of Fumblebuck Montana") as if that had anything to do with the article at hand here, either. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 19:06, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The "/" seems to imply a "sub-page" which do not exist in the article space. But anyway, many off the less minor candidates have been deleted (Eric Minamyer, Tom Bemmes, Peter Fosset, Jeff Sinnard, etc.) so it would stand to reason that those guys who ran for the House 3 years ago and got even fewer votes should be too. These are guys who got a handful of votes in the primaries (sometimes in the double digits). Certainly not-notable. <a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:04, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This looks too much like an advertisement for the World for World Organization. The page is primarily geared towards providing contact information for the organization. A Google search on the organization's name produced nothing except promotional material for the organization and announcements of events hosted by the organization. No independent parties have written about this organization, which indicates that the organization is non-notable. This article looks unsalvageable, so I advocate deletion. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 23:15, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>These articles cite no source other than TV.com. The information from that site comes from a single person there, who has a "source" at Nickelodeon, whose identity he does no reveal. This is entirely unverifiable. Furthermore, the issue has been raised before with a delete consensus. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Crossroads_of_Destiny_34fb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Crossroads of Destiny">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Crossroads of Destiny</a>, where the article was only recreated after confomation from more relible sources. I also feel obliged to point out that, in the past, several articles in this situation received <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> deletion based on the Crossroad's AfD , however, the tags I placed on these were removed by <a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">User:Pgk</a>, and I decided taking it here would be more fruitful than arguing the issue . --<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../f/y/r/User_talk%7EFyre2387_93d0.html" title="User talk:Fyre2387">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fyre2387_382c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fyre2387">contribs</a>)</sup> 23:22, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hmm, apparently the source has turned out reliable in the past (given that an episode was deleted and then recreated when it was confirmed..),so I'm not sure I understand the deletion reason. We may not have access to all of the sources, but it being reported somewhere is still verifiable information. Even if the episode title were changed, I could see including the information in the retitled article. I do wish you'd waited for a response from the page's creator though. I see you messaged them about this AfD, but you could have talked first instead of going to an AfD anyway. Then if you'd convinced them, they could have nominated it for speed deletion instead. BTW, I don't consider the prior discussion to be precedent, participation in it was minimal. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:52, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. These articles don't compare well in quality to the two main articles, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Avatar%7E_The_Last_Airbender_dca9.html" title="Avatar: The Last Airbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/List_of_Avatar%7E_The_Last_Airbender_episodes_fc5e.html" title="List of Avatar: The Last Airbender episodes">List of Avatar: The Last Airbender episodes</a>. The articles for the individual episodes that have actually appeared are also very well done. Those listed in this AfD have practically no information and no reliable sources anyway. I don't see the point of merging because there is nothing here but a title and an episode number. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 03:29, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
