<li><b>Delete</b>, I nominated this article for deletion for the second time because as I started reading the first nomination, a "no consensus" conclusion was made and the article was removed from nomination before I got the chance to voice my argument. Here is the reason again (sorry if this is redundant, but I'm not sure where is the proper place to put this note):</li>
</ul>
<p>This article represents the Shia point of view which sharply contradicts with the foundation of the faith of the mainstream (Sunni) Islam. Worldwide Sunni Muslims (comprising 90% of world Muslims) believe that this list is nothing but a fabrication by the Shia sect. This is not new; this has been going on for centuries. This online encyclopedia is NOT the proper place for those kinds of extremely controversial issues, especially when they represent points of views of a minor sect (Shia) of the global religion of Islam. Of course the Shia scholars will continue to claim that their views and deviant beliefs are supported by Sunni references and sources. However, all they have been doing over centuries is misinterpreting those references, taking them out of context and twisting them to support their views. They've had a historical enmity towards the 3 rightly-guided Caliphs of Islam which are revered by over 1.2 Billions Sunni Muslims and have been revered for the past 14 centuries, while Sunnis never carry any sort of enmity towards the sacred figures revered by the Shia such as Ali ibn Abi Talib or Fatimah. There is not one single Sunni Muslim or Sunni scholar that will accept the Shia interpretations of the references otherwise, if they do, then over a Billion Sunni Muslim will convert happily into Shia. Therefore, further attempts to quote the so called Sunni sources to support those Shia views should be discredited and not to be accepted a valid argument in any way. According to Sunni Islam, this list does not even exist. Ali, Fatimah and all those Sahaba enlisted in this list have given their full allegiance to Abu Bakr and to believe that they were at odds with him is totally absurd. Again WIKIPEDIA is NOT the proper place for those minority views.TrueWisdom1TrueWisdom1</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, merge what is salvagable into Shi'a view of Abu Bakr. most of it is a "list of sahaba not giving bay'ah" <i>according to</i> shi'ites. others (i.e. the rest) in the list are redundant, as they only briefly opposed then subsequently offered their <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay%27ah.html" title="Bay'ah">bay'ah</a>, making their inclusion in the list pointless. furthermore, the some of the sources used are extremely poor: a fundamental source is the comical "<a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshawar_Nights_8a8d.html" title="Peshawar Nights">Peshawar Nights</a>", which narrates of a so-called "Sunni-Shi'a" discussion (which some believe simply did not happen and was frankly made up - the Sunni character clearly doesn't know his stuff), and is used nowadays solely as a polemical device. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 13:56, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Do you regard those scholars as Shi'a scholars? If not, why are you suggesting that their information is of Shi'a origin, and more importantly, why does it belong in an article about the Shi'a view of a single person? Further your argument of <i>"as they only briefly opposed then subsequently offered their <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay%27ah.html" title="Bay'ah">bay'ah</a>"</i> is an <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> argument, since nobody has nowhere stated that this is a list of person that opposed him <i>indefinitely</i> but in fact, the article clearly says <i>"was <b>initially</b> opposed"</i> --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 15:47, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Bukhari/Muslim/Tabari are narrating hadiths, not their opinions, so the material becomes a primary source, which is something which generally shouldn't be utilized. Ibn Qutaybah/Ibn Abi al-Hadid may too be narrating hadiths (seems unlikely in the latter case)- however, their attributions have seemingly been obtained from media less than reliable -- one being a wordpress ppt presentation, the other a Shi'a website. what is really needed is independant verification. Gibbon is one i overlooked, yet he has only been provided in verifying the existence of the dispute, and not for verifying the individuals in the list. this is why i suggested that whatever can be salvaged should be merged into the proposed article or in <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a> which can then give it an appropriate overview.</dd>
<dd>if the opposition was temporary, 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months even, then what's the point of making a list about a period of time as brief as this, apart from forwarding a particular view about this general dispute? thanks. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 21:30, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tabari is admittedly only narrating hadith, he stated that in his introduction of the book and thus is his book only a primary Source. But we all know as a fact that the same kind of thing can not be said about Muhammad al-Bukhari and Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj: both are celebrated by Sunnis for the great achievement of only including reliable narrations in their <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_Sahihs_5c0d.html" title="Two Sahihs">two Sahihs</a>, thus is their work not only an extremely reliable secondary source of early Sunni scholarship, the sunni even praise <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Bukhari_0b24.html" title="Sahih Bukhari">Sahih Bukhari</a> as the "most Sahih Book after the Qur'an" <a href="http://www.ummah.net/Al_adaab/hadith/bukhari/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ummah.net/Al_adaab/hadith/bukhari/index.html" rel="nofollow">ummah.net</a>, <a href="http://www.islamonline.com/cgi-bin/news_service/profile_story.asp?service_id=838" class="external text" title="http://www.islamonline.com/cgi-bin/news_service/profile_story.asp?service_id=838" rel="nofollow">islamonline.com</a>, <a href="http://www.sunnah.org/history/Scholars/imam_bukhari.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sunnah.org/history/Scholars/imam_bukhari.htm" rel="nofollow">sunnah.org</a>, <a href="http://yarehman.bizbrowse.com/islam/Mazameen/Personalities-English/Imam-Bukhari.htm" class="external text" title="http://yarehman.bizbrowse.com/islam/Mazameen/Personalities-English/Imam-Bukhari.htm" rel="nofollow">yarehman.com</a>, <a href="http://www.inter-islam.org/A-Z/B/B.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.inter-islam.org/A-Z/B/B.htm" rel="nofollow">inter-islam.org</a>, <a href="http://fatwa-online.com/classicalbooks/hadeeth/0000101.htm" class="external text" title="http://fatwa-online.com/classicalbooks/hadeeth/0000101.htm" rel="nofollow">fatwa-online.com</a>. This is enough to end the disccusion regarding if this is only a Shia view or not, and considering the Bukhari/Muslim narrations, it is only expected that you find other non-Shi'a like Ibn Qutaybah/Ibn Abi al-Hadid narrating hadith to the same effect.</dd>

<dd>It is true that i found the Ibn Qutaybah in a non-Muslim teaching course, and considering that i also have two independent Shi'a sources give the same quote, but with small variations in translation, you either have a Shi'a/Shi'a/non-Muslim conspiracy to misquote Ibn Qutaybah, or he did in fact narrate that hadith. The same can be said by Ibn Abi al-Hadid the non-Shi'a non-Sunni <a href="../../../m/u/27/Mu%27tazili.html" title="Mu'tazili">Mu'tazili</a> scholar who is widely known for quoting narrations that Sunnis agree are Sahih but do not feel comfortable being reminded of. Again, this is an editorial issue, add a request for a better tag if you wish, the Bukhari/Muslim quote is enough to refute the nomination arguments.</dd>

<dd>Gibbon verified that the Banu Hashim "and their chief", ie, Ali, did not give the oath: <i>"the Hashemites alone <b>declined the oath</b> of fidelity; and their chief, in his own house, maintained, <b>above six months</b>, a sullen and independent reserve; without listening to the threats of Omar"</i>. If nothing else, this is a secondary source of the Bukhari/Muslim secondary sources, voiding all allegations of this being a Shi'a only view. Gibbon is the second non-Shi'a non-Sunni holding this view, together with Ibn Abi al-Hadid.</dd>

The fact that there was a large amount of Sahaba that just like Ali did not initially give his oath is uncontested and readily admitted among the early Sunni historians, the practice of trying to deny this is a more modern phenomena that is at strikingly odds with all the early historians, including Bukhari/Muslim.</dd>

This event is notable enough to warrant a full and detailed article, something that can not be given justice to as a section in an already large article: going into such great detail in the <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a> would spark even stronger felings and revert wars than if given it's own article, so given multpiple arguments, i strongly oppose merging this to <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a> or an Shi'a view article.</dd>

<dd>well, the reason we don't use primary sources is not because we doubt their authenticity, but because we're not in a position to intepret them. sometimes you can use primary sources when there are extremely explicit, but with most hadith there are too many ambiguities. the hadith cited in the article make little mention of duration (from my observation), it's difficult to tell whether the witholding spans a few days or a few months (apart from Ali). there may also be other sound narrations reporting slightly differently on the assumed chronology, events, and details. that's why we use secondary sources. did <i>all</i> personalities mentioned resist for six months? nobody is denying that a pledge may have been temporarily withheld, but for how long? and what is its encyclopedic relevence, if the problems of verification are overlooked (if the problematic sources were removed, then much of the article would also thus be removed)?</dd>
<dd>i don't think anyone finds such information "uncomfortable", it's simply about what is factually accurate. who, and when, are questions that this article doesn't seem to answer convincingly. that's why i think this stuff can be comprehensively overviewed in two paragraphs of prose in one of the other articles. as it stands, the article consists mainly of a list of names, and some blockquotes from certain personalities. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 00:19, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No one among you should have the misconception that the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr took place suddenly. No doubt, the oath was pledged in this way, but the Almighty protected the Muslims from its evil consequences [which might have arisen] and remember! there is none among you like Abu Bakr, whose greatness cannot be surpassed. Now if a person pledges an oath of allegiance to someone, without the opinion of the believers, no one should pledge allegiance to him as well as to whom he [himself] pledged allegiance because by this both of them shall present themselves for execution. (Bukhari: No. 6830)</p>

<p>Sorry for the late answer, i have been doing other things IRL. Some anon is adding strongly pov material, so if you are looking at the article, make sure you are not looking at some pov version.</p>
<p>ITAQALLAH argued that we should not interpret primary sources, and i agree 100%. Problem is, the article is not trying to interpret anything. ITAQALLAH said <i>"sometimes you can use primary sources when there are extremely explicit"</i>. I argue that the following qualifies as "extremely explicit":</p>
<ol>
<li><i><b>She remained alive for six months after the death of the Prophet</b>. When she died, her husband 'Ali, buried her at night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral prayer by himself. When Fatima was alive, the people used to respect 'Ali much, but <b>after her death, 'Ali noticed a change in the people's attitude</b> towards him. So Ali sought reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him an oath of allegiance. '<b>Ali had not given the oath of allegiance during those months (i.e. the period between the Prophet's death and Fatima's death).</b> <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Bukhari_0b24.html" title="Sahih Bukhari">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.546" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.546" rel="nofollow">5:59:546</a></i></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>So Abu Bakr refused to hand over anything from it to Fatima who got angry with Abu Bakr for this reason. She forsook him and did not talk to him until the end of her life. <b>She lived for six months after the death of the Messenger</b> of Allah (may peace be upon him). When she died, her husband. 'Ali b. Abu Talib, buried her at night. He did not inform Abu Bakr about her death and offered the funeral prayer over her himself. During the lifetime of Fatima, 'All received (special) regard from the people. <b>After she had died, he felt estrangement in the faces of the people towards him.</b> So he sought to make peace with Abu Bakr and offer his allegiance to him. <b>He had not yet owed allegiance to him as Caliph during these months</b><a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Muslim_6c10.html" title="Sahih Muslim">Sahih Muslim</a> <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/019.smt.html#019.4352" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/019.smt.html#019.4352" rel="nofollow">19:4352</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You do not get any more explicit than that, there is no interpretation needed in this issue, Bukhari and Muslim are crystal clear when they state that Ali did not give baya for six month. And the article is not quoting hadith, Gibbon , a noted scholar, is also quote, and he is not the least ambigous regarding the rest of Ali's tribe, the Banu Hashim:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>After the simple inauguration of Abubeker, he was obeyed in Medina, Mecca, and the provinces of Arabia: the Hashemites alone declined the oath of fidelity; and their chief, in his own house, maintained, above six months, a sullen and independent reserve; without listening to the threats of Omar, who attempted to consume with fire the habitation of the daughter of the apostle.<a href="http://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/volume2/chap50.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/volume2/chap50.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></i></li>
</ul>
<p>But in either way, the article does not try to pin point how long the whit holding was, it faithfully presents the sources that are available, it gives dates when they do and omits dates when they do. When a source only states that the subject only withhold for a period, but does not specify the period, it does not make the withholding any less notable. Ie, if the source does not state for how long, it is not our job to try to guess how long, we only report what the source states.</p>
<p>Also, we are not here to determine what sources are sound or not. If other relevant sources exist, then of course do they need to be presented, but that does not make the other sources any less relevant.</p>
<p>Regarding <i>"did all personalities mentioned resist for six months? nobody is denying that a pledge may have been temporarily withheld, but for how long? "</i>, that is irrelevant. We report a timespan when there is one, and do not report one when there is not one. Lack of timespan does not make the subject any less notable. There is not problem with verification here, there is no un-verified information present in the article, every single part is sourced.</p>
<p>And im sure that nobody would argue that the question of how many people did not give the baya in the most crucial event in the Islamic history is irrelevant or non-notable.</p>
<p>Regarding <i>"Well, this is a controversial topic, but I would like to point out that we should not miss the point that in these disputes the main concern of the early Sahaba should have been Islam rather than desire for wealth or power."</i>. I don't understand this, what does their motivation has to do with anything, we are not here to guess or do original research.</p>
<p>And this is most certanly not a pov fork, stating that something is a povfork is a bad faith statement, accusing me of creating this to do dodge consensus. I most certanly did not do that, at most, this is a content fork, and it is not even that, since this information is not covered in any other article. Further, the article is a apart of the <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a> series and it is way to detailed to be included in the main article. Im sure nobody that surprised is by the fact that the Succession to Muhammad can not be described in full depth in one single article.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 16:24, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I spoke on this, because I have seen a history of POV-pushing in Islam related articles before, and I think all can agree those exist: <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_c5f9.html" title="Third holiest site in Islam">Third holiest site in Islam</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reforms_under_Islam_%28610-661%29_7678.html" title="Reforms under Islam (610-661)">Reforms under Islam (610-661)</a>, just to name a few. Please please please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume good faith</a> - it was not a bad faith statement. And, it appears that this has continued here, from at least one side of the issue: every single <i>keep</i> so far has come from a Shia, and every single <i>delete</i> from a Sunni. This, unsurprisingly, should lead me to the idea that it may be a POV fork. I would probably speak out, at this stage, in favor of keep, but I see absolutely no evidence at compromise on including the Sunni POV that this list is bogus (clearly, neither side appears to be have accomodated at all: - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Sahaba_not_giving_bay%27ah_to_Abu_Bakr&amp;diff=101194206&amp;oldid=101136035" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Sahaba_not_giving_bay%27ah_to_Abu_Bakr&amp;diff=101194206&amp;oldid=101136035" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and no talk page discussion). <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 11:05, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bro, it is true that one (1) single anon has edited that this list is "bogus", but he did that with no source to back it up, while the article contains voluminous references to Sunni scholars that have written that the named persons did not give their bay'ah initially. Surely there needs more than an anon edit to sidestep sourced scholars? <b>If reference to a scholar who did not agree with some part of the article is provided, then that needs most certanly to be included in the article</b>.
