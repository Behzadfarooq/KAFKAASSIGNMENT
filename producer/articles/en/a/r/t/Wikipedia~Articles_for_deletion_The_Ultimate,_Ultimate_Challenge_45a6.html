<li>Note my comments below, and I have made basic fixing to the article so that it is nolonger quite so out of date. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 10:17, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - out of date, unverifiable; if it was never screened then it isn't notable either. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 19:44, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>if it was never screened then it isn't notable either.</i> Well, I disagree with this part at least; depending on the cast and crew attached to a particular planned show, or if it excited some controversy which led to it being pulled, it may be notable despite never coming to air. See <i><a href="../../../p/h/a/Star_Trek%7E_Phase_II_be93.html" title="Star Trek: Phase II">Star Trek: Phase II</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Dugan_e259.html" title="Mr. Dugan">Mr. Dugan</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../w/e/l/Welcome_to_the_Neighborhood_%28TV_series%29_7239.html" title="Welcome to the Neighborhood (TV series)">Welcome to the Neighborhood (TV series)</a></i> for examples. If this article had not been a hoax, and a high-budget reality show was produced and filmed but for whatever reason never aired, that alone might make it notable. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 01:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, was originally thinking delete after looking at the article and reading the votes. However thanks to then digging around I'm now leaning towards keep. First of all I saw <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2005/9/prweb288938.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2005/9/prweb288938.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> press release. Ok I went, that is interesting. But is just a press release, so still no reason to keep. But then I saw this coverage. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tobi-elkin/porn-press-and-premieres_b_19541.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tobi-elkin/porn-press-and-premieres_b_19541.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1188982,00.html+%22The+Ultimate,+Ultimate+Challenge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=16" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1188982,00.html+%22The+Ultimate,+Ultimate+Challenge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=16" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> plus another press release <a href="http://www.primenewswire.com/newsroom/news.html%3Fd%3D107141+%22The+Ultimate,+Ultimate+Challenge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.primenewswire.com/newsroom/news.html%3Fd%3D107141+%22The+Ultimate,+Ultimate+Challenge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=20" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> I decided the topic is worth keeping.

<li>Where to start? In media res, I suppose. Mathmo tried to wave the red flag but nobody paid attention. Let me endorse a <b>move</b> to American Cannibal: The Road to Reality. From what I can make out this is a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blair_Witch_Project_53bd.html" title="Blair Witch Project">Blair Witch Project</a> for grown-ups, or something. It's a documentary about a reality show that couldn't happen (what lawyer would sign off on starving people to death?). Yet everyone in it -- playing themselves, as writers, producers, or actors -- somehow keeps a straight face. Or maybe some of them really believed....

<dd><i>But one can't help but wonder how both sides played each other in this reality show within a reality show about a doomed reality TV production.

Both crafted for maximum benefit.</i></dd>
