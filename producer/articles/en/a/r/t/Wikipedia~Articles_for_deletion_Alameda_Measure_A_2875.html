<p>The result was <b>Delete</b> as unsourced. Any article, to meet Wikipedia's standards, must do two things: 1. Assert the notability of its subject, and 2. document this assertion. The assertion of notability here is that the measure had ramifications outside the community and became precedent for other measures nationwide. After checking the links provided I find that the evidence for this has not been forthcoming. Simply put, if this measure was a landmark event reliable sources should not be hard to come by. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 04:01, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And anyway, so what if it is only of interest to people of Alameda? Who says that geography is the proper delimiter of communities of interest in Wikipedia? The Britney Spears page is only of interest to people who like Britney Spears. Perhaps the City of Alameda web page is also only of interest to people from Alameda? People from Alameda are entitled to look to Wikipedia to find information that is of interest to themselves as well, even if it doesn't have broad geographic interest, no?

<dd><i>I could use some info....</i> This isn't train schedule information, or information that changes periodically like the tides, sunrise, sunset, movies at the local cineplex. There's over 30 years of history behind this issue. People in Alameda shouldn't be dis-enfranchised from finding out about it in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is of interest to the fields of development and urban planning.

And yes, those two links refer to land-use generally, and not to Measure A specifically. But how are people supposed to know that "Measure A" in Alameda refers to land-use if they look to an encyclopedia and can't find it?

<li>Please don't&#160;!vote more than once. And how are people supposed to believe that Measure A really does mean more than to just the people of the city of Alameda if we don't prove it, and so far we haven't, which means that so far, it's just a local proposition that doesn't mean anything outside of the city. Despite grandiose claims, you and the article's supporters have still failed to prove your claims, and I am hoping that the closing admin will take that into consideration when deciding how to close this. If you do come up with some outside sources to prove your claim, that will go a long way towards keeping this article. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 23:17, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You're too focused on term "Measure A" - I agree, you probably will never find anybody outside of alameda refer to the term "Measure A" - but that's not the point. The point is that 'land use' is an issue of great interest to people outside of Alameda, as other people have pointed out. This article is a land use article. People in Alameda know it by the term 'Measure A.' And again, you haven't provided any reason to dis-enfranchise Alameda residents from learning about it through Wikipedia. As for voting twice, that was not my intention - using Wikipedia amounts to using a programming language, and I'm not about invest half of my life learning another one. And yes, I've made some suggestions for improvement on my wiki page. <a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowster_c2d2.html" title="User:Mowster">Mowster</a> 17:34, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You really don't understand this, do you? You're trying to turn this AfD into a referendum on Measure A, rather than a question over whether Alameda's specific policy is notable enough to warrant a Wikipedia article. All that your complaining about other people's biases does is make it appear that you don't have any real argument that Measure A is particularly notable. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 00:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I know I will be attacked no matter how I vote on this, so here goes. I think the tug-of-war over this Measure A article is ridiculous, and not just because I disagree with Mr. David Howard (AKA Mowster, AKA IP address 70.137.142.153) on the underlying issue. Measure A is of great interest to a number of Alameda residents, but I honestly don't think too many people beyond our borders are following it … though I must admit that whenever I tell people that it's <i>illegal</i> to build town homes, condominiums, and apartments in my town, it usually does raise an eyebrow or two. At any rate, I tried to use restraint in the few edits I made to the page, but nothing seems to satisfy Mr. Howard. Just as Measure A is a draconian measure to stop bad multiple-unit development by banning <i>all</i> multiple-unit development, my "delete" vote is a draconian measure to stop bad writing about Measure A by banning <i>all</i> writing about Measure A. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelJKrueger_ea9b.html" title="User:MichaelJKrueger">MichaelJKrueger</a> 02:29, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I realized that the real test for deletion of this article should not be its notability outside Alameda, but rather the guidelines under <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html#Campaigning" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Conflict of Interest: Campaigning</a>. In particular, "If you edit articles while involved with organizations that engage in advocacy in that area, you may have a conflict of interest." Mr. Howard, the author of the article and its predecessor (which was also deleted), is one of the founders of a political action committee whose stated goal is the preservation of Measure A. The group, Citizens for Alameda Neighborhoods (FPPC#1288721), funded literature supporting slow-growth candidates in the November 2006 mayoral and city council races in Alameda. I don't have an outside source to verify Mr. Howard's involvement (you'll have to take my word for it), but this <a href="http://keepmeasurea.wordpress.com/your-support-is-needed/" class="external text" title="http://keepmeasurea.wordpress.com/your-support-is-needed/" rel="nofollow">appeal for support</a> on his <a href="http://keepmeasurea.wordpress.com/" class="external text" title="http://keepmeasurea.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Measure-A-themed blog</a> links him to the group through this <a href="http://keepmeasurea.wordpress.com/files/2006/11/kma_donation3.jpg" class="external text" title="http://keepmeasurea.wordpress.com/files/2006/11/kma_donation3.jpg" rel="nofollow">form</a>. I realize that I belong to a community group (<a href="http://www.homesalameda.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.homesalameda.org/" rel="nofollow">Housing Opportunities Make Economic Sense</a>) on the other side of the Measure A issue, but I would be happy to forgo editing any Wikipedia pages about Measure A as long as Mr. Howard agrees to stop misrepresenting HOMES' position. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelJKrueger_ea9b.html" title="User:MichaelJKrueger">MichaelJKrueger</a> 03:31, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
