<li><b>Keep</b> -- It is likely that people might search for this phrase in an encyclopedia. If the Processor Register article does not describe General Purpose Registers and their conventions thoroughly, then the topic would merit its own article. I believe the description in the Processor Register article is not as informative as the current article on the topic. Otherwise, make it a redirect, but not without merging the information into the other article. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 01:01, 17 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, the information in the article is incorrect and misleading. The <a href="../../../p/r/o/Processor_register.html" title="Processor register">Processor register</a> article is more accurate. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 01:14, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Processor_register.html" title="Processor register">Processor registers</a> misses a point that such registers may be used freely, i.e. the programmer can store data there. The distinction that makes a register general purpose or not is <i>not</i> specifically that it can store both values and addresses. If there is an inaccuracy, then it should be fixed, but having errors does not merit deletion. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 01:26, 17 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not an accurate definition of GPRs either, I don't believe: firstly, it is <i>not</i> the GPRs only that can be used "freely", secondly, the distinction between the kinds of registers as listed in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Processor_register.html" title="Processor register">Processor register</a> (GPR vs FPR vs IR, etc.) truly is as described. <i>Processor register</i> is used as a general term referring to all kinds of registers so it seems that a more elaborate description of GPRs (e.g. of a size of this article) belongs in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Processor_register.html" title="Processor register">Processor register</a>. I would agree that as a term, <i>General purpose register (GPR)</i> in some systems and in modern architectures is used more generically. As GPRs receive wider usage, the GPR topic may evolve. But then, it could be "sub-articled" later, right? So at this point I vote <b>Merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Processor_register.html" title="Processor register">Processor register</a>. -- <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrovert_e3fe.html" title="User:Introvert"><font color="#004161">Introvert</font></a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EIntrovert_66c0.html" title="User talk:Introvert"><font color="#004161"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 02:00, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Mrs. Spann was very much active in both campaign/elections for her brother, making numerous phone calls and mailings that she should be noted. Spann was also noted for her high standards of religion as was the standard of many other members of the Carter family. She also was a leading biker-girl for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harley_Davidson_10ea.html" title="Harley Davidson">Harley Davidson</a> riders and easily climbed the ranks long before her brother became <a href="../../../p/r/e/President.html" title="President">president</a> of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, so in a way, she actually was a popular person years before her brother was involved in public office. I think the article on Mrs. Spann should definitely be kept. I also noticed that much of the information in the article came from Carter's An Hour Before Daylight, which should be incorporated in a citation. Being the last sibling of the former president is also notable enough. There was an incident back in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> when Gloria was arrested for playing a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonica.html" title="Harmonica">harmonica</a> in a cafe down in <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plains.html" title="Plains">Plains</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/_/Ga.html" title="Ga">Ga</a>, while brother Billy was having is own problems at or around the same time.

<li>If <i>all</i> Bezos did was found the company, he'd not deserve a biography. However, he has done quite a lot. He has been one of the leading e-commerce cheerleaders, has innovated, has pioneered on-demand, etc. He deserves a biography because his biography is interesting and because he is referred to as a person by other sources. On the other hand, a man who hides in the shadows and runs things and just appears in trade magazines is famous only for the company, and only in the context of the company, and therefore would have his bio-article redirect to the company. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:47, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I'm struggling a bit here too. He's listed as a co-author, but not on the cover of the book. What did he do?

<p>I think that this should be amended as it seems to be a defination of an imaginary point and not a plane.

<li>Having looked at those references, in the first article, the term "imaginary plane" is being used to refer to a plane that is just a thought-experiment; one for the sake of the argument. The second article uses loose mathematical langauge, but the full quote from the article is "real and imaginary plane" which is a viable (if odd) way to refer to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complex_plane.html" title="Complex plane">complex plane</a> (this is occasionally called the real-imaginary plane), and so does not really refer to the "imaginary plane" of this article. The Google hits all seem to be non-existent planes rather than mathematical terminologies, too, from their summaries. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 04:57, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, in mathematics at least, there is no such thing as "the imaginary plane"; it's just some teenager misunderstanding a maths lesson, I think.

<li>Delete: I don't care how many blogs there are on Wikipedia. The proliferation of evil is no mediation of it, nor can anyone (and I'm getting tired of this) extrapolate from an instance to a class. Some blogs are leaders, forerunners, innovators, and some are just the weekly mass-forwarded e-mail ha-ha. This one is of the latter class, and we know this a number of ways. The first is that the article's text has irregular line forms indicating a paste from some other source. The second is that it's already out of date.

<li>Delete: The article doesn't even explain who he is. Why is this a <i>biography?</i> Why isn't this just a name mentioned in the context of an article on the music? Then note that the people who vote keep on all game music <i>still</i> can't be bothered to improve any articles, and we have a situation where even the fans don't want to lift a finger to help out, so it's highly unlikely that this incomprehensible mess will ever get better.

<li>Exactly, and that is why this is a clear delete. Of course, if fans <i>believed in it,</i> they could try to keep it from being such a patent deletion guideline violator. Apparently, though, they're not interested in that. They're only interested in keeping weak stuff, so long as it satisfies their own hobbies. Some of us <i>save</i> articles that should otherwise be deleted. Others just insist that the process not go forward. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:07, 17 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If an article satifies someone's own hobbies, it obviously has some value, and should be kept and left for the wiki process to improve. Unfortunately some people use Vfd to try to force improvement from those who have no special knowledge or interest in the topic, but are doing their best to preserve wikipedia's value against those who would remove almost everything that makes it a useful resource. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:02, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actually, the fact that it satisfies someone's hobby makes it perfect for Everything2.com, but not an <i>encyclopedia.</i> This is particularly true when we start insisting that not only should the favorite tune be covered, but that the author get a "biography" that consists of...the tunes! Then that there be an article about a variation, then another about the co-writer, then the company, etc. All spiralling out because it is the <i>hobbyist's hobby</i> to collect trivia. Hobbies are <i>private entertainments,</i> while encyclopedias are <i>public references.</i> Some people mistake the "anyone can edit" for "centered around You." The fact that anyone can edit doesn't mean that all possible desires and interests are equally appropriate. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:56, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article wasn't created by me, but it informs me more about who creates music for music games, a topic which I happen to be interested in. So I can't really understand the "private entertainment" concept.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Are you so dense that you cannot possibly fathom a world where people are not pure vandals or pure angels? Just because I had some fun when I was new to this system doesn't mean that I'm utterly incapable of stringing more than two words together for non-spoof purposes.

I posted this article when I was brand-new to wikipedia, and didn't have a user name yet. I put it on here more as practice than anything. The problem is, I realised that it is not wikified, etc...and my source list got wiped out. I do remember most of the primary sources I used however. (see this article's talk page if you will). It is "orginal research" in that I worked with primary sources and wrote my own article, but not "original research" in the Wikipedia sense in that I am not propounding any radical or non-traditonal view of the subject. All assertions herein are based in primary source material within a framework of knowledge gleaned from peer-reviewed secondary sources and education. This might be a good article, but I need your guys' help in editing it and making it more "wiki" friendly.

<li>Delete: It's original research, alright. It's also highly POV and based on ghosts of information. Take it from the author, the article really doesn't belong.

I have a MA in medieval history from Boston College (which is actually the foremost institution in America to study early medieval history) and a JD (Law Degree) from NYU. I have made several significant contributions to legal articles here under the username CelineDionFan82. Look them up. Furthermore, does this article look like vandalism or a spoof?

<p><b>Keep</b> Guys, the point of this article is not to list all terms, rather to show that some terms also have a literla meaning. that aspect of the article would be lost if it would be merged in the bigger one. Is there any way to keep that aspect and make it more encyclopedic?</p>
<p>what if whe rename it to "Islamic Terms with dual meaning"&#160;?</p>

Exactly what we mean by <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">Imperialism</a> is of course controversial, but I think a lot of people would accept that it means more than just nationalism, or the ruler assuming the title of emperor. Actually, I would say Japan is the one non-white imperialist power, which is POV, but as this is a significant school of thought it deserves mention.

<li>As the original creator of this article, lemme explain: there once was an article called <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Chancellors_and_Vice-Chancellors_d322.html" title="List of Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors">List of Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors</a> which had started as a badly-titled list of <b>British</b> chancellors &amp; vice-chancellors, and had grown by the addition of various assorted additions from around the world. I cleaned it up and rationalized it, a major part of which was spinning off national pages. The other countries' lists, I think you'll find, are fairly well-formed; obviously the US one was grossly inadequate. But I was just cleaning up; I didn't want to delete people's work peremptorially.

<p>The same could be said of many acceptable entries, including The Ford Motor company. The fact remains that this is a company with an interesting history and substantial long-term impact upon the boating and fishing industries. While the article is short and could be a good deal more complete, I don't think it fair to delete it so hastily as mere advertising. We're not talking about an internet casino here.</p>

<li>I found this article while researching Masaaki Hatsumi's schools outside of Japan after encountering students of Mr. Prather's Yamaneko Dojo in Tucson, Arizona. The text of the article is similar in nature to the school's brochure and in my opinion, was most likely written by one of his schools on his behalf. Although I am not an editor, my expectation of a wikipedia article is to provide only the established facts, most notably career, awards, and affiliations. This article meets that requirement, but also contains information better suited to an external link to his personal or professional webpage. In conclusion, I would recommend keeping the article as it documents Mr. Prather's role as an official <i>shihan</i>. <a href="../../../j/j/o/User%7EJjoganic_abdd.html" title="User:Jjoganic">Jjoganic</a> 23:16, 7 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As a follow-up, I read through the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">content rules for biographic information</a>, and would suggest the following item as a vote for keeping the entry.
<ul>
<li>The professor test -- If the individual is more well known and more published than an average college professor, they can and should be included.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Within the scope of Japanese martial arts tradition, if Mr. Prather is in fact 15th dan and studied under Hatsumi in Japan, then he is directly relevent. The only evidence that I have for this is the brochure that I received from students of the Yamaneko Dojo this afternoon. A scanned image of the [<a href="http://negi.joganic.com/images/brochure.png" class="external text" title="http://negi.joganic.com/images/brochure.png" rel="nofollow">brochure</a>] and a higher resolution image of what is apparently [<a href="http://negi.joganic.com/images/prather.png" class="external text" title="http://negi.joganic.com/images/prather.png" rel="nofollow">Mr. Prather and Mr. Hatsumi</a>] is included and will remain online for at least a week or so. Note: I have no affiliation with the school, students, or individual in question. I was quite literally having lunch with my wife in a park when I asked one of the students about their dojo. From an editorial viewpoint, the text of the article could (and should) be made to read less like a vanity page or advertisement for his school. Moreover, [<a href="http://initiation.warriorschool.com/profiles.htm" class="external text" title="http://initiation.warriorschool.com/profiles.htm" rel="nofollow">his website</a>] and the brochure state that Mr. Prather is in fact 13th dan (very high) where the article states 15th. Some further research is necessary in any event. Unfortunately, the most important research would probably need to be conducted in Japanese as the english google has very little to say about "Jeffery Prather" that links him to Hatsumi even indirectly. Credentials aside, it is unlikely that this article is a hoax. All in all, I'm of a mind to edit the article myself, but I have no connection with the information aside from a chance meeting and a mutual interest in martial arts. <a href="../../../j/j/o/User%7EJjoganic_abdd.html" title="User:Jjoganic">Jjoganic</a> 01:25, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On a probably final note, there is apparently some confusion over the spelling of Mr. Prather's first name. Googling for "Jeffrey Prather" returns ten pages of hits. Googling for "Jeffery Prather" returns two. The article should probably be renamed and the incorrect spelling and link from <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masaaki_Hatsumi_88d2.html" title="Masaaki Hatsumi">Masaaki Hatsumi</a> changed as well. <a href="../../../j/j/o/User%7EJjoganic_abdd.html" title="User:Jjoganic">Jjoganic</a> 01:57, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Star Wars characters are notable, but that doesn't tell us whether it should be described in detail or just merged elsewhere. The article doesn't help because it reads like an article from a fictional encyclopedia about a real subject rather than an article from a real encyclopedia about a fictional subject. Yeah, it says it's a fictional character up front but then it immediately ignores that context. Where and how was all the detailed information about this character revealed? In game dialogue? In a text-scroll prologue before play starts? In a little printed insert included with the game cartridge? Does this character only exist in this game, or has he been used in other media? If he only exists as a figure in the game with some expository details thrown in here and there, the character really should be merged into the game article because he has no independent existence. Considering how the game article just makes a reference to him under the header "Other characters met along the way," he can't even be all that important to the game no matter how many details the game creators decided to flesh him out with. I'm struggling to see why we should give it such in-depth coverage. --<a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 03:59, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Darth Traya was actually the one who wanted the jedi destroyed and aided this assult the most. Nihilus hardly ever appears in the game, and when he does, it is rather briefly. And also, he was never actually against the 'jedi' so to speak. He hated everything and anything that had life.
<ul>
<li>And in hating all life, he managed to nearly destroy every Jedi. Traya may have wanted to destroy the Jedi as well, which serves her own notability, but Nihilus was more instrumental in taking action against them. <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 17:53, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. This 'Darth Nihilus' seems to be rather unimportant in the story, and should be deleted. He is not that important in the storyline, and plays about in total maybe 7 minutes in the game. That is why i vote for strong delete.<small>Both this unsigned vote and above comment were made by User:138.130.213.165</small></li>
<li>Absent further showing that this character is more important, trim down the content to the essentials, <b>merge</b> content to both the article on the game and also <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Sith_characters_c6e5.html" title="List of minor Sith characters">List of minor Sith characters</a>, and then redirect to the latter.

<li><b>Unprovoked Attack on User 138.130.213.165</b>. I would just like to say to 'Nufy8' that although i did in fact want the Master Kae article to stay, and did not realize there was a deletion policy in place which stopped repeated votes for deletion, i would like everyone who visits this page to hear this. I categorically deny that this is an act of vandalism. How dare you critisize me! This is a legitimate vote for deletion, so don't assume i am causing trouble. you are the one doing that! and your preliminary assumptions are unwarranted and do not justify your saying 'strong keep'!. you only say that (according to wikipedia policy) if you want to keep something! Now i would like this page to continue with genuine people posting their opinions, like i did just above. not personal degradation.</li>

<ul>
<li>I think you're judging importance by the wrong standards here. A fictional subject is not important simply because he's depicted doing important or dramatic things within the fiction. If a book merely happens to mention that within its story, that the President is William Smith, that doesn't make William Smith an important character by <i>encyclopedic</i> standards even though that's an important role within the fictional world. On the other hand, if numerous films and books all portray the same janitor with whom the protagonist has hearty conversations every day he leaves from work, that character may be important for our considerations even though he isn't important except as an acquaintance within the fictional world itself. Here we're talking about a character that "doesn't appear...too much" in the <i>only game</i> in which he is portrayed. That <i>all</i> <i>Star Wars</i> characters have some minimal level of notability due to the fanbase and pervasiveness of the media is why all reference to the character shouldn't just be outright deleted. But that the character only appears in one work (one <i>video game</i>, at that, not a major motion picture), and doesn't even sound very central to that work, is a strong argument for summary treatment rather than a lengthy, independent article. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 01:19, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Point taken. However, within the game, although Nihilus himself does not feature so much, his actions are quite important, he did almost destroy the planet that the Exile (player character) was on at the time, and so is rather important in that respect. My main point was basically the "<b>Comment</b> If a major character" posted by Nufy8 above. He is central to the plot though, though it does not revolve around him, and he <i>is</i> mentioned in the very title of the game. I wouldn't oppose a merge and redirect though. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperiority_ab05.html" title="User:Superiority">Superiority</a> 09:52, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Just to Clarify</b>. If you think that was an act of vandalsism it wasn't. I realise, as you do, that there is a system which displays the fact that i wrote a post. That is why i don't think it is vandalsim. you know when i am writing, so there is no deception! i have a right to post comments as well. and i only entered one strong delete because i get to express my opionion once as well. and even though it wont be counted, at least i got to write what was on my mind.

<li>I would imagine people would think more highly of you if you put for reasons for putting it on VfD at the top, rather than making such unsigned comments. And I didn't say it was vandalism, I jsut said it seemed rather underhanded.

<p>Why should this article be deleted? Because some fool has a grudge against charcters not from the movie. You people who claim he has a limited amount of time on screen in the game are totally correct, but so did boba fett in the trilogy, so why isn't he being considered for deletion? Nihilus is an interesting figure, who deserves to be kept. Deleting him isn't going to solve the problem, because avid fans will just rewrite the article again. This is a free informational website, if people want to come here and read an article about Darth Nihilus, that is their privilege, and that is what makes this website so great. So to make a long story short, who the hell do you people who vote for delete think you are, you are not the gods of computer-land, don't ruin good things for everyone else, because you have hairs accross your asses about something as harmless as a character from a popular game. I mean honestly, why do you care, let the Damn article stay in place. I vote <b>STRONG KEEP</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite a short amount of screen time and little dialogue in the original trilogy, Boba Fett obviously became an extremely well known and popular character (even well outside the bounds of the dedicated <i>Star Wars</i> canon followers), as is reflected in the numerous non-<i>Star Wars</i> references to the character in other media (some of which are described in the article). His action figure was one of the most popular, he has been substantially portrayed in other <i>Star Wars</i> media outside the movies, and Lucas gave him and his father a very prominent role in the second prequel. There's simply no comparison to the obscurity of Nihilus. The <a href="../../../b/o/b/Boba_Fett_68c2.html" title="Boba Fett">Boba Fett</a> article is actually pretty good, btw, because it sources character information to specific works of fiction and describes it in terms of those. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 18:35, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Just as a point of curiosity, why hasn't <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Traya_07be.html" title="Darth Traya">Darth Traya</a> been nominated for deletion while Nihilus and Sion have? - <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Hart_0932.html" title="User:Jon Hart">Jon Hart</a>

<li>I agree why hasnt it? It was marked for deletion earlier but for a different reason.</li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Although Darth Nihilus may not appear in KOTOR 2:The Sith Lords until closer to the end, the player (it is a RPG!!!) is consumed with the impending meeting throughout gameplay. Nihilus is a major character in the Expanded Universe and as such, deserves a unique entry. <a href="../../../e/x/i/User%7EExile_1138_196f.html" title="User:Exile 1138">Exile 1138</a></li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> There needs to be an article about Darth Nihilus. Though I believe some of the content needs to be updated to provide a better round out description and happenings of this character, but to delete this article would be foolish. Someone would create another one and go through the whole process again. I say keep this article and perform the necessary changes as needed. -<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeStar_2a7c.html" title="User:LifeStar">LifeStar</a></li>

<p>Delete-The Shia "view" necessitates deletion. The Shia are a 10-15% sect in the Islamic world. Their theological and historical views deserve as much they represent: 10-15%. A good encyclopedia does not allow theological partisanship to dominate its pages. The entries for Jesus and Christianity do not contain "refutations" by Muslims, nor criticisms of the majority by minority sects such as the Monophysites of old Catholicism. Why then should the Shia view be held in such high regard? The vast majority of the Islamic community views the history of Umar in diametrical opposition to the Shia. That is to state, the Sufis, Sunnis, Salafis, Ibadis, and Kharwarij.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Another of Striver's attempts to use Wikipedia as a Shi'a soapbox. The Shi'a view of Umar is well-represented in the current version of the <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umar</a> article. The only material missing from the <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umar</a> article, but present in this one, are the cut-and-pasted <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a>, or oral traditions, lifted from other websites. Hadith are often of dubious historical value and should not presented as "true" without further qualification. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 10:19, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It does seem that Zora, having tried to keep most of the Shia material from the main article, is now trying to delete the separate article that was created in response.

<dd>I don't want to keep Shi'a views out of the Umar article -- I want to keep them from <i>dominating</i> the Umar article. I think all of Striver's accusations against Umar are listed there at the end -- all that's gone are the endless hadith dumps he keeps inserting in articles. That is a pietistic mode of argument and not very encyclopedic. Striver cites hadith that he thinks prove his point; a Sunni would cite different hadith; then general mayhem ensues, as the Shi'a and the Sunni try to blacken the names and veracity of the various transmitters of the oral traditions. Meanwhile, academic historians watch from the sidelines and say, "Well, hadith are extremely dubious historical material, to be handled with caution." I think that part of the problem is that Striver does not really know how to make an argument to a non-Muslim. He presents a hadith with a "so-there" attitude, and the reader is supposed to divine from the hadith exactly what it is trying to prove, and contra whom. I have sometimes been able to replace or supplement Striver's hadith with more discursive explanations -- with which he often agrees -- based on outside reading. But if you don't know what he's trying to prove, or the context of the argument, his hadith are completely opaque. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:45, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--- Did any one takes the time to go true the shia argument? its nothing but personal insults on Umar. Nothing objective is to be found there, the conclusion people get about Umar from the article is <font color="red">100% negative</font>, its propaganda. I think its time you reallies that an Iranian shia cannot be objective about an Arab like Umar ibn al-khatab who was the masterminder behind the conquest of Iran. let Jesus for Christians and Umar for Sunnis and Ali for shias thats what i think and dont let people who have historical enmity to write about there enemies. <font color="red">Delete</font> Ayubi1187</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>-- Isn't the porpoise of this website to give complete historical fact about People. The shia article don't give any valuable information about Umar only propaganda. Sens shia don't have broad information about Umar and only narrow information that he was usurper,lier, hypocrite and so on this view cannot be considerate as complete information to be listed as separate article. The main article give complete biographical story of Umar something you don't find in the shia view of Umar only backbiting. Its very clear from the article that shia don't have complete history about Umar's life to contribute beside the negative story's. It should be enough with the main article of Umar and in the bottom it should be written that "shia view Umar as evil man and sens they don't have complete biography about him beside he was evil there view will be not listed in separate article" or something similar. I think thats very reasonable if the objective of wikipedia is to give broad picture about different personalty's and not narrow. Ayubi1187</p>

<p>Comment: This article should be deleted, for <font color="blue">three</font> reasons. + - <font color="blue">First</font>, the purpose of any encyclopaedia is to present facts impartially and without prejudice, sticking as closely as possible to the viewpoint that is generally agreed upon among competent scholars. The "Shia View of 'Umar" fails miserably along these lines: the goal of the article is obviously to tell people negative things about 'Umar. + - <font color="blue">Second</font>, allowing articles with such titles as "The X's View of Y" is merely an invitation to people to use this encyclopaedia as a forum for their propaganda. They should ALL be deleted. If we want to allow such articles, what will prevent their being an article called "The Sunni View of Shias", explaining that Sunnis regard the Shias obsessive-compulsive liars, cowards, bigots, and troublemakers with nothing of value to contribute to Islamic civilization? Do the Shias really want articles which explain exactly what the majority of Muslims think about them? + - <font color="blue">Third,</font> the Shia view of 'Umar is so devoid of any sound historical basis that it belongs in the same category as "The Ku Klux Klan's View of Blacks" or the "Flat Earth Society's Views of the Roundness of the Earth". It would surely be ridiculous for any respectable encyclopaedia to contain entries such as these, and the same goes for the "Shia View of 'Umar". [Omar Mirza]</p>
<p><b>comment</b></p>
<ul>
<li>First: That is what "Shia View of 'Umar" does, reports accuratly how Shias view Umar.</li>
<li>Second: So go delet all the elder articles, why are you objection now and not before? As for "The Sunni View of Shias", i eagerly await it, it whould be nice to show everybody what Sunnis blive of Shias. Dont forget to include the al ahzar fatwa that made us the fifth madhab.</li>
<li>Third: Is Bukhari and Muslim "devoid of any sound historical basis"&#160;? Cool, i didnt know that...</li>

<dd>You like to talk don't you. It was not fatwa by al-azhar as institution but the personal opinion of state appointed mufti Shaltoot other wise they would teach jafari madhab in al-azhar.

<p><br />
Thank you for the personal comment, much appreciated. If you make some reaserch, you will find that fatwa was the fruit of a decade long mutual research between shia and sunni representatives, aiming on unity, not some random fatwa given by some bribed nobody. It didnt came before since for a long time it was customary among sunnis to kill shias on sight.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 16:36, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I maintain this article should be deleted. I have explained my reasons above. Here I elaborate upon them. Capitals below are for emphasis: I'm not shouting.</p>
<ul>
<li>First: The "Shia View of 'Umar" does NOT report accurately how the Shias view 'Umar. There are many important aspects of the Shia view of 'Umar that it leaves out. It does not tell us anything about the time-honoured practice of RITUALLY CURSING 'Umar, which is considered a religiously meritorious action by the Twelver Shia. It does not tell us about the "Supplication of the Two Idols of the Quraysh", that the Shia scholars have accepted as a good supplication, and which is used to curse 'Umar. It does not tell us anything about the fanatical desire of the Shia to have the grave of 'Umar removed from its position near the grave of the Prophet of Islam(s). It does not tell us anything about the CONFUSIONS that the Shias have concerning 'Umar (many of the Shias have long accepted the reports in their own sources whch admit that 'Umar was married to the daughter of 'Ali, while modern apologists find it more convenient to deny this fact.) It also does not tell us anything about Shia RACISM towards 'Umar, as in the poetry that Shias have composed making fun of his dark skin ('Umar was a quarter Ethiopian by ancestry). It does not tell us about the bizarre rituals of burning effigies of 'Umar that are popular in Shia countries. The article basically leaves out all the more paranoid and obsessive aspects of the Shia view of 'Umar, knowing about which would be important in a scholarly account. The article is a piece of propaganda, not an objective description.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Second: When an article is being used as a front for propaganda, it should be deleted. This is the case here.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Third: The fact that the article cites only Nahj ul-Balagha and Sunni sources (as noted by Striver) shows clearly that THIS ARTICLE IS PROPAGANDA. Anybody with any experience of Shia missionaries knows that they make a big deal about proving their points from Sunni sources. If the article was a scholarly account of the Shia view of 'Umar, then it would cite only hadiths from their main sources, such as "Usul al-Kafi", NOT Sunni sources. Why does the article not mention any of the hadiths in the four main Shia collections? What is the point of citing Sunni sources in an article whose alleged purpose is to give the *Shia view*? Isn't the *Shia view* best expressed in SHIA SOURCES? Shia INTERPRETATIONS of Sunni sources are devoid of historical basis. So the article would be better if it stuck to a description of what is said in the Shia sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that the author cites Sunni sources so much shows that the article is designed to convince Sunnis of the Shia point of view. This is just a piece of propaganda, and should be deleted.</p>
<p>[Omar Mirza]</p>
<ul>
<li>First: Well, then add it. I forgot about it, i dont ritualy curse him, but i do get a few lols when i read about him, and i do get angry when i see people blatantly ignoring his deeds. But you are right, go ahead and add those practises to the article, it belongs ther. Add also a link to the duas.</li>
<li>Second: Not true. It should be NPOVed.</li>
<li>Third: No, it only means that the only one contributing to it only have read that. But you are absolutly correct! It fills me with great joy to be enlightened to the fact that i can for once use Shia sources to expose him!</li>
</ul>
<p>--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 14:28, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another reason to delete this article: In addition to the obviously propagandistic nature of this article, the scholarly quality is VERY poor (this is common in Shia attacks on 'Umar). The Sunni sources it cites are from bad translations (e.g. the online "Sahih Bukhari".) It is obviously useful for a POLEMICIST to provide online links, whether these are bad translations or not. But in an encyclopaeida, the article-writers should be held to a higher standard. [Omar Mirza]</p>
<p>IF you belive it to be POV, then NPOV it. You only want the article deleted since you love Umar and cant stand to see a article reporting negative things about him. If you disagree with the translations or links or any other material for that matter, then fix it, that does not constitute a excuse to delet the article.</p>

<b>TO THE MODERATOR: MOST VOTES TO DELET THIS ARTICLE ARE POLITICALY BASED AND NOT MADE IN GOOD FAITH. </b>
<b>ALSO REMEBER THAT SUNNIS OUTNUMBER SHIAS BY FIVE TO ONE.</b>

<ul>
<li><b>This article is filled with inaccuracies</b>. As you would expect from a polemic with little schol;arly value. For example, the author claims, against all evidence, that 'Umar was "not a valiant man", yet the great scholar Suyuti reports that</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Ali said: I don't know of anyone who didn't emigrate in secret except for 'Umar ibn al-Khattab; because when he wanted to emigrate he strapped on his sword, put his bow over his shoulder, carried his arrows in his hand, and came to the Ka'bah where the nobles of Quraysh were in the courtyard. He performed seven circuits, and then prayed two raka'at at the Station (of Ibrahim). Then he approached their circle one step at a time and said, "What ugly faces! Whoever wishes to bereave his mother, orphan his children and widow his wife then let him meet me behind this valley." Not one of them followed him.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds pretty valiant to me, frankly. The argument that he didn't answer Amr's challenge is also weak, since it is not known that he was even present at that part of the ditch: for all we know, he may have been stationed by the Prophet(s) elsewhere along the Ditch (which was very long).</p>
<p><b>Coment</b> Or, he had protection from his tribe, while the Banu Hashim did not. The hadith you mentined, if authentic, does give a valiant impresion. Or, it could just show his usual spite for anyone he disagreed with, includint Muhammad (as), like in hudaybia or at his death bed. Do you have any report of Umar hurting or being hurt by a Mushrik? I have found none. Only him running away or implying Muhammad (as) was dead and discouringing people from entering battle.</p>
<p>As for the ditch, it might be true, or it might not, its conjecture. Even if he was on some other part, he hade plenty of time to be summoned, Amr breaching the treanch was not a minor event, i can not grasp Umar failing to notice that, or not being reported that. Again, its just conjecture.</p>

<p>Striver created this article as part of his new strategy -- instead of facing community criticism of his changes to the "established" Islamic articles, he's just going to write his own Shi'a POV articles and then link them to the main articles.</p>
<p>This article can't be kept because even the TITLE is a Shi'a indictment of the first three caliphs -- they say that the first three caliphs made law and changed custom, whereas the community should have adhered strictly to the sunnah, or custom of the time of Muhammad. There is no way that a traditional Sunni Muslim can argue that any changes were OK -- the Sunni Muslim is going to have to deny any changes whatsoever. At which point the article just becomes a catalogue of "did" and "did not".</p>
<p>There is a secular, academic argument to be made about the extent of the authority ceded to the first caliphs -- best exemplified in Crone's book, <i>God's Caliph</i> -- but it should be made at <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">Caliph</a> or <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">Sharia</a> or possibly <a href="../../../u/l/e/Ulema.html" title="Ulema">Ulema</a>.

<dd>It's not that I don't want to have the Shi'a view represented. I want it represented WELL, and readably. I have incurred the anger of the three Shi'a working on Wikipedia (Striver, Zereshk, and Ya Ali) by objecting to arguments that consist mainly of hadith dumps, copyvios, and misspellings.

And of cource, in shia view, its Sunnah to not exile Abu Dharr, Muhammad (as) called him the most truthfull man betwen heaven and earth!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>About the solitary prayer, that is why its under Shia view and not Sunni view. We Shia belive that it is not Sunnah, and Ali dispersed those who did it during his Caliphat. As goes for Muslim, whe dont consider all of it as Authentic.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no pov problem, except for maybe Marwan. Ill toss down Marwan to the Shia view. Is there any more POV issues left after that?</p>
<p><br />
And by the whay, POV is not solved by deleting the whole article, its solved by NPOVing or in worst case, deleting. I know that Sunni dont like to see that list. But not liking the list does not warant a deletion.</p>

<p>What we've got here is two Shi'a insisting that Wikipedia be their soapbox, that they get to have articles devoted to their "personalistic" view of history, in which everything is reduced to piety and personality. The <i>good</i> pious Muslims followed Ali, and were persecuted for it; the <i>bad</i> worldly Muslims followed the Sunni path. Anyone who did not choose Ali was a bad person, which is to be shown by oral traditions (possibly folktales or bazaar gossip) collected hundreds of years later, showing the Sunni leaders as monsters of depravity and hatred. Really -- this is history as comic book material. It IS possible to present history from a Shi'a viewpoint without turning it all into personalities. I was quite impressed with Reza Aslan's 2005 book <i>No God But God</i>, which is based on extensive academic research, and shows the early Muslims as making choices based on conflicting interpretations of Islam, views of how the political process was to be managed, etc. Aslan presents a Shi'a POV without turning it into hagiography/demonology.</p>
<p>The insistence on stuffing this material into a frame which ASSUMES that innovation is bad is also inherently POV. This is the POV of current traditionalist Islam, of "fundamentalis", of Wahabi, Salafi, and Islamist Muslims -- but it is not the POV of non-Muslims, or of Muslim liberals and reformers. Part of the material in the article could go into the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_Islam_4b8a.html" title="Shi'a Islam">Shi'a Islam</a> article, as describing Shi'a belief, and part of it could go into <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">Caliph</a>, discussing early Muslim views of the authority of the caliph.</p>
<p>Crone makes a good argument that current-day Muslims fail to fully understand the fluid situation in the early days of the Islamic empire, in which the caliphs believed themselves to be entitled to deliver legal judgements and set precedents just as Muhammad had -- because they were his successors, and wielded his authority. Crone also points to the tremendous challenges faced by the new Islamic empire, in dealing with situations that were completely outside anything faced by Muhammad and raised questions not easily or quickly answered. The response, as many secular, academic scholars have observed, was to grant the early caliphs a great deal of legal authority, and also to adopt customary Byzantine and Sassanid law.</p>
<p>Crone is not the ultimate authority, and there are many academic historians who would disagree with her, but there is a dimension of this argument of which Striver and Ya Ali seem to be unaware. The article is basically a traditionalist Shi'a indictment of the first three caliphs. It deserves to be presented in Wikipedia, but in context, and in articles where alternate POVs can be presented. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:00, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<b>coment</b> actually, i now also oppose to change the name of the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I've tried to expand the article a bit. Note, however, that "Jesus Christ is risen today" is a <i>different</i> hymn. This article is about "Christ the Lord is risen today, Alleluia! Sons of men and angels say. Alleluia! Raise your joys and triumphs high, Alleluia! Sing, ye heavens, and earth reply, Allelulia!" The other hymn (which I at least know much better) is an anonymous translation of an anonymous Latin hymn, and it goes "Jesus Christ is risen today, Alleluia! Our triumphant holy day, Alleluia!

<p>In response to the above criticisims, I firstly reformatted the page to make it more formal and remove any hint of an adverising tone. Next, the arguement proposed that the firm in question is non-notable has to be discussed from several viewpoints.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, notability cannot simply be measured by how many internet hits and links one can find for it. Some companies, through either economical reasons or geographical inability, cannot be montioned or monitored on the internet regardless of how notable they may truely be.</li>
<li>Secondly, the word non-notable is in itself a highly relative term and depends purely on the views and experiances of the individual in question who makes the assurtion. This is often the case with grocery stores(and in this case language accuistion programmes) in which the notabilty depends highly on the geographical location of whoever is claiming the firm to be notable/non-notable. Shopper's Warehouse is highly notable in America whereas in Germany, where the firm doesn't exist, anyone would calim the firm as non-notable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the definition of an encyclopedia according to the merriam-webster's dictionary is, " a work that contains information on all branches of knowledge." and from dictionary.com, "A comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects." Looking at the definitions, one can see that wikipedia, the proclaimed "online and free encyclopedia" should be held to that definition. "All branches of knowledge" and "wide range of sujects" dictates that wikipedia should allow this page to be left online as it constitutes to a widening of the available knowledge on this site. Lastly, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia</a>, wikipedia's own mission statement, " Its(wikipedia) purpose is to create and distribute a free international encyclopedia in as many languages as possible." The mission statement itself states that the authors on wikipedia are merely expending it to encompass all ranges of topics. I am merely one such author. Bringing new information to this site helps not only people understand and gain more knowledge themselves, but may spur other people to add their own comments and pages, another one of wikipedia's goals. I am merely trying to provide people who may not have known about this company information, in the same way all other pages due. This response should bring to light the true intentions of this page, so once again, <b>Keep</b> -80.120.190.34</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> You can't vote twice. Looking at your revisions, it's just as much an advertisement for a non-notable company as it was, now it's merely not as much in the first person anymore (we do this, we do that). This is not a substantial enough revision for me to change my vote. ‚Äî<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 19:45, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Still feels advert. Same material you've got in German in your promotional page. The entry was done clearly to promote business. No serious references to double-check (URL, printed ISBN, besides reports in the general press press of its activities), to prove it has a place in the teaching history as it hints. Stating that an encyclopedia must contain everything at all is no argument.

The issue was discussed on the talk page of the main article and I've no idea why IP 4.250.138.52 chose to look back in the history and make a new article, just as I have deep questions about the original appearance of the manufacturing instructions added here (and on another explosive) on 30 April 2005 by IP 85.206.83.143 which is in Lithuania. There may also be some sense in advising appropriate authorities of the original source of the 'recipe'.

<p>I think this article results from an accidental misinterpretation of french.</p>
<p>I can find absolutely no mention of this goddess anywhere, and I think its an error resulting from translating a description of <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hathor.html" title="Hathor">Hathor</a> from french (sentait = <i>felt</i> i.e. <i>(one who) felt</i> in French), as much of the description is that of a form of hathor, with the "name" of "sentait" possibly being a title (as the french translation of the title).</p>
<p>"Sentait" also doesn't look very <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_language.html" title="Egyptian language">Egyptian</a> as a word. The only translations I can see are</p>
<ul>
<li>"brother-land-father" (i.e. <i>brother of the father-land</i> or <i>brother of the land's father</i>)</li>
<li>"kiss-land-father" (i.e. <i>(one who) kisses the fatherland</i> or <i>(one who) kisses the land's father</i>)</li>
<li>"sister-father" (i.e. <i>the father's sister</i> or <i>the sister's father</i>)</li>
<li>"sister-room" (i.e. <i>the sister's room</i> or <i>the room's sister</i>)</li>
<li>"sister-picture" (i.e. <i>the sister's picture</i> or <i>the picture's sister</i></li>
<li>"sister-my" (i.e. <i>my sister</i>), requiring double feminine ending (e.g. bastet rather than bast)</li>
</ul>
<p>none of which make much sense. [N.b. don't value my ability to translate it well, I'm not a professional Egyptologist].</p>

<p>This is my first votes for deletion vote, so please bear with me. I vote <b>keep</b>. Doing a Google search of Sentait goddess -Wikipedia comes up with a lot of sites which have this information, although admittedly not much more than that she was an Egyptian cow goddess. Now it's possible that they got their information from Wikipedia, but they don't say so. See <a href="http://www.alsirat.com/deathlore/deathgods/sentait.html" class="external free" title="http://www.alsirat.com/deathlore/deathgods/sentait.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alsirat.com/deathlore/deathgods/sentait.html</a>, <a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/s/sentait.html" class="external free" title="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/s/sentait.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantheon.org/articles/s/sentait.html</a>, <a href="http://www.aurochs.org/cows/famous/" class="external free" title="http://www.aurochs.org/cows/famous/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aurochs.org/cows/famous/</a>, and <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/12865/mray/pegy.htm" class="external free" title="http://library.thinkquest.org/12865/mray/pegy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://library.thinkquest.org/12865/mray/pegy.htm</a>, just from the first page of the Google results. I did do an image search, but it only came up with one image which is unlikely to be what we're interested in. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Barleycorn_399c.html" title="User:John Barleycorn">John Barleycorn</a> 23:58, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with Google searching is that
<ul>
<li>You also need to do -encyclopedia and -GFDL as some don't cite wikipedia (unfortunately also cutting out encyclopedias with original info)</li>
<li>When the article has been up for a while, you run into places where people have read the article on Wikipedia, and published it as part of their own sites, but in their own words</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The way to cut this out is to check exactly what they have written. It will tend to be virtually identical in substance to Wikipedia, sometimes refactored a bit, with no new information.</dd>
<dd>In particular, in this case, with Egyptian words there are usually a variety of spellings - e.g. set=seth=sutekh, nebt-het=nebhet=nepthys, bast=bastet=ubasti=pasht - due to the fact that the vowels are not completely known, and there was <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_change.html" title="Sound change">sound change</a> over the vast period of egyptian history. However, for this goddess there is only "sentait" which is very unusual, variations should exist, e.g. (this isn't necessarily a legitimate variation - it depends on what the hieroglyphs actually are) "sentejt", "snetajt", "senetajt" and "senetay-te", and there would at least be the greek version &amp; egyptian version which would be two different words (e.g. horus vs. har, isis vs aset, iusaaset vs. saosis).</dd>
<dd>So these articles are likely just to be from information that originated here, albeit indirectly.</dd>
<dd>In a way, if I created an article Hoger, about the cross between a horse and a tiger (c.f. <a href="../../../l/i/g/Liger.html" title="Liger">liger</a>), and it existed without people questioning it for a few years, then it would appear across the internet on people's own sites, rather than Wikipedia mirrors, particularly if it was difficult to verify - e.g. I said that Hoger's were rare, and only existed in antiquity, as the breeds of horse suitable have since died out.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I have tried searching google for the term (Sentait, and various different guesses at alternate spellings) before I put it up for VFD, but couldn't find a single mention that didn't seem like it had ultimately originated from somewhere other than here. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 21:34, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Essentially, from your list,
<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.aurochs.org/cows/famous/" class="external free" title="http://www.aurochs.org/cows/famous/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aurochs.org/cows/famous/</a> actually cites encyclopedia-mythica (pantheon.org) as its source</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>so these are all the same source - pantheon.org, like most such articles will be</dd>
<dd>and many articles from pantheon.org are basic copies from earlier versions of wikipedia articles (or vice versa, not sure which), making the same basic errors (e.g. treating one god as two, despite the fact that when you translate the names it is so obvious that you would never make the error)<a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 21:42, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>in fact, google search "sentait -wikipedia -mythica -encyclopedia -le" ("le" to cut out some of the french usage of the french word "sentait") only returns 606 articles, almost all of which are lists of gods copied from wikipedia etc. or french using the word "sentait", sa normal french word. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am not a professional and my resources are too limited; a newcomer too. For these reasons, I am not sure I should vote here (would have voted to delete though). But what I did, I additionally looked up Russian sites for religion and mythology of ancient Egypt. For what I was able to dig through in one day, I found no traces of anything even resembling the name <i>Sentait</i> (including whichever variations of "Sentait" in Russian or English I came up with&#160;:). For example, <a href="http://middleeast.org.ua/history/egypt.htm" class="external free" title="http://middleeast.org.ua/history/egypt.htm" rel="nofollow">http://middleeast.org.ua/history/egypt.htm</a> or <a href="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/036/599.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/036/599.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/036/599.htm</a> seem to contain credible research with numerous quotations and references to the sources such as translations of Egyptian papyri, museum exhibits, professionally reviewed publications or printed books by famous egyptologists. Among those, of older times: M. E. Mathieu (ru: –ú. –≠. –ú–∞—Ç—å–µ) or B. A. Turaev (ru: –ë. –ê. –¢—É—Ä–∞–µ–≤) or V. S. Golenischeff (see e.g. <a href="http://www.cesras.ru/eng/pers/pers.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.cesras.ru/eng/pers/pers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cesras.ru/eng/pers/pers.htm</a>); also other sources and more recent ones, as well. I am wondering if this new name for a goddess emerged on the Internet as the result of even newer research, but in this case especially, shouldn't one expect credible references to the sources. Of course I could have missed the obvious (must be well hidden!&#160;:) - would be great to have a professional step in. -<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrovert_e3fe.html" title="User:Introvert"><font color="#004161">Introvert</font></a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EIntrovert_66c0.html" title="User talk:Introvert"><font color="#004161"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 08:32, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> it! I feel so awful that someone wanted to initiate a deleting proposal for this entry. I found this Tao Yang did many interesting scientific researches such as: computational verb, physical linguistics, computational noun, to name a few. These concepts constitute a new science of matter and minds. I found this Tao Yang also did many applications of scientific principles to engineering problems, as well as many pure mathematical researches. These researches are very important to our knowledge base and therefore deserve to display in Wikipedia.222.69.229.68</li>

<li>Physics Letters A</li>
<li>International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos</li>
<li>IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</li>
<li>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems</li>
<li>International Journal of Circuit Theory and Applications</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Yang published many scientific papers in the above-mentioned journals.</p>
<p>Yang also published the following book:</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>TAO YANG, Impulsive Control Theory, Berlin: Spinger-Verlag, Aug. 2001, Lecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences, vol. 272, ISBN: 354042296X</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>by the well-known technical publisher [Spinger-Verlag]. It is an insult to such a famous publisher and its editors to the book serial "Lecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences" by calling any author of any book in this book serial a "folk scientist".</p>
<p>Yang had been worked in the [University of California, Berkeley] for more than 5 years as a visiting scholar. It is an insult to [University of California, Berkeley] if a "folk scientist" had been worked in one of its best department for such a long time.</p>
<p>It is also an insult to the Office of Technology Licensing, University of California, Berkeley, for they allowing a so-called "folk scientist" to gain the following patent:</p>

<li>Hm, an interesting, but somewhat paranoid twist to the story. I am quite a fan of Wikipedia (as proven by many hours of editing), so disrupting Wikipedia is not in my interest.

<li>Paranoid: you've already created Prejudice (islam) and Prejudices (islam) articles, now both up for VfD, as well as attempting to re-create the successfully VfD'd Islamophilia article (an article which has been speedily deleted three times now). All these pages seem to contain content related to the protected <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> article. Again, I ask that you focus on compromising and contributing to existing articles rather than rushing to create new articles whenever and whevever you can.

<li><b>Keep</b> To be fair, Ville (MC Babushka) is actually a real important symbol in the global Oasis community. He used to be a big staple in the Brit Pop scene in the late 90s and was always spotted among the more promenent Europeans during release parties. He's not just some "forum user" as some people would like to describe him. I'm trying to look for my article from Q Magazine a few years back so I could show you that he was briefly mentioned in an Oasis article. It was something about how obessesive he was with the band and how he wouldn't eat/sleep until they came to Helsinki to perform. Out of sympathy, the band invited him to a few parties and shows in the UK and that's when he started to get some attention. I think he's a small part of British pop culture, but I vote he stays TheSunTheSea

<p>In regards to Mikka's comments: Yes, I agree that a groupie is not notable enough to be featured on an encyclopedia, but when a band such as Oasis dedicates a song to a person such as Ville, I think it's quite notable. How many "groupies" do you know of that have a song dedicated to them? In case you're wondering, Oasis wrote a song a few years ago called "Wonderwall". I suggest you check it out --TheSunTheSea</p>
<p>KEEP! How dare you consider even deleting this page. Ville is a legend and a godsend and w/out question a reason for Oasis' career lasting so on. He also is a legend in the wrestling circle. Back in 1999 the WWF was doing a house show in Turku, Finland. Babu was there and The Big Show was doing a fan challenge and he got into the ring and CHOKESLAMMED the 7 foot, 500+ pound Big Show. This would not only be a disservice to virgins and Oasis fans everywhere, but to humankind itself. Keep MC Babushka. He's also a musical artist and has created several albums, mostly of Finnish bippity boppity crap music, but he tries at least.

<p>Hmm...I don't think this Mikka character is for real. Seriously though, the facts I mentioned alone merits MC Babushka's spot on Wikipedia. That's just my two cents. -- TheSunTheSea</p>

<li>I disagree. You are underestimating Goshen's importance and quite frankly, I find that very offensive. We'll see who's not "notable" outside of one "small town" in New York when Governor Maerz is sworn in in 2007.

<li>Oh please, stop wasting my time. The guy is an activist that Google has never heard of. He comes from a town in New York with less than 13,000 people living in it, and the article about him establishes no notability outside who his wife and children are, and the fact that he might one day run for Mayor of New York for a political party that no-one has ever heard of.

<li>Again, you're failing to do your research. It is a run for <i>Governor</i>, not Mayor, that Mr. Maerz is considering, and I already linked you to an article that establishes Mr. Maerz's prominent seat on the board of directors for the successful Open Space Coalition.

<li>Would prefer a <b>delete</b> but will settle for redirect. Despite its pretensions, the article makes no attempt to reference its claims and reads like a personal essay. There's barely a single assertion that can't be immediately questioned eg <i>Charvas often stay within their own 'clan', and gang fights can be common, again backing up the theory of mild US influence</i>. What is a charva 'clan'? Are their fights common or not? Whose theory are we talking about?

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> with chav..

BTW, we shouldn't keep bad articles because <i>others are doing it</i>.

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a>. I've never quite understood why this merited a seperate article from <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a> in the first place. I've lost count of the number of different names I've heard depending on the part of the country being talked about. Neither "chav" or "charva" are the terms used where I come from, but "chav" is the one that's been picked up by the national media. While there may be regional variations I don't see that chavs of one part of the country are totally unrelated to charvas of another part. The article also has quite a POV problem: "<i>Charvas are widely thought in the North as the scum of British youth today.</i>" Presumably the charvas themselves don't take this view. The article's blanket statements about charvas almost remind me of the 1911 EB's country articles talking about the "national character" of somewhere. Compare "<i>Most charvas are considered to be unintelligent, and rarely show any intelligence that they may have, in order to look good around their mates.</i>", "<i>Socially charvas are seen as dis-obedient with a mind of their own.</i>" and "<i>Although some can be reasonable, most commit crimes.</i>", with "<i>If the Chinese character is inferior to the European, this inferiority lies in the fact that the Chinaman's whole philosophy of life disinclines him to change or to energetic action. He is industrious; but his industry is normally along the lines marked out by authority and tradition. He is brave; but his courage does not naturally seek an outlet in war.</i>" I think we'd do well to have all this stuff under one article so it can be kept in a reasonable state. No one is saying we can't talk about regional differences, so this is a merge, not a delete. ‚Äî <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 18:18, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comments</b>: There seems to be some confusion as to why this article is on VfD. I certainly didn't vote as I did because of the POV issues alone, as should be clear from my previous comments. I hope, and indeed believe, that nobody else did either. As of now, it's unlikely that I'll vote either way in the Ned VfD since I don't want to spend my time reading up on that term, but in the case of charva I hold the firm opinion that it's not different enough from chav to have its own article. The thing that could change that would be new facts being unearthed that point to more differences, but that hasn't happened yet. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/d/User_talk%7EEldKatt_f6fd.html" title="User talk:EldKatt">Talk</a>)</small> 07:58, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Keep it" Because it has the potential to be a serious article. Well...as serious as something related to fark.com can be, at least. But really, have you seen some of the crap contained in Wikipedia? You're going to delete the Ha, Ha! Guy and keep all those other just-as-lame-and-deletion-possible items? Wtf? Just keep the article, police/edit it for about a week, maybe the next two to four days. It'll be fine. Look, if you're going to delete the damn thing, and I don't think you should, at least list it with fark.com somehow. Maybe add a list of the cliches, if there isn't one already. It deserves to be kept because it's funny and because the admins have a bug up their butt at the moment about it. That's really the only reason why you're getting so much traffic on it in the first place. I can assure you that the discussion page does NOT reflect the average farker. The average farker's MENTALITY, but not the average farker. There are those of us who post to fark.com who know how badly it sucks, know how out-of-control and cough-syrup happy the adminstrators and moderators are, and yet simply don't care. And why is that? Because every once in awhile, something comes along that makes us laugh, and we end up forgetting how badly the site needs a rework and how much it needs to have new admins and mods put on the site. The "Ha, Ha!" guy is one of those things that makes us forget. And when we post to fark.com, we like to forget. Trust us. Wait...what was I saying? --68.158.111.148 00:52, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - the subject seems non-notable non-encyclopedic, For a supposedly online phenomena... a Google search for "Ha Ha Guy" yields a paltry 207 hits, limiting the search to <i>site:fark.com</i> reduces this number to two in minor forum postings, and a news search produces no results. Whether it could develop into a serious article or not is not the issue IMO, it is the importance, significance, and widespread recognition of the subject of the article, which just appear to not exist. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 01:20, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep it</b></s> The argument for the deletion of this entry seems to center on the relative insignificance of the entry. But consider this - I actually went on Wikipedia to investigate this "clich√©", looking for some history or background, and was genuinely interested in what the article had to say. Isn't this what Wikipedia was meant for? I imagine that there are others like me that would be out of luck searching for the article if it were deleted. In terms of significance, I maintain that you must put the article in perspective. There are stubs for geographical locations in Wikipedia that have received far less visits or interest, yet no one disputes their validity of being included in Wikipedia. I will hazard a guess that this clich√© will appear time and time again (now that it has been born as a meme). Removing the article therefore would be a disservice to the community at large. --<a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigizen_3647.html" title="User:Digizen">Digizen</a> 02:23, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> -- More like a question, someone has started a new article entitled <a href="../../../h/a/%21/HA%21_HA%21_guy_88a6.html" title="HA! HA! guy">HA! HA! guy</a> which is supposed to be more encyclopedic. Is this merely a sad attempt to evade the Vfd, or is does the new atricle merit keeping? I am tending toward the former, a vanity page by a new name is still vanity, and the fundamental question is still whether <b>Ha Ha Guy</b> should have its own article on Wikipedia, although it would be ashame to totally lose this original research.. thoughts? --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 13:08, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep It</b> -- Although the article is in need of a little work. Specifically, the origins of the picture should be at the begining and perhaps a seperate entry should then be created for the "pop phenomenon" it caused on several forums accross the net. The whole concept of clich√® images that appear on web forums is very interesting and should researched and documented further. mikepickens

<dd>Uncle G said that this page you are nominating is called an disambiguation article. If there are more than one thing that uses the name or initials, then the article is turned into a list. Example, I type in football. But there are more than one type of football, so it gives a list asking me what specific article I want to look it.
