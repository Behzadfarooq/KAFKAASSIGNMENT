<p>Aajonus Vonderplanitz was created last October by an anonymous user, 212.135.222.212. On January 28 it was nominated for deletion in a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Primal_Diet_ab8a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Primal Diet">shared AFD</a>, along with the related article <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primal_Diet_375f.html" title="Primal Diet">Primal Diet</a> (Mr. Vonderplanitz is apparently the inventor of Primal Diet). The AFD discussion concluded with a delete result applied to both articles, although <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primal_Diet_375f.html" title="Primal Diet">Primal Diet</a> was immediately recreated as a redirect to <a href="../../../r/a/w/Raw_foods_diet.html" title="Raw foods diet">raw foods diet</a> by one of the AFD participants. About 6 weeks after its deletion per AFD, Aajonus Vonderplanitz too was recreated (by an editor who was likely unaware of the previous versions and deletion). This recreation was speedily deleted, and the editor appealed for review at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>. In this <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;oldid=47804686#Aajonus_Vonderplanitz" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;oldid=47804686#Aajonus_Vonderplanitz" rel="nofollow">discussion, which I have just closed</a></span>, a substantial majority felt that the speedy deletion should be reversed (± relisted on AFD for discussion). I am listing the page here as there are good arguments on both sides of the issue, and I hope we may come to a consensus on whether the subject merits an encyclopedic a entry.

<li><b>Delete</b> crank proponent of crank theory (including raw meat in a raw food diet, stating that it confers total health). Most references seem to be blatant promotion. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:22, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> According to Wikipedia rule the truth of a theory has no importance respect to the presence of it in wikipedia. Aajonus Vonderplanitz has a strong (wide and stable-many years) base, mainly in California, plus his work is influencing raw food diet. Aajonus Vonderplanitz is very well known in raw food circles, and deserve his space on this encyclopedia. Was a major figure in changing the law in California legalizing raw milk and there are plenty of references to his work from his books to interviews he gave (and the legal papers of the previous trial). I also want to point out that there is a serious effort from <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">User:JzG</a> to keep this article and its sister <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primal_diet.html" title="Primal diet">primal diet</a> article from appearing. While someone else (always a different person!) keeps on making it again. The presence of so many people who independently desire this article should be reason enough for it to be given a fair chance to exist long enough to collect the necessary information--<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietrosperoni_fa82.html" title="User:Pietrosperoni">Pietrosperoni</a> 09:03, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is a serious effort from me to keep <i>all</i> minor crackpot theories and their proponents from appearing on Wikipedia. I know you take this issue personally, the fact that some people are strongly non-neutral is one reason the articles are problematic in the first place, but do not make the mistake of believing that this particular crank theory gets any more attention from me than any other. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:06, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, he's a published author who's obviously had enough exposure to qualify under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 13:47, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Aajonus Vonderplanitz is a published author and his name frequently turns up in searches for raw food diet in major search engines. It would seem amiss if Wikipedia did not cover this person. Also there are people who adhere to this raw food diet. This diet is not mainstream and that in itself makes it interesting enough to warrant keeping it so that it can be available to people who want to find out more about it. Admittedly the Wikipedia article on this needs work, references and etc, but more time is needed to do that properly. <a href="../../../g/t/l/User%7EGtlim75_bd75.html" title="User:Gtlim75">Gtlim75</a> 14:51, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Aajonus Vonderplanitz has a valid California nutritionist's license and he has very practical nutritional protocols that work excellently for a large proportion of people with whom he consults. I have been eating his raw food diet for over 8 years and have greatly improved health as a result. His gound-breaking and far-sighted work merits a place in Wikipedia.-=thetasig=- 21:22, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Crackpot, but notable as such in my opinion. Article will probably need constant monitoring to make sure it's not de-NPOVed. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 21:28, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Notable crackpot. The presence of an article on a marginal theory does not endorse the validity of that theory. This guy has generated <i>just</i> enough noise to make himself interesting, if unbelievable. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 02:19, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> Good thing I checked the article again! No one notified me that it had been relisted. I started the article (apparently for the second time, as I had no idea it had been started and deleted previously), therefore obviously I support keeping. BTW, IMHO while Vonderplanitz certainly might have some unusual ideas (at least from some individuals' perspectives), he is certainly not a "crackpot." Just misunderstood.&#160;;) <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 21:56, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As someone else stated he is a published author that meets the criteria that is listed under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. As the article now stands it briefly tells who Aajonus is and does not promote his diet. It seems quite objective at this time and should be monitered to make sure it stays objective. The person asking for it to be deleted claims that it is a "crank theory." In science, theories are not proven, they are disproven. Please disprove with "neutral" evidence.DJCupples 23:09, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.
