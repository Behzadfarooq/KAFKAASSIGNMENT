<p><b>Vote: Keep</b>: It's a very interesting product that appears to be genuine and in production/development. The article is discussing a new technology that could benefit a lot of computer users, thus it has encyclopediac integrity and merit. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardbooth_bdaa.html" title="User:Richardbooth">Richardbooth</a> 01:12, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Advertisement</b>. The article is nothing but an ad for a product that doesn't even exist yet. As for the novelty value of the described product, keyboards with programmable LCD keytops were already available many (15?) years ago. <a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENaddy_8480.html" title="User:Naddy">Naddy</a> 11:41, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Vote: keep</b>.</p>
<p>Artemy Lebedev studio may have not well been known outside of Russia, but it is a very solid manufacturer. I genuinely do not believe that the studio would publish an article on something they did not actually work on. I think the "vaporware" claims, at least as far as accusations of publicity frauds, are not justified.</p>
<p>As for the argument that it is a prototype, I have seen hundreds of entries in Wikipedia about concept ideas by other companies, including car manufacturers like GM or Ford, or not-yet-released software, including those who already HAVE proved themselves vaporware (ahem <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Nukem_Forever_0d65.html" title="Duke Nukem Forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a>. Why don't we go and delete that?</p>
<p>I think the article should be given a chance. It perhaps should be modified, more directly emphasizing the fact that no physical keyboard exists, and/or warn about dangers of vaporware. But simply deleting an interesting article about an informative concept design is displaying bias and triggerhappyness. (<a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvarg_4b5f.html" title="User:Elvarg">Elvarg</a> 18:38, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Vote: delete</b>. It is only an artist's concept, and only vaporware. It should not be even mentioned as a 'product' or 'prototype', because it does not exist in physical form. If it is kept, it should be in a "Future Keyboard Artist's Concepts" section.</p>
<p><b>Vote: keep</b>. This product very innovative, good idea, and current "event". Maybe vaporvare, but I don't think so.</p>
<p><b>Vote: keep</b>: If it is in advertising style, let's change it. It's an interesting idea (albeit not entirely new), and the article gave useful information (for example: I didn't realise the pictures were cg renderings). The article on <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-cola.html" title="Coca-cola">coca-cola</a> isn't considered an advert, and other future devices exist on WP, so lets keep this interesting technology page, albeit tweaked a little for encyc. style. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMat-C_07e7.html" title="User:Mat-C">Mat-C</a> 11:45, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Vote: keep</b>: This is arguably an advertisement, but could easily be edited to broaden its scope. The advertisement is continued in a number of places on Wikipedia, including two mentions to itself on the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_keyboard.html" title="Computer keyboard">Computer Keyboard</a> page (an image <i>and</i> a link at the bottom), so these should perhaps be removed.

<p><b>Vote: Delete</b>: What is the point of this article? It doesn't seem apropriate to have an article about a single product (not a broader technology) that doesn't exist yet, and therefore has not historical or cultural importance. While I agree that this could be of technological interest, if that is the point of this article, then a broader article about the technology itself, not an individual product would be the right way to go.</p>

<li><b>Vote: Keep</b>: But change the title to something like "Reconfigurable Computer Keyboard", rearrange the structure to minimize the brand placement, and imply that most graphical keycap keyboards have turned out to vaporware, but in 2005, company X announced theirs would use the new OLED technology, but as of July 2005, the only visible evidence of the Optimus keyboard is a computer generated rendition. Then, future changes could say either, "the first working prototype was shown at the 2007 CES in Las Vegas" or "as of July 2007, it appears that the Optimus keyboard also turned out to be vaporware." <a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 16:27, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

I'm a programmer by trade and have been using computers throughout my (admittely young) life, and this is the first I've heard of OLED/LCD-top keyboards.
