<li><b>Keep</b> Like many others have noted, this article should be given a chance to develop more. It's as simple as that. If it's still a fluke in one to two weeks or so, then I recommend a merge. In terms of notability, Boyd qualifies for several valid reasons already mentioned, including it's numerous press references, attention, relative size (biggest nationally almost), band, and the like. Finally, seeing as McKinney is apparantly the fastest growing city in the nation, I'd expect it's three high schools to be covered in some detail. And Soltak, it makes absolutely no differences whatsoever WHO wrote it. It could be a dog for all anyone cares. The important thing is the relevance, accuracy, and contribution it makes to Wikipedia as a whole. For that reason, I question you motives behind even mentioning your theories on the author. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewtheart_6f71.html" title="User:Andrewtheart">Andrewtheart</a> 04:26, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Andrewtheheart and and the other keep-sayers. This article needs a chance to develop more. I didn't intentionly post the rosters for name-dropping reasons, although i didn't know that you weren't able to post records, <s>I guess I could have just put "The Football Team experienced an unsuccessful first season, with not a single win."</s> And yes Soltak, I'm a student that attends MBHS. The last time I checked it wasn't against the rules for students to create/edit articles here on wikipedia or to be bold in editting. For those of you that don't know, a marching band that made sweeptakes at UIL and advanced to the finals at the Denton Golden Triangle its first year is a very difficult task to accomplish, thus making the band alone notable enough to have its own article. This School is also making tremendous progress in the academic field and in its extracurricular programs. The only reason you saw blank sections is because I was on break when I created this and therefore was not able to get citable information from the club sponsors themselves. I say give this article some time, and it will expand enough to become worthy enough to be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadernet_f2d6.html" title="User:Zadernet"><b><font color="black">Zader</font></b></a><a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadernet_Concordia_c1a6.html" title="User:Zadernet/Concordia"><b><font color="blue">n</font></b></a><a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadernet_f2d6.html" title="User:Zadernet"><b><font color="black">et</font></b></a> 10:34, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
