<li><b>Comment</b>: But Uncle, the last time I looked at it, "<a href="../../../s/c/a/Scatolinguistics.html" title="Scatolinguistics">Scatolinguistics</a>" claimed to be the study of "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">Profanity</a>". Now, while sociology is the study of society and sociology should most certainly claim its own article (articles, actually), I don't see why there's either a general need to have an article on X and another purportedly on the study of X -- particularly when the "study" barely exists. (Let's see -- is there a peer-reviewed <i>British Journal of Scatolinguistics</i>, or a West Coast Conference on Scato-Linguistics?) Instead, it very much looks to me as if this is a new (and inferior) attempt at what has already been done in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">Profanity</a>. But OK, if the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scatolinguistics.html" title="Scatolinguistics">Scatolinguistics</a> article is worth preservation, how would you like to see its future relationship with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">Profanity</a>? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 11:32, 2005 Jan 10 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Thank you for the reasoned and interesting reply, which I'm still digesting. In the meantime, one clarification.

The worries about fittingness have nothing whatever to do with squeamishness or prudeness. I have no qualms at all about the intelligent use of the word <i>fuck</i> on Wikipedia; indeed, I used it myself in contributions to <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expletive.html" title="Expletive">Expletive</a> (which I now see has a worrying degree of overlap with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">Profanity</a>). -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:34, 2005 Jan 11 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>It is not a neologism</i>. <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> himself said that the term exists.

It may be linguistic <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jargon.html" title="Jargon">jargon</a>, but since a Google Groups search reveals that others have since adopted its use, and feel no need to explain the word when they do, it is not a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> any more. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:46, 2005 Jan 10 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed, fair enough. I withdraw my comment that it is a neologism. My vote remains, however, since neologism or not, it's a very, very, VERY rarely-used word, and this article seems unlikely to be the palest ghost of what's already located at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">Profanity</a>, <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a> and elsewhere. Since I can't imagine any information applicable to "Scatolinguistics" but not to "profanity", I don't understand what could ever be presented in this article.

<li>My own Google Groups search revealed only five posts with the word (and four of those hits are the same quote used in the now-modified article), which does not attest widespread use. There is only one hit for the corresponding adjective "scatolinguistic". It may technically not be a neologism since it was invented about 40 years ago, but if somebody invents a word and it is barely used at all for decades (even within the field in which it was invented), I fail to see why we should distinguish it from a neologism. They don't feel the need to explain it because it is an easily recognizable <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> word, like if I made up a word like, say, "dentolinguistics" for the study of different words for teeth. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 17:08, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>(Only one of the hits is the quote used in the article. The others don't actually contain quotes.) You are trying to claim that if something isn't notable, it is a neologism. That doesn't wash, I'm afraid. If you want to argue notability, argue <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> directly. (And if you are going to argue non-notability on the grounds of limited interest, which is what you apparently will be, please explain why all of those H2G2 readers won't be interested in what scatolinguistics is.) Don't argue that something isn't a neologism, but since you don't deem it to be notable it "really is" a neologism regardless. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:46, 2005 Jan 10 (UTC)</li>

<li>We get so many non-notable words here on VfD though that the "neologism" argument is pretty much short for "some word that was made up by some individual(s) and hasn't gained widespread use", i.e. a non-notable word. I suppose our terminology isn't technically correct. In any case my argument was that this is a non-notable word, not that it is a recent coinage, because such words are perfectly welcome so long as they are actually used by a sizable group of people. The notability of the name of a field of study is easy to measure: does anybody in that field refer to it as such? So far, I see no evidence of scatolinguists or their scatolinguistic texts, although there is a significant amount of study done on profane words (I'm a linguistics student and I've seen it). I would not declare unencyclopedic an article about the study of profane words, but it would need a clearer and more recognizable title, and since this article explains little more than the meaning and source of the word itself (i.e. a dicdef), I think it should be deleted. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 21:51, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, by that I mean that an educated person (the type of people reading the few articles on the linguistics of profanity in which the word is used) could probably meaningfully guess what it means by decomposing it into its constituent words, but I imagine there are many laymen who don't know what "scatological" means or who would not be able to readily decompose it. I think a more conventional title ("Study of profanity" or somesuch) would be overall more readily understandable and appropriate for the subject, but I really don't see why an explanation of it should exist outside the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">profanity</a> article. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 07:56, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>One linguist. Great. Do you have any idea how many thousands of semi-prominent linguists there are and the thousands of words they invent for certain concepts that never really catch on in the field?

<dd>The subject obviously exists (!), but it's not called <i>scatolinguistics</i> by linguists. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 02:54, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I forgot to mention, the etymology of the prefix <i>scat</i> doesn't really match the wider topic implied by the article, so even the name of this non-area of linguistic study is linguistically dodgy. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 23:00, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The expansion of the term was <i>already mentioned</i> in the article as it stood when you last commented on it. I even mentioned as much in my original talk page comment on the original article. Please keep up. I also note that there seems to be a lot of work published in the field for such a "non-area of study". The editors of the various books and articles referenced seem to be studying this area of linguistics quite thoroughly. A claim that this is a non-area of linguistic study, when Wikipedia itself has several examples of works in this field, is laughable. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:33, 2005 Jan 12 (UTC)</li>

<li>The label is etymologically incorrect and mentioning this in the article doesn't solve the problem. Please stop trying to cloud the issue by implying (inaccurately btw) that I've not read the article or am not "keeping up". So far as the linked references go, the BBC story contains a journalist's offhand use of the term, and the other two employ it similarly, in a tentative, almost humorous context. Obviously, linguists have deeply studied these sorts of words, that's not the point of this VfD. The question is, does a recognized field of linguistic study called <i>scatolinguistics</i> exist in the peer-reviewed literature? The answer very much appears to be <i>no</i>. Finally, referring to other articles in WP that may themselves be candidates for VfD is not a convincing reason to keep this one. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 02:47, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I originally started this article, but I readily admit that I had no idea what I was doing and that the H2G2 entry is infinitely better. I've always used the word 'scatolinguistics', but I don't know where I've heard it. Please delete it if you like; I readily defer to your undoubtedly superior judgement. The alleged topic of scatolinguistics has always been a favourite of mine and I was prompted to write something about it because of my extreme interest in the field. I like to undertake informal studies at my high school and compare things like British and American usage and male versus female usage. But what can I say. I'm just a teenager, I'm a relative newcomer to Wikipedia, the H2G2 entry is so much better than I could ever manage (I just reread it today actually) and I defer to the superior judgement of you who are so experienced in this regard. The Administrators should remove this embarrassment of mine from the compendium of knowledge that is Wikipedia before it causes any more problems. I blush in shame. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchomikeromeo_cbbc.html" title="User:Echomikeromeo">echomikeromeo</a> 04:22, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Spoken like (a bit too much of) a gentleman, Echomikeromeo. Meanwhile, it was I who stuck the VfD notice on your original article. But it was nothing personal, and there no hard feelings, I hope: after all, subsequent discussion reminded me of the amazing and enjoyable articles in <i><a href="http://www.benjamins.com/cgi-bin/t_bookview.cgi?bookid=Z%2063" class="external text" title="http://www.benjamins.com/cgi-bin/t_bookview.cgi?bookid=Z%2063" rel="nofollow">Studies out in Left Field</a></i>. (If you've never studied any linguistics, parts of them will be incomprehensible -- but you should understand, enjoy, and even learn from others. So do look out for the book.) Please don't let the critical treatment of this article of yours discourage you from writing others. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:15, 2005 Jan 15 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, it's been brought to my attention that I somehow managed to delete a large portion of this VfD section's content while I was editing the other day. It was accidental, and I'm dismayed. It happened again just now as I was trying to leave this message. My regular browser client sometimes does similar things when it has been up and running for a long time, and WP has been having server problems lately, so I suspect it was for one or both of those reasons. My apologies to all for any inconvenience or confusion this may have caused, and thanks for your patience (and to <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> for catching it!). <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 03:29, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>No problem. As your comment was cut-off in mid-sentence, I didn't think the deletion was intentional. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 03:45, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
