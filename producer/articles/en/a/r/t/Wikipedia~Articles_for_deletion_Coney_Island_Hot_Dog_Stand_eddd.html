<li><b>Delete - sort of</b>. First of all, please refrain from using wording such as "speedy keep" and "wiki stalking nomination". That implies bad faith on behalf of the nominator, when Kyaa is clearly not a bad-faith editor. This object clearly exists but the sources provided do not <i>currently</i> show it to be of anything other than local notability: I doubt that this passes <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>: I also doubt that you could write a featured article on this topic, and if sufficient data is not present for that then there probably shouldn't be n independant article in this first place. Of course, if more <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> are provided that show this thing to be of more than local notability, then things are different. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup> 15:29, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The general notability criterion says that "A topic is notable if it has sufficient, independent works that are reliable and can act as the basis for an encyclopedic article." The USA Today "article" isn't much more than a passing mention and provides little context. Three of the other articles are, seemingly, local news stories that don't affirm encyclopedic notability. As far as the Rocky Mountain News article is concerned, that article is all about the move and provides no encyclopedic context for us to use, as indeed are quite a few of the others. Indeed, I would say that as far as we have any notability asserted the <i>move</i> of the object is more notable than the object itself. As far as I can see the TV programme made only passing mention of this. Furthermore, three of the articles cited are by the same person. I do not think the primary notability criterion is satisfied. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup> 15:58, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> It is an oddball, but it is very similar to the earlier Tale o the Pup in spirit, albeit not identical. The notability guidelines stress the uniqueness of design, not how interesting the object can be. If just being interesting was a primary notability guideline, we'd have articles on all the funny Paul Bunyons and such which are better suited for a website like Roadside America. <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Moreschi discusses the media coverage better than I could above. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 16:12, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Question</b> Would you please point to the specific guideline language underlining "the uniqueness of design"? Could you further explain how to judge uniqueness (as these are not identical designs) in a way that is not subjective? --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:46, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Done: "In a few rare cases, an individual location will also have architectural peculiarities that makes it unique and notable." The first giant hot dog, unique. Another giant hot dog, built 20 years later is not unique. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 23:06, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This line of argument seems to be going off-track from the primary notability standards. Regardless if it is of "unique design" or not, there is now an abundant amount of published works about the subject. Just because it doesn't satisfy the single "unique design" criterion doesn't mean it doesn't pass others like <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.

<dl>
<dd>Unique design is a key portion of WP:CORP when dealing with gimmicky restaurants like this. The primary reason this hot dog stand has a wikipedia article is due to its unusual design.... Moreschi's statements about the news articles being cited not providing encyclopedic context for this hot dog stand continue to be unaddressed, and add to the question of the stand meeting WP:NOTE. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 07:55, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Published works about the subject is the primary criterion of WP:CORP. Whether any editor's POV is that the design is not unique is completely irrelevent. All the references cited support the encyclopedic content in the article. Some my not think it's "encyclopedic", but WP guildlines dissagrees with that. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 08:05, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Once again, I refer you to Moreschi's question about whether the primary notability guideline is met. Is the object notable or is the movement of the object notable? Are there multiple, non-trivial independent sources? As Moreschi showed, the answer is "no". <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 08:20, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The answer is "yes". And it's the subject that's notable. There would be no story about the move without the notable subject. That's why multiple non-trivial independent sources are written about it. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 08:27, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please address the concerns as to why the movement of a fast food restaurant makes it notable and encyclopedic raised by Moreschi. Hundreds of other buildings are moved, why are they not notable for the same rationale? The article for Tail o the Pup claims it was built in 1946(although the claim is unsourced, but I'll AGF on the part of whoever added that date since it was prior to this AfD), which would make it the first "giant hotdog shaped" hot dog stand and this an imperfect copy. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 23:40, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please restrict your opinion to this article Kyaa, not the Tail O The Pup article. This article does not claim notability by being the first of anything, it claims notability for appearance in a movie and being the subject of some media attention. If you feel that is not enough to pass notability, great, please state your case. I'm sorry to be so blunt, but I'm not a fan of <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> arguments, and I believe you have now brought up the <a href="../../../t/a/i/Tail_O%27_the_Pup_6062.html" title="Tail O' the Pup">Tail O' the Pup</a> article about 3 or 4 times now, and it is not the article at issue in any way. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 02:09, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> per Dhartung, and for having more than one non-trivial secondary source (yes, USAToday and the Rocky Mountain News are non-trivial, although obviously we would all be happier with a published book or journal article on regional landmarks).
