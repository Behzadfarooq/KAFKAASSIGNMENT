<p>PennyGWoods, I've been away for a while not arguing on Wikipedia and the debate has long ended, so I'll just answer whatever crap you managed to spew and hope you read it. "Okay, then when was the golden age of hip-hop?" Already covered this. "your little b-boys are going to keep your little toy" Hip-hop <b>is</b> a young man's sport. Don't be bitter. ""HEY! COME VOTE!" (as evidenced by the user pages). " Politicians do the same thing. Do you bitch about them? "You're irrelevant to me." Misanthrope much? "Get the fuck outta here with your gay ass e-thuggin shit." Have you heard of irony yet? "Be sure to write an article about how Jay-Z is the greatest rapper ever, since MTV says so." Has the bug up your ass been liberated yet? "if me pointing out that your people broke policy bothers you so much," There's a "Stop Snitching" movement, don't you know?</p>
<p>You're a bitter, vengeful dumbass. Next time, try and argue like a human being, not like an emotionally crippled moron. <a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModulatum_dd33.html" title="User:Modulatum"><font size="1" face="verdana" color="#00A7EE">MOD</font></a> 16:53, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_golden_age_of_hip_hop_bfa8.html" title="Edit section: Vote research">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Vote research</span></h2>
<p>Let's look at this little tally, shall we?</p>
<p>Rockero, Audacity, Chubdub, Ted87, Graphic, Big.p, Tutmosis, Jaranda, LaPizza11, Modulatum, W juice, Jalabi99, Dragoonmac, PDTantisocial, Carlitosrosario, Mrblondnyc, Can't Sleep and Furious Freddy were ALL votes fished for by PONY. (LILVOKA was also fished for, but the comment is unsigned.) Out of all of them, only FuriousFreddy (delete) spoke out about it. Everyone else, who stayed quiet, voted "keep" <b>This can be verified simply by looking at the Talk pages of the voters.</b></p>
<p>Jhamez84, Nagle, DavidGC, and Lotheric don't seem to have been called over by anyone. They voted "keep" MasterofNinja and ulayiti, also seem to be scandal-free; they voted "delete". Tim Ivorson called Urthogie over. I assume this is because he was the primary author, so I wouldn't call it a fish (plus I don't think Tim voted).</p>
<p>Sure is strange how veteran Wikipedians are so quick to point out other Wiki policies in this thread, but ignore the one that clears shows that this was an orchestrated movement (note to <a href="../../../p/2E/o/User%7EP.O.N.Y._8fdd.html" title="User:P.O.N.Y.">User:P.O.N.Y.</a>: try email next time). And it's even stranger that I had to be the one to do all the tallying, as opposed to an actually moderator or bureaucrat. While I don't feel that all of fished votes are equally accountable just because some nut job tapped them on the shoulder, <i>not a single one of them</i> before FuriousFreddy said a thing about it; they simply showed up and voted. For THAT, they are partially responsible, and should be reprimanded as such.</p>
<p>I am also not suggesting that the article should be deleted BECAUSE of this movement. But I DO think that all of the nudged votes - save for Urthogie (the PA) and FuriousFreddy (who spoke up) should be tossed, and all nudged voters be banned from further discussion concerning this particular AfD. Otherwise, I can get a great big list of Wikipedians and steer them towards this "debate". I'm sure we all could. <b>That's why you're not supposed to do it.</b> PennyGWoods 06:08, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can you explain what's wrong with asking people interested in a subject, and part of its wikiproject, to take part in a controversial AFD? also, if you want to be so picky about policy, how about we discuss how you put in little/no effort on discussing deletion on the talk page, assuming that you were the voice of truth on all things wikipedia.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 08:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, it's <i>GUICE</i>. you should try reading people's names correctly before you toss around accusations of vote-fishing just because your dead-in-the-water attempt to delete an article on an extremely important topic was seen as stupid by most people in WP:HH. <a href="../../../w/_/g/User%7EW_guice_dd47.html" title="User:W guice">W guice</a> 11:05, 30 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't care what your name is. You're irrelevant to me. Most of the people here were summoned here, and that's against policy. Period. No one cares if you don't understand it or not - it's not allowed. And if what you all pulled was okay, you wouldn't have a problem with me shedding a light on it. Why are your backs all up, if what you did was okay? PennyGWoods 20:33, 30 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you would take your time to read all the comments PennyGwood, instead of getting upset about the fact that this article is going to stay, you would see that everyone <a href="../../../p/2E/o/User%7EP.O.N.Y._8fdd.html" title="User:P.O.N.Y.">User:P.O.N.Y.</a> "summoned" *rolls eyes* here actually gave a clear explanation for their vote which shows that their intentions are genuine instead of like you say, voted because some "nut job tapped them on the shoulder". If all the users you mentioned had voted <i>Keep</i> without a comment then you would have an arguement. Also, indirectly calling <a href="../../../p/2E/o/User%7EP.O.N.Y._8fdd.html" title="User:P.O.N.Y.">User:P.O.N.Y.</a> a "nut job" is quite insulting and if you consider yourself a "veteran wikipedian who does not ignore policy" than I suggest reading <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_be_a_dick_6caa.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't be a dick">Wikipedia:Don't be a dick</a> again. <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>- Tutmosis</small></a> 21:50, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Boo hoo hoo, i'm not going to get my delete nomination passed. *shrug* i could give a fuck if you care what my name is or if you get it right. i think if people's backs are up it's presumably because you're being an arrogant trolling fuck rather than that they have a guilty conscience over some miasmic vote-rigging allegation. so yeh, throw your toys out of the pram all you want, you haven't got a leg to stand on and you know it <a href="../../../w/_/g/User%7EW_guice_dd47.html" title="User:W guice">W guice</a> 07:52, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Get the fuck outta here with your gay ass e-thuggin shit. You were the main one crying like the bitch you are over a goddamn typo. Now take you and your little boyfriends and go back to your little hip-hop playground, writing about why "Rapper's Delight" is the most important rap song ever. The best part about this all is that it's been agreed that the article sucks ass, stay or go. You have something to do. Hop to it, bitch. - PGW
<dl>
<dd>My point was actually more that if you can't even copy and paste a username correctly, what chance have you got when trying to talk on issues of any consequence? which, yeh, QED, really. <a href="../../../w/_/g/User%7EW_guice_dd47.html" title="User:W guice">W guice</a> 07:36, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Tell your mother <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_be_a_dick_6caa.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't be a dick">Wikipedia:Don't be a dick</a>. All I'm doing is pointing out the blatant rule breaking, just as you are doing with me. If it's not against policy, I'm sure an admin will simply say so, and your little hip-hip playground whining and throwing tantrums isn't going to summon anyone over sooner. Oh, and I've NEEEEEEEVER claimed to be a Wiki vet. That is untrue.</dd>
<dd>As for the article staying, even with all the fished votes thrown out, the article would stay. That's not my problem. It's your name attached to this unresearched, untrue POS article (as more or less agreed on here by just about everyone). If you want to stand up and claim it while true hip-hop heads laugh at you and wonder what the hell you people are talking about, good for you. As long as my name isn't on it, that's all that matters. Be sure to write an article about how Jay-Z is the greatest rapper ever, since <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a> says so. PennyGWoods 22:58, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Ofcourse, I can see that you enjoy accusing him of breaking policy and making various remakes regarding people he contacted that voted <i>Keep</i>. What I dont understand is why you insist on bringing it up here, do you want us to appologize? cross out our votes? maybe you should contact an administrator since people who break policy usually get blocked. We'll see whats worse: informing someone of an AFD or making personal attacks. <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>- Tutmosis</small></a> 23:25, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why don't you do it yourself? Your gang seems to be so good with contacting people; if me pointing out that your people broke policy bothers you so much, then you contact an admin and complain about it. I don't want you to do anything, because you have no power to speak of, saving for beating your chest and playing dumb. What can you do? PennyGWoods 23:50, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but that doesn't apply to AfD. You can play as dumb as you want to (you ARE playing, right?), but everyone here knows that fishing for votes is against policy.

<dd>Penny, this AfD page demonstrates pretty well that you are fighting an uphill battle.
