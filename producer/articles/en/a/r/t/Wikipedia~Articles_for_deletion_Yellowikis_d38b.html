<p>It's a wiki for business information, that apparently intends tries to fill itself by grabbing deleted articles from Wikipedia. Except that it doesn't really.

<li>Yellowikis doesn't "grab" articles, Uncle G's bot transwikis them. Yellowikis has been around for just over one year. Most of the articles are considered incomplete in some way so they are marked as stubs - and for that reason they are not included in the count of legitimate pages. Yellowikis isn't a business. The use of the "rel=nofollow" tag prevents the external link from acting as linkspam.--Yellowikis Admin 01:33, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the article. This Alexa ranking is below the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> threshold, but that's a <s>proposed</s> guideline, not a rule, and there seem to be other notability things in its favour (per Kappa, and the links given in the article). DELETE the spamming links to it seen in other articles and see if it can't be rewritten to be more POV. It seems to have grown somewhat since the first nom. On the other hand, if it keeps growing, maybe even if it gets deleted this time, it can always come back later. Perhaps the article content could be transwikied to itself? ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 22:55, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thanks R!... The recent changes were what was proposed, not the guideline itself, so strike that. Do we know who's actually doing transwiki-ing? It seems to read like someone on their side is doing the work of moving (about to be?) deleted articles over? ALSO, they can't be THAT tiny, they have <a href="http://www.yellowikis.org/wiki/index.php/Talk:Transwiki:Burberry_on_wheels%21" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yellowikis.org/wiki/index.php/Talk:Transwiki:Burberry_on_wheels%21" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> the WoW! vandal...

<li>WP has lots of links to other WikiMedia Projects that are in construction - We thought that it would be OK to link to a FDL, non-profit, (but non-foundation project). Uncle G advised against it so we stopped. But I still think we should be able to encourage people to add information to Yellowikis. Just as some articles point people at WikiBooks or WikiSpecies. --Yellowikis Admin 01:33, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've now read the first and second discussions, as well as reviewing the article history. I'm confused as to why some of the cite material was redacted, and now aware it's you that causes semiautomatic transikification to happen (and if you have any ins with the team there, you may want to recommend they take some antivandalism steps!). But I have not seen anything to change my vote from keep as noted above.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, and I think we should stop transwiki-ing things to them as well, it's a diversion of our resources.

<li>I'm basing that on looking at <a href="../../../t/l/_/WP%7ETL_c6c3.html" title="WP:TL">WP:TL</a>. I'm often wrong, but unless there is no human intervention required here, isn't this a long list of things that someone has to tend to as opposed to doing something else? Even if it's just bot-work, that's still disk space and server time being used. And "our resources" are those that go towards the aims of the project. If the editors doing the work are members/contributors to YW as well, I suppose it's not an issue. Not my reason for supporting deletion, though.<br />

<li><i>I'm basing that on looking at <a href="../../../t/l/_/WP%7ETL_c6c3.html" title="WP:TL">WP:TL</a>.</i> — As per the name of that page, that's the log of things that have been transwikied, not a queue of things to be transwikied. <i>And "our resources" are those that go towards the aims of the project.</i> — That is still not specifying what resources "our resources" actually are.

<ul>
<li>Er. I didn't say <i>"here are a bunch of resources that are <b>going</b> to be used,"</i> but I could have been more clear in that. I also said that bot work still consumes resources. It's a minor point, but I'm not seeing any indication that I'm wrong. The bot runs on Wikipedia servers, it's consuming a Wikipedia resource, albeit a tiny amount. Clearly there is such a thing as "our" resources, which is why I can't use my user page as a <i>de facto</i> myspace and why we eliminate spam. I now yield the floor.<br />

<li>What makes you think that "the bot runs on Wikipedia servers"? Was the hint from the person who runs the 'bot that <i>there are no such resources</i> perhaps too subtle an indication that it <i>doesn't</i> run on Wikipedia servers? ☺ And I didn't ask what "our resources" were in general. I specifically asked <i>what resources involved in the process (of transwikification) are "our resources"</i>.

<li>Yellowikis collects quite different information about companies than Wikipedia does. There are hundreds of links from WP to Yahoo! Business information - are you going to add Yahoo! to the spam blacklist too?--Yellowikis Admin 01:33, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would not mind adding a link to Yellowikis <i>if</i> the company does not have a website on which they state their business information, but the <i>if you get the chance ... add a link</i> sounds like an invitation to spam Wikipedia. -<i><a href="../../../r/2E/k/User%7ER.Koot_9d15.html" title="User:R.Koot">Ruud</a></i> 02:08, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>In the first AFD discussion, I asked Payo (<a href="../../../p/a/y/User_talk%7EPayo_a155.html" title="User talk:Payo">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Payo_10f2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Payo">contribs</a>) for citations of independent reports of and conference presentations about Yellowikis. Based upon clues in the discussion there, I actually located several articles myself at the time. More have been added since. Whether content is copied from here to Yellowikis is irrelevant to whether this web site is notable. But so, too, is discussion of Alexa ranking, Google hits, and article counts. Such considerations no longer form part of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and rightly so because they are <i>bad</i> metrics. WP:WEB asks for non-trivial published coverage of the site by multiple sources independent of the subject, and the article links to several such published works. True, this web site is at the bottom of the notability scale. But it <i>does</i> satisfy the WP:WEB criteria. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 07:00, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm a long time wikipedia user, been using wikipedia for the longest time, even though most of my edits are done without logging in. I don't understand the fuss about yellowikis, since wikipedia is full of other junk stubs of companies that probably needs clean up. Most are even under the wrong name. Furthermore, currently Yellowikis is not for profit, thus a place to advertise start up businesses should not really classify into this argument. Also, why aren't other articles like wikicompany etc. not being considered for deletion, seems like utmost bias to me on part of the users of wikipedia towards other wikis. --Stabani 20:25, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
