<p>I can't see how this is a coherent topic worthy of an individual article. At best all it would do is collect criticism of each individual president found in their own articles. This is only going to be an echo chamber for the pundit spin of the year or the author's personal research. There are not any unified academic standards for analyzing this or even describing what it means to be the "worst president in history." <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">User:Postdlf</a> 03:18, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Since many historians have ranked Presidents in various ways, it would be possible to have an encyclopedic article on "Historians' rankings of U. S. Presidents" that would summarize the <i>opinions</i> of these historians in the approved "X said Y about Z" formulation. However, every such ranking or opinion should have a good solid source citation, preferably a traditional print reference with book title, publisher, ISBN, and page number. An article that says "The following United States Presidents have often been suggested for that title" with not the slightest hint of who has suggested them, when, or where is not such an article, nor is it useful guidance to anyone who would want to write such an article. Thus, "Historians' rankings of U. S. Presidents" is an encyclopedic topic, but <i>this article</i> has no potential to become encyclopedic. Wipe the slate clean. Let someone start over from scratch if they want to. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:46, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, <i>strongly</i>, it's a perfectly good topic. I have often heard debate about who is the worst president we Americans have had (I voted against him last November, for the record), so it's definitely a historical issue with some currency.

<li><s><b>Delete</b>, <i>strongly</i></s>, it's not a perfectly good topic.

<li>When I can cite notable media analysts, popular polls (I know there are some of the latter) with their views on and the best television show and whatever characters or plot lines made them be regarded as such. I really can see how a popular entertainment issue like this can be worth an article.</li>
<li>To sum up the silliness: the article we're voting on is rubbish under a POV title. I love <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/eventualism" class="extiw" title="meta:eventualism">eventualism</a> as much as the next person, but there are limits. Here's one. Feel free to "properly do" the article you so vividly breathe a semblance of life into with naught but imagination.

<li>Sarcastically parroting my logic is really obnoxious, you know. And if you want to make it work you need to pick something more patently absurd. The TV example sounds like a perfectly good article to me. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 23:14, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I know. It was supposed to be as obnoxious as your handwaving and patronizing "I'm concerned about the number of delete votes I see here, and the logic I see being used". Your concern is touching, but not productive.<br />
I'm sorry I couldn't go far enough for your taste. I thought it was already absurd enough, but it's clear to me now you're voting on the <i>topic</i>, while I'm voting on the <i>article</i>. The TV show example I did to highlight the massive difficulties (or sheer impossibility) of keeping <i>any</i> article with "best"/"worst" in its title NPOV and relevant. To then suggest as casually as you did that it's perfectly fine and should be kept boggles the mind, especially if you imply that everyone else is using faulty logic.<br />
I do not at all object to the article you <i>allude to</i>—but the article we're <i>voting on</i> has got to go. The only way you can "make" this into a good article is by completely replacing it, in which case you might as well send off a decent signal by deleting it. Had this article been improved substantially in the voting period, I would have voted <i>keep</i>. It wasn't. It's the same rubbish it used to be. Voting <i>keep</i> appeals to a level of patience and trust we shouldn't need to have for articles as clearly defective as this one is—not just in execution, but in the very approach. Again: nobody's losing <i>anything</i> over this. An article on the same <i>topic</i>, done properly, would sooner benefit from seeing this go than having it stay. This argument springs from incompatible assumptions, not because we really disagree on the conclusions. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 07:01, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC)

Changed my vote to <b>Keep</b>, pending further rewrite, and a move to a better title. I personally think something more general than "worst president" makes for a better topic, though (<a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_assessments_of_United_States_presidencies_d0cd.html" title="Historical assessments of United States presidencies">Historical assessments of United States presidencies</a>?) <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 07:01, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC)</li>

<li>We have articles about fictional spaceships, and we're voting to delete this? Now that's a lack of perspective. I presume that such an article, if done properly, would cite notable historians and popular polls (if there are any of the latter) with their views on the worst president and whatever policies or actions made them be regarded as such. I really can't see how a popular historical issue like this isn't worth an article. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:12, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As Everyking points out, and although it may seem a little silly, it's a subject that *does* get discussed quite a bit, both in the popular media and in academic circles. The article can discuss the arguments and counter-arguments for naming certain presidents worst ever (and reference to Bush-43 as such, which may or may not be unprecendented in American history, certainly deserves mention). I'd take a swing at improving the article (which should be at a better title) along the lines <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> proposes, if it weren't obvious already that it's going to be deleted.

<li>It's a concept. There is an issue surrounding the question of who was the worst president, and the title indicates that. I don't see how it's POV. You could write an article called "Warren G. Harding was a total loser" if that phrase happened to be notable enough for an article. Obviously the title would not be an endorsement of the view that Harding was a total loser. It would just be treating the concept. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:41, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Straw man; obviously the phrase "Warren G.

The article is not attempting to describe the phrase "Worst United States President in History", however, and it could definitely do with a better title. "Worst United States President in History" is hardly the best we can do as a label for a neutral concept. This notwithstanding the observation that a lousy title is not reason in and of itself for deletion. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 20:06, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I already voted to delete the Worst United States President in History last year. Unfortunately there was no consensus for deletion. <i>added anonymously at 12:29, 2005 Apr 27 by <a href="../../../f/a/e/User%7EFaethon387_82c2.html" title="User:Faethon387">Faethon387</a></i></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: the article is poor. The subject is very problematic, since at least one very prominent candidate for the position of worst ever is alive, newsworthy, and, extraordinarily, still popular among many US voters who otherwise aren't obviously insane. (Forty years ago, this would have been much easier, as we'd be complacently -- too complacently -- chuckling over comfortably long-dead Pierce, Harding, and the like.) It would be flamebait. Then again, anything related to Israel, Palestine, Iraq, "Creationism", etc etc is flamebait; yet there's no consensus to lock these articles for long periods, let alone to do away with them. Reasoned claims are made about this by well-informed and thought-provoking writers (I believe I've seen <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Krugman_2111.html" title="Paul Krugman">Paul Krugman</a> writing on it), e.g. in columns in non-tabloid newspapers; moreover, as pointed out above, it seems a subject of much wider interest (let alone importance) than plenty of subjects that get their own articles, e.g. fictional spaceships. The article is doomed, but I hope that a greatly superior replacement will soon emerge. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:07, 2005 Apr 30 (UTC)</li>
