<li><b>Keep</b> Intereesting and useful: provides a quick at-a-glance way to compare various sci-fi series by length. I think our definition of "original research" is starting to get overly-broad. It was supposed to protect us from crackpot theories and "<i>Dude, what if the whole universe is just a hair on an ant's butt?</i>" silliness. None of this article is original research. If one wants to find out how long, say, <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_Runner_090c.html" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a></i> is, there's a thousand different places to find it: the IMDB, the DVD, countless video guides. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 10:01, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> as a usefully put together collection of data that is not itself all that important. It's not OR, although it leans toward an indiscriminate collection of information. Given a potential usefulness to someone wondering exactly what they are getting in for when starting a new sci-fi series (which is happening more and more as DVD season sets continue to come out), I'd say err on the side of leaving it alone. It can be reviewed at a future date if it expands in foolish directions or is not maintained. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 16:10, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A useful almanac-style list. As Andrew Lenahan points out, it's not original research, but a collation of information available at dozens of other locations. Citations can be provided if verifiability is the concern.

<li><b>Comment</b> It isn’t indiscriminate at all; the article describes very clearly what belongs in the list and how it is organised.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> as per Markeer. It's not an indiscriminate collection of information as it provides an actual context and criteria for the information. Maintainance is not really an issue because there are obviously people willing to maintain it (and it gives counts up to whichever episode it mentions, so again the context - and the limits of the information - is clear). As for cruft, it really depends on your definition, although I would say that it's a step above most cruft insofar as it is actually <i>interesting</i> to see how long certain series have lasted and the breadth of fictional universes. I, too, would err on the side of keeping it. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 01:37, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Not original research. Somewhat indiscriminate, but potentially useful, collection of information -- enough so that I'm inclined to give it benefit of the doubt. Might be NPOV/citation issues (who's deciding what's "canon"?), but that calls for cleanup, not deletion. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 09:28, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for the sheer fact that it's a useful collection of information, that clearly a number of people have use for it, and that clearly a number of people have put a lot of work over a long period toward maintaining it. I've often seen links to this article, in conversations about TV sci-fi.--Aderack 17:04, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That's not the way it works. Reliable sources for this information exist, so it's merely a matter of citation, which is not a reason for deletion. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 08:51, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, that's the way it works. Per WP:RS: "The responsibility for finding and adding references lies with the person adding material to an article, and sources should be provided whenever possible." Per WP:V: "Unsourced material may be challenged and removed." So a lack to cite sources is <i>very</i> valid grounds for deletion. Just asserting that sources exist somewhere isn't a valid remedy. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 17:22, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you're misreading WP:V. The criterion isn't whether information is <i>verified</i>, it's whether it's <i>verifiable</i>. Yes, it is important that we cite our sources on Wikipedia; but that's not a deletion criterion. The criterion is whether such sources <i>can</i> be provided. An article on my cat Maggie is unverifiable, because no reliable source <i>could</i> be provided. Sources <i>can</i> be provided for the information in this article (and, indeed, Arctic Gnome has begun to do so). This article isn't original research, but a collation of widely available data. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 17:48, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was not arguing this article fails WP:V; I'm arguing that it fails WP:OR by default because it has (or had) no sources. But strictly speaking, it does fail WP:V, because I think <i>you</i> are misreading WP:V by stating that "The criterion is whether such sources <i>can</i> be provided." Quoting from WP:V again: "'Verifiable' in this context means that any reader must be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, because Wikipedia does not publish original thought or original research." It also says that "The burden of evidence lies with the editors who have made an edit or wish an edit to remain." Read together, this means that, in case of disputes, the criterion of WP:V is whether sources <i>are in fact</i> (not: can be) provided. The same is true, <i><a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutatis_mutandis.html" title="Mutatis mutandis">mutatis mutandis</a></i>, for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> compliance. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 18:50, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unsourced material is not the same as original research. In this case, any reader can in fact check the information against reliable published sources. The error lies in the fact that the citation isn't (or wasn't) provided -- which is not in itself a reason for deletion. If the material were questioned, and such sources were not (or, more to the point, could not be) cited by editors, <i>then</i> there might be reason for deletion as OR -- however, since the citations can be (and are being) provided, this meets WP:V criteria. Ideally, of course, all articles would be both verifiable and verified -- but the fact that a given article is not yet verified is grounds for cleanup, not deletion. Deletion of verifiable material is simply counterproductive when cleanup is a possibility. (This is also, I believe, why the policy states "unsourced material <i>may</i> be challenged and removed," rather than "<i>will</i> be... removed." Babies, bathwater, you know the drill.) <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 20:29, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
