This article has already been tagged for merger from November 2006 but such an action would simply place unsourced trivia into a good article. The Picture of Dorian Gray article already has very well referenced and encyclopedic sections on allusions from other works and on film, television, and theatrical adaptatations. <a href="../../../22/i/n/Wikipedia%7E_In_popular_culture__articles_a4c6.html" title="Wikipedia:&quot;In popular culture&quot; articles">Wikipedia:"In popular culture" articles</a> are a bad idea and citing the precedent of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aleister_Crowley_in_popular_culture_e7af.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aleister Crowley in popular culture">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aleister Crowley in popular culture</a>. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 06:59, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes, a lot of it is crap. If I remember correctly (and anyone interested can check the diffs), I contributed a lot of the crap to it. Any crap that I did contribute came straight out of the article on the novel or that on the character (amazingly, the latter exists as a separate article). My reasoning: a large and vociferous contingent WP editors stand on their rights to insert trivia, whoops I mean contemporary cultural references, to WP. Without this article, the article on the novel or character or both would be stiff with it, as (it seems) every tenth popster who's gazed in the mirror, contemplated his own (real? imagined?) beauty and vaguely remembered what his sister told him about <i>PFG</i> as her A-level text has made a "reference" to the novel or the dude. Well, I thought, let them have their own little playpen. But maybe I was wrong. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:40, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Perhaps we should have "Wikipedia is not a playpen"? Anyway, keeping indiscriminate collections of trivia out of main articles is definitely not a valid reason to have an article.

<li><b>Comment</b> In one hand, the article could be deleted, but then people would add the trivia stuf to the main articles again.

<li><b>Delete</b> is first choice, based on how WP is not for indiscriminate lists or directories of every appearance of a fictional character in pop culture ever. This minutae does not belong in its own article or in the main article and editors of the main article need to be vigilant about removing it instead of just dumping it off on another article. Would support a <i>sourced</i> article for adaptations. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 13:28, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with Celithemis. While most of it is absurdly trivial, this page appears to be the only account of the film adaptations of the novel, which are encyclopedic (or at least as encyclopedic as any film, and we have thousands of such articles). That being said, feel free to treat this as a delete, I suppose, for consensus building purposes (I hate it when articles are kept due to a lack consensus from vote-spilitting, especially when there is a strong consensus to not keep the article). We can probably retrieve the encyclopedic parts and edit history after deletion. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 14:01, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> current manifestation of the article, under its new name and without all this "I think Nancy on <i><a href="../../../e/i/g/Eight_is_Enough_0aff.html" title="Eight is Enough">Eight is Enough</a></i> said the words 'Dorian Gray' once" crap. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:19, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - wow I am really amazed at this vote. How many "in popular culture" articles do we have on Wikipedia? It is a well known fact you can't stop editors from adding this stuff it is a veritable daily flood - <a href="../../../22/i/n/Wikipedia%7E_In_popular_culture__articles_a4c6.html" title="Wikipedia:&quot;In popular culture&quot; articles">Wikipedia:"In popular culture" articles</a> is an essay, not a guideline - it represents one opinion and IMO an idealistic and impractical one. No one is going to actively engage in edit disputes on a daily basis trying to keep popular culture junk out of articles, it is not worth the time or effort - in reality, no one does it and so the popular culture sections just keep growing like weeds. The only solution is to segment this stuff out and keep it out of the main articles. IMO the real problem here is people trying to delete the "in popular culture" articles over some idealistic notion of what Wikipedia should be, without taking into account pragmatic realities. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 14:56, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am amazed every time that someone wants to keep one of these articles giving a variation on "people are gonna do it anyway" as a rationale. People are going to put up hoax articles anyway, so let's keep those. People are going to unwitingly enter false information, so let's keep it because we can't stop it. People are going to vandalize articles and put up articles on non-notable topics and do all sorts of things and there's nothing that can stop them, so why try? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:20, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Hoax articles and false information are clearly against policy. If something is notable or not is a much more difficult challenge - what is trivia to you is notable to someone else, otherwise they wouldn't have added it! The guidelines about trivia and notability are <i>guidelines</i>, not policy, and much more difficult and have to be judged on a per-case basis. Surely you must recognize this reality of Wikipedia, notability and trivia are subjective. Yes, people will add it anyway, that is a fact. I've been here 4 years and I've tried every method possible to discourage people from adding junk and the only method that works is to isolate it out of the main article space. Attempts to delete in popular culture articles are well meaning and understandable but will not work in the long term. It just creates cycles of add/delete, either in article sections, or in AfDs. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 16:08, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
