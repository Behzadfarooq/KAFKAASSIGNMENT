<dd>I do not own civ III nor have I ever played it. I am however an experienced player of civ I, civ II and freeciv. The article is of interest to me as I might use the article to help me to decide whether or not I should purchase civ III. Not that this is necessarily a reason to keep this article. I am just rebutting Calton's fallacious arguments. Paper documentation can be lost or damaged. The games' electronic documentation is not able to be modified and improved by the gaming community.

Whether this article is interesting to the average viewier (encyclopedias are practically by definition uninteresting), useful to its intended audience, contains information extractable from the game manual or the game itself, or whether any editor has played the game before, is all 100% <u>irrelevant to the deletion discussion</u>.

<li><b>Strong, Speedy Delete</b> Civ is a good game but this is total fancruft/listcruft. Wikipedia is NOT a game guide and is not a freakin' "game encyclopedia" whatever hellish thing that is.

<li><b>Delete/merge</b> - As a player of Civ2, Civ3 and Civ4 and as a frequent contributor to CVG articles, this article is really really game specific to the point of being a game guide. I can absolutely see why a list of technologies in civ3 may be helpful and interesting, for the players of the game who actually want to learn more about what the technologies are about and their affect in the <b>Real World</b>, it'd be a great starting point. But right now, it's just the tech tree/game guide laid out in textual form. Please just put it into a simple list in the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilization_III_cd7e.html" title="Civilization III">Civilization III</a> page, like the list of wonders and list of races. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 20:42, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
