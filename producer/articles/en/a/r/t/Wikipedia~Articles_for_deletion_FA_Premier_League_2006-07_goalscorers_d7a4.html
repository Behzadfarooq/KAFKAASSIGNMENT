<p>The result was <b>delete all</b>. Remember that AFD is not a vote, but rather an arguement at the basic level.

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> I think that this article and others of the same kind are very important and need to be kept because they help in any form of research, wether it is proffessional or personal. The template for football players which includes the amount of goals they've made for the club is not season-wise and it sometimes take long to update while this articles are usually updated instantaneously. I've looked for this kind of information in other sites and for other leageus such as Germany, and I've had no luck finding one. This articles can be consulted for knowledge about how is a player or a team is doing in the league and to know who has scored the goals for the team and how many they have. About size, these article don't grow more than they already are. Hardly you get new scorers by this time of the year. And I have to completely agree with Mjefm on why to make Wikipedia less informative just for the sake of it. Combines, these goalscorers articles don't occupy more then a megabyte on Wikipedia's servers. It's not like it includes any pictures.200.121.177.124 21:31, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> A professional footballer is notable, a goalscorers in <i>top division of very notable league</i> is even more.

<li><b>Very strong keep</b> as per several speakers above. These lists provide lots of information which gives the readers of "our" encyclopedia the opportunity to see which players scored which amount of goals for a certain club in a certain season. I don't see why this would be overkill. The information is notible to the players which are notible to have an article in the encyclopedia. For those who don't have an article yet or those who are stubs these lists can easily help creating better articles on the players as more information on them is available and easily accessible, by creating links or by a simple click on the player's "what links here section". The comment that says the articles are becoming too large is total nonsense to me. So far the articles are not too large and I doubt they will be as the seasons in Europe are all half way or over already and you can assume most players who will score a goal in the second part of the season already have scored at least one goal in the first part of the season. Of course some players will be added who did not score a goal yet, but the articles won't be expanded that much anymore according to the size. A lot of people spend lots of their free time in this encyclopedia, inclusive very useful lists like these. Not that that particular fact should be a reason not to delete the articles, but I personally would feel all the time I spent in these articles would be thrown away in just one simple click for deletion. Better spend some more time in looking for total crap in this encyclopedia instead of deleting useful information. Also, the existance of these pages is already known for months. The pages have been updated ever since and are currently correct. Concluding that these have not been up for deletion in the past you can assume no one has had problems with them in the past. Everybody let the editors update these lists before nominating these for deletion in late December, so all work would be for nothing. Pretty sad in my opinion, but we will see what will happen, all I can do is give you my opinion and here it is.

<dd><b>In addition'</b> does this also mean we are going to delete all scored goals information from the players articles? Thousands of players on Wikipedia have their goals specified like in these goalscoring articles mentioned on their own articles year after year as well. Some, like in <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boudewijn_Zenden_d4aa.html" title="Boudewijn Zenden">Boudewijn Zenden</a> for instance even have them specified for league, cup, Champions League etc. If the goals are not notible in one article, why would they be notible in another article? I'm not telling these statistics on the players should be deleted, but if we are going to delete these goalscoring lists as they are considered overkill then the only conclusion can be that all the goals scored by a player should not be mentioned on their article page as that would be overkill and because Wikipedia is not Soccerbase, or any other football player profile page. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 04:54, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm, this is a slightly bizzare argument - you appear to be calling for the same information to be displayed twice? I agree that a lsit of appearances and caps on a player's page is notable. But such information renders pages such as these redundent.</dd>
<dd>As for size issues - this is more a precdent thing. At the moment, we're talking about 14 aritcles for one season. But what if next year this is reapeated for every top level football league in Europe? And then someone adds a try scorer list for the Super Leauge? And that continues season after season after season. Suddenly, we have thoudands of fairly large pages that are a collection of facts and trivia, not knolwedge. The top scoreres in a league is relevant in a league summary. A player's total appearances and goals scored is relevant info in a page about him. Lists such as this one are not relevant. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 09:58, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not a bizzare argument. Just try to find something random on Wikipedia and you will most likely find it again somewhere else on Wikipedia, but in a slightly different form. That's also the case in this situation. The stats on player pages are extremely notible to the player in question. Once on his article page you see the amount of goals scored and you wonder where he was in the top goalscorers rankings for that season. Was he the club top goalscorer? Was he among the top 10 of the goalscorers in that league during the season? This way these questions are answered. If these are not available you should know each and every team mate in a certain year, browse to all of their separate player pages to find out the same results that can be found in these lists in one simple view. Yes it's the same information, but it's there in a different form, just like many other facts described on Wikipedia. As for the sizes, yes you're right, Wikipedia is growing and will always keep on growing as long as it will exist. You can't stop that and that should not be stopped as that would prevent us creating an encyclopedia that is as complete as possible. It will never be complete, but if we are leaving out notible information it might get lost and no one will ever be able to find this information again. The grow of Wikipedia should not be an argument to delete these documents. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 00:17, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As for the "delete it to save space argument" I think there are plenty of vanity pages, made up rubbish and irrelevant nonsense articles on wikipedia to get rid of before we start removing verifiable information for the sake of space.

<li><b>Comment</b> There seems to be a lot of discussion on how valuable the information is to a certain group of people... but that has never been a sole qualification for what gets kept and what gets removed. Plenty of things are useful to certain people that aren't notable or go beyond the scope of detail necessary. The usefulness of the information is not relevant, as far as I can tell. It's not one of the criteria that the deletion process is designed to consider. 206.213.209.31 17:23, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To elaborate further: The <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_Pages_f2fd.html" title="Yellow Pages">Yellow Pages</a> contains useful information. It doesn't mean such information should be included in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 17:40, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> That's a poor reference considering that the Yellow Pages is essentially an advertising device, which Wikipedia is not. <a href="../../../n/i/a/User%7ENiall123_9f3d.html" title="User:Niall123">Niall123</a> 17:45, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But it's useful, which is one of the primary arguments being presented in support of the article. Yellow Pages information would clearly violate other standards for Wikipedia, so the usefulness wouldn't be justifiable. I would be interested in hearing more reasons for why the lists need to stay that don't relate to usefulness. 206.213.251.31 17:52, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So far we have heard reasons why it should be deleted. But we have heard no really reasons why it should be deleted. We have heard that it is too much detail. But why is too much detail a bad thing for wikipedia&#160;? <a href="../../../n/i/a/User%7ENiall123_9f3d.html" title="User:Niall123">Niall123</a> 18:03, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I believe the sentiment is that it falls under the idea that Wikipedia is not an <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collection of information</a>. The rebuttal to this has been that the information is useful. Such a rebuttal is invalid. The justification for this reason to delete is up for debate, which is why I have not personally made a decision; I'm waiting to hear more arguments. 206.213.251.31 18:16, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can't tell under which point in your above link does this type of information fall. I also can't understand why the above information can be described as "Indecriminate". <a href="../../../n/i/a/User%7ENiall123_9f3d.html" title="User:Niall123">Niall123</a> 18:31, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>&lt;reduce indent&gt;My logic behind saying 'this information, whilst useful, is not valid for Wikipedia' has two fundamental underpinnings:
<ul>
<li>The 'indiscriminate information' means that we don't just include everything factual. We are instead, in the business of recording <i>knowledge</i>. A list of countries by their GDP is knowledge because it informs us as to the relative macro-economic performances of countries, and is a statistic used by a number of institutions when formulating policy. A list of FA Cup winners is knowledge because it shows the victors of an important competition through the ages and the changes that have occured in English football. A list of the top scorers in a season in English football is knowledge, for similar reasons. However, a list of every goal in the Premiership/SerieA/La Liga (never mind the Libyan Prem and Dutch Second Division) is <i>not</i> knolwedge; it is trivia, it is statistics, it may be other things, but its not 'knowledge'. <i>Indiscriminate</i> refers to the fact that we are not discriminating between knowledge and other facts</li>
<li>As noted before, the scope for these articles to grow is quite frightening. We're basically justifying the creation of simialar articles for every season of football throughout in history in any top or second level league. THAT is a lot of info and that is the sort of stuff that should be in a football stats database, not an ecyclopedia. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 18:32, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of course these pages are knowledge and the information is not only useful but also notible for the leagues, the players and the clubs. It informs us about which player scored for which team in which year and where he was in the top goalscorers list among his team mates. Wahetever you make out of it that information is notible. It may not be of your interest, but something not being of your interest should not be a reason to delete it from an encyvlopedia. The lists could be merged into the articles describing the seasons if that would be better for the servers, but from what I have seen everywhere on Wikipedia is that we try to keep article pages as small as possible and we create subpages where possible, to prevent the original articles becoming too large. I agree with Robdurbar that this is information that should be available in a football stats database, but that does still not say this information should not be on Wikipedia. If you can provide me a website on the internet that has all this information available for all these leagues let me know. RSSSF has a lot of information available, they have all matches, sometimes even with goalscorers and line-ups available in any league, but does not give us the information described in the way they are described in these lists. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 00:36, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep all</b>. We should be encouraging editors who are prepared to write football articles and not discouraging them. We are not short of server space (and if we are the ever increasing barometer at the top of this page will buy lots more!) so the arguments over length, precedent etc don't hold water. These articles comply with all WP policies and as stated above are of both interest and use to some people. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 02:42, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: if WP isn't here to be a useful internet source of information, what is it here for? It's own sake? Articles such as this have merit, are useful, concert a noteworthy subject (there are far more obscure subjects on WP that professional football, for goodness sake). Besides, the <i>WP is not an Almanac</i> 'rule' was only recently dreamt up and has subsequently been removed. An encyclopaedia is simply a collation of information. If some of it is in list form, hooray. <a href="../../../m/j/e/User%7EMjefm_0b21.html" title="User:Mjefm">Mjefm</a> 14:54, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> since it is information not just per season but also for every team. I think such a competition, that information is usefull. If we merge it, the article wil be in big kilobites and that will be bad for reader. <a href="../../../k/r/b/User%7EKRBN_3818.html" title="User:KRBN">KRBN</a> 13:25, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
