<p>Prod removed. Non-notable artist. The "feature" in Boston Globe consists of one quote in a small six paragraph article. Author claims over 400 independent search results, but I found a mere <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Filiz+emma+soyak%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Filiz+emma+soyak%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">74 unique hits</a> on google. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 16:29, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The deletion proposed by <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">user:irishguy</a> demonstrates a failure to properly check the background of artist before determining "notability." Filiz Soyak is a well known arist both regionally (to Boston) and in the wider context of the art world. As I stated in the talk page her art has been presented in various galleries and showings worldwide. If a single patroller is able to use their own loose interpretation of "notability," then it is time that Wikipedians seriously consider defining what notability is. I have included below a few "Contemporary artists" that lack notability in the context of my region or art taste....<br /></p>

<dd>I don't believe I was lacking civility in my response to the AfD tag. I merely indicated that the article was tagged for deletion without a clear demonstration of lack of notability. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states that<br /></dd>

<dl>
<dd>I am merely asking for proof that the artist in question will not become part of the historical record of contemporary art. There are many other artists in the contemporary category that warrant deletion based on the grounds that this article has been tagged. I don't support the deletion of those articles because in terms of the greater context of comtemporary art, I cannot determine their contribution to the field of art. The paradox at hand is that they are contemporary and thus they haven't left their mark on the field yet. If the reason for AfD of this article passes then I see no way to avoid AfDs on many more contemporary artist entries. This is a dangerous precedent to set. I hope other users will contribute to this debate. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackhamm_6bf9.html" title="User:Jackhamm">Jackhamm</a> 17:06, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a crystal ball</a>, nor do I have to provide proof that this person won't become a part of the historical record. It is the article author's job to provide verifiable proof that the artist currently <i>is</i> a part of the historical record. What <i>could</i> happen in the future is entirely irrelevant. The nomination clearly shows that this isn't notable: the google hits are low (70-some unique hits is not impressive) and there is only one article and the artist wasn't even the primary subject of the article but merely gave a quote. For the record, Wikipedia <i>does</i> have a definition for what notability is: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 17:18, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The notability guidelines (<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>) are in dispute. However they state "A topic can fail to satisfy the criteria because there are few or no reliable published sources independent of the subject." I fail to see how one is able to make an assessment that "70-some unique hits is not impressive." I've asked for proof that the artist is non-notable. I've been given links to disputed policies and personal interpretations of notability. I've offered links and a passed search engine test. Once again, the Boston Globe article has a multimedia component, that lasts for several minutes and was the result of several hours of video interview. I would point out that the above statement "...there is only one article and the artist wasn't even the primary subject of the article but merely gave a quote" is NOT accurate. Furthermore, the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> states:
<dl>
<dd>"Notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly. With respect to notability, the inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, and journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it. As such, the primary notability criterion does allow Wikipedia editors to determine whether "the world" has judged a subject to be notable, but this is not a consideration of whether a Wikipedian personally thinks a subject is or is not notable."<br /></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The Filiz emma soyak article has demonstrated adherence to the above policy. I intend to add more information later and encourge additional editing by other users, but even with currently only one reference, it still demonstrates that "Other authors, scholars, and journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it." Once again I contend the proposal for deletion is unwarranted.</dd>

<dd>You say: <i>I've asked for proof that the artist is non-notable</i> but it doesn't work that way. Articles must illustrate verifiable notability. This doesn't. One article wherein the artist wasn't the primary subject does not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> which expressely states that the artist must be the subject of multiple non-trival articles. A six paragraph article is fairly trivial, but regardless, Soyak wasn't the primary subject. 70 some hits isn't notable. If this artist had made a large impact in the art world the number of references would be three times that amount. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 17:51, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The artist's own site, being self-published is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for Wikipedia's purposes. The Boston Globe article shows that the artist in question is getting some attention, but it contains very few factual details, being mainly a reflective piece, and certainly not enough to verify the whole article. This isn't to say that this will always be the case, however. If more sources become available, and the article becomes verifiable, this article would become a good addition to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Wilson_16a7.html" title="User:Scott Wilson">Scott Wilson</a> 19:13, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nice try. The "above user" is some IP address. I didn't need to vote as I already made my opinion on keeping the article. I have no need to resort to sockpuppetry as I already know I'm outnumbered.

Secondly, I'm not sure how the removal of a vandalism that you linked to demonstrates anything other than the fact that you are obsessing over the fact that I won't agree with you. Also, I'm not quite sure why you think launching a personal vendetta against me because we disagree on notability is necessary, but either way please stop being combative and read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackhamm_6bf9.html" title="User:Jackhamm">Jackhamm</a> 03:58, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Secondly, and just and FYI for the all the people who have been exceedingly nasty to me since I started my first post here, now I understand why so many people disparage Wikipedia. I can't help but notice that my attempts to explain why I thought this article was worthy of submission was met mostly with rude responses (with the exception of one friendly response) or 'delete' lines without explanation.
