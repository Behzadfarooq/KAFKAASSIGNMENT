<p>term apparently coined by a couple of editors for use in Wikipedia, the definition of a neologism. A Google search of "unused highway" reveals official sources using different meanings than the implied, unsourced, one in the article. A companion article was twice submitted to AfD (as <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_ramp.html" title="Ghost ramp">Ghost ramp</a>) before being moved to a similarly-named place and will soon accompany this in AfD. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 03:37, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>With no supporting evidence from <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> or a statement why it should be deleted, I move that it be speedy kept.

<li><b>Delete</b> Regardless of the article's past afd's, after examining the article it is pretty clear that it should be deleted as being unverifiable original research. There are two references in the article, however neither of them ever use the term 'unused highway.' One does use the term 'stub ramp' once, but the term isn't defined and its meaning as given in the article is inferred.

<li><b>Keep</b>; "unused highway" is a simple phrase like "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities.html" title="List of cities">list of cities</a>" or "<a href="../../../f/a/u/Fauna_of_Puerto_Rico_5867.html" title="Fauna of Puerto Rico">fauna of Puerto Rico</a>".

<ul>
<li>I have a better idea: if you can find such a term that covers the catch-all in this article and cite it, I will gladly withdraw my nomination. The so-called "tautology" cited by Seicer is not the case here, as a revisitation of the term will make clear.<a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 04:01, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

A quick Windows Live search on "unused highway" turns up some U.S. state government web pages dealing with legislation, so the term is out there. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">-/-</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warren</a></span> 05:07, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Who really needs a definition of "unused highway", or a banal discussion of the various obvious reasons why one might close a highway? This isn't a phrase that needs definition - put "unused" and "highway" together, and they mean exactly what one might expect. I can perhaps see a list of notable unused highways - considerable stretchs of major highway that have been closed, are unused, etc. - but why define or discuss such a commonplace phrase? What's next - "broken sidewalk"? "Muddy path?" --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 06:38, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So... you are in agreement that the definition is a <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tautology.html" title="Tautology">tautology</a>. Therefore, your position would be more in agreement with keep rather than delete, since both pages contain relevant information. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 06:46, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see how this is in any way a tautology. I am saying this is like having an article on "blue bathrobes" - which is to say, <i>bathrobes</i> which are <i>blue</i>. This combination of words has no special meaning, and neither does it define a subject which needs an article to explain it. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:11, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Would a merge, rather than a delete, be more appropriate? The List could be merged into the primary article, with a brief overview (per what is there currently) to explain the different types? <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 07:14, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all, as Brian has already mentioned, this term is <i>not</i> a tautology. Secondly, even if it were that would in no way imply that the article should be kept; there is no policy that says tautologies are inherently notable, the very idea that something's being a tautology somehow makes it encyclopedic is ridiculous. Also, as Brian argues, there is no reason why 'unused highway' is any more important, encyclopedic and notable than 'red cars,' 'unused airport runways' or 'broken sidewalks.' The term is probably even unsuitable for Wiktionary. If there are notable unused highways then feel free to rename this to 'List of Notable Unused Highways,' that is if you can establish clear and objective criter for determining the notability of such highways and the topic (eg. find sources that state that this particular unused highway is important because...) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:26, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(Edit conflict) Per the last two AFDs and extensive discussions, the choosing of the word is the most appropriate terminology as it is the most _direct_ and _simple_. It's unfortunate that you were not a main participant in those prior discussions (per standard search, please correct if I am mistaken), because those discussions led to the renaming of the article. Renaming it again, or moving it to satisfy your definition or idea is simply spinning the wheel, and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Renominationswasting_everyones_time_and_resources" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Renominationswasting everyones time and resources</a> --</li>

<li>I think that some of this could be merged to <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway.html" title="Highway">highway</a> or some other similar place, as a description of what one can do with unwanted highways. I don't think much of this is useful for helping define what a notable unused highway is. One could of course use it to categorize the unused highways, but I'm not sure how useful that would be - how many highways have notably been turned into gardens? I think that would be up to the editors of the list, as to whether that would be a useful scheme of organization. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:34, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It seems to me that the problems with this article are not specific to the article's title. You want a 'catch-all' for the information in the article, but I, and I believe the nominator and Brian, feel that the information itself isn't encyclopedic; it's not notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article is heavily referenced with official sources, is written well enough to convey the essence of the topic, and the topic itself is notable enough for inclusion. Anyone disagreeing with that last statement should read the article on the <a href="../../../a/b/a/Abandoned_Pennsylvania_Turnpike_f52a.html" title="Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike">Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike</a> sections to see how much can be written about a highway that is now unused.

<li><b>Comment, no "vote".</b> Obviously this is just another in a long line of highway-related nominations (both the first two "ghost ramp" nominations and a number of others) that's going to end in no consensus. Obviously, it is a neologism coined by NE2 (I've never heard these referred to as "unused highways" before), but the term makes sense, and was done as a compromise for people who thought "ghost ramp" and "stub ramp" were neologisms. I feel the concept of whatever you want to call this phenomena is notable, for much the same reasons TMF stated. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 20:52, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. Subject is encyclopedic. Name is a compromise based on objections to "ghost ramp", which is in fairly common use but hasn't been documented (to my knowledge) in a sufficiently reliable source.

<li><b>Keep</b> There are obviously sections of paved roadway (and ramps and tunnels) which were built but not yet placed in service, or which have been removed from service. Tax dollars were spent on them. They are used for making movies and disaster drills. They tie up resources. The only dispute I can see is over what to call them, and that does not reasonably lead to deletion.

<li><b>comment</b>: <b>Closed Highway</b> appears to be a more poppular term which is even used, most recently with our Big North Eastern Winter Storm of January 2007 that we are currently experiencing, on the weather network. Again, as per my above vote to keep, I would merge to "Closed highway"... a term as I demonstrated within the precedence that is used by Police during chases. It is also a term that is used during "accidents" involving deaths, or serious truck spills, or many other incidents where Police decided to "close" a highway. This term has many legal implications as well... if you where riding/driving on a "closed highway" vs. a "highway". Smarten up! By taking a look at the nominator's user page, it is obvious he has a general grudge for compound worded articles. Two word terms do exist and can be used in wikipedia... like <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheeseburger.html" title="Cheeseburger">Cheeseburger</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorboat.html" title="Motorboat">Motorboat</a> which used to be two words. <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailing_ship.html" title="Sailing ship">Sailing ship</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_carrier.html" title="Aircraft carrier">Aircraft carrier</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sexual_behavior.html" title="Human sexual behavior">Human sexual behavior</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Light_at_the_End_of_the_World_8e07.html" title="The Light at the End of the World">The Light at the End of the World</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_layout_engines.html" title="Comparison of layout engines">Comparison of layout engines</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophets_of_Islam_5eee.html" title="Prophets of Islam">Prophets of Islam</a> are all compound worded articles.
