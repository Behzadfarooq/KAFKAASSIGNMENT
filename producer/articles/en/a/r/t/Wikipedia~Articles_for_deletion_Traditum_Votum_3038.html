<dd><s><b>Keep and edit it</b></s>. The source John Wansbrough, The Sectarian Milieu: Content and Composition Of Islamic Salvation History checks out, though the translation of the work is under question, Traditum is to surrender, so Traditum Votum should mean Surrender to God, shouldn't it? The School of Oriental and African studies stated that the book was delayed as a result of the author's death. SOAS is also apprehensive about having a wiki page on the society, I think they don't want this being "leaked". But obviously there is no proof that this society has any links with the institution. 212.219.118.149 14:14, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> lol, you're expecting a student from a high school to have expert in latin. However I too don't know whether or not traditum actually means surrender, though I'm sure you would be able to enlighten me with your perfect latin translation abilities. Through Wansbrough's notes, the name Louis IX was stated. However, I cannot be 100% certain it is St Louis it is referring to. The time period of the 13th century led me to assume that it was St Louis of France.<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanksy1988_cb65.html" title="User:Banksy1988">Banksy1988</a> 19:41, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> You still haven't explained how any of this secret society (whose secret activities included founding a football team) relates to a history of Quranic studies.

<dd><b>Comment</b> They didn't found a football team, they took control and then allocated control to the fans. Islam was the religon under which the soceity was founded in the south of Spain, the Quran was a big influence on their thinking. The Church where the engraving of the societies initials and seal still remain today, stands on an old mosque. Mushrif-ud-Din Abdullah (known more commonly as Saadi in his works) was captured during the crusades and he is said to have become a member while in captivity in Spain. In Wansbrough's last edition of his book Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation he states that part of the thoughts Saadi portrays in his writings are Quranic (i.e. of Islamic origin) and speak of his "finding of a new politcal underground" which "does the word of God through subtle means". This very writing was found within the remains of the church.<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanksy1988_cb65.html" title="User:Banksy1988">Banksy1988</a> 22:51, 12 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Note</b> that the current wiki page for Saadi verifies that he was captured during the crusades and that his writings were contreversial, how likely is it that a Muslim in his times would write about homoeroticism? Surely, he was protected by some sort of organization from certain excecution. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanksy1988_cb65.html" title="User:Banksy1988">Banksy1988</a> 23:38, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(backing up, pushing the right margin) So let's get this straight. You've got a medieval Sufi, who <u>may</u> have been captured by the Crusaders and <u>is said</u> to have been held in Spain. He wrote of an unnamed political underground but said little about it. From that, you come up with a group with a Latin name (whose meaning you don't know, but got from where?) supposedly connected to a French king and saint, as well as an Italian saint, neither of whom was remotely connected with Spain. And all of this is somehow connected to a 19-year-old Bulgarian/British schoolkid, whose article appears to have just been deleted and recreated. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:57, 13 May 2006 (UTC)
