<dd><b>Comment/Question</b>: <i>What</i> is the criteria for notable? There have (apparently) been articles published about this language, and not by the creator, and I <i><b>do</b></i> invite someone who speaks german and/or polish to please verify the articles Mr. van Steenbergen cited. If being published about is the criteria for notabilty, then this whole AfD is moot.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's not a fake language; it is completely real. It just happens to be a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructed_language.html" title="Constructed language">constructed language</a>. Within the field of constructed languages, it's very well known. I don't think 500 hits for something with no false positives is half bad.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The thought is good, but I'm not sure if it would give a workable solution. First of all, there are a lot more languages in IB than Brithenig and Wenedyk only. Even <a href="http://www.langmaker.com/db/Category:Languages_of_Ill_Bethisad" class="external text" title="http://www.langmaker.com/db/Category:Languages_of_Ill_Bethisad" rel="nofollow">this list</a> is far from complete! In order to be complete, I'm afraid an article like the one you're referring to would be pretty exhaustive, and it would also have to list quite a lot of languages that notability-wise would not warrant inclusion. Another thing is that not all IB language would owe their notability to Ill Bethisad only, case in point being <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brithenig.html" title="Brithenig">Brithenig</a>. â€”<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 19:29, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not voting to keep it because it's Ill Bethisad related, nor is it self-promotion. If it is deemed to be deleted, I will support it.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I wish people would stop making personal attacks like this. "That they've managed to [...] spam a lot of Wikipedias"? You seem to imply that all this is part of one big action for self-promotion. May I remind you that neither the article about <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a> nor the article about <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wenedyk.html" title="Wenedyk">Wenedyk</a> were started by me, or any other IB member? You may like it or not, but there are a lot of people interested in these things. If you're not, that's perfectly fine with me, but don't use this trollish kind of argumentation. â€”<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 19:22, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If neither you nor any other IB member have been doing the article writing or the spamming, may I ask upon what grounds you conceive that to be an attack upon you? That being said, I am quite happy at characterizing writing an article about a non-notable subject across several Wikipedias "spamming;" I've certainly created no article myself which in my estimation failed to pass the applicable criteria. That there is a fandom on artificial languages is irrelevant; there are fandoms based around many things which still nonetheless must past verifiability and notability musters. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:50, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I consider it to be an attack upon me Ã¡nd the other fifty IB members because of the way you formulated it: "[...] an alternate history project fifty people have bought into [...] That they <i>[i.e. those fifty people]</i> have managed to slip under the radar and spam etc.". It may just be a matter of poor word choice, but you Ã¡re implying that all IB related stuff was produced by IB members only. That's simply not true. I also object against the term "spam", which I would define as violent, unsollicited self-promotion. None of these qualifications are true. By using the term, you implicitly attack not the article, but the people who worked on it in (presumably) good faith. Again, if you don't care for the subject, that's fine. But calling articles about subjects you don't care for "spam" is very unpleasant; there are lots of subjects I don't care for myself, but I wouldn't dream of calling them "spam". Besides, if the existence of a fandom doesn't point towards notability, then what does? As far as both Ill Bethisad and Wenedyk are concerned, verifiability doesn't seem to be the issue. â€”<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 20:07, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Article passed the previous call for deletion: this means there was not enough clear opposition. Constructed languages aren't "fake" any more than a model railway is a "fake" railroad. The usual ad hominem attacks and misinformation round out the opposition to the article. Naysayers seem to only rely on personal dislike for a subject rather than reasoned dispute. "Notability" is also a red herring: there are plenty of lesser known artists and works of art out there that are and ought to be recorded as part of the deposit of human culture. Elemtilas 22:01, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(User's sole contributions are on AfDs concerning artificial languages) I doubt anyone would call a model railroad "fake." As it happens, there is a model railroad enthusiasts' club in my area, with a large set up and about sixty-five members. Would you consider, under your stance, an article about SSRE's railroad suitable for Wikipedia? As far as notability being a "red herring," your position that lesser works of art deserve recordation notwithstanding, Wikipedia has notability guidelines to determine whether an article can be included or not. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:19, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So what if my "sole contributions" are on AfDs concerning artificial languages. That doesn't make my opinion any less valid than yours. Since you understand how a model railroad isn't a "fake" railroad, you already understand how a model language isn't a "fake" langauge. I would consider an article about model railroading every bit as acceptable as an article about conlanging. A short article about a spectacular model railway (like "Roadside America", if it still exists), or a conlang, or some lesser known opus by a not-so-well-known composer are all quite valid. Notability is a red herring because there are no good objective criteria. If your whole artistic world revolves around rap, then the Seasons will hardly be "notable".

<li><b>Comment:</b> I don't understand what you're saying. "unable to provide any reliable sources beyond his own website"? What do you mean? Are not the two <u>published</u> articles (who are <i><b>not</b></i> Jan van Steenbergen) "reliable sources". Please explain your objection to the article. <a href="../../../b/o/l/User%7EBoLingua_e27f.html" title="User:BoLingua">Bo-Lingua</a> 16:39, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Me neither. Since you are referring to the verifiability page, why do you place the burden of evidence upon the creator of the language, and not on the person who wrote the article, or on the third parties who might give their objective opinion? That seems pretty contradictory to me! But for the record, I'm the creator of the language in question, and I'll be more than happy to provide you with any information you need. So, what is it you want to see verified? My website is sufficient proof that the language exists, and is real, so that can't be the issue. Significance? Aside of the two printed sources mentioned by Bo-Lingua, the web is full of references to Wenedyk. Of course, you might argue that the web is not a reliable source, but whether you like it or not, it is a new medium, which has changed the world completely. Therefore, judging an internet-published creation by the amount of books written about it is like judging the quality of a car by the question whether a horse can pull it. â€”<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 18:24, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Could you add a "references" section in that case? â€”<i><a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._Koot_c978.html" title="User:R. Koot">Ruud</a></i> 21:04, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>As a matter of fact, I can't and won't, for the very reason I stated above. As the creator of the language, it's not up to me to decide what its significance is. My contribution to the article therefore has been limited to adding an interwiki link here and there, and correcting one blatant error. Anything beyond that would come dangerously close to what's described in <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>. That is also the reason why I haven't issued a vote and only given a few comments. I'll look for the Polish magazine (I should have it around somewhere) and add the data here. I know there are (or were) a few web references as well, but I have to admit that I haven't been keeping track of that for at least two years now. They might be gone. â€”<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 22:50, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, assuming that it is a fully (or anyway mainly) functional language, which it appears to be. Invented languages are valud article subjects.
