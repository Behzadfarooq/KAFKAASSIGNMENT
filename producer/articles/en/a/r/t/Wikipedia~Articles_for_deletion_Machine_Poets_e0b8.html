<dd>I realise I may not be able to vote on this VfD, seeing as I wrote the article, but I wanted to point out that I have nothing to do with this band (so it's not 'vanity'), and that the three members are all prominant figures in Australia's independent music scene, each with histories datin g back to the late 1970s. I intend to expand on the article, hence its 'stub' tag. <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 7 July 2005 00:29 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> non-notable. Googling "Machine Poets" -poetry -poet (owing to the name's derivation) gives 21 hits, "Machine Poets" "Garry Gray" gives only 1 hit, as does "Machine Poets" "Andrew Picouleau" and "Machine Poets" "Ash Wednesday" gives 2. There is also <i>no</i> allmusic.com presence. Thus fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. No allmusic.com entry for this band or any of its members.

<li>Some of us think that an encyclopedia should be based on facts and evidence, not good feelings and wishful thinking.

<li>It's very common to vote based on other people's assertions, if you don't believe the assertions you should challenge the people who made them. Cnwb is voting delete because s/he doesn't realize that being a project by 3 notable people makes it notable. Even if only <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ash_Wednesday_%28musician%29_1c17.html" title="Ash Wednesday (musician)">Ash Wednesday</a> is notable, this page should be merged with his article rather than deleted. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 7 July 2005 01:33 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ok, you made the assertion that the band was notable: prove it. You only use the word "apparently" in your vote, and that just isn't good enough. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 7 July 2005 01:40 (UTC)</li>

<li>So, I may be deluded, but at least I'm honest! Regarding notability; <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ash_Wednesday_%28musician%29_1c17.html" title="Ash Wednesday (musician)">Ash Wednesday</a> is perhaps the most notable, having played in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Models_a0a3.html" title="The Models">The Models</a> and <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einsturzende_Neubauten_25ab.html" title="Einsturzende Neubauten">Einsturzende Neubauten</a>.

<li>If three notable musicians get together to form a group, it should be covered, regardless of google results or whatever, because anyone who is interested in any of the three would be interested in the group. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 7 July 2005 01:43 (UTC)</li>

<li>Self-evidently not. When Googled together with their band name, they go down in flames. To Google without the bandname is meaningless (lots of people could have any name you like). <s>Merely quoting from an article extension to the article (which didn't provide any reference, proof, justification etc) doesn't prove the slightest thing: you can't say "this article is notable because this same article says here that it's notable".</s> And <i>I</i> have a history going back to the 1970's!-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 7 July 2005 01:53 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ok, that was a bad way to say what I meant. I meant that VfD is for <i>establishing</i> notability not merely asserting it (which is all you've done). By quoting back the very content that needs to be established, your argument is circular and internal. External verification of the notability of all 3 artists does not consist of a mere claim that they are notable — surely you agree that other evidence is needed. I personally didn't find any, and I looked. You've <i>not</i> looked (or haven't showed us where) but <i>still</i> seem to have found some! -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 7 July 2005 02:17 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well my vote depends on Cnwb's word, which I believe is more reliable than a google test by someone who doesn't know any of the musicians' history. If Cnwb won't defend the notability of the other two, my keep vote is null, but Ash Wednesday has an article which shows notability so the material should be at least merged. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 7 July 2005 02:22 (UTC)</li>

<li>Garry Gray played with the Sacred Cowboys, and in The Reals an early outfit of <a href="../../../o/l/l/Ollie_Olsen_c03e.html" title="Ollie Olsen">Ollie Olsen</a>. Andrew Picouleau, besides playing with a multitude of small independent bands, has played in Dave Graney &amp; the Coral Snakes. I think that in Australian independent music, they're on the fringe of notability.

<li>Delete: Not signed, not prominent, not influential. At this point, nothing points to notability of such a nature as to require an encyclopedia article, and such statements as "a group, it should be covered, regardless" sound like a former user who ended up founding his own wiki that keeps everything.

<li>With great reluctance, I am going to vote <b>delete</b>. The Ash Wednesday article suggests they were formed since 1999. The low Google count is therefore significant. As far as I can tell, they have not released any records and, if they have, it hasn't achieved much success.
