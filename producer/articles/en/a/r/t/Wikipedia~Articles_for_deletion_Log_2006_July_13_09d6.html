<li><b>Keep</b> - I'll copy my post on the subject from the talk page.

<li>The difference with "List of United States military history events" is that it is a timeline of factual, historical events-- and hence, verifiable and neutral. Whereas this (and the similar article also listed for AfD) is a list of expressions promoted by particular group(s), collected from assorted Websites, with limited verifiability-- falling into the same category as "quotations" and "aphorisms". I'd just as soon nominate List of unflattering nicknames for Bill and Hillary Clinton which could likewise be sourced to a Website: <a href="http://www.jokesmagazine.com/managearticle.asp?c=825&amp;a=172" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jokesmagazine.com/managearticle.asp?c=825&amp;a=172" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</li>

<p>My earlier comments:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wait. You say, "tagged for using Primary sources," and "If no non-primary references can be found, this article will need to go up for deletion." But <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, now that I look at it, says:
<dl>
<dd>However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So primary sources are fine. It seems like you're trying to say the various antiwar groups aren't reputable sources. Of course they aren't for a lot of issues - but it seems to me like they are regarding the chants that they use. Again, from <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>:
<dl>
<dd>A magazine or press release self-published by a very extreme political or religious group would often not be regarded as "reputable." For example, Wikipedia would not rely only on an article in the Socialist Workers' Party's newspaper The Militant to publish a statement claiming that President Bush hates children. However, if that same claim was in The New York Times, then Wikipedia could refer to the article (and to the sources quoted in the article). <b>The political newspaper could, however, be used as a source of information about the party itself.</b></dd>

<li><b>Neutral</b> but I will point out that I see no problem with the sourcing. Almost any group may be cited for information about themselves; that only becomes a problem when there is reason to think they are lying. A chant sheet is a perfectly good primary source and there is no general rule against primary sources. Unacceptable original research would be for our contributor to say "I heard someone chanting it". A few may be dubiously sourced, but some are very well sourced indeed: the BBC, the <i>Daily Californian</i> (one of the U.S.'s most prominent college newspapers), etc. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:25, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is easy to draw a perfectly logical distinction between at least three levels (local, regional, national). I suppose if there <i>were</i> a truly global radio show, you would argue that everything is still local because no radio-waves from it have reached the Andromeda galaxy yet? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a></li>

<li><b>Answer</b> Have requested further information from the authors and also found various other uses of the phrase - found lots of blogs using this term casually also - common usage in the field (web 2.0 / metadata) but not citable. In various discussions (going back over a year) on poor meta-data recording (three distinct types of 'meta noise'), 'meta noise' meaning scientifically recorded environmental data that has been corrupted by unwanted physical influence (in a research paper on optics), a metadata tag describing 'noise' (i.e. sound) in addition to the poor use of XML to record small/simple data forms - namely the ratio between XML tag names and the data they contain. I think there's a pretty good case here to keep this article open for further expansion to explain various areas - and that is *only* going on things I found through Google.

<li>First of all, the existence of one non-notable article doesn't justify keeping another. Secondly, are you seriously comparing London to <i>Kanata</i>?--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">WilliamThweatt</a> 00:58, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am not arguing one side or the other. And I am not citing one so-called "non-notable" one, but dozens. There also seem to be individual articles for Vancouver's three bus rapid transit lines -- see <a href="../../../b/-/l/Category%7EB-Line_bus_d4ae.html" title="Category:B-Line bus">Category:B-Line bus</a> -- which are different from Ottawa's individual bus routes. London seems to be the only city with individual articles for bus routes. But I am not comparing London to Ottawa (not Kanata, which is not a city), but a London bus route to an Ottawa bus route. There is nothing inherently more worthy about an article about London bus route trundling through suburbs than about an article about an Ottawa bus route trundling through suburbs. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 01:03, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. After carefully considering the issue, I respectfully believe these articles should be kept. I agree these articles certainly need alot a work, and bus route articles should be far more than text versions of the route map. However, the London bus route articles show that bus route articles can be quality articles if given the chance. Thus, I submit the suggestion that these articles be retained for improvement. -- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanntm_6305.html" title="User talk:Danntm">talk</a></sup> 01:35, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please pardon me if I was vague. I myself do not understand why anyone would want an article on a bus route for schools, and I certainly do not compare most of these routes to the storied urban routes found in London. I just think that these articles should be given a chance to see if the creator, or someone else, could give them a full treatment. ---- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanntm_6305.html" title="User talk:Danntm">talk</a></sup> 16:56, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Shircago is a professional group of a capella musicians with great voices (I'm a speech pathologist with specialty in voice and disorders). Shircago has existed for several years and has recently begun distribution of their CD at a reputable retail store, Tower records. Those who work for Wikipedia obviously have not bought the CD nor realize that Shircago is one of the few worthy young American Jewish pop artists. The type of music they play has been dying, similar to the Shadow Play in China. It is important for the Jewish people to keep that music alive. And Shircago obviously has the right qualifications given that the Jewish Community of Chicago knows the name of the group, and members look forward to attending their concerts - most recently at the Jewish Folk Festival in Chicago. Wikipedia would be making a mistake by deleting this reputable group from their Encyclopedia. Please do <b>NOT DELETE</b>.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mini-K (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mini-K_4424.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mini-K">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p><br />
It isn't a MySpace page. The band has existed for 10 years and is known to audiences in Chicagoland and beyond. The group is a representative of an important up-and-coming expression of religious music in a genre that is accessible to all ages, so the proper course of action is to <b>not delete</b>. --Wolverine94 21:39, 11 July 2006 (UTC)Wolverine 94, 4:38pm CDT, 11 Jul 06</p>
<p>I would be more convinced that this isn't a MySpace page if that huge picture wasn't emblazoned across the top of the article. The picture doesn't add anything of encyclopedic value and probably is why this is even an issue. <b>Delete the picture</b>, save the text.

<dd>The fact that there may be a bit of vanity in the motivation does not automatically disquality this entry. I think the attention this group gets in the Chicagoland area and beyond puts it above your typical small band. They have been featured in one of the largest U.S. newspapers for being part of a newer movement of more ethno-religious-popular music (I read the Chicago Tribune article with interest). I think stumbling on entries like these is what keeps Wikipedia so interesting (although again, would not like to see every 'boy band' included). Since there is more than a little doubt and debate, I would certainly <b>keep</b> this entry.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.135.56.21 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.135.56.21_96cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.135.56.21">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> I was the original creator of this article, and it was a VERY long time ago this article was created. Now that this message was added, I decided to alter virtually every word, to make this completely original. I even changed sentence structures, and tried to make this as close as possible to feature status. I believe that this is an ULTA, ULTRA important article, that is of incredible significance. It is one of the most important College Football articles out there. This article needs to be kept, at any costs. It is too sacred.--Summonmaster13 04:54, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Delete</b>. Individual game articles are rarely kept unless they contained a <i>very</i> notable single play, which this does not. If this were kept, an out-and-out summary of the game is not encyclopedic and it would have to be trimmed down considerably and have its notability asserted by something other than a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">point-of-view</a> assertion. ("...was considered one of the greatest games of all time"? By who?) I follow college football and don't see a good reason why this particular game really needs its own article. Plus, I think the full game summary is still intellectual property (copyrighted.)

<li>Uh, yes. My cite was only to point out that this game has some relevance to others than fervent Huskers and Canes fans. My editorial comments, other than the one about copyvio, are sidenotes and not conditions for keeping. Clearly this article has serious POV and tone issues as of now, but those are not grounds for deletion. About copyvio, someone other than me should decide whether User:Summonmaster13's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Miami_v._Nebraska&amp;diff=63544580&amp;oldid=63522205" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Miami_v._Nebraska&amp;diff=63544580&amp;oldid=63522205" rel="nofollow">recent edits</a> solved the problem. Oh, and I didn't say this should be rewritten as a game theory article.

<p><b>COMMENT</b>: Gassy Guy let me correct you. Binaca geetmala is NOT a chart issued by a local radio station - rather it is an old program that used to play in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the middle east through radio stations in Sri Lanka and then India. The program played every week from 1952 till mid 1994. The annual charts were a summation of the weekly charts. It was the ONLY countdown show of Hindi film songs in South Asia and the Middle East during its times with many millions of listeners every week - in other words it was definitely comparable to the Billboard charts. The historical significance of everything that I (and others) put up in these pages are immense for the many South Asian heritage readers that you have and will have. And yes, history whether it be musical history as represented here, or movie history or political history or military history is always encyclopaedic and deserve a place on Wikipedia - irrespective of whether we are talking of US history or the history of some other nation. And by the way - it is NOT an indiscriminate collection of nonsense as observed by one very wise (?) commentator here - For everyone's information, the cultural history of some country other than the US does not make it indiscriminate nonsense&#160;!!!--Ghoshi 17:45, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can you at least add some explanation into these articles? Imagine an ignorant Westerner (me, for example) stumbling onto this article. What is it about? No way to tell. All I see is what looks like a list of foreign words or names. Nothing says it's a list of songs. Nothing tells me what the entries mean. Is "Zindagi Ek Safar" a song title or an artist? What about "Andaaz"? "Shankar-Jaikishan"? It's like some of the articles we see about an episode of a television program that forget to mention what the program is. The article needs to provide context. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 18:25, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> While I'm still iffy on whether the lists themselves have a place here, I do believe that the songs themselves deserve mention as popular songs. Is there any way to incorporate them into the years in music articles (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1970_in_music.html" title="1970 in music">1970 in music</a> et al)? I just read the 1970 one and it has a horrible lack of material about non-Western music. Anyone have any thoughts into possible integration of the songs into articles of that sort?

<li><b>Comment</b> boy... I can't believe I'm actually fighting to keep this article... I understand the argument that just because we made a mistake on the KROQ list does not force us to make the same mistake here but I will say this again: <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">some people</a> put a lot of effort in trying to develop the non-north-american content to Wikipedia and I think that we should think twice about holding different standards for other cultures. Of course, who's going to notice this article being deleted? One or two people if we're lucky. In contrast there will be a few dozens of KROQ listeners ready to step up and defend the "I know this radio station so this should be kept" line. What's the rush here? at least one editor seems to know what these lists are. Let's give it a few months to expand, explain the context and so on. If we conclude that the whole thing is still unverifiable cruft, then I'll be happy to delete. In the meantime I think this deserves a bit of a chance. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 01:43, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The Binaca Geetmala used to air on <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Ceylon_b707.html" title="Radio Ceylon">Radio Ceylon</a>.

Radio Ceylon was the sole outlet for much popular music, and the Binaca Geetmala its primary countdown show. Top ten lists from the Binaca Geetmala, the programme itself, and its legendary presenter Ameen Sayani are all encyclopaedic articles. At least, they are if Billboard is. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 05:26, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Changing my vote to definite keep</b> as I think there is now sufficient indication that this is waaaaaaay more notable than the KROQ countdown! Of course, there should be an expand-tag added to the whole bunch of articles but they deserve their spot. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 05:54, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> First, let me say that I was never in doubt that the Binaca Geetmala itself was notable. Second, based on my understanding of this, this is a year-end chart of a popular music radio show. I'm starting to feel more that we should err on the side of caution and not delete this one, but first I would like to ask - was this a daily countdown? Weekly? Monthly? Currently, we have year-end charts from this show. If this chart is analogous to Billboard, is it possible to format it similar to the Billboard lists? For example, rather than a year-end chart, could there be a chart from each year showing the song that headed Binaca Geetmala's countdown week by week? GassyGuy 08:01, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Comment</b> - While I did do some searching before I entered this nomination, reading more at WP:CSB and WP:OSTRICH have convinced me that perhaps I did not do enough. I'm still not happy with the lists as they are and hope that they would be cleaned up, and I do feel that this generated some good collaborative discussion about that improvement that likely would never have happened if I had simply posted a question to the talk page. At the same time, I must acknowledge that deleting this article is probably not the way to go and am <b>leaning towards withdrawal</b> of this Afd. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G_856f.html" title="User:Brian G">Brian G</a> 13:22, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is completely accurate. And as for the comment comparing longevity of life to shoe sizes, may I say this: your immaturity and complete lack of appreciation for human life is rather disgusting. Further, the simple fact that similar lists have been compiled for Canadian and British prime ministers, and that neither list has come into question, shows a rather sad trait found occasionally on these forums. Just because the public official is not from an English-speaking country (i.e. Britain or America) does not mean that their life span is "unnecessary and indiscriminate."

<dd>How about someone writing a paper on the history of Japanese Prime Ministers, and could include data on who lived to be the oldest? I know people compile statistics on US Presidents like that - who's still alive, who died early, who lived to be an old fart, etc. I can't substantiate this, but I know people study the effects of holding high-stress jobs on one's health. People that hold those offices tend to die younger. Wouldn't an article like this be of use to a person like that? --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 20:59, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If someone actually carried out a study like that of US presidents, the sample size would be so small as to make the study invalid. Even assuming the researcher were to include all 43 presidents, its still using only a sample of 43 to make claims about a very large group of people (people with high stress jobs, which numbers in the millions), and the researcher still have to deal with all the very wide historical differences in healthcare, diet, environment, operational role etc etc etc not to mention individual genetics and so on. The people you know who are compiling these statistics are compiling <i>trivia</i>. About the only practical use I can think of for this kind of information is if it were for a pub quiz or perhaps some kind of number puzzle, both of which are themselves trivial pursuits. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 22:46, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article SHOULD NOT BE DELETED. It is not just about "SJSU" or the CSU, it is about the entire California State Normal School system. It contains information and images that are not included in either the SJSU or CSU articles. One of the reasons for creating and maintaining this article is to combat the "San Jose State" historical revisionism that has attempted to wipe the California State Normal School from the pages of history. This article is also being expanded upon on a weekly basis. The main proponent of deleting this article, "NeoChaosX" is a self-avowed "hacker" and recognized Wikipedia vandal who have repeatedly vandalized this article and others, to advance his own anti-CSU political agenda. He deleted this article, and now that that has failed, is attempting to have the article deleted to help suppress accurate California, CSU, SJSU history. Michaelch7 08:48, 13 July 2006 (UTC).
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> All I did previously was try and have the article redirect to <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jose_State_University_8d9a.html" title="San Jose State University">San Jose State University</a>, not delete it. The article has redundant information and has nothing notable that would warrant a seperate article. I have nominated the article for those reasons, as well as being advertisement and promotion for your agenda, which is something <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> 04:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It is interesting to note that the so-called "promotion" in this article, an inaccurate reference to an inaccurate article, was included in this article by someone other than the author (but has now been corrected). Also, a part of the discussion regarding this article, in which NeoChaosX admitted to vandalizing this article, and apologized for it, has now been deleted. This fits the pattern of NeoChaosX's deletion and vandalism of historically accurate entries and articles, simply because they do not comport with his preferred (but historically inaccurate) views. This is exactly the type of "San Jose State" historical inaccuracy and revisionism this California State Normal School article is meant to combat. The stakes are high: historical accuracy and preservation of California State University history in the face of brute "San Jose State" revisionism. Moreover, NeoChaosX spurious claims that this article simply repeats content in the SJSU and CSU articles is self-serving nonsense, as NeoChaosX himself has repeatedly vandalized and removed many accurate references to California State Normal School and California State University history in those articles. Michaelch7 10:48, 13 July 2006 (UTC).

<li><b>Comment</b> First, all I did was remove links that promote the renaming campaign, since they were off-topic links in those articles. Second, if you checked the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_June_27&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_June_27&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history of article</a> where I admitted to "vandalizing" the page, you would find it was not deleted by me, and in fact was recommended by another user to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_June_27&amp;oldid=60982108#California_State_Normal_School" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_June_27&amp;oldid=60982108#California_State_Normal_School" rel="nofollow">keep the redirect</a> and to make further additions in the article it was redirected to. I do not know where you get this idea that I am repressing your views; I am simply making changes that I feel (and other agree) that improve the quality of Wikipedia, and to undo changes that do not fit Wikipedia guidelines. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> 06:08, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> NeoChaosX, you admitted in writing that you deleted the text of this article and redirected it to the SJSU article, which is tantamount to deleting the article. The issue is not whether you are repressing my views, but whether "San Jose State" has and is revising and repressing authentic and accurate California history for its own political purposes, and whether you are helping promote that effort by repeatedly attacking this article, and other contributions to other articles. The record of your actions makes it clear that you are guilty of this. Michaelch7 08:10, 15 July 2006 (UTC).
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Look, it doesn't matter what you think the purpose of my edits are. We're here to discuss if the content of the article merits being included in Wikipedia, not what the reasons are that I've nominated the article. You've given no reason to keep the article other than your unsubstantiated claims that San Jose State is "repressing history" and repeated personal attacks on me. Furthermore, you have admitted that the article is meant to "<i>combat the "San Jose State" historical revisionism</i>" in your words, which makes it a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">POV fork</a>, which is not supposed to be on Wikipedia. If you can't come up with a reason to keep the article other than claiming how you're protecting what you believe to be "accurate history", then my argument with you is done. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> 03:37, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I am still uncertain how or why this small advocacy group keeps coming back to this subject. This does not belong in an encyclopedia, but rather on GoState's own seperate webpage that they can finance themselves. Please delete this so that we can keep a neutral point of view as to subjects that are worthy of an encyclopedia, and not be bothered by articles and comments which simply express one small group's hope for a name change to their own instutition? <b>PLEASE DELETE</b>. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreltzer_2ab2.html" title="User:Streltzer">Streltzer</a> 23:41, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep pending cleanup</b> I am the original author. I've placed this wikipedia as a placeholder until I can dig into more detailed information. Ken Suid had a trememdous impact on education in America, first as Asst. Secretary of Education, then as VP of Bell and Howell, then Trend. His story is interesting and informative on the intersection between academia, government, and private enterprise. For this reason I believe he deserves a wikipedia entry--not for a memorial, but for education. There are few google references to Ken Suid, because he had no knowledge of the internet, not even an email address. I feel he is notable for the following reasons: He held a high position in government, he was instrumental in the rise of the polytechnic institute as an American fixture. --Harperbrad 21:39, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, nothing is being done "wrong" here. But as Haukur notes above, Wikipedia has certain criteria that subjects should meet. This nomination is to generate discussion as to whether the criteria for musicians (<a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>) and other WP guidelines have been met; if we feel it hasn't, we encourage the removal of the article. If you feel that verifiable information (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) can be provided in the article that shows that the subject meets these criteria, now's the time to add it; such info would undoubtedly sway editors into wanting to keep the article. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 08:43, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, I tagged this with {notability} and {music-importance} earlier to encourage any info that might prove notability; I don't believe anything significant to that effect has been added.

<li><b>Comment</b> Don't take this personally Konnektor, there is simply a standard that a band must meet in order to have an article in Wikipedia. For example, take a look at the band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Shadows_of_Tomorrow" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Shadows_of_Tomorrow" rel="nofollow">Shadows Of Tomorrow</a> which looks like is going to be deleted as well. I think it is a slightly more notable band than yours, but even their band falls short of meeting the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> standard. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 08:38, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>We all have more info to provide. This is extremely quick to pass judgement. As far as myspace being possible self promotion, anything can be possible self promotion.

<li><b>Comment</b> Your article asserts notability, so this AfD discussion will last for at least several days, and then an administrator will look at the votes and discussion and decide whether or not to delete the article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is a notable website and community.

The article is blatant <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamcruftisement</a>, list of moderators, pleading against deletion inserted into the article itself (in bold) and all. Number of forum members and Amazon rank, whatever that actually means, are not indicators of notability - multiple verifiable non-trivial third-party coverage is necessary to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Amazon.com reviews don't count (they can be written by anyone and are trivial). The closest we come is "Described by HeadRoom Corporation as "the center of the universe for headphone enthusiasts" <a href="http://www.headphone.com/guide/by-application/audiophiles/a-great-entry-to-high-end-audio/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.headphone.com/guide/by-application/audiophiles/a-great-entry-to-high-end-audio/" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, which doesn't focus on the forum - it's covered in the final paragraph. Even if you consider that non-trivial, we still fail the "multiple" criterion of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. I searched on <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> and found nothing but passing mentions - nothing on which to build an article. The article that came to came closest to covering the forum was from 2002, which wrote a bit about the forum though its focus was on a headphone trade show. It said little more about the forum than that it had 3,000 members - obviously more users have registered since then, but whether it has more <i>regular</i> members is a different matter, and no sources seem to have taken especial notice if they have. The ground rule is - if they're really that notable, someone unrelated to the website will create an article. Oh, and there are no articles linking to this one. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 09:52, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It may be impressive, but it's not notable. Of course, I haven't the faintest idea whether it's impressive or not - it's not up to us to decide whether that primary data makes something notable, it's up to secondary sources to decide whether that makes the forum sufficiently interesting to tell their paying readers about it. When that happens we can make the decision whether those secondary sources justify inclusion in a tertiary source (us).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Please see the recent additions in the external links, as reputable trade publications in the audio industry such as Stereophile have reported on this site and its importance to the resurgance of headphones as a viable alternative to the speakers and home theater markets. Stereophile's Editor-in-Chief came to the past International Head-Fi meet, as well as representatives from Sennheiser, Headroom, Shure, Etymotics, Beyerdynamic, Audio Technica, and many other major manufacturers. Deletion of a site mainly responsible for the rise of this phenomenon (coupled with the rise of the iPod) may do a disservice to the encyclopedic nature of Wikipedia. -this unsigned comment was by 06:34, 13 July 2006 199.67.140.83</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Alexa ranking of 8634 (which was incorrectly reported above as an "amazon.com" rating), and the external links (which I think were just added) link to two different substantial articles from online magazines regarding this forum. The stereophile one at <a href="http://www.stereophile.com/news/042406heaven/" class="external free" title="http://www.stereophile.com/news/042406heaven/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stereophile.com/news/042406heaven/</a> is the most impressive probably, since stereophile itself has a decent alexa ranking and is a paper magazine as well. The head-fi article needs some serious cleanup, of course. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 14:58, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Agreed, the cleanup needed will most likely start after people stop throwing everything in they can think of to stave off deletion. There is another stereophile article that captured the direction this community was moving towards prior to its dramatic rise this year, an interesting read on the future of audio as well. <a href="http://www.stereophile.com/news/111405headfi/" class="external free" title="http://www.stereophile.com/news/111405headfi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stereophile.com/news/111405headfi/</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Well, I can understand why it is up for deletion, but there is notability to the community. When I started the wiki, it was just to get the ball rolling for the other more experienced members to begin filling in the holes. The website has pretty high traffic number, is voted top "hi-fi" community by Alexa, and has had an impact in the audiophile community. I'd say it is a keeper and just needs for cleanup. --<a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFootemps_2c74.html" title="User:Footemps">Footemps</a> 16:31, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Looks like Head-fi also has a long-standing link in the <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audiophile.html" title="Audiophile">audiophile</a> entry, and specific mention of headphones as part of that definition is included there as well. Browsers of Wikipedia interested in this aspect of being an audiophile now have a wiki entry to learn more about the main community dedicated to it, and in fact the Audiophile entry should incorporate an internal link to Head-fi in the Headphone section once it is accepted as being off deletion-watch. Also, in case a web article by Stereophile is not sufficient, The new Stereophile arrived in the mail today and the actual magazine has a full review, by Wes Phillips, of the AKG K 701s, where he mentions Head-Fi, the New York meet in Nov. 2005, etc. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 199.67.140.84 (<a href="../../../1/9/9/User_talk%7E199.67.140.84.html" title="User talk:199.67.140.84">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_199.67.140.84_3444.html" title="Special:Contributions/199.67.140.84">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>keep</b> - Funny, there are tons of articles of forums which do not exist anymore or too small that no one knows that have ever existed, while the forum which can be found in google by typing 'headphone' and simply click the forth link (which implies 4th? correct if I am wrong) cannot be listed in wiki. I am sorry to say that, but I don't see any single logical reason of being deletion. The forum is recognized by not only by stereophile but also by several hi-fi websites/forums such as AV-forum in UK. Also, because I am a korean, and I can say that head-fi forum is very well known to most of korean hi-fi sites. I can give several proofs if any moderator needs. Regards.

No such nationality nor ethnicity exists, or has ever existed; and Orkney has never been a state (the island was <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pict.html" title="Pict">Pictish</a> before the Norse occupation). Orkney is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland, nothing more and nothing less. Its status is exactly the same as North Ayrshire, Aberdeenshire or Fife. The creation of this page is part of a campaign by <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallimak_5f83.html" title="User:Mallimak">User:Mallimak</a> to utterly divorce <a href="../../../o/r/k/Orkney.html" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> from <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>.

<li><b>Keep as redirect</b>, at least until such time as the "Orcadian people" section of "Orkney islands" expands to the point of needing to be factored out for summary style reasons, rather than POV-fork-ish ones. Angus is correct, however, this is technically a misapplication of AFD, though one that's tempting to use as an effective means of gauging consensus for turning into a redirect (even though that's not in theory effective).

<p>I never wanted to get into a dispute with Mais oui! I know there is the warning: “If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it“, but I never expected such pettiness or such prejudice. I have not been the only target, judging by the comment in the “Orkney people stub” debate:</p>

<dd>” <b>Comment</b>- Mais_oui! has a history of going through articles changing "British" to "Scottish"- so it isn't very surprising he is opposing the changes you made. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 19:41, 4 July 2006 (UTC)”</dd>
</dl>
<p>Mais oui!’s statement: “Orkney is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland, nothing more and nothing less.” is a clear demonstration of his prejudice. In international law there is still doubt over the status of the islands, which is why <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_D._Mackay_d8e1.html" title="John D. Mackay">John D. Mackay</a>’s letter provoked the response it did. (Mais oui! insists on turning the patriotic Orcadian, John D. Mackay into a “<i>Scottish</i> man of letters”, I note.) The Scandinavians still see Orkney and Shetland as forming a part of Scandinavia (an historic and cultural designation rather than a political one), which is why they will allow the coats of arms of Orcadians and Shetlanders to be placed in the Skandinavisk Vapenrulla, a right they do not extend to any of the other 30 council areas of Scotland. The unofficial flag of Orkney (which you see flying all over the islands) is a Scandinavian cross based on that of the <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalmar_Union_e3b1.html" title="Kalmar Union">Kalmar Union</a> of which Orkney was a part. There is a lot more to Orkney than Mais oui! will admit, or maybe there is lot more to Orkney than he knows - which is all the more reason to have this information in Wikipedia!</p>
<p>Is Wikipedia going to allow itself to be limited by Mais oui!’s prejudices? I hope not.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Followup</b>. I've looked at the pictures referenced in Coredesat's comment above. For starters, one of the photos includes a clip from Record World magazine promoting the album. The radio station top 10 lists do in fact appear to be from Billboard, probably before the official Hot Latin Tracks lists. More importantly, my Google research indicates that the DJ at that station, Dick "Ricardo" Sugar, was the leading American radio host for Latin music in the 60s and 70s, (search for "Ricardo Sugar"), making his lists the de facto Latin Top 10 of the era. The article obviously needs substantial rewriting, but I vote <b>keep</b>.

<li>As per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, one way to fix a mis-placed dictionary article is to turn it from a dictionary article about a word into an encyclopaedia article about a person/place/concept/event/thing. I've started this. Research shows that there <i>is</i> a cultural stereotype in Mexico that is commonly known as "fresa". But it is proving difficult to find sources that discuss it any more than superficially. (There are plenty of "fresas say 'o sea' all of the time!" "no they don't!" "yes they do!" arguments on discussion fora, but those aren't sources.) Like <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html" title="Chav">chav</a>, this article requires strict sourcing to prevent the introduction of original research. This was an exceedingly bad start to an article. <b>Weak keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:36, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I don't think we need to support an English language article on an alleged Mexican slang word that has <i>no</i> article in the Spanish language Wikipedia. If Spanish language speakers don't find such an article notable, why should we? <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 15:50, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a poor argument given that the article simply might not have been written in the Spanish language Wikipedia yet. The Spanish language Wikipedia has roughly 1/10th the number of articles of the English language one, and 1/10th the number of editors. To argue that <i>Spanish language speakers</i> don't find the subject notable, one has to look at the world at large rather than at Wikipedia (as is always the case with notability). There is no shortage of <i>Spanish language speakers</i> discussing this subject. I mentioned above that one can find them arguing about it, in Mexican Spanish, on discussion fora. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:15, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let's leave the POV of whether or not my argument is "poor" out of the discussion. If you don't like the argument, just say why. Now, to address <i>your</i> "why"... If they're actively debating the article then 1/10th resources aren't an issue for this particular article. Posting the article in English <i>while the Spanish speakers debate it</i> is like saying to them "hey, we know your language better than you do." Let the Spanish language speakers sort things out first in their language. If they decide it's a worthy article, only then should it appear in other languages. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 16:22, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A poor argument is a poor argument. And the argment that we should have no article because the Spanish Wikipedia has no article is a poor argument, plain and simple, for the reasons stated. Your additional argument, about "posting the article in English while the Spanish speakers debate it" is irrelevant, simply because it bears no relation whatsoever to what is happening here. There is no such debate. The article is being debated <i>here</i>. Finally: Waiting for the Spanish Wikipedia to decide whether articles are worthy before writing about the subjects in the English Wikipedia is a very bizarre approach to constructing an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:51, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A "poor argument" is a personal judgment - and it runs counter to <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> (see Examples section). I based my recommendation on your comment that there was "no shortage of Spanish language speakers discussing this subject." For the purposes of this AfD, I simply propose waiting for the experts to sort out what's what before creating an English language article about Spanish language slang. By way of illustration, I would find it strange if someone wrote an article in the Finnish Wikipedia about a debatable English-language slang word not found in our own version. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 18:23, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I disagree. I think it's OK to say that an argument is "good" or "poor". There is, admittedly, a fine line between arguing that an argument is "poor" and making a personal attack on the person making the argument. Nonetheless, I would suggest that both sides "chill out" and focus on the arguments rather than characterizing whether an argument is "poor" or not. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 15:38, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article MUST NOT be deleted. It was placed there by a member of the historical fencing community, is referenced by members thereof, and is linked to several other articles. If there are any grounds for deletion at all, it is that this page has become a political quagmire. It should instead be locked. This "mob editorial" policy is the reason why academics such as myself refuse to allow Wikipedia as any sort of reputable source.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> it would be interesting to know the exact names of those who are so continuously attacking this well respected Maestro. He has been teaching to almost all researchers in the USA and America, but some (few of them, but very aggressive on the Net) have started to mob him since he clearly espressed some disagreement with them. Non one can offer REAl certification of Mastership in Tradition of Fencing. But his skill is repeatedly confirmed by several great personalities such as Maestro Ramon Martinez, who stated that he (Andrea) "clearly teaches what is the real tradition of fencing".</li>
</ul>
<p>Fact: Andrea Lupo Sinclair has been teaching to almost all the students and researchers of Historical Fencing in the USA and Europe. Removing the article about him should mean that most of many other articles about others should be deleted.</p>
<p>Fact: he has created the biggest Federation for historical Fencing in the world. The standards of the Federation he created are followed and seen as an example from other organisations such as the Spanish Fed and the British one. To me, this is enough to give relevance to Andrea lupo Sinclair here on Wikipedia. [No, this is not correct. ARMA is the largest historical fencing federation in the world, and it can be easily verified.]</p>
<p>Fact: Andrea Lupo Sinclair has founded the IMAF that collects some of the most relevant teachers in world. This is another fact of relevance. [How many teachers does IMAF number right now? According to the IMAF website, not more than ten, only a few of whom teach fencing]</p>
<p>Fact: he has been mobbed for three years by some of the very aggressive self promoting "researchers" in the USA because the knowledge of this Maestro was obscuring their own one. [This is debatable, and therefore a non-fact]</p>
<p>Fact: he has been independent from political games, and this can be absolutely proved. That is why some of the big "politicians" in fencing hates him so much, at the point that have no shame in attacking he who has been the only one to create a true independent federation in Italy. [Nobody hates anyone. Again, this is about credentials. These either exist or not.]</p>
<p>Fact: Andrea Lupo Sinclair still travels in the USA but not at the same events of other researchers or so called ones. All the IMAF has decided to change a bit its policy of public presence. But it is deeply unfair to use this as an evidence of other issues. [And this is from someone uninterested in politics. Ah.]</p>
<p>Others informations could be given by Maestro <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramon_Martinez_eb3f.html" title="Ramon Martinez">Ramon Martinez</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/z/User%7EArzach_2_7ce9.html" title="User:Arzach 2">Arzach 2</a></p>

It is badly in need of sources, though. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> 19:38, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Gentlemen; this individual has a worrisome propensity for free-wheeling claims that he invariably can't back up. Just take a cursory look at his bio page on his website. There's no mention of how he obtained his title. One would think that would be the first thing a Fencing Master would mention, no? But he surely "attended the best high-school," "designed the best blade" and taught "most researchers and fencers in Europe and the US." Right. A passing mention to the HUGE controversy this guy's created around his name by spouting off these enormities (which is why he no longer shows his face at general US fencing events) has to be included, or else Wiki is just a vehicle for unchecked self-promotion. A personal attack would be: he's a fraud. An objective statement, instead: critics say he hasn't produced his credentials, which is what the overwhelming majority of historical fencers in the US are asking themselves. If you think this latest version is imperfect, please let me know and I'll be glad to tone it down further or add any reference you consider appropriate. Cheers. Nuages2000.

<p><b>Comment</b> Mr. Mondschein, there is no mob editorial. Questioning the credentials of someone who claims them is not a personal attack. Questioning the motives of those who pose such a simple question, on the other hand, is. As for locking an entry, well. So I can post an entry calling myself the father of contemporary Psychology, and as soon as someone asks for my credentials, I'd have one of my minions cry for the entry to be locked? Not deleted, mind you, but locked? And then cry wolf about Wikipedia's lack of academic credibility?</p>
<p>That's a bit too convenient, don't you think? So let's each of us put up some romanticized fiction about ourselves, lock the entries when somebody raises some predictable questions, and cast aspersions on those meanies who do the asking.</p>
<p>So, for the 1000th time: where's this great Maestro's official certificate? If this cannot be produced, where's the "notability" about this individual, as someone keeps asking? Again, let's all put up a higly embellished page about ourselves. Go Wiki!</p>

<p>The article contains inherent POV, as there are no fixed standards for determining an "automotive flop". As can be seen in the article's history and discussion page, it provokes perpetual conflicts, and is used by some people as a means of publicizing their POVs on selected cars or brands. It is evaluatory in its nature, and Wikipedia's main task is not to evaluate, but to provide information. I do not see why would any user seek for such information on WP, and if found, this article can only compromise WP's status as a good source of impartial information.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- it makes for interesting commentary. The individual articles linked from the page should have enough information that substantiates the concept of a "flop", though. The talk page for the list should contain some objective definition of what it means to be a flop, such as a short production run, lower than expected sales, or widespread criticism (like "<a href="../../../u/n/s/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed_1b6a.html" title="Unsafe at Any Speed">Unsafe at Any Speed</a>"). The <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth_Prowler_ce53.html" title="Plymouth Prowler">Plymouth Prowler</a>, for example, doesn't qualify for this list because it was intended to be a limited-production vehicle -- as far as I can tell, anyway. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 16:03, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> While the article sure made for some interesting discussions there is no reference for what a sales flop is. While I realize that this is vague concept, much like the term flagship, a policy similay to that found on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_flagship_vehicles_by_manufacturer.html" title="List of flagship vehicles by manufacturer">List of flagship vehicles by manufacturer</a>, should be instituted here- one source for every vehicle listed as a flop. POV is not too strong, as Karrman stated, it is ususally removed quickly.

<li><b>Comment</b> - let me reiterate that POV is INHERENT in such listings, and as we can see in the above comments even, it will be perpetually causing discussions and not reach a stable, satisfactory form. Wikipedia is also not a place to provide "interesting commentaries", encyclopedias do not provide these, but facts and information.

<li><b>Keep</b> I realize what you're trying to say, but rather than deleting the article for fear of wrongful inclusions in the list, lets find a way to better define "flop". Nobody is going to put <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota_Camry_3979.html" title="Toyota Camry">Toyota Camry</a> as an entry (the best selling car of the last decade in the US), and we won't have to worry about any excessively inappropriate inclusions. Also, if an entry seems to be not quite a flop, or questionable, the user simply has to click on it and more information about the car's sales failure can be given.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is a question of only allowing mathematically accurate and precise definitions, vs. allowing general consensus and obvious but unprovable fact. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 17:01, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe that "obvious but unprovable facts" are a nicely-sounding catchphrase that can serve as a loophole for introducing non-encylopedic topics and pseudo-information, while avoiding proper definitions and referencing. Sometimes a definition of a subject is vague, and this is then discussed by a given article, but the definition of a "automotive flop" is inherently subjective and dependent on the peculiar POV of a given person - there can be as many definitions as users here. But that's not the main point.</dd>
<dd>The main point is that lists in general should only be created if they are really needed in WP for information/navigation purposes, and are too big or cumbersome to be included as parts of an article or a template. For example, one would expect an encyclopedia to contain a <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_of_Chinese_monarchs_c834.html" title="Table of Chinese monarchs">full list of Chinese Emperors</a>, with reign years, date of birth/death, dynasty etc. preferably, but it would be far too big to be included in the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_of_China_81a3.html" title="Emperor of China">Emperor of China</a> article. Therefore, some factual information got moved to a separate list/table.</dd>
<dd>But, as you can read <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html#Lists_are_not_a_place_to_make_value_judgements_of_people_or_organizations" title="WP:LIST">here</a>, lists are not a place to make value judgements. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> guideline refers to people and organizations, but I believe making value judgements of places or items would also be quite improper - would you find a "list of cities which are really terrible" or "list of disgusting jewellery items" proper? This list is in fact very similar to those examples.</dd>
<dd>This could be remedied by devising a good definition and change the title to a non-judgemental one, like "List of automobile models that sold worse than manufacturers' sales projections", but would it be anything really necessary in an encyclopedia? Wouldn't it be better to keep such lists in car-related websites, where one does not have to mind NPOV, and which are in general directed at car buffs and not the general population of Internet users?</dd>
<dd>And if you believe a given vehicle WAS a flop, and have a good rationale for such statement, why not just include that in the article and not cause tensions by putting it on a "list"?

<li><b>Keep</b> It's a given that some car models <i>will</i> flop for one reason or another. And it's also a given that deciding on what is or isn't a flop is definitely POV. The POV here, however, is not from the article editors, but rather the automotive press, the manufacturers, and the general public. I found the article through the AfD, and it's a fascinating read on all the ways the automobile industry has mucked thigs up over the years. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 18:02, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How in the world does the auto industry generate POV here? Have you ever read an official GM press release stating "Cadillac Cimarron is a flop"?

<dd>Yet it's not a value judgment as in a page called "List of really, really good authors" or "great recipes". It's a value judgment of common sense, and although I know that some people don't have it, the definition of a "flop" is so obvious and yet intangible that we cannot let a need for an exact definitions be the downfall of this article. In addition, each entry is explained, so we can let the reader decide. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 19:05, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, if you've got something that's indefinable and within a "grey area", then trying to categorize items definitely according to that criterium <b>is</b> POV. You put something on the list because your "common sense" suggests you that it is a flop. Still, some other person might not think of it as flop, and as being a flop is not defined well and a "grey area", you can both be right in your own perception and there is no neutral and fixed criteria to decide who is right. Therefore, putting or deleting anything on the list <b>is</b> inherently POV.</dd>

<p>Non-standard usage. Consists entirely of factual inaccuracies and non-neutral POV.

I suppose it's <i>conceivable</i> that a good article with this name could exist in the future, but the current content is all junk.

<p>Current text is irreparably non-neutral and generally factually inaccurate.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Kinu. The article doesn't actually describe an organized movement which bears the name "matriarchal marriage"; it's just a biased, POV and just plain <i>weird</i> take on the hardly new or radical phenomenon of the stay-at-home dad. There most certainly is <i>not</i> any growing trend of marriages where women own all the property and men are restricted to domestic servitude. Gender roles in marriage are certainly <i>evolving</i>, but not <i>that</i> far or fast. Matriarchal marriage is a valid and encyclopedic term, but this isn't even close to being the right article about it. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:07, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - Does not appear to be advertising (no marketing-speak) any more than any other soft drink article would be.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I think it is a bit unfair that an article should be wiped purely because the product is not on Amazon... the CD was previously available from Dress Circle, FootLight Records in New York, and all Forbidden Planet stoers in England. It was also sold through UFO Magazine, and is currently available through www.musicline-ltd.com (which in fact DOES sell through Amazon.) My society is staging the show and we were pleased to see the artilce. I have alerted the author, who states that, the authors of the original quotes do not mind their feedback being printed. I have asked him to contribute, so maybe that will help too.<br />
Just checked about what is "notable" - The author, Daniel O'Brien, was nominated for the Really Useful Group Best Newcomer Awards at the Vivian Ellis Prize 2000. This should qualify for a major music competition - it was a staple of the Musical Theatre industry for many years, and was where the lyricist for Phantom of the Opera was discovered. Many industry profesionals were judges - Cameron Mackintosh, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Don Black etc. The composer / arranger of the show / CD is Iain Cook, of the band Aereogramme, who have been published by Chemikal Underground Records worldwide, a very respected indie Scottish label who also publish Bell &amp; Sebastian and The Delgadoes. So hopefully this won't be deleted, would seem a shame to! We are having a great time in rehearsal and hopefully others can find out about it too through this! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 217.33.247.248 (<a href="../../../2/1/7/User_talk%7E217.33.247.248.html" title="User talk:217.33.247.248">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_217.33.247.248_450c.html" title="Special:Contributions/217.33.247.248">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as nn. Also, by the anonhymous comments above, it seems pretty safe the article's appearance is to puff the revival of the 2001 musical, thus, an advertisement. In most afds, editors are faced with judging notability from evidence here and now. In this case, we have the hindsight of five years to judge by. The original musical had a handful of reviews, arguably the most notable being the SF Channel's. There is nothing since, the album isn't available anywhere that I can find except from the one outlet in the UK. It's not an official WP policy, but I'm saying the musical disappeared with nary a whimper and nothing to mark its passing in five years. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 14:54, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Retain</b> The musical that this CD is of is still in production - see comments above - these are Amateur productions that would be much more likely to want to be able to find something about the musical on Wikipedia, the CD itself seems to not be available but when did this make it worthy of deletion? --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasterMereel_172d.html" title="User:JasterMereel">Jaster</a> 12:38, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Retain</b> "It's not an official WP policy, but I'm saying the musical disappeared with nary a whimper and nothing to mark its passing in five years" - it's ironic that you are requesting objectivity when you lack it yourself, making an ill informed and unprofessional comment, which you yourself admit is irrelevant in the current context. It is very easy to be snippy - one might suggest that you need to learn how to spell, for example. The fact of the matter is, the show is out there being produced. We could supply some photos, if you're interested. It is also available for purchase. I really don't see the problem - a dictionary is intended to impart knowledge, why so eager to cut information? It's very easy to hit delete, not so easy to invest a little time into something. There are people out there investing money and staging this work, it has been featured in a lot of media features, what more do you want? There are people who are more than happy to give you the info you seek - photos, details of the show itself, just list them and they will be supplied (some already have been). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 217.33.247.248 (<a href="../../../2/1/7/User_talk%7E217.33.247.248.html" title="User talk:217.33.247.248">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_217.33.247.248_450c.html" title="Special:Contributions/217.33.247.248">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Details of your production of a musical have nothing to do with the notability of this album. It'd be more appropriate for a separate article called "Area 51 (musical)" but it's irrelevant here. That's the problem of this article. It doesn't focus on the notability of the album but tries to promote a musical that you're putting on.

<li>I created this article and I would like to thank everyone for their feedback. I will do my best to remove POV and long-winded language, and add references. I don't think it should be deleted or merged with another article because many sociologists feel tabloid talk shows represent a very unique period in American pop-cultural history and since there have been entire scholarly books written about tabloid talk shows, there should at least be a wikipedia article on the subject. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/User_talk%7EEditingoprah_d3ee.html" title="User talk:Editingoprah">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Editingoprah_b75f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Editingoprah">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article looks interesting and I notice attempts made to make it less POV and more cited in the past day, with mentions this effort will continue. I think assisting with the formalizing of references and helping make the article more NPOV would be more useful than deleting it.

<li>As TransUtopian points out, I am trying to make this article more neutral and referenced. I took a lot of the details from the Jerry Springer and Ricki Lake page, and now that I read it over there was indeed a lot of POV language like "vulgar" and "trashy". But I obviously agree with TransUtopian that these are simply a matter of style and can be slowly corrected if you're all kind enough to give me and anyone who wishes to help the opportunity to do so. I also believe it would be a huge mistake to merge this article because it describes a very unique breed of talk shows representing a transitional period in American history and the article mentions a Yale sociologist who wrote an entire book about the genre and he's not the only one. I also felt the article was needed because the intro to the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Donahue_4ba6.html" title="Phil Donahue">Phil Donahue</a> page used to contain a huge long winded explanation about how he was the first of the talk shows to take his microphone into the audience etc. I edited the intro to simply say he hosted the first tabloid talk show, with a link to this page explaining the concept and significance. I believe this article is relevant to many different existing wikipedia articles as this genre has existed for decades and was watched by tens of millions of in the U.S. alone <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 03:57, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP!!!</b> As a professional poker player from Las Vegas, I have often found that the 5 of spades is unlucky. Yesterday, for example, I lost both my cars and $24 thousand, all because of that evil card. Many of my fellow card players have had similar problems and they all blame it on the 5 of Spades. --pokerking 10:57, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep this entry.</b> I am a professer at Oxford University, England. I have an MSc in Applied Statistics and also do some work for RoSPA (The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents). My department has found that over 90% of household accidents and over 70% of all accidents are a direct cause of, or happen in the near vacinity of the 5 of spades playing card. I conclude therefore that you should not delete this entry as our findings backup the speculation of this entry. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by profanthony (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProfanthony_309e.html" title="User talk:Profanthony">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_profanthony_277e.html" title="Special:Contributions/profanthony">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Reading this page, it seems that the <i>superstition surrounding</i> this particular card is unique to my area of the world - I apologise that this is not internationally recognised. I have not so much as mentioned this entry to anyone I know and due to the tone of these two defending entries, I believe they are simply just jokes. I know that this claim, however, will be difficult to prove. --<a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKryters_7ef2.html" title="User:Kryters">Kryters</a> 14:35, 14 July 2006 (UTC) Also edited --<a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKryters_7ef2.html" title="User:Kryters">Kryters</a> 20:46, 14 July 2006 (UTC) (inclusion of the italicized text)</li>

<ul>
<li>In my opinion this entry should stay because it explains the folklore surrounding this playing card. The history of many seemingly odd things appear in the wiki. It is possible that this is a regional superstition but that should not rule out its credibility in the wiki. Perhaps however there should be a link in the superstitions entry to this an example of regional superstition?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Gorgia Guy: Yes, the Ace of Spades is notable, however, in Kryter's view, and in his area, the 5 of spades may be equally notable.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Porquin &amp; Chomes75: Although not backed up by reliable fact, the article is not based on the view of an individual that "the 5 of spades is unlucky". It is based on the sup[erstitions of a region and goes on to explain variations of card games; not necessarily related to the so-called bad luck of the card.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Recury: I'd not heard this either but I have played the mentioned versions of the card games involving the 5 of spades, perhaps there is a basis to the entry?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>There might be a basis to it, but we need to see at least one or two things published that mention the 5 of spades being unlucky. If you could just find a couple web pages that mention it being unlucky or at least as part of the rule variations that are mentioned in the article, that would go a long way towards convincing people to keep this, I think. Which part of the world are you from, if you don't mind my asking? <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 22:02, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My conclusion is that this entry should remain as there is no valid reason to remove- it if it is true that in the author's area this card is regarded as unlucky.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and sockpuppetry (also note that Theflamehaired1 has no other edits because of speedy deletes on articles he made, as warned on his user page). I doubt that the five of spades has any sort of notability as to being unlucky over any other cards. It appears to be orignal research, which Wikipedia shouldn't have. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 06:53, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Regardless of whether sockpuppetry was involved or not, it is the value of the arguments that theflamehaired1 put forward that is important - though I deny any association with this user. As it states above, this is certainly not a vote. --<a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKryters_7ef2.html" title="User:Kryters">Kryters</a> 13:39, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, in standard decks of cards (to my knowledge), the five of any suit only has 9 figures on it (the five suit symbols, 1 number in the northwest corner, 1 number in the southeast corner, and the suit symbols in each of those corners). <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 06:55, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I have noted above, the 5 of Spades is also highly unlikely (<i>unlucky</i>) in tarot [<a href="http://tarot.artofdivination.com/a40.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://tarot.artofdivination.com/a40.shtml" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>]. Also, [<a href="http://www.irishtarot.com/pages/how-to-read-playing-cards.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.irishtarot.com/pages/how-to-read-playing-cards.php" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>] shows that the 5 of Spades corresponds to a jealous rival when enquiring about love. Many packs of cards go by a different design, with the number and symbol in every corner, as you can see by the entrys picture. This clearly shows 13 black figures in the design. --<a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKryters_7ef2.html" title="User:Kryters">Kryters</a> 11:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>Unlikely</i> in tarot is right.Our article <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarot.html" title="Tarot">Tarot</a> doesn't even recognize "spades" as a possible suit. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> |<a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 14:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Spades corresponds to swords in tarot. <a href="http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art19531.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art19531.asp" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> --<a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKryters_7ef2.html" title="User:Kryters">Kryters</a> 15:33, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Still, in normal Playing Cards, ones that people play poker, euchre, cribbage, solitaire, etc. with, the five of any suit only has nine figures on it. The image on the article is taken from an outdated version of Microsoft's Solitaire. The version on my computer does not have numbers or suit symbols in the northeast and southwest corners, just in the other two. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 00:49, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is another point for dispute. According to <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/pjmadsen/cards4/" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/pjmadsen/cards4/" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, original cards went by the design shown in 5_spades.PNG - with symbols in each corner. However, these designs have faded in favour of the version you have described. I noticed you described the design as "out of date" rather than "original"&#160;:). As far as I know, Microsoft Solitaire has always used the simplified version of cards - I made 5_spades.PNG myself based on the MS design. --<a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKryters_7ef2.html" title="User:Kryters">Kryters</a> 13:39, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Call it a war, call it a conflict - whatever it is, it certainly is something. It makes sense to keep, because two operations are clearly a part of something.

<li><b>Comment</b> From the Yahoo article cited above: <i>"The military offensive <b>coincided with</b> a major Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip to retrieve another captured soldier and halt Palestinian rocket fire."</i> (emphasis added). That doesn't sound to me like they're regarding these events as a single conflict. It's obvious that the events are related. That is not the same thing as saying it's a single conflict. The CSM article is calling the Lebanon situation a war, but refers to the Gaza events beginning with the words <i>"At the same time..."</i> <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:32, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I just counted the votes, and after 5 days, there are presently more keeps than deletes: the fact being that calling the situation a "conflict" instead of a "war" resolved general objections. Furthermore, there have been some work on timelines for events before and during this conflict: I feel content from those lists should be used to expand the article. Links to all articles relevant to the current situation should be posted in a "See Also" section.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but, to be clear, I was the one who started the article, so you might want to discount my vote. On the other hand, I am not directly connected with Zeugma (other than social acquaintance with authors - impossible to avoid in a city like St. John's) Here's why I felt that it had merit, and created it:
<ul>
<li>The journal exists within an arts community (Newfoundland's, that is) that is generally strong, but it is the only literary journal currently active. As such, it bears a importance that goes beyond simple circulation numbers.</li>
<li>Zeugma has successfully reached it's second edition, and received more funding (such as the N&amp;L Arts Council grant mentioned above) and greater circulation. I would not have supported the presence of this article after only one printing.</li>
<li>Zeugma is functioning as a professional publication in ways that are not maintained by many "non-notable" publications. The founders (and primary driving forces behind the publication), mentioned in the article, are not publishing their own work, for example, meaning this is not simple self-promotion.</li>
<li>Zeugma's has been covered in local media (none of which maintain online archives I can point you to - sorry!) by programs and publications that have no connections to the publishers.</li>
<li>Basically, Zeugma probably <i>is</i> non-notable outside Newfoundland (at least, so far), but maintains more than enough regional significance to justify it's existence. I'm sure the next poster is going to say "I'm from Newfoundland, and I've never heard of it!", but I'm not trying to say that *everyone* here is touched by Zeugma, only that it is relevant <i>enough</i> within the arts community here to justify inclusion.</li>
<li>Finally, as a response to the hand-sewn comment, that was clearly intentional - This wasn't a "run it through mom's sewing machine" type job. I know you have allowed for that, but you make parallel claims that the type of binding can hurt circulation (true - it's time-consuming, I assume) and notability. I disagree with the second - as long as a type of binding looks professional, or at least intentional (both of which this one did, at least to the uneducated eye such as mine), I would suggest it has no effect on notability. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 16:25, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I just realized that the article has been edited a couple of times to make it more "addy", and I'm going to go back and filter a bit, hopefully creating an article that will pass POV tests. However, within an encyclopedia/community which is willing to maintain an entire category for "encyclopedic" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_porn_stars" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_porn_stars" rel="nofollow">|lists of porn stars</a>, I hope that an article on a small but growing literary journal can be maintained. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 16:25, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am fixing a nomination (see talk page and history for details). Rationale is (essntially): "Not notable. Not encyclopedic [...] obscure and trivial.". I personally disagree.

<li><b>Delete</b>, not very many related Google hits for philberth transformer or philbert transformer, and most of them were pages in French which just happened to have the French word <i>transformer</i> ("to transform" I guess?) in them. Also has the worst diagram ever in it. It seems pretty obscure to me right now, though I admit I'm not familiar with the subject matter. I'd reconsider if someone made a case for notability, of course. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 19:41, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

This is essentially a collection of trivia and has no apparent usefulness. The information is alreadly fully contained in another list. Also, the old "shoe size" analogy has been brought up a number of times, and hell, I think it's appropriate here. If you gave me 3 hours alone to think of a possible application for these lists, I would be dumbfounded. As much as I hate citing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indescriminate collection of information</a>, this is exactly what it was created for.

<li><b>Comment</b>. My opinion is mainly based on the fact that, whenever a Chief Executive (for want of a more appropriate term) dies, is elected, or has a birthday, one of the first things the newspapers will point out is that he (or she) is the n'th longest-lived Chief Executive. I'll grant you the Nobel Prizewinners, but the relative ages of Chief Executives is something that's of general interest to the media, and (one assumes) to the general public. However, if the general consensus is to delete these lists, the corresponding lists of monarchs should go too - if longevity is generally _uninteresting_, then why should we acknowledge it at all?</li>

<dd>This seems odd to me, but I wouldn't have noticed this sort of fact, so I decided to look around a bit. I picked the death of Ronald Reagan, as I figured that'd be major and recent enough to have some reliable sites still available. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/05/reagan.health/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/05/reagan.health/" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> is a CNN.com story.

I don't mean this proves that no news source ever makes reference to this sort of thing, but I don't believe it is a common practice. GassyGuy 23:20, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would note that every single Pope except one has held office until they have died, so the end of term of their office coincides with their death. That's why age is non-trivially significant for the Pope - because people expect them to serve until they die. The modern US Presidency is limited to 2 terms (8 years) and they cannot serve again. The age of former Presidents is irrelevant to the US political system. The media talks about the age of former presidents, because - bluntly - its a game (for the news commentators) of wondering when they're going to die (especially in the case of Reagan, who had Alzheimer's) because when they die, it means a big media event and a state funeral. The <i>comparative longevity</i> as opposed to <i>the anticipated deaths</i> of former Presidents is marginal and trivial compared to that main consideration. The House resolutions are celebrating Reagan not-dying-yet not his winning-the-race-of-longevity-against-every-other-President-which-will-prove-his-ultimate-superiority. It's the same when we talk about our own elderly relatives. We're glad they've not passed on yet, but we're not expressing the hope that they "beat" everyone else in the longevity "contest". The WSJ column you cite is a humorous trivia piece about a humourous interview exchange. And in that specific Washington Post example you gave, they're emphasizing his age not his comparative longevity (if they were, there'd be a silly discussion of why Reagan is living longer than other Presidents blahblahblah)<a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:01, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting points, certainly more insightful than "<i>ridiculous listcruft</i>". Thanks for the discussion of the Pope, although you might have noted that I mentioned that in passing, not unlike your more appropriate French tennis player and Mexican poet examples. You are certainly entitled to view the longetivity of the Presidents as "humorous trivia". However, I would beg to differ, not the least because comparative longevity has long obsessed the ex-Presidents themselves, for example <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Adams_7525.html" title="John Adams">John Adams</a>, whose famous last words were "<a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> survives" <a href="http://www.americanpresident.org/history/johnadams/biography/LifeAfterPresidency.common.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.americanpresident.org/history/johnadams/biography/LifeAfterPresidency.common.shtml" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:22, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Newspapers are perfectly valid sources at wikipedia and the WSJ is better than most. According to our article, the WSJ has a circulation of 2.6 million and serves a global elite (<i>a readership profile of about 60% top management, an average income of $191,000, an average household net worth of $2.1 million</i>). They don't just print anything. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:45, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand that they printed a table of the ages of the oldest-lived presidents, but I dont' understand how this illustrates that it is a matter of common concern and not more than a nice bit of trivia. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 03:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have already placed a number of links into this discussion showing that Presidential longetivity is frequently mentioned in the media. I have further pointed out how the issue of longetivity has been an issue for the presidents going back to Jefferson and Adams. I understand how some might find that trivial. However, I consider it just as valid as any other aspect of presidential scholarship. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:55, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What's the first thing you do when a president dies? You mention how old he was. Of course the relative age of presidents comes up often, but that does not mean it is notable, and that does not make it more than trivia. I also cringe at the fact at such justifications being used for "List of Wimbledon champions by longevity" or something of the like. Lists arranged as such should have some value in their arrangement, i.e. why does it matter that Dwight Eisenhower(#13) lived longer than Andrew Jackson(#14)? Also, what about the other nominations up for deletion? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 04:00, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it comes up often it is "notable". Otherwise, it would not come up at all. Regarding "trivia", one man's trivia is another man's vital nugget of information. Every article here contains some element of trivia. If I looked at the articles you created, I would probably consider some to be trivial. I might also think that someone would have some use for the information. I didn't know that Andrew Jackson lived almost as long as Dwight Eisenhower. I think that is an amazing bit of information considering that Jackson was born in 1767, fought in a bunch of wars (like Ike) and was sick most of the time with TB. The ramifications of this type of thing for historians and president buffs are endless. Regarding the other nominations, I already pointed out that this is a global encyclopedia so we need the same lists for foreign heads of state. I can tell you that the same issues of longetivity are frequently raised in other countries (Churchill and Mitterrand immediately spring to mind). I will say that as a general rule group noms are a bad idea. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:29, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dearest Kevin- It is not a quest to change the rules, but a quest to <i>create</i> rules when there aren't any. A clear violation in the absence of a specific ruling against it is not grounds for inclusion. But I suppose that this call for change is a foolish venture and we should simply live with the status quo. Remember that we are not mindless rule-followers, and we do what we believe is best for the encyclopedia. Remember the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharisees.html" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</a>?

<p>The page is not slanderous; it is purely informational, based on sources on the internet which can be verifed. This person may not be as notable as George Washington, but it does not violate the tenets of Wikipedia and the tag "non-notable" seems inappropriate based on the content of the article.</p>

School was not going well because it was so hard. Cory helped out at my school in Charlottesville last year and now I get B's on some tests. I looked Cory up on www.wikipedia.com because I wanted to show my Mom who helped me. She did not think he would be on the internet but she was wrong. We have posters of Cory up in our school.

<li><b>Keep</b> For two reasons. Firstly, as a Eurovision Song Contest entry it has clearly won some form of national contest. Exactly what sort of contest I can't be sure offhand, but some kind at the very least (see the archived debate linked from <a href="../../../d/u/_/Du_Bist_bd35.html" title="Du Bist">Du Bist</a> for this sort of an argument). Further, as it was the first time the Cypriot ESC entry was not in Greek and the first time that English had been performed, this makes it a significant point in terms of Cypriot ESC participation as well as a point in the progression towards the largely monoglot English Contest of today. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 06:36, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As per BigHaz: it is a song which represented a whole nation in an international competition, and was voted for by a significant section of that population in order to represent them. It went on to be seen by hundreds of millions of viewers in one of the world's longest-running television shows. There are many other articles about "XXX (song)" - so songs clearly have their place on Wikipedia. This is a <i>very</i> notable example of a song. As for a disambig... well there wasn't one already created, so not too many people have been confused. <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurosong_5f20.html" title="User:Eurosong">EuroSong</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/u/r/User_talk%7EEurosong_19f5.html" title="User talk:Eurosong">talk</a></sup> 15:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - if there's fear of confusion, I would be behind it being renamed as "Gimme (song)" or "Gimme (Eurovision song)". It just happened to be a pagename that wasn't taken when the article was created and which covered the subject matter well. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:45, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would compare this to American Idol, which I would say every contestant isn't notable enough on their own to warrant their own page, but they each do currently. However, the Eurovision has many more contestants, doesn't link to the songs, but does link to the artists. Why wouldn't the artist's page be sufficient? Gimme is not currently linked to by <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2002_6cbb.html" title="Eurovision Song Contest 2002">Eurovision Song Contest 2002</a> nor <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_%28band%29.html" title="One (band)">One (band)</a>. Also, the 2005 Cyprus Eurovision entry by a former member of the band doesn't have an entry. How many songs that were entered into Eurovision have their own entry? Neither of the ties for 3rd place of Eurovision 2002 have their own entry either, and this song placed 6th. <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 05:33, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>To address the points in the order in which they were raised: I'm not totally cognisant of the debates regarding the notability or otherwise of Idol contestants, however I'd be tempted to argue that if each contestant does currently have their own page, they're notable enough to warrant same. Regardless, as the ESC is larger than that (broadcast throughout the world for starters), I'm not sure that it's the most useful analogy. The song is not currently linked to from either of the pages you've named due (in the case of the band) to my own laziness in not linking it and (in the case of the Contest page for that year) a conscious decision to link the Contest pages to the songs <i>en masse</i> rather than piecemeal (i.e. once all the songs for the 2002 Contest, or as many as don't get AfD'd, have entries, then the page will be updated to link accordingly). In regard to the number of ESC entries with their own pages, a quick check of the the relevant category tells me that there are 273 (275 entries in the category less one song not performed and one separate entry for the Swedish version of "Waterloo"). In regard to the songs at that particular Contest, there are currently 8 entries with their own article - including this one. One of them (<a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_Away_%28Eurovision_song%29_74d2.html" title="Run Away (Eurovision song)">Run Away</a>, or "Runaway") being a tied-for-third entry. As I said earlier, the lack of links is due to a combination of laziness and it not having seemed like a good idea at the time. I'll happily put the relevant links in if that's what's required here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 07:12, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Further, in relation to the claims regarding the 2005 entry (which I missed earlier), I would direct the nominator to the article <a href="../../../e/l/a/Ela_Ela_%28Come_Baby%29_ba9b.html" title="Ela Ela (Come Baby)">Ela Ela (Come Baby)</a>. I was unaware (I'm not as well-up on Cypriot pop music as I'd like to be, this isn't a laziness thing) that the singer there was a former member of the band, but will update the relevant articles in accordance with the information. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 07:17, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But it isn't broadcast in America to my knowledge... Dunno about China. What makes you think it is broadcast outside the EU?<a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 20:41, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm reasonably sure that I've heard about it being broadcast in the States (certainly there are plans afoot for an American version thereof, designed as a competitor to Idol). I know it's broadcast outside the EU because I live in Australia and watch it every year. Further, it's broadcast in countries like Armenia [who compete], Georgia and Azerbaijan (none of whom are EU members). I'm also aware of a broadcast in Canada. That said, even if it's only broadcast in the EU, that's still at least a comparable potential audience to American Idol. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:42, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It has nothing to do with the EU whatsoever. It is broadcast by full and associate members of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Broadcasting_Union_5408.html" title="European Broadcasting Union">European Broadcasting Union</a>. Full members lie within the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Broadcasting_Area_352a.html" title="European Broadcasting Area">European Broadcasting Area</a> (which has <i>nothing</i> to do with the EU, and is only loosely based on geographic Europe), and associate members may be any around the world. The Contest is broadcast in Australia and Japan - and has been shown also in Canada. It is not shown in the USA because no American TV company is an EBU member. Hope that's cleared that up for you&#160;:) <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurosong_5f20.html" title="User:Eurosong">EuroSong</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/u/r/User_talk%7EEurosong_19f5.html" title="User talk:Eurosong">talk</a></sup> 02:19, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>I know nothing about that. There is a game called BIONICLE Heroes out later this year, but it does not involve all three islands to my knowledge.

<p><i>All I can tell you is no one here at LEGO seems to know anything about that. In general, standard Wiki is full of a lot of nonsense and really shouldn't be used as a resource -- if you want to check out a Wiki for BIONICLE, stick to the one BS01 does.</i></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Your contributions to this enyclopedia are objectionable because you, Ms. Frieske, have the same user name as the record label that you work for. With these contributions, including your repeated insertions of this, Mr. Moore's, and Moore's album into more reputable articles are done in a way that seems to me that you are treating Wikipedia as an advertising service, which it is <b><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">NOT</a></b>. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 03:39, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Being the exectuive producer, I would know more than most about our record label. I'm not spamming and I'm not using this as a soapbox. I've spent the last 72 two hours pouring over your guidelines, correcting posts, adding links, emailing your editors and in return all i get is negative feedback. It seems to me that you should point out <b>HOW I CAN FIX</b> these opinions so we can have an entry on wikipedia or please simply pull this off. I respect Wikipedia and I respect all the editors who work tirelessly to keep your encyclopedia to a high standard. I only wish that you <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> would provide us with the necessary information to <b>HELP</b> us instead of your own personal negative slant towards us. Blue Canoe Records is a respectable label, I only wish that you would find it in your heart to see this.

<li>A large amount of my issues with your contributions that you are pushing your label, its artist(s), and their album(s) as being notable in their areas of interest, which from what I know, is not the truth. A large amount of your edits put Mr. Moore onto lists of other reputable musical artists within articles, listing him along side <a href="../../../g/e/d/Geddy_Lee_0515.html" title="Geddy Lee">Geddy Lee</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Entwistle_c8ff.html" title="John Entwistle">John Entwistle</a>, among others. Your contributions about your label are severely questionable as to assert the notability of those within. I'm afraid that I cannot think of any way to help you to have these articles stay within Wikipedia, and I apologize for that. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 04:09, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> i looked at those pages you cited and I don't see Joseph's name on those pages. You are accusing us of adding things we didn't add. Joseph is a bass guitarist and obviously so is the two gentleman you cited. According to your post above, you are asserting that our contributions are not true and that we are posting false info and our embellishing our own personal opions here. Last time I checked Joseph was a bass player and darn good one at that. He is #25 out of the top #100 as posted by an outside source:<a href="http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/best_jazz/best_jazzbass.html" class="external free" title="http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/best_jazz/best_jazzbass.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/best_jazz/best_jazzbass.html</a>

<ul>
<li>First, stop making your comments headers. They disrupt the AFD logs. Second, sign your comments by placing ~~~~ at the end of your comments. Third, you did not add Joseph's name to the pages for Geddy Lee or John Entwistle, but you added him to lists where they were also listed, such as <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">Bass guitar</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bass_guitarists.html" title="List of bass guitarists">List of bass guitarists</a>, and the alumni list for <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Tennessee_21d3.html" title="University of Tennessee">University of Tennessee</a>. I went through where his article was listed and removed him from these lists because of the dubiousness of his notability, which is still being questioned (I did not remove the listing at U Tennessee, but another editor who felt the same way did, as well). Once again, I have nothing against your company and anyone involved withit, but I do have something against people who feel that they are important enough for mentioning on Wikipedia, which has been lauded by some as an unreliable resource because of editors who wish to do nothing but advertise, which your actions I felt to be as such. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 04:33, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>why are you pulling links on your own accord</b> <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a>, I respectful disagree. I've stated the facts. Joseph is an alumni of UTK and he does play bass guitar.

<li>He may be a bassist, but because of his (so far) lack of notability, I had removed him from the various lists and articles where you had inserted him. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 04:48, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Again, I stand by what I've been saying on the last 30 posts to you...I state the facts here. I'm not spamming nor am I advertising, because we don't need to do this, as we are having success without abusing or spamming credible bodies of work such as wikipedia.

<li>I have heard of Geddy Lee and John Entwistle, and they are established musical artists.

<li>Ok , I think <b>I've proved my point</b> about your negative slant and non-helpfulness towards Joseph and Blue Canoe Records <b>as stated by your comments above</b>. <b>You would rather impose your own personal opinion, which seems to go against the very guidelines which you have set forth.</b> It appears that many other people are familiar with Joseph his music and his contributions to both the <a href="http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/best_jazz/best_jazzbass.html" class="external text" title="http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/best_jazz/best_jazzbass.html" rel="nofollow">world of bass</a> and beyond.

<li>I am not imposing a personal opinion. If there are others who know about Joseph Patrick Moore and Blue Canoe Records, they are free to edit the encyclopedia as well. It is just that <b>you</b> are the sole contributor to the articles connected to the record label that <b>you</b> work for, and are promoting this artist by placing him elsewhere in the encyclopedia when his notability is in question by others. If he is notable, then yes, he deserves a mention at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bass_guitarists.html" title="List of bass guitarists">List of bass guitarists</a> as well as his alma mater, but he does not need to be mentioned in the actual article for the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">Bass guitar</a> or other various guitars. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 05:28, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Regular delete</b> asserts notability: <i>has been involved in many local, provincial, and national initiatives</i> - what would a political candidate's nomination statement be if they didn't even try to show he did significant things?

<li><s><b>do not delete</b></s> I have improved it. I agree it was unsatisfactory before and I will take sugestions for further improvment. I would like to know how to edit the title of the entry: It now reads "Desmond cole" and the "c" in cole should clearly be capitalized. --geordiemcruer 12:07, 14 July 2006

<li><b>Comment</b>. Geordie, while you have improved the article, that's not what's up for debate. The article is considered for deletion on notability grounds, since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia isn't really a soapbox</a>. Information about a candidate's personal life is campaign brochure material, not for wikipedia. Try using verifiable sources like newspapers, etc. In fact, take a look at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a> for a start. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 16:37, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>do not delete</b> I have removed some more personal information and added more context at the bottom. Note that two of Mr. Cole's opponents have entries. Vaughan's is of questionable significance since his greatest public relivance outside of the upcoming election is as a City TV reporter. Meanwhile, Dwight Drummond, a news anchor on the same station has no entry. Please continue to give me tips for improvement. --geordiemcruer 13:46, 14 July 2006
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Unfortunately, it doesn't matter whether Mr. Cole's opponents have entries, as Wikipedia isn't promotion for campaign candidates. The only thing for debate is whether Mr. Cole is notable. If you believe Vaughan's entry is not notable enough, list it as an AfD. The event participation that you have put in is probably not notable enough, though winning <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_Idol_8a56.html" title="City Idol">City Idol</a> might be. Also, please do not vote twice - I have stricken out one of your votes. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 21:44, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>do not delete</b> I think we could keep Desmond's entry on the grounds that he was "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" City Idol received a lot of press (locally and nationally) and the winners are still getting a lot of press because they are City Idol winners not because they are yet another candidate running for council. In this light I would reorganize the entry to focus more on Desmond's involvement with City Idol. hakka_moy 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Any claim to notability that this person has is solely due to the Stolen Sidekick ordeal; he is not famous enough outside of htat incident.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I am confused. The StolenSidekick story was reported around the world, with the name Evan Guttman appearing in Newspaper headlines, radio, and TV. For 3 weeks straight there were 5-10 million hits a day on the website and even though the story is over, more than 100,000 hits still a day. It was linked in over 400,000 websites. Yet, Wikipedia deleted the page twice. Now someone has created this page, and again it is being put up for deletion. What does it take to "make" Wikipedia. There is a page about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Poop_Girl" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Poop_Girl" rel="nofollow">Dog Poop Girl</a>. That wasn't reported in US newspapers (let alone on the front pages of them), yet it has a page here. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Kid" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Kid" rel="nofollow">Star Wars Kid</a> has a page... The StolenSidekick saga too had people creating videos, flash games, and photoshops. So, again...what does it take? In the end, I will quote what someone wrote when the Dog Pool Girl page was up for deletion: "these are the kinds of entries that make wikipedia so much more than an encarta clone. Interesting, if not always tasteful, articles about EVERYTHING notable... not just one person's concept of "appropriate".

<li><b>Keep</b> Worth keeping, the story is fresh, newsworthy and interesting. teaches people to be honest. JohnD508 00:33, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The argument against this article's notability has been sustained yet no valid reasoning has been presented in this light. That the value of the information being presented here can only be weighted in context is, in my opinion, not a legitimate argument because the nature of all information in this universe is that it can only be viewed in context--inside an infinite size system, all events are relative to each other. Ergo, the notability of first president George Washington exists only in context of a country called the United States of America, which in turn is only notable in context of a planet named Earth, and so on. Ultimately, a true encyclopedic endeavor would mandate the inclusion of all perceivable information without bias or regard for its "relevance," if only because relevance is subjective while reference sources ought to be objective. I am not saying that limitations of current technology and financial availability must not reasonably limit such an endeavor, but rather that an event which has been recognized by the international community could not have done so were it not "notable" in the eyes of a great many. This factor must be considered if Wikipedia is truly for the people, because it is the people that demand this information. --Connected 24x7 05:52, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What matters is <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Specifically, one of the guidelines states: "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. (Multiple similar stories describing a single day's news event only count as one coverage.)" Guttman has only been mentioned in the context of a single day's news event - the Sidekick incident - and nothing more, and thus does not meet the notability guideline as set in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 06:10, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>However, another guideline states that it is okay to have articles for "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events," something Evan Guttman has, indeed, accomplished. And "In 100 years time will anyone without a direct connection to the individual find the article useful?" Most certainly--the moral aspect behind the Stolen Sidekick issue transcends time as a core value of humanity. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Connected 24x7 (<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConnected_24x7_7341.html" title="User talk:Connected 24x7">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Connected_24x7_7b66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Connected 24x7">contribs</a>) at 15:08, July 18, 2006.</small></li>

<li>Well, the second guideline that you pointed out is under the alternatives section, which has not necessarily gained widespread support. Also, why are you making such sweeping judgements over the predicted sentimental value of this incident? One oculd argue that the P-P-P-Powerbook also teaches the similar morales, about honesty and what-not. It is on Wikipedia because it was still memorable and well-known months after it had taken place. I don't necessarily know if it's a <i>de facto</i> guideline or real, but it has been a general guideline that people only notable due to a single event are redirected into that event's article. For instance, the owner of <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a>, <a href="../../../c/j/a/CJayC_a5cf.html" title="CJayC">CJayC</a>, redirects to GameFAQs because he is not notable besides being the owner. <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patsy_Ramsey_edf9.html" title="Patsy Ramsey">Patsy Ramsey</a>, accused killer of her daughter, simply redirects into <a href="../../../j/o/n/JonBen%C3%A9t_Ramsey_b118.html" title="JonBenét Ramsey">JonBenét Ramsey</a> because she is not notable outside of her daughter's murder. <a href="../../../h/b/d/User%7EHbdragon88_4994.html" title="User:Hbdragon88">Hbdragon88</a> 21:34, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I beg to differ. There were actually now 3 news events that were reported. One was the start of the website, the second was the arrest of the alleged thief and return of the Sidekick, and the third was the Ebay auction with portion to charity. On top of that, it caused debate online and in the media on what is the right thing to do when you find someone else's property.

<p>This is a curious recently recreated page I am bringing here to get some opinion/consensus on. I first noticed this article when it appeared on AIV<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=60554052&amp;oldid=60551752" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&amp;diff=60554052&amp;oldid=60551752" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>. It had been around for quite a while (since 2004 if you look at the article's talk page and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;diff=2707684&amp;oldid=2707643" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;diff=2707684&amp;oldid=2707643" rel="nofollow">first AfD</a>), but two days later it was listed for AfD<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cali_Ruchala&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60908875" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cali_Ruchala&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=60908875" rel="nofollow">[59]</a> and within thirty minutes, before the AfD3 was made and without any comment from <i>anyone</i>, the article was deleted<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Cali_Ruchala" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Cali_Ruchala" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>. I looked into this before, and there are some curious things going on between the two editors mentioned in the AIV report, and involved in editing the article (eg <a href="http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/3114.html##9" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/3114.html##9" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>). I can only see these issues arising again, and maybe even another hasty deletion, so I think it best to get some opinion here. This person may be a journalist, and a founder of a publishing press. The recently recreated article is currently light on content, but it has looked more convincing. I have <i>no vote</i> at this time. -- <a href="../../../z/z/u/User%7EZzuuzz_ab5e.html" title="User:Zzuuzz">zzuuzz</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/z/u/User_talk%7EZzuuzz_d9bf.html" title="User talk:Zzuuzz">(talk)</a></sup> 00:46, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I recently came across some material written by Cali Ruchala and was surprised not to find anything about him/her in Wikipedia, - on further search I noted that there had been an article and I basically restored it as I did not see in the discussion of the article any reason for deletion. Indeed it looked to me that the consensus of the few respondents was "keep". I agree that there is not much information but a little is better than nothing, and we have to trust the wiki to get more over time. Is Cali Ruchala the real name or a nome-de-plume? This a spurious argument. That's all we have, and there are lots of people who are listed here not by their given name. If it is not the real name, let us say so in the article. So that's my reason to keep/restore the article.<a href="../../../e/k/e/User%7EEkem_3ee4.html" title="User:Ekem">Ekem</a> 02:03, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That you were patrolling new articles is not the point. You shouldn't be responding so rapidly. Stubs need time to grow.

<dd>SlimVirgin did not "vote solicit", she asked me to look at the article and AfD, and told me her reasoning as to why she thought it should be kept. I looked at it, did a little research of my own (I noted, for example, that Langley has been interviewed for 1/2 hour on BBC TV as well <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/asguru/generalstudies/tvtimecodes.shtml#drugs06" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/asguru/generalstudies/tvtimecodes.shtml#drugs06" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>), and decided that the article should be kept. Is asking for third-party opinions on Wikipedia now something to be frowned upon? I have had literally hundreds of requests on my Talk: page from dozens of editors asking me to look at situations.

<dd>Has she had any public recognition? Sitting on a committee doesn't confer intrinsic notability, neiother does appearing in an interview on TV. Has her work been cited anywhere?

What I am asking here is: would anyone outside the circle of Animal Rights activism ever have heard of Gill? I'd say no. Please convince me that I should have heard of the lady. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 22:08, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, she is known within animal protection circles, not just animal rights activism. So anyone involved in <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_testing.html" title="Animal testing">animal testing</a> will know of her i.e. anyone involved in writing about it, presenting evidence about it, taking cases through court etc. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:12, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>The Scientist</i> doesn't exactly command great respect. In <i>Nature</i> (the leading British science journal) Gill is mentioned twice (as spokeswoman for the Hadwen Trust), saying that not enough is being done to replace animal testing. I see no evidence (in <i>Nature</i> again) that her report has been cited anywhere. The "Union for the Abolition of Vivisection" on the other hand is mentioned often. I'm a bit reminded of the <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumber_Cartel_bb26.html" title="Lumber Cartel">Lumber Cartel</a>. It's a running joke amongst antispam activists - I certainly have heard of it - but outside that narrow circle the joke is unknown, and I'm not convinced that that particular meme needs its entry on Wikipedia. Same here. I'm just looking for her being mentioned giving testimony etc <i>and getting noticed for it</i>. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 22:41, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I mistyped: <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Scientist_4920.html" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a>. If you mean her recent report, it has only just been published, so people will need time to respond to it in full. When you say getting noticed for giving testimony, I'm not sure what you mean. I'm very confused by this, because there are so many (possibly hundreds of thousands) of articles about people and issues less notable, and less well referenced, than this one. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:57, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was thinking about expert testimony in courts, or anything else that might confer public recognition. Sine you mentioned less notable people and issues, no, I'd say that minor porn stats, morning radio presenters and local politicians shouldn't have entries here either. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 23:03, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As the article says, she was invited to be an expert witness at the House of Lords inquiry into animal testing in 2001. She sat on the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Procedures_Committee_bcfc.html" title="Animal Procedures Committee">Animal Procedures Committee</a> for eight years (the committee that oversees animal experimentation in the UK). She advises the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Commission_5611.html" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> on issues related to animal experimentation. She is one of a very small number of researchers in this field who are extremely highly regarded by all sides of the debate (scientists, animal-rights activists, governments, courts). <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:15, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The editorial part of <i>Nature</i> commands great respect amoungst scientists as a reliable source for news on science and science policy, especially European issues. I've said it already: what I doubt is the assertion that Gill is "highly regarded by all sides of the debate" as she is mentioned in <i>Nature</i> merely twice, and only as a spokesperson for an organization. Also note that unlike <i>Nature</i>, the <i>New Scientist</i> is a popular journal. Until we see the "Next of Kin" report mentioned in notable journals we must assume that the publication went unnoticed. Remember that Wikipedia isn't a vehicle to advance worthy causes, it is a record of notable causes. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 00:29, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you and the nominator have misunderstood this article and, with respect, Wikipedia. This is not an article about an eminent scientist <i>qua</i> research scientist who is writing in peer-reviewed journals and working for a university. This is an article about a zoologist and writer, who has become an expert in an unusual field (where peer-reviewed articles are rarely, if ever, written), and who has succeeded in gaining respect from all sides of the debate, which is exceedingly rare in this area. However, I think the article speaks for itself, so I won't say any more about it, except that I'm somewhat bewildered, and very disappointed in certain people on this page. I have never viewed myself as an inclusionist, but if this is what deletionism causes, then I may indeed have to cross the floor. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:22, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please read again what I said above. I mentioned the editorial part of <i>Nature</i>, the "News" section in particular. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue" class="external text" title="http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is what an issue looks like. Anything important in animal testing would be reported there; it's such an important issue that affects so many scientist. I made my case that Gill is non-notable (because she rarely appears in the newspapers and twice in the scientific news but not as an expert). Can you make your case that she is a highly regarded expert with verifiable evidence? There was a blog cited further up... is there really nothign better? If you can't, and someone disagrees with your view, please don't attack that person. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 03:28, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have to agree that this is totally bizarre. I came across this because I've been arguing (politely, of course) with the author elsewhere and looked up her contributions, and the individual is clearly notable. I'd suggest those who voted to delete before she had the chance to weigh in be asked to reconsider given her response and the article today. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">Sam</a> 21:45, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Editors will be interested in reading the talk page of the article that clearly breaches <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. My factual addition 'The Next of Kin report into what is a contentious subject has, however, not yet been peer reviewed nor subject to critical analysis' has been reverted. Let me be clear; yes I am a scientist but no I have no strong position on animal rights. Despite accusations against me, and adolescent jokes, I base my case on the facts not personalities. This article is pivotal. This is an article for a lobbying body that has a clear (though obviously legitimate) agenda. For such an article to have merit it most certainly requires peer review to establish its neutrality and scientific merit (on which I express no view). Dr Langley is obviously well established in committee circles but what is needed is evidence as to what she has actually done e.g. peer reviewed papers, academic positions attained (e.g. professor not research fellow), generating new knowledge etc. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 21:49, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I'm going to place myself firmly in the "this is bizarre" camp. Something truly odd is going on here.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per IronDuke. This is rather strange. She appears to be a notable activist, add to that the unusual factor that she's a former animal researcher, and she's easily notable enough for a WP article. If we delete this we'd probably have to delete 2/3 of the bios in WP. Wrote an important report for an important activist group which was cited in New Scientist, was interviewed by the BBC... there's <i>plenty</i> here to call her notable enough for a WP article. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 19:41, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per SlimVirgin and IronDuke. The article has been fleshed out from its stub state and there are many items in the article that would make her notable in the world of Animal Rights Activism. As a whole that category needs a little more attention (especially from a POV slant) and this article is a quality example of a NPOV bio in that category. It would be a shame to lose. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne27</a> 15:01, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
