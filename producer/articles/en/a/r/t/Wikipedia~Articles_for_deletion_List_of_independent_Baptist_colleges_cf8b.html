<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. The list <i>could</i> be replaced by a category for those listed articles of value, I think, which should satisfy those few wanting the article kept.

<li><b>Keep</b> with the caveat that we replace the external links with red links. Nine of the school have Wikipedia articles. The content of this list isn't covered by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bible_colleges_945c.html" title="List of Bible colleges">List of Bible colleges</a> because that list doesn't not the denomination a particular school is affiliated with. The same holds true with Category:Seminaries and theological colleges. I could be convinced to delete if a category was created, in the vein of Category:Roman Catholic universities and colleges in the United States.</li>

<dd>They are already listed by religious criteria twice over and in other ways too. Also it is "independent" Baptist, which is different than "Baptist."

<dd>Arbustoo - I don't know what your point is in the above comment. But, in fact, I registered in October 2005. It is "ERcheck", not ERCheck (which is not a registered user name). You registered in January 2006. How is that relevant to this AfD? —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 02:56, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I read the wrong article entry. As for your claim; a "Jesuit school" entails a easily defined group. Indepedent Baptists are not a particular sect, but simply have no affliation. The analogy you put forth does not hold water. As for "Independent Baptist is different that Baptist as Jesuit is different that Roman Catholic," you might want to re-read what an independent Baptist is. A Jesuit is a denomination. Catholic is a denomination. Baptist is a denomination. An indepedent Baptist is still a Baptist, just one that does not have ties to the main organization. That is why this list is AfD. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 04:00, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I understand from <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Baptist_6ff1.html" title="Independent Baptist">Independent Baptist</a> that independent baptists do not belong to a denomination but are 'self declared'.

The Jesuits are a religious order and easily definable.--<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorturology_8c86.html" title="User:Porturology">Porturology</a> 03:15, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. While the Independent Baptists claim not to belong to a denomination, they do in fact have characteristics in common and behave much like a denomination. This group of colleges is part of what holds them together. Having a separate list like this is useful information.

<dd>A few comments about accreditation. I don't think it is relevant one way or another that many of these schools are not accredited. They are religious schools. Many religious schools choose not to go through the accreditation process, because they wish to remain independent, not necessarily because they are diploma mills. This group of Baptists is VERY independent, so it is not surprising that these schools are not accredited. Even for them to join the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Baptist_Convention_a9e3.html" title="Southern Baptist Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> would be for them a form of compromise. <a href="../../../h/2/o/User%7EH2O_a495.html" title="User:H2O">H2O</a> 00:15, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. This looks a lot like an attempt at Gastroturfing - the first one I checked with a Wikilink (rather than an external link, whihc I'd say is questionable, since why would we list places not notable enough for articles?) was Providence Baptist College. I checked on its accreditation status, and can't find any evidence of accreditation (which may be defective searchign skills or not). I suspect that this mix of redlinks, weblinks and wikilinks is part of the Southern Baptist walled garden. I see no evidence that these colleges self-identify as a separate sect, as the title implies. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 11:42, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Jason Gastrich sent you to AfDs in the past and I think this might be the same situation (the reason is his sock puppet has been floating around-- see Independent Baptist College). You copy and pasted your post from Independent Baptist College AfD vote... as you can tell without punctuation, the exact wording is the same, and no capitalization. But anyway, explain how this list fits Wikipedia criteria. Why is it "important"? What makes it helpful (considering it links mostly to schools that do not have accreditation or wikipedia articles)? <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 20:15, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
