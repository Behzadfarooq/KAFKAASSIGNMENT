<li><b>Speedy Strong Keep</b>. I am doing my very best to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, but I find it extremely hard to believe that this article is without merit. The basis for the nomination provides no reason why this article fails to meet any of the criteria or policies of Wikipedia. Just because there are a lot of internet-related articles is no reason to choose one for deletion. To accept that is to say we should delete <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_River_e27c.html" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> because there are a lot of articles here about rivers.

<dd>Correction: Wikipedian <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a> was kind enough to double-check the counting, and noticed that <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a>'s vote was incorrectly attributed as a "delete". This mistake has been corrected, and the numbers above reflect the new changes to the vote count. Of the 8 valid votes cast, 62.5% is for delete. This is marginally below the threshold of around 66% required for deletion, so the article "Liz shaw" will be undeleted and reinstated. "Liz Shaw NZ" contains the same content as "Liz shaw" as stated by 203.173.189.162. A disambiguation page <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_Shaw_%28disambiguation%29_8589.html" title="Liz Shaw (disambiguation)">Liz Shaw (disambiguation)</a> will also be made as a result. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 02:22, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Annon Edit; This above point is irrelevant as William Hung has a Wiki entry, for one bad audition he did. And Liz's subsequent publicity led to an invitation to do a porn movie with Ron Jeremy. Liz's publicity, while not on the same scale as William Hung's is still prolific considered New Zealand's size. I support the renaming to "Elizabeth Joan Shaw".</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> The Liz Shaw Phenomenon is actually quite widespread here in NZ.

With all respect to <a href="../../../k/j/p/User%7EKJPurscell_1583.html" title="User:KJPurscell">KJPurscell</a>, she has used her rejection as a springboard to more infamy (the same kind you'd get if you posed with your rejection slips in an erotic fashion). --<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a> 06:16, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>No vote yet</b></s>. I'd like to hear from more experienced Kiwi Wikipedians on this issue. On the one hand she seems "notable enough" but on the other hand everything I can find online about her looks like it is sourced from the same group of Internet forums; so it feels like this might just be an attack article by some very tenacious haters. Also, the "links" section on this article is of tragically poor quality, although VfD is not cleanup. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 12:29, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>rename</b> I originally posted this article, and wanted it to go under "Liz_Shaw_NZ" to avoid ambiguation wiht the Dr Who Liz Shaw. Due to an error on my part it was posted to "Liz_shaw" instead, and when HappyCamper deleted it, I reposted it to Liz_Shaw_NZ because I thought that it should go to a vote, rather than speedy deletion. I would be happy for the article to be moved to Liz_Joan_Shaw, or left at Liz_Shaw_NZ with the Liz_shaw entry deleted. Also, I would like to mention that I am none of the people refered to in the article.

<li>I've lost track of the asterisks, so someone can reformat this if necessary. I've heard of her, despite having read no student mags, hardly any blogs, and very few newspapers in the last 12 months. Eurekster.com search engine has not heard of her (and has only one entry on the fictional one). She's not the best advertisement for New Zealand, but there's enough public knowledge of her to keep the article in WP, preferably with a properly styled page name such as "Liz Shaw, New Zealand". I think she is more encyclopaedic than US college football coach <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Hines_ec98.html" title="Paul Hines">Paul Hines</a>, for example (nothing personal, Paul and friends!). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_Patterson_109a.html" title="User:Robin Patterson">Robin Patterson</a> 05:59:17, 2005-08-30 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I support namming the topic as Liz Shaw NZ or Liz Shaw (New Zealand) as she is not known as Elizabeth Joan Shaw - as well as a dab page from <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_Shaw_1af5.html" title="Liz Shaw">Liz Shaw</a> to the correct pages for both the "Liz Shaws. I suppose that if the topic WAS to be renamed Elizabeth Joan Shaw that could be handled through a <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_Shaw_1af5.html" title="Liz Shaw">Liz Shaw</a> dab page also - would that mean that the current <a href="../../../l/i/z/Liz_Shaw_1af5.html" title="Liz Shaw">Liz Shaw</a> page is renamed to Liz Shaw (Dr Who) or similar?

<li>Unfortunately, it is not possible to "make an article noteworthy"; an article's topic has to already be noteworthy, and it's our job to make an article <i>comprehensive</i>, <i>high-quality</i>, and <i>unbiased</i>. If an article's topic isn't noteworthy, there's nothing we can do: we have to delete it. If it becomes noteworthy at any point in the future, we can always recreate it. You can also freely transfer all the information on this page to an off-Wikipedia website so it isn't lost. But if the article's not noteworthy, no amount of improving it will do any good; if the article <i>is</i> a noteworthy subject matter, meeting requirements like <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, then all you need to do is provide reputable citations/references to verify that the content is valid and significant enough. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 09:46, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>On behalf of the Luton Sixth College (of which I am currently a student) this page has been requested to be deleted from this site. It was created without the prior consent of any administrative member of staff, by a student who was put up to it as a simple joke. The college (as I understand it) can reserve their right to not be listed on this encyclopedia if they do not wish to be, certainly not in the mal-constructed, under-written form as the article appears now. It could be considered potentially harmful to the college reputation (refer to the history of the page, vandalism has been cleared for the time being as the deletion process is pursued) if this page remains. A formal addressal will be made to contact the Wikipedia H.Q. over the next few days to request removal, but I have still decided to address this through the 'normal' channels. I think it is very clear that this article does NOT have a place on this encyclopedia. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasei_44e5.html" title="User:Kasei">Kasei</a> 02:13, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are a number of arguments for the notability of schools and the arguments for keeping or deleting them - <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments</a>. If your school is not sufficiently notable, it can go. However, that you don't want to be listed is not a sufficient argument for deletion - see any of the AfD discussions at <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>. Contact legal if there are legal problems with inclusion, but I see none. It can be speedied if the creator wants it to go. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">Jammo (SM247)</a> 02:50, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The existence of the college is public domain - I don't think the college have any right to request the article's removal. They do of course have the right to edit it!

<li><b>Delete</b>, this is has nothing to do with the request to remove it (which we have no way of knowing is genuine). The school does not appear to be notable enough to justify an article -- and there is no precedent or consensus for "Keep" votes or some mystical "inherent notability" for schools (despite what is claimed by organised pro-School article voters). If the school is planning to make a formal request for removal (with reliable identification), then that's up to them... but on AFD we have to make a decision solely on the article, and mine is 'delete'. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 10:00, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article was previously tagged for db-nonsense, but the creator removed it. I considered restoring the tag, but I don't think it actually qualifies as nonsense under the guidelines. Also, as ridiculous as it may be, there is an assertion of notability, so I don't think it qualifies as A7 either. I suppose this all goes to the question of whether an obvious hoax should be speedily deleted.

<li><b>Keep pending verification of information</b> The notability requirement is not official Wikipedia policy. It is, rather, a suggested, unofficial policy that does not yet have consensus, and therefore not necessarilly by itself a reason for deletion. Moreover, it is unclear as to what the definition of notable would be for this site. It does seem to offer the same services as other sites that are listed in articles in Wikipedia, and unless there is some evidence that it is a bogus site it may very well have enough interest to qualify as "notable".</li>

<dd>That being said, parts of the article is not currently independently verifiable. Therefore it will require additional citation to meet the verifiability standard.

You can't have it both ways, if you want to relist now, withdraw the DRV and wait a decent time (a month is typical) before relisting at AfD. If you want a DRV with a result of delete, don't relist here. If you want a DRV with a result of relist at AfD, you have to let the DRV finish first. I'm surprised that <a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike">User:WCityMike</a>, who has been using process as a strong argument in the DRV to contest the outcome, would flub up this bit of process this way... --<b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 05:28, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as should have been done after the previous AFD. I made the mistake of saying, "merge anything useful ... otherwise delete" in the first AFD. Unfortunately, this was misunderstood to be an impossible (because of the GDFL) "merge and delete". I had thought that "otherwise" would imply mutual exclusivity, but I guess not. At any rate, so that there is no misunderstanding as to my opinion on the matter, <b>delete</b> per the previous AFD. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. This "article" is little more than a laundry list of topics covered in a clip show. I can't see how that is an encyclopedic topic. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:46, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Her claim to notability is that she's editor of the Guardian's literary supplement, as well as the author of a number of children's books published by a good sized house <a href="http://www.walkerbooks.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.walkerbooks.com/" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A <i>Sunday Times</i> article from 2001 refered to her as head of the Guardian's literary section in an article on the Samuel Johnson Award which she was a judge for as well as the Orange Prize for Fiction. The ACT Public Library system has six of her books on the shelves which suggests that have had a reasonable distribution. Her work seems to have been reviewed in publications such as the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> and the <i>New Statesman</i>. She seems notable enough for mine. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 07:36, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, "The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field.", and the Orange Prize is part of such a record in the field of literature. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 10:30, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I've expanded the article a bit to show her involvement in lit. prizes and festivals, and her kids' books translated into other languages. --<a href="../../../h/j/m/User%7EHJMG_daa3.html" title="User:HJMG">HJMG</a> 10:47, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I considered changing my vote based on the recent comments, but the only thing I see are further assertions and I only respond to evidence. It is incumbent on the editor (or in extension on those voting for keep) to <i>establish</i> notability rather than assert or assume it, or pass the burden on the nominator. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 22:07, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But the article <i>did</i> establish notability by stating that she was an editor of the Guardian, a writer of six books, and a judge for the Orange Prize. Each keep vote has agreed that these are reasonable examples of notability. Indeed, I've crossed out "search" above: it's true that one shouldn't have to search for notability before nominating, but the notability here was right there in the artcile. — <a href="../../../1/9/9/User%7E199.html" title="User:199">199</a> 15:07, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Closer's notes</b><br />
This debate was split evenly down the middle numerically. However the main argument for keeping the article was that it was supposedly a revenge nomination for another article that was deleted, whereas the main argument for deleting the article was that it did not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. When the acrimony has subsided, the result of this debate may be cited as trending towards delete.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Ben, as I'm sure you're aware the AfD process is not a vote but a <i>discussion</i>, and if you continually interject to provide facts helpful to a single side of the debate, you're a <i>de facto</i> partisan, no matter how piously you proclaim your neutrality. I reiterate my <b>Keep</b> recommendation. This article is little more than an advertisement for a not-very-popular website, but what of it? Once political partisans begin engineering AfDs for articles they find objectionable, it will never end. It has in fact already begun with the Burch-orchestrated removal of Conservative Underground; let's bring it to a swift and speedy end. Ben, I find your crusade against Wikipedia articles referencing politics you do not share to be in stark conflict with the liberal ideals you purport to espouse, but in compliance with <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> I will refrain from accusing you of baldfaced hypocrisy. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 19:22, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I do apologize. I said "I'm sure you're aware" that the AfD process was a discussion and not a <i>vote</i>, but apparently my assumption was hasty and you weren't in fact aware of this. I have done as you suggested and checked the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Conservative_Underground_75fd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Conservative Underground">process for the deletion</a> of Conservative Underground, which was initiated by <i>you</i> on January 11... for reasons, I might add, of a "low Alexa page rank", which happened to be three times higher than the rank of the page which is the subject of the article currently under consideration for deletion. Somehow, Your Neutralness has failed to point this out in your comments on this page, but I'm certain it was just an oversight.

<p><b>Comment</b>. Ben Burch brought this on himself for alleging that media attention and Alexa traffic reports were needed for a encylopedic article. His pure hypocrisy is the main reason why this article is being subjected to deletion. I can tell that he is trying to act like the 'nice guy' or 'neutral' on this article. Also, I think that it was he that started the deletion process for the CU article, unless I am mistaken, and his website has a <i>dismal</i> traffic report compared to CU.

<li>That's all irrelevent, Ben. One does not gauge notability by the size of one's, um, "equipment." The "mine's bigger than yours" bit won't help you.

<ul>
<li>Of course the amount of equipment is irrelevant! I am just clarifying. Alexa does a good job of sites like PW or CU because the users are more likely to install their spyware. When comparing two sites which are similar in their user base, like FR and CU or PW, Alexa is a fiar basis for comparison. WRS's user base, for example, has more Mac users and more Linux users than FR does. I know this as I have posted images to busy threads on FR and watched the logs to see what fetched them. But in any case, go look at the log files and you will observe that 17,000 unique users per week use White Rose. Why don't you ask your people how many use CU in the same interval? And of course none of this makes WRS or CU notable at all. I think neither are notable. Like LU isn't notable, and PW isn't notable and NU isn't notable and DW isn't notable. I would move to delete entries on any of those. And that is why I have not opposed the removal of WRS. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 17:00, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Burch is a habitual prevaricator and a blatant hypocrite.</p>
<p>Bottom of the barrel Alexa ranking-using Burch's own hypocritical standards, not mine-no noteworthy mentions of his site outside of the DU hive-and perhaps AAR/leftbot talk show hosts that are consistently rated at the bottom in most objective Arbitron measurements-and an unwillingness to broach anything but the most anemic argument in its defense.</p>
<p>This is an open and shut case for deletion, IMHO.</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I think White Rose is significant because it is an historical archive. There are full-length audio files documenting American political discourse from the left over the last five years in great detail, with some files going back into 2000. I am using it now in my doctoral dissertation on opposition politics in the USA. Assuming this site persists, it is worthy of an encyclopedia entry for just that reason; To guide researchers such as myself to this resource. And if you can judge such a political web site based on the amount of absolute hatred it creates in its opponents, it is not only significant, but actually successful.

<li><b>Keep</b> Examining the site statistics provided above I see that this site serves almost twenty thousand unique IPs every week. And I can only assume that most of those are repeats given the nature of an archive site. This makes it notable. 82.142.150.82 00:36, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the description of the website, verbatim:</p>
<p>Mmp3 audio archive of talk shows criticizing George W. Bush.</p>
<p>There are hundreds-if not thousands-of websites that host either audio files, or video files, or columns criticizing President Bush. I don't think anyone can seriously assert that Wikipedia should maintain entries on each and every website that has content that criticizes President Bush.</p>
<p>The only noteworthy talk show host listed on the main page of his site is Randi Rhodes, who is heard on a scant 33 terrestrial radio stations, and, according to a 2005 Talkers magazine survey, was not even listed among the top 25 syndicated talk show hosts in the country.</p>

Also, I don't care about arguments for delete (as this is a clear case of potential acceptability <i>if it's actually notable</i>). What I want to know is: What makes this website notable in an encyclopedic sense? By the way, I don't care about Google or Alexa results--I've long since disregarded that data for consideration of notability. I want to see a list of serious points that suggest notability.

<dd>Steve, No contracts involved. I archive shows by permission, and the show hosts mention the archives because they want to. Some do it every show every day. Others, such as Randi Rhodes do it so infrequently that I get emails from my fans telling me that she did it. But I am still myself unsure of the encyclopedic notability of this page. White Rose I have no doubt is notable; I have 15,000 hours of Liberal/Progressive talk radio archived on the site, going back to 2001 for some of the shows, and serve around 17,000 unique people weekly. If I didn't think it was notable and important I wouldn't be doing it. But I am not at all sure if an encyclopedia needs to take note of it. It's not Planck's Constant. It's not Charles Darwin. And you don't have to say that you are going to be fair about this.

<dd>Well, "notability" obviously must subtract how we feel about our own work--it deals solely with how the "world" or the community that surrounds the entity thinks about and treats said entity. <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crooks_and_Liars_b2dc.html" title="Crooks and Liars">Crooks and Liars</a> has been around since 2004, it archives audio/video of interest to the left, and it's notable because in the left-wing blogosphere, one trips over all the references to it. However, I don't notice this same kind of tripping over WRS mentions. I think that necessarily, for a website to have notability, it must be deemed important by its most natural constituency, and for WRS, that is the same (or very similar) constituency as that for Crooks and Liars. Also, just because an entity acts as a great voluminous resource doesn't automatically make it notable--notability is whether a lot of people, especially influential (well, notable) people commonly refer to this resource as some kind of "must-see". I guess I'm just going to have to see more evidence of notability... like mentions in mainstream sources--I read above that Randi Rhodes has mentioned it sometimes... if something like this is documented (as in transcript documentation) as a regular occurrence from Rhodes or other notable personalities, I would be inclined to vote at least "weak keep". Links to several transcripts like this would do the trick for me. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><span style="color:white; background-color: green;">&#160;<b>Stevie is the man!</b>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 03:02, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, as there are not textual transcripts prepared for any of these shows, that is a tough call. Listen to the last ten minutes of Mike Malloy's show, or Bob Kincaid's show and you'll hear me and the site mentioned by name. Unlike Crooks &amp; Liars, I don't archive "events". They have clips of exceptional things that happen in the video realm. I have a daily archive of nine different shows, also archives of several weekly shows, and never take anything offline. Want to hear what Randi Rhodes said the day that Bush landed on the carrier? It's there. And people do refer to the site when they need to refer to a particular show in their blogging. Drudge mentioned me once over a skit that Randi Rhodes' people played that seemed to imply somebody shooting the President, and I had about 38,000 visits that one day! Here is an lgf mention of the same event; <a href="http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=15635" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=15635" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> But honestly I am not going to defend White Rose's page here because I don't really know why White Rose, or DU, or FR, or CU, or PW belong in an encyclopedia.

<dd>Well, honestly, I don't want to be in the position of defending this entry. Go look at the server stats linked above if you want some idea of how important it is to the people who use it. 17000 unique users in the average week, and that does not include streaming users or users of our usenet postings of every show we archive, or people who go directly to the mp3 directories and skip the html pages. Is it indispensable? Many think so, but I have no particular desire to document that, though I am happy to answer your earnest inquiries as best I can. The best indication of that is that people donate money to me for what they can download from me for free, This is the third fundraiser I've run at the $10,000 level since last September, and we succeeded with the first two, and are well on the way to succeeding with this one. But, honestly, I don't care if White Rose has a Wikipedia entry or not. My log files show me about 200 hits from that page, most of them during this AfD and the last one. Ppeople don't come to White Rose though looking for White Rose! They come to it by looking for Randi Rhodes or Mike Malloy, or Thom Hartmann. This entry is likely an appropriate jumping off point for the links on their individual Wiki pages, sort of a disabigualtion, but one that could easily be dispensed by having a direct link in all of those individual places. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 04:38, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I misunderstood what I was looking at re: updates. But what Ben Burch did with external links is perfectly fine. His site is notable enough for an external link in said articles, as his site naturally extends knowledge about those subjects. Perfectly legit.

<p>I think this determination should be based upon this website's notability within the far-left Web community.</p>
<p>Even using that criterion it fails miserably.</p>
<p>Compare the amount of sites that link to the WRS-a little over a hundred-to the number that link to more popular leftist, vehemently anti-Bush websites, e.g. Bartcop, which has over 800 sites that link to it, or Common Dreams, which has over eight thousand sites that link to it.</p>

<p>I'm simply trying to elicit a credible response from Burch.</p>
<p>He still hasn't justified the inclusion of his extremely obscure organization in Wikipedia on any grounds, other than self-interest.</p>

<p>I'm not a Wikipedia regular.</p>
<p>Hence, any formatting irregularities.</p>
<p>Although, I don't see how my lack of familiarity with afd discussions-or even Wikipedia in general-bears directly upon the noteworthiness of this entry, or the substance of my argument.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that if it is not his job to defend this entry then he should cease to defend it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it simply lends credence to my assertion that this is an advert.</p>
<p>Also, I'd like to point out that Burch's claim that a Conservative Underground user created this entry is a blatant, and quite self-serving, falsehood.</p>
<p>If his purported enemies did create an entry on his organization-a dubious claim on its face-they certainly would not have written one that has a favorable, or even neutral, tone.</p>
<p>My two cents.</p>

<dd>How long would it take to learn Wikipedia formatting? About two minutes. Please realize this discussion is not just about our positions, but also that they are formatted in a manner that most people can follow. If you cannot present your positions clearly, you cannot expect others to be able to understand the discussion as a whole. Your response here indicates a lack of deference to the Wikipedia and our usual ways of discussing matters. That doesn't help your position. It hurts it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Further, just because it is not his job to defend the subject of this article doesn't mean he can't. However, I do believe it is a conflict of interest for someone who originally wrote or heavily contributed to the article under Afd to vote on its deletion. And that also goes for someone who owns the entity that is described by the article. I believe administrators discount or ignore such votes. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><span style="color:white; background-color: green;">&#160;<b>Stevie is the man!</b>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 17:32, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Furthermore, Burch has not come forward with any evidence to demonstrate that "many" believe his website to be an "indispensable" resource, nor has his claim that LGF, i.e. Charles Johnson, not a user on that website, mentioned him or his website been born out.</p>
<p>72.68.172.20 18:43, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let it be noted that a majority voted in favor of deletion the last go-round.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_White_Rose_Society_%28website%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_White_Rose_Society_%28website%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_White_Rose_Society_%28website%29</a></p>
<p>Much the same as in Burch's transparently partisan attempt to delete Conservative Underground.</p>
<p>The only difference being that in the former the decision of the majority was ignored, and this entry retained for some inexplicable reason.</p>

<dd>I believe that more than just a majority is required for an article to be deleted. Here's another area where learning about how the Wikipedia works could prove useful for you, Anonymous One. It requires a super-majority of what I would call "non-conflicted" votes, that is, votes that aren't sockpuppets, and votes that have no conflict of interest. Also, I think admins look at whether something has been renominated too soon after its previous nomination--if it is too soon, the result here may be possibly voided. This is all my understanding, of course, as I am not an administrator (at this time, heh). — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><span style="color:white; background-color: green;">&#160;<b>Stevie is the man!</b>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 17:32, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This page seems to be absolutely harmless to Wikipedia. It brings into the Wiki new information in the form of the actual existance of a number of Liberal/Progressive talk radio shows.

I simply cannot imagine that this process we see here serves any interest whatsoever.

<p>Well, liberals were never known for their wit, although I admire your attempts at sarcasm.</p>
<p>Seriously, do you think Mike Malloy is more notable than Al Franken?</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge no AAR host has distinguished him or herself in the ratings book, but the hosts you highlight are particularly obscure, at least in terms of generating large audiences of devoted listeners.</p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Michael Savage, Laura Ingraham, among others, all have large numbers of listeners who disagree with their political point of view, which is a testament to their popularity, if nothing else.</p>
<p>Can you assert with any credibility that there is a single radio host you link to who reaches an audience beyond their own narrow political constituency?</p>

<p>Among all listeners 12+, it was a race to the bottom for AIR AMERICA and WLIB as mid-days went from a 1.6 share during winter 2005 to a 1.0 share winter 2006.</p>
<p>During PM drive, host Randi Rhodes plunged to 27,900 listeners every quarter hour, finishing 25th place in her time slot, down from 60,900 listeners every quarter hour in the fall.</p>

<p>One of the more popular hosts on your page.</p>
<p>In the recent ratings period, Air America in Austin didn't record any significant listeners under 25.</p>
<p>It might be a ratings anomaly, or maybe young liberals are simply listening to music, satellite radio, and podcasts.</p>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> - There wouldn't be anything like this much effort expended to CENSOR White Rose if you were not notable, Ben. We here love your archives and my iPod is filled with your podcasts each and every morning. We especially like the commercial-free edits you make to Thom Hartmann's show, and we also really enjoy Lizz Brown's show. BTW, When are you going to have an archive page for Bruce Burch's new show on the Head On Radio Network? I work when he is on the air and have not been able to listen yet! 82.119.205.115 00:02, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Specious logic.</p>
<p>The only reason any effort was exerted to delete this entry is because Burch is notorious for squelching any speech that he disagrees with, which led him to nominate CU and PW for deletion.</p>
<p>The controversy has nothing to do with the WRS itself, which is too obscure to merit comment, but rather the jihadist tactics of someone who is neither liberal, nor a supporter of free speech, despite claims to the contrary.</p>
<p>My own opinion is that if this entry is retained it should be merged with the wholly unnecessary Ben Burch Wiki, which even its subject has admitted is not noteworthy enough to keep as a stand-alone article.</p>
<p>71.125.240.18 00:15, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are obviously a die-hard fan of his-and the shows he's archived-which leads me to believe that your "strong keep" recommendation has very little to do with the merit-or lack thereof-of this article, in my humble estimation.</p>
<p>If this article is to be retained it should not be retained on the basis of adulatory fans, who offer no impartial reasons for retention, unless you consider one's fanship reason enough for a permanent "keep."</p>
<p>71.125.240.18 00:18, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> This site is mention on the air daily on Mike Malloy's show, and he considers it to be his official archive site. Peter Werbe, Guy James, and Bob Kincaid never, ever do a show without mentioning White Rose and Ben Burch by name. 61.70.131.246 01:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are no-name hosts.</p>
<p>The most famous being Mike Malloy, who was replaced by the Satellite Sisters on AAR's signature network, the retooled-and much worse, IMO-WLIB.</p>
<p><a href="http://gammablog.com/?cat=52" class="external free" title="http://gammablog.com/?cat=52" rel="nofollow">http://gammablog.com/?cat=52</a></p>
<p>I'm not saying that Malloy's Wiki should be removed, only that the fact that he refers to Burch-no matter how frequently-does not qualify Burch for a Wikipedia entry.</p>
<p>If Burch were a regular on a show hosted by an even moderately well-known celebrity, e.g. Al Franken, I would render a different opinion.</p>
<p>71.125.240.18 01:30, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Again, the very least that should be done, if this entry is to be retained, is to merge the transparent vanity page, re: Ben Burch, with the larger stub on the White Rose Society.</p>
<p>I don't think even Burch himself would object to that course of action.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>No evidence of notability in the article. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 23:46, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Notable on its face. Major website, amazing collection of historical documents, serving tens of thousands of people. I can't imagine why anybody would find this non-notable. 216.55.177.58 03:00, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even Ben Burch has not claimed that his website serves "tens of thousands" of people.</p>
<p>Perhaps it has "tens of thousands" of page-views, or has tens of thousands of visitors, however I find it extremely hard to believe that tens of thousands of people are utilizing this resource on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>Outside of Democratic Underground I have not seen it referred to-even in the most oblique way-by an even moderately popular website, let alone, touted by an extremely popular or well-known radio talk show host.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> In lieu of removing comments that are viewed as tangential, or wholly irrelevant to this discussion, do you think a better idea might be to create a "talk" page for this entry?<br />

<li>Comments to the motivations of the users or nonsense about how this or that commentator is doing poorly has nothing to do with this article, and wouldn't belong even on a talk page. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:13, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I respectfully disagree.</p>
<p>If his case rests upon his association with these hosts-and from what I've observed, it does-don't you think that their popularity-or in this case, unpopularity-among the general public is pertinent to this discussion?</p>

<p>Sorry for the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>I was referring to his claim-which I take at face-value-that his website is mentioned "nine times."</p>
<p>Either weekly, or daily.</p>
<p>I forget which.</p>
<p>He hasn't mentioned-to the best of my knowledge-that he's a correspondent for the Mike Malloy Show-which is alluded to in his Wiki-but I presume that he would cite that as another reason to retain this entry.</p>
<p>As I said before, if no consensus can be reached the simplest course of action would-in my opinion-be to simply merge the two Wikis.</p>
<p>Even Ben Burch has not objected to that, based upon his comments with respect to his own Wikipedia entry.</p>
<p>Granted, the notability of this website is a contested issue, but I don't think anyone is seriously suggesting that Ben Burch-as an individual-merits an entire encyclopedic entry, even if it is merely a stub.</p>

<dd>Well, it shows that 274,691 distinct IP addresses accessed the site over the 224 days since the log file was started. And that is not fully inclusive as it misses the servers where most of the binaries are, and the icecast streams. Are distinct IP addresses equivalent to distinct users? Most web sites take them as such. So, somehow, a quarter of a million distinct people found and used the site in that interval. The vast majority of them went after the three Air America hosts; Thom Hartmann, Mike Malloy, and Randi Rhodes. Said content is provided by permission from a well-known and notable entity. Indeed, in the case of Thom Hartmann, I am a contractual publisher of his material and pay a sizable royalty fee for it. But this is not actually Web-Specific content. It is RADIO content, translated into a form that can be hosted on the web. This makes White Rose much more like <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live365.html" title="Live365">Live365</a> than like <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drudge_Report_b304.html" title="Drudge Report">Drudge Report</a>. Live365 produces no content, but it is notable because it serves so much of the streaming content of others. Likewise, I produce very little content, but WRS is notable because it archives, podcasts, and streams so much of the content of notable entities, and does it for so many people. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 06:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That site mentions White Rose in passing as a "liberal talk show site" (and does not elaborate further, making it a trivial reference) and the Goodwriters link seems to just be a link page.

(Meaning, not "Download our older shows here" or somebody's link page or whatnot.) Without that, WRS is less like a service like Live365 and more like non-notable site that hosts notable primary works, no more noteworthy than a site that hosts pictures of notable paintings or scripts of notable movies. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:29, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>alleged pop culture term, should be transwikied to Wiktionary if kept.

<li><b>Comment</b> It definitely is a curious trend, but it's A) not a curse, B) has nothing to do with Steve Balboni, and C) most importantly, the term is not documented.

<li><b>Comment</b> A couple things to say but I'll keep it to two. I'd dispute the original research claim and at what does original research become accepted fact. This was an easily verfiable trend. Second, the name is fitting of something so light-hearted. Let's not try to find too much meaning in sport.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, obviously, but I also deleted it from the X-Play article.

None of which is conclusive of course. However, googling for "Global Environmental Technology &amp; Management" gets one hit on a technorati blog. Googling for "Global Environmental Technology and Management" none at all. Finally, googling for "getm" brings plenty of hits, but only one appears to be related to the subject of this article... and it is their own website. So... I can't think of reason for keeping this article as the organsiation does not appear to be notable enough to justify an article on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm tempted to suggest delete based on the alexa rank of 38,038 for what is described as the most popular but the arguments put foreward in the last AFD that it's notable within astronomy circles seem to make it more than most of the websites that come this way.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I agree that the current article needs cleanup, but Universe Today (.com, I have no experience with the others) is one of the more popular and important astronomy-for-laymen sites, and as one of the two fathers to the important BAUT forum (the other being Bad Astronomy), it is notable. It has made e.g. <a href="http://www.skepticnews.com/2005/02/universe_today_.html" class="external text" title="http://www.skepticnews.com/2005/02/universe_today_.html" rel="nofollow">Skeptic News</a>, and perhaps even more telling, it is one of the five newssites linked to from <a href="http://www.astronomy.net/news/" class="external text" title="http://www.astronomy.net/news/" rel="nofollow">Astronomy.net</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:00, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Universe Today (as in .com) is a popular astronomy site with a widely read newsletter. (Full disclosure: I subscribe to it but I have <i><b>no</b></i> relation to the owner nor any other kind of stake in the enterprise, I merely read it as an astronomy enthusiast). It is by far the most high ranking of the UT websites and the only one to actually go by the name Universe Today. The universe today.org site (return to the moon) does not have the UT name on its site, merely the domain name.org and has if I recall a whooping 5 google hits. Universe Today.net, Wayne Smith's site is actually a forum that goes by the name Universe <i>Daily</i>. Apparently, Smith has been linkspamming on here for a while and has several sockpuppets. (He accused me falsely of being Fraser Cain! and vandalised my user page!) This site has less than 50 google hits. Fraser Cain's UT.com has several hundreds of google hits and is mentioned on other websites that deal with astronomy. This article specifically refers to the .com website and not the others who do not even go by the name UT.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 19:03, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. My name has several hundred google hits, but that it itself doesn't make me notable. The site appears to have a very low Alexa rank, but i do accept that does not mean it is not an important portal for a niche field. In deference to those that know more about astronomy than I, i've changed my suggestion to <b>neutral</b>. I relisted it mainly because it was very close to deletion last time and the closing editor mentioned he/she would welcome a relist if the article hadn't developed. As it happened the article was a lot worse. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 20:12, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> This is listcruft. All the external links don't exactly help it looking like advertising. If kept they should definatly be changed to internal ones.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Is it listcruft? A little. But now that it's been thoroughly cleaned up and the links are now intrawiki links, it isn't advertisement-y. It's also a list that is not an indiscriminate list of info, and it's definitely not a list that could be infinite. It also, unlike most lists, actually provides a smidgen of useful information. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 17:16, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In my opinion, no. Let's say, for some reason, somebody was searching WP for cognitive science degrees. They wouldn't go to a college's page, scroll to the bottom, and happen to see that a college grants said degree. More likely, somebody would read the <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_science.html" title="Cognitive science">cognitive science</a> page and notice the "see also" link. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 20:56, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs cleanup, but a distinction should be drawn between what it refers to, and "freeware" and "shareware" as described by the nominator. As far as I can see, it is <i>not</i> about freeware or shareware - it's about online games that would normally be pay-to-play but are instead free-to-play for whatever reason. If this distinction can be more clearly stated in the article (because, after all, all non-online games are "free to play", so it needs to be mentioned that they're not its subject), and if there isn't already an article that describes these games, I think it can be kept. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 10:03, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Seb Patrick. As a broad concept, this seems worth keeping. — <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a>::<a href="../../../t/k/d/User_talk%7ETKD_73cb.html" title="User talk:TKD">Talk</a> 10:15, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> refers to a distinctly different concept to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeware.html" title="Freeware">freeware</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shareware.html" title="Shareware">shareware</a>. It needs to be explained somewhere <a href="../../../y/d/a/User%7EYdam_9ecb.html" title="User:Ydam">Ydam</a> 10:27, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<p>Currently the article refers to games that can be played with no limitations and for no cost. That is <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeware.html" title="Freeware">freeware</a>. It also mentions games that can be played for free, but the player will need to pay a fee in order to receive additional features and/or updates. That is <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shareware.html" title="Shareware">shareware</a>. The last paragraph also makes a reference to what could be interpreted as <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crippleware.html" title="Crippleware">crippleware</a>.</p>
<p>If the meaning was simply that the game is free to play, I cannot see how the reader would not understand that simply from reading "This game is free to play". Before you go on and tell me that this is not what the article is <i>supposed</i> to contain, that is what it currently <i>does</i> contain (in my opinion).</p>
<p>Previous comments say that (This is my understanding, correct me if I am wrong) it may refer to the subscription fee of a game, not the initial purchase fee. If this article can be rewritten to include more than just a couple paragraphs about that, then it could certainly be kept. A good comparison could be <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guild_Wars_01f9.html" title="Guild Wars">Guild Wars</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, for example (since they are both pretty similar in function, but different in payment methods).</p>

<li>Yo suckas, ER (Operating room deal) gets a show, but Just Ben doesn't? If wikipedia is a site consisting of human knowledge, I believe that even things most deem to be minor deserve a spot in history. This show was a brainchild of mine, and my best friend's four years ago. Now, it's sucessful.

<li>What do you mean you'll "change your vote", Motor? That sign up there says this is NOT a vote. I've seen far more esoteric things kept on this site, and it was stuff no one even cares about. Just Ben is important. Maybe if you keep the wiki up you'll witness just how important it is. I presume this entry alone will generate double the amount of hits, and by logic double the amount of donations. Taking down Just Ben will be like shooting yourself in the face with a PPK; you won't die, but damn will it ever hurt.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 198.53.72.231 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_198.53.72.231_6c4b.html" title="Special:Contributions/198.53.72.231">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> As far as trivia goes, or as indiscriminate information... I suppose I could call a lot of pop-culture stuff the same, except when it's popular or widely accepted/known about? This is a legitmate piece of information that supplements the iTap article - as far as referencing urbandictionary.com, the first part has nothing to do with the online collection of slang terms, I just felt the second half could follow the first - remove that part, fine. But couldn't I call <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeroy_Jenkins_c207.html" title="Leeroy Jenkins">Leeroy Jenkins</a> popular trivia and a waste of Wikipedia's valuable space? Not that I don't understand the impact on society this character has made, or where he's been found, but if he were gone from Wikipedia tommorow...I really don't understand how it would make a difference, either. Maybe I should nominate the article for deletion. [/sarcasm]</li>

<dd>I'm not trying to be militant, but understand where I come from. Sudden curiousity strikes and I'm reading the T9 article - I link over to iTap, and I see my entry in "See also" - except it's not there... A little research later, and I feel like it's important enough to include; I guess if I can create an entire world in my head and sell it to people either in the form of religion (s'up <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>?) or fictional novels (s'up <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>), and get more than a hundred people store it in their memory banks (not to mention take up ALL THAT WIKIPEDIA SPACE - have you seen some of the fictional tangents these LOTR worlds have taken?

<dd>I just added like 4kb? of relevant, true fact (at least the first half), and all the people I've shown it to have appreciated it. *shrug* Am I really taxing the servers with this info? I mean, it's SUCH A HUGE ENTRY, and it just doesn't stop getting traffic hits (I better stop typing in all-caps, that adds to the size of a wiki article too, doesn't it?)... If so, point me to that paypal thing again and I'll throw $5 towards the server fees. Sorry I'm new to the scene and can't do all the fancy-pants link redirecting or image-inclusion, or understand the "status-quo" of Wikipedia, but more and more this project feels like another elite forum... you guys spend so much time on here, make your self fancy little icons, a nice user page, this and that about counter-vandalism, multiple languages, and cowbells...and suddenly you guys are the newest cyber-frat.

<dd>Thanks for the reply! I'll try and explain why it's up for deletion: it doesn't have any sources with reliability. That is, anyone can add entries to Urban Dictionary, and that's the closest this article has to a source that someone else can go back and check up on. That means there's no way that we can test if this is a hoax or not without getting a phone with iTap ourselves, and no source for any of the speculation that comes after it about why it's there. That's just not acceptable for an encyclopedia. This is not to say that it doesn't have a place, but it's a big Internet, and it is already on Urban Dictionary (which deals with these kind of things). As for comparing it to other articles, I agree, I don't think the enormous effort that goes into some pop culture stuff is useful at all, but it's sourced and easily verifiable from written sources, which is important under Wikipedia policy (the three big ones at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>).

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't really understand this one either. The article doesn't appear to be original research or a hoax.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The Witnesses are certainly a notable group, as is the UN. The article makes a convincing case that this isn't just some passing animosity on the part of a few Witnesses but an important part of their teaching the past 4 decades.

<p>I will try to make this clear. The only source for this "controversial issue" listed in the article is the Guardian newspaper. Everything else is research. there are no references to who is claiming this is a controversy except the guardian, which has a history of villifying JW's. There are websites which exaggerate this issue (see my link 1 above) but they mostly mirror each other and all source the Guardian.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_m_d217.html" title="User:George m">George</a> 21:50, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Excuse me, but are you implying that the animosity between Jehovah's Witnesses and the United Nations does not exist? Because seriously, it takes about fifteen seconds on Google to find resources that make it blatantly clear that it <i>does</i> exist. When I do a Google search for <i>"Jehovah's Witnesses" "United Nations"</i>, I get over 96 000 hits, and the ones that I come across first are all about this issue on one level or another. The 1963 Watchtover Resolution against joining the United Nations is all over the web. Pointing out that the animosity exists is <i>not</i> original research. That said, if you have issues with the article itself, if you feel that it suffers from POV problems or some other problems, feel free to improve it. But to say that this issue is not noteworthy is just plaing wrong. If what the web sez is correct (and I see no reason to assume that it's not), the resolution was adopted at all 24 assemblies, by a grand total of 454,977 conventioners. That's almost half a million people from a single religion taking an official stand that the UN sucks. How is that not noteworthy?</dd>
<dd>Also, the recent edits on this article kind of worry me. To be honest, I have some trouble following the changes, because as far as clearly written articles go, this one isn't... but I'm a little concerned that pretty passionate people are involved with the article, which is often a signal for POV problems to begin.</dd>

<p>By all means clean up the article. My problem is with the fact that the article is about some supposed "controversy" over JW's registering for library access at the UN, not the way they view the UN. IF it <i>was</i> about how JW's view the UN then I would have no problem with it. Also, animosity is not the right word. If JW's held animosity toward the UN they would not state that it goals were <b>admirable</b> though futile. I don't want to get into doctrine on this page. I did succeed in getting some much needed attention on this article so that whatever may happen to it is a consensus action and not that of one or two JW editors (myself included). So feel free to get involved.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_m_d217.html" title="User:George m">George</a> 03:51, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, okay. Fair enough. Well, if you feel the article is wrong, by all means fix it.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - if it is going to be a redirect, it really should be a redirect to <a href="../../../t/c/c/TCC_fe75.html" title="TCC">TCC</a>, which is a disambiguation page for all articles/companies with those initials. I seriously doubt that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Casual_Courier_6969.html" title="The Casual Courier">The Casual Courier</a> is the most common TCC. Does anyone actually refer to them as "TCC" (with quotes)? Normally, there isn't much use for quoted page names. Would someone looking for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Casual_Courier_6969.html" title="The Casual Courier">The Casual Courier</a> (or any other TCC) be likely to put "TCC" (with quotes) into the search box? I don't see much reason for the redirect, but if there is a redirect, it should be to the main <a href="../../../t/c/c/TCC_fe75.html" title="TCC">TCC</a> page, not to this company. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 15:09, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Move to close</b> - as it has been changed to a redirect by the only contributor, should we discuss this on <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion</a>? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 17:20, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

But I disagree on two fronts: One, as the acronym (in quotes) redirects to this one article, as opposed to the disambig page, we shouldn't close the debate. Two, when the article was listed for deletion, it was an actual article as opposed to a redirect, so a move to RfD is unnecessary. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 17:24, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With respect to the second point, normally, I would agree, but since the only contributor to the article is the one who changed it, it's really just cutting a step out of the process. As the only contributor, he could have it speedied as db-author, then create a new "TCC" as a redirect. So moving to RFD is just cutting a step out of the process. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 17:30, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. It certainly isn't in Wiki-worthy style but some of the facts being presented seem true (60% of college degrees going to women).

<li>"Extensible Out-of-band Language" gets four Google hits, two of which are Wikipedia and answers.com, a Wikipedia mirror. Google is a bad indicator of significance for some topics, but when it comes to programming language, it's awesome. Four hits? That's, uh, not exactly notable. The article is also entirely unsourced and possibly even unverifiable, considering the lack of Google hits. Original research? Well, being written in first person would kind of hint at that.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I am a member on Clanwars and was hoping you could elaborate on your reasons for deleting this article? I have read many articles discussing strategies of games or games in general; I suppose I'm wondering what is wrong with a link to a gaming league as there are other articles on wiki for online gaming clans and leagues. Please reconsider your request. RyanKatora

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Clanwars is no different than CAL or Teamwarfare (whom both have Wikipedia entries). Clanwars has become just as popular as either league. Electronic Arts, a billion dollar company, recently included Clanwars integration in its recent release "Battle for Middle Earth II". Results are currently automatically sent to the Clanwars league system after an online match is played in BFME2. I would imagine integration into a game by one of the leaders of the video game industry is significant as will any future interaction between these two entities will also be significant. Recently Clanwars has been receiving numerous sponsorships by companies such as Nvidia, Zboard, BigHugeGames (a partner of Microsoft), and others. The league has continued to grow since its inception and will only continue to get larger. Clanwars is more than a “cookie cutter” style league such as Teamwarfare and has garnered much more attention from video game companies than any other online league. --Klaskey 15:21, 16 June 2006 (UTC) <small>This comment was in fact added by 136.142.210.221 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_136.142.210.221_49d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/136.142.210.221">contribs</a>). <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConscious_cf76.html" title="User:Conscious">Conscious</a> 15:38, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> I still debate the "no notability" charge. Surely if the head honchos at Electronic Arts along with Gamespy were able to notice and integrate the clanwars ladder system into their game, than wikipedia would have a place for the ladder system that is quickly finding its way onto the map for many of game design companies. Certainly these sponsorships and relationships with giants of the video game industry match if not outweigh the accomplishments of other ladder sites such as teamwarfare and CAL, both of which have wikipedia entires (as I've mentioned before). So far, I havent read one good rebuttal to those facts from any of the posters here. If you don't feel its notable, please do explain how teamwarfare or CAL is notable. I understand some of you may not have heard about Clanwars, but then again, perhaps this kind of stuff isnt your niche. Of course, as long as wikipedia covers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_necrophilia_in_the_mallard_duck" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_necrophilia_in_the_mallard_duck" rel="nofollow">Homosexual necrophilia in the mallard duck</a>, I guess there will be something of interest for everyone. --Klaskey 13:31, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry, I must not quite understand the phrase "please note that this is not a vote. This is a discussion". As far as contributions go, I'll make sure that I'll run to wikipedia so that I can be the first to note the actors who participate in the next new beer commercial, or maybe I'll be sure to find another instance of homosexual necrophilia in a new breed of butterfly. Again, I only want to point out that nobody here is really arguing the points that I'm making, which means this really isn’t much of a discussion at all, just a bunch of people pointing fingers. I changed my "vote", hope that makes everyone happy.--Klaskey 17:29, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Fairly unremarkable article. Really, it's just throwing out words for the reader like 'aspiring writers' and it is like saying "Sports Forums" or "Dating Forums". There are not articles for these. This is an article basically saying that there are forums for people wishing to be writers. It is not worthy enough to be a freestanding article, and I have the feeling that the external links at the bottom are self-promotion. Now, i May be wrong, but that is my gut feeling. <a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">Paaerduag</a> 13:44, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't really see any point for this. I think the concept of people who share an interest and band together on the net to discuss it is kinda notable in itself, but I really see no point in having an individual article for every interest group. The merge already being suggested in the article itself seems fine, I suppose, except I'm not at all sure that there's anything to merge. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 15:02, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. You both make good points about the problems of having an unending series of articles on niche forums, but I still think this article did a good job (for a stub) of outlining a topic and suggesting lines of future development. I can see this easily growing into a full article with sections devoted to different aspects of writing, publishing, reviewing, etc. I think there is notable material out there and would like to give this article more time to bring it into Wikipedia. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 15:57, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hmm. I'm not quite sure if I understand what you mean. We already have articles about various forms of <a href="../../../w/r/i/Writer.html" title="Writer">writing</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publishing.html" title="Publishing">publishing</a> and whatnot. Do you really think that having articles on <i>talking</i> about the the aforementioned topics would be worthwhile? I dunno, maybe you're right, but even so, wouldn't that be something to tackle under <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_forum.html" title="Internet forum">Internet forum</a> rather than a separate article (or series of articles about, say, sports forums, science fiction forums, film forums, comic book forums, dating forums and so forth)? I write for a living myself, so I certainly agree that there's a lot of solid information about the topic out there... I'm just not sure that it's at all significant information. Actually, now that I think of it, perhaps the creation of a new article about writers' workshops or something along those lines would be helpful, because that's a very real (and, in my opinion, a far more notable) phenomenon. That could also very well encompass writing forums, which are, after all, a kind of a subset of writers' workshops... I'm mostly just thinking out loud here, because the subject matter <i>is</i> of interest to me, I just don't see this particular article making the grade. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 16:28, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> I like Captain Disdain's idea about finding a more general home for something like this, something about the intersection of the Internet and information on writing.

<li><b>Sort of Keep</b> apparently a real magazine, though admittedly shady. I've been watching it over the months, but never brought myself to propose it for deletion. I am guessing that real magazines with real circulations are presumptive, if not automatic, keeps.

<p>This is a niche product. Absolutely useless on wikipedia and I'll tell you why. No one knows about this game. It is too insignificant to be on wikipedia. I mean, the Adventure Company is barely afloat. This is better served on a company website not wikipedia. it is too insignificant and warrants deletion. Also the prose is so sloppy that it reads horribly. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaanxiquake_988d.html" title="User:Shaanxiquake">Shaanxiquake</a> 23:55, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>First of all, the article is in German, which I can't really read without resorting to heavy-duty dictionary use, so it's possible that all it needs is some minor translation work. I <i>can</i> make out that it's about a classical guitarist, but the details get hazy. However, the real problem is that the creator's username is also <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVasile-danciu_3c0a.html" title="User:Vasile-danciu">Vasile-danciu</a>, and he also added (a non-working) link to the article under the "Promising guitarists" section in <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitarist.html" title="Guitarist">Guitarist</a>. I'm not getting any relevant Google hits here, either. All this kind of points towards a vanity situation covered under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD:A7</a>, and the only reason I didn't tag the article as such is that I can't quite figure out what it says and I'm going to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and give all y'all a chance to point out that I'm wrong, since it's possible that I am -- maybe the creator isn't the subject of the article, but just a well-meaning fan. I don't <i>think</i> so, but guess it don't hurt none to be sure. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 14:55, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per german to english translation it appears to be a non-notable musician who clearly does not mean notability requirements. "Vasile Danciu was born in Maramures (seven castles - Rumania). It studied classic guitar at the art secondary school in women stream in prof. Marin Petreus and at the music academy Gheorghe Dima in Klaus castle in prof. Constantin Andrei. It has lived since 2002 in Vienna and studies Vienna at the conservatory – privately university.

<li><b>Delete</b>. In the (stated) expectation that it would be cleaned up, I voted <b>keep but cleanup</b> on the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casual_courier.html" title="Casual courier">casual courier</a> article. Damn my <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assumption of good faith</a> ... apparently, the cleanup-but-keep consensus on <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casual_courier.html" title="Casual courier">casual courier</a> has inspired its creator to wikispam every single term related to this corporation. Here's four reasons to delete, in a single sentence&#160;: this article, as a (1.) dicdef of an admittedly (2.) <s>copyrighted</s> trademarked term, is (3.) advertisement and (4.)nonencyclopedic. -- <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocether_44df.html" title="User:Docether">Docether</a> 15:42, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Point of information</b> - it is a trademarked term, not a copyrighted term. You can trademark anything you want - it just means what it sounds like - it is a mark that you use in your trade. It's a bar on other people using that term to leech off of your success - it's not a bar on other people mentioning the word in ordinary conversation, writing about the word, or using it in such a way that it was nothing to do with what you trademarked. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 15:47, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- Thanks, I stand corrected. It appears that this trademarked term is not in common usage other than as a mark of the particular corporation, which leads me to believe that this is part of an advertising / promotional usage of Wikipedia (considering the other factors). -- <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocether_44df.html" title="User:Docether">Docether</a> 15:57, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> with extreme prejudice.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I didn't realize that bookbinding was a competitive sport. All kidding aside, I think there is merit in keeping this article, although it should be quickly re-written to avoid the copyright concern. Assuming this person's career was late C19 and early C20, I doubt you'll find a lot on the internet about this. Bear in mind the limitations of <a href="../../../g/t/_/WP%7EGT_7ea5.html" title="WP:GT">googletesting</a> and its bias towards more modern subjects. While bookbinding today is probably a lost art, I suspect at the time it was an important craft (important enough that prizes were awarded for it).

<p>A strongly POV article about a rather marginal dancer who does not seem to fulfill <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> - Google has about 10 hits for "Francisco Bailando" but most of them probably not related to the dancer. The article is constantly reverted by its creator, who is seemingly a member of the Bailando's "cult", and there is probably nobody here who would be able to make a good article from it, because of lack of independent sources about Bailando.

<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup. This is a major problem, people just slapping an AFD on a page for some reason when it can just be fixed.

<li><b>Comment</b>: My apologies for "slapping an AFD" on the page. As an extension of <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runaways_%28comics%29.html" title="Runaways (comics)">Runaways (comics)</a>, the information provided in this article is too detailed and should be included in a small plot summary (focusing on major plot developments like origin, major changes, and effect in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Universe_3203.html" title="Marvel Universe">Marvel Universe</a>) on the Runaways page. Not every arc is important enough to be encyclopedic. If taken on its own, as perhaps a literary look at the <i>Runaways</i> comic book (which I do not believe is the intent), it contains too little (read: no) information about reception, themes, and style. For the record, I don't believe <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_X-Men_%28story_arcs%29_f143.html" title="Ultimate X-Men (story arcs)">Ultimate X-Men (story arcs)</a> is viable either for the same reasons. I accept, however, that I may be mistaken. --<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsyphics_cd27.html" title="User:Psyphics">Newt ΨΦ</a> 13:20, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We've been through this quite a few times. Grace is most definitely not notable enough for her own page, she's a gameshow contestant! <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">Budgiekiller</a> 18:28, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Notability is really an iffy thing. I am supplying the sources and supplying my rationale for why it should be kept. To be honest, I don't watch TV or really care about celebrity status (except for me&#160;:P). I have looked over the policy and in my mind it appears that she fits the profile.

<dd>S'ok. I usually try to keep an eye on that list, but I hadn't seen this entry. (We often get requests for articles that already exist.

I sometimes like to go get a copy of a manga listed on the requests page (<a href="../../../s/c/a/Scanlation.html" title="Scanlation">usually from unorthodox souces</a>) and then write the article from that. There's also the seiyu request page. (Though you have to check those for notability too.

<li><b>Keep</b>, clean up and expand. It is not a prayer. The article is about the quite notable collection of songs, known as the <i>Thiruppugazh</i>, of <a href="../../../a/r/u/Arunagirinathar.html" title="Arunagirinathar">Arunagirinathar</a>, a 15th century <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_people.html" title="Tamil people">Tamil</a> <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint.html" title="Saint">saint</a>. The search term "Thiruppugazh OR Tiruppugazh" gets about 19,600 Google hits, while variations like "Thiruppukazh", "Tirupugaz", etcetera, give a few hundred more hits. The article is obviously not written according to <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>; for example it uses a long paragraph to sketch the socio-religious context before the topic is introduced (in an unclear manner), and it also has to be cleaned up for neutrality. But both are weak grounds for deletion. There is much more to be said about the songs then there is in the present article. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 20:24, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>And someone appears to think that the way to refute arguments against the article's deletion is to delete the arguments. Nice idea of "rational debate" there.</p>
<p>To recap and hope that it won't get deleted this time: it's not likely to appear on any recipe sites, since the recipe is "chuck a load of stuff in a saucepan and cook it", nor is it "widely used chef lingo". I'm aware that I haven't given any references - that's because I doubt there are many, since it is primarily a colloquialism and not likely to occur very frequently in published material. In case any of you were wondering, I did not invent the term myself, nor is it particularly new: I initially came across it in the early 1990s, in a book which was probably published some years before that. Unfortunately I no longer have the book in question, and am thus unable to cite it as a reference. I'm intrigued by its categorisation as "very dumb hoax" and "BJAODN", apparently solely on the grounds that those making the comments haven't heard of it. It may well not meet standards of verification, in which case it is likely to be deleted, but if it's a hoax then you must all be hallucinating, since you've read an entry written by someone who's been living for the past year on stuff that apparently doesn't exist. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChile_Nose_Jam_fb77.html" title="User:Chile Nose Jam">Chile Nose Jam</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChile_Nose_Jam_d09d.html" title="User talk:Chile Nose Jam">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chile_Nose_Jam_08a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chile Nose Jam">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I think the entry is relevant. Although the content is decidedly local in nature, I have no doubt the page itself will pick up numerous hits as there are almost 15,000 registered users on the three major Mississippi State University message boards combined. These message boards (as well as many of the college message boards) have taken on a life of their own as many of them have their own histories and lexicons. As a result, I plan to address this history and expand the page over time. I think this is an burgeoning area for Wikipedia and an opportunity to add some local flavor to the site. Although I am a poster, I am not one of the message board founders. The board has become increasingly important to me. Rest assured this is not an advertising ploy. I am just trying to place some Mississippi State icons on Wikipedia. You'll notice in my history that I added an entry for our University's President yesterday. I had hoped to add entries for our coaches, our sports histories, our message boards, and other traditions. Croomdawg 14:02, 16 June 2006 (UTC)Croomdawg</p>
<p>Also, I took out the reference to the mullet as an inside joke well known to fans of Mississippi State, but would likely miss their mark when viewed by others.Croomdawg 14:16, 16 June 2006 (UTC)Croomdawg</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> While a list could give context and explanation, this one doesn't bother to do so in the intro. Nor has it established any criteria to limit inclusion other than being physically located in the U.S. A small family cemetary that is lost in the woods merits inclusion (yes, doing genealogy research I've gone tramping through the woods looking for such). I've also seen small private cemetaries on the roadside with 5-10 tombstones. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, which is exactly what this list is designed to be. At even 5 cemetaries per town or city, we would end up with over 25,000 cemetaries on this list. As the nominator said, categories is the way to approach this.<a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:00, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not saying it couldn't do with inclusion criteria, but most of the cemeteries on the list at the moment do actually have their own article. The fact an article is not fully developed <i>yet</i> has never been a reason to delete it from Wikipedia. Otherwise almost all stubs would disappear, something I know some people would like, but the majority almost certainly wouldn't. And I completely disagree with your claim that this list is designed to be an indiscrimate collection of information - with an adequate introduction and criteria for inclusion it could be a very useful article. Are you saying that instead of editing articles we don't think are adequate we should just delete them? Seems to fly in the face of what Wikipedia is all about. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 12:29, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, this kind of thing should go into the articles on the presidents.

<li>Comment: I'm not sure we want to devote a section of the various presidential articles to these allegations. While they are themselves notable, they are not central to the notability of those figures. Those articles should probably each contain one sentence with a pointer to this one which can present more detail without hijacking the presidential articles. One could separate these into four separate ones, but a unified article makes a more interesting read and provides context. Part of that context is, as you note, that most recent presidents have had allegations of this sort made, which likely speaks more about the current culture than about their characters. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 01:29, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

If the other two are truly worthy of mention, they'll be covered sooner or later.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> List of allegations... give me strength. If these allegations are notable, then what is the problem with mentioning them on the article of the respective president? The only reason I would consider something like this worthy of its own article is if there was some kind of reason to believe that U.S. presidents are particularly prone to raping. Otherwise, it's just an excuse to list allegations, or for someone who has had his contributions thrown off presidential bioggraphies and decides to start his own article instead. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 10:32, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Exactly. Also, it creates more work for those trying to maintain NPOV, as they have to try to come to a consensus on multiple articles instead of just one. Finally, editors should be aware that a truly comprehensive biography on a person is not appropriate for an encyclopedia, even Wikipedia (whether the biography consists of one article or multiple articles). For United States presidents, such a biography would consume a short book at the least since we know so much about them, relatively speaking. If the event (or situation, action or whatever) did not have a significant impact on the person or on the industry, nation, culture or society, there is a good possibility that it should not be included. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 12:25, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> gimme a break.... anything with "accusations" in the title automatically disqualifies itself from inclusion in an encyclopaedia where verifiable facts are the norm. Accuasations furthermore are ludicrous. Reagan and Bush as rapists? I won't even touch on the fact that these people (certainly in this day and age) are always going to be accused of something as do virtually all celebrities, athletes, politicians etc. which means that without solid reasons there should be extra care taken with this sort of thing or we might as well devote half of the encyclopaedia to accusations made against well-known people.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 19:57, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Are you suggesting that Wikipedia never mention that Juanita Broaddrick accused Clinton of rape, or that Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of harassment, or any other well-known allegations? Wikipedia does not report what <b>is</b>. We report what people say is. That's the very cornerstone of the NPOV policy. The fundamental questions are whether the allegations are notable, yes as evidenced by media coverage, and verifiable, yes the <b>accusation</b> is verifiable. The article never suggests the alleged act did or was likely to have occured. So, removing the material has no basis in policy, nor does it serve the reader. There have also been lots of people worried that this article exists to promote POV or that it creates problems monitoring that. I ask, where is the evidence for that? This has been a remarkably quiet article, and I think is scrupulously neutral. If people are looking for a POV brawl, stick this back into the main articles and see what happens. That's exactly how this article got started, because the Selene Walters and Juanita Broadrick articles were hotspots. I see a lot of opining about how this article causes more trouble than a merge by people whose names I don't recognize as being active contributors to those Presidential articles. The evidence points to the contrary. Jimbo is right about this: AFD is broken, long live AFD. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 20:43, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am suggesting that the first word of the article disqualifies it right then and there. Furthermore, Broaddrick (I am nor familiar with this particular case) <i>may</i>, and I say that carefully, be worthy of inclusion considering Clinton's record. Hill's accusation played a large part in Thomas's <s>character assasination</s> <i>hearings</i>, making it notable. The rest of this article is again, filled with ludicrous accusations. Wikipedia should imho <i>not</i> report everything people say. Also, the term <i>undue weight</i> springs to mind.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 22:01, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are hudreds of students that need this specific information!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>I am sick of having people come to me because they could not find this information.....firstly I see no reason why the information provided can't be seperated into the desirable categories. I put the information in here when I know student will be using it for ther finals. If I have time I will break it up and exapand on current articles as the inforamtion found in these articles are not specific enough. I thought that wikipedia is where student can find information that may be hard to come by. Perhaps I was wrong. Perhaps you want to dum down our society.

<li><b>Delete</b> To the author, the problem isn't the idea behind the article. Taiwan is an important consumers' market but you need to do several things. First, most of this information is already in the article about Taiwan and therefore isn't new. The information that isn't there should be placed there. Could you do that? Second, the new information isn't presented as an article, just as facts. You need to write it as an article. This isn't a place to store info for students who are taking finals. And as already pointed out, almost all these numbers are already available in the Taiwan article. Third, getting angry on an AfD page doesn't help get this article in wikipedia form. Could you go ahead and merge this information into the main Taiwan article?<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 23:20, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Everyone in Belgium would know that there is no large city called Eiland (or any of the others): the fault lies in the fallingrain website, which gives population numbers out of the blue: see e.g. <a href="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/BE/8/a/E/" class="external text" title="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/BE/8/a/E/" rel="nofollow">this list</a> for all "cities" in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Flanders_cd4f.html" title="East Flanders">East Flanders</a>, Belgium (the province has in reality a total population of almost 1.4 million: you'll notice on the Wikipedia link that neither Eiland nor Polfbroekstraat are mentioned as municipalities, let alone cities). Similarly, <a href="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/BE/5/a/G/" class="external text" title="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/BE/5/a/G/" rel="nofollow">Gotem</a> has a fanciful number of inhabitants (hey look, Gothem even has 84,000 inhabitants!). In short, these users try to create fanciful articles by using a tiny bit of reality, some very bizarre data on (legitimate) websites, and a lot of imagination, and seem to achieve this because at a glance, it looks legitimate. CrzRussian, I could by the same means start creating articles about the Russian cities of <a href="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/47/a/A/n/" class="external text" title="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/47/a/A/n/" rel="nofollow">Anino and Annenskoye</a>, both with 714,696 inhabitants, or perhaps <a href="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/47/a/B/e/" class="external text" title="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/47/a/B/e/" rel="nofollow">Belyayeva or Belyayevo</a>, with 749,719 inhabitants. Or let's take the USA: it seems wehave forgotten to create articles about <a href="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/12/a/G/" class="external text" title="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/12/a/G/" rel="nofollow">Glenwood Heights</a>, Florida, population 426,386, or the <a href="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/6/a/C/o/" class="external text" title="http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/6/a/C/o/" rel="nofollow">Coach Royal Trailer Park subdivision</a> in California, population 443,982. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:23, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem with your use of places like Glenwood Heights and Coach Royal Trail Park argument, Flam, is that these places exist within <i>densely populated areas</i> (as can be seen by the solid yellow coloring on the Fallinrain pages). Thus, the population (which is determined by a 7km radius from the point), captures an extraordinary number of people. Glenwood Heights is in the county of Miami-Dade which is world reknown for its beaches, nightlife and tropical setting. It is also dense in population since it is a <i>large city</i>. Yes, Fallingrain may be questionable but only under certain circumstances. In this case, it is not. Since Gotem is rural, <i>it does not exist in a city or other area of dense population</i>, thus it is not unreasonable to count everyone in a 7km radius. 7km (approximately 4.3 miles) actually a very small radius to count a population anywhere and is <i>easily</i> walking/biking distance in a rural setting. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesxavier_4417.html" title="User:Charlesxavier">Charlesxavier</a> 14:17, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

The goal of the project is: "Some Wikipedians have formed a project to better document the history and geography of Belgium, especially less-widely known municipalities which play an important role in the history of Belgium". None of the articles in question document a mnunicipality, and none of the streets or hamlets they are talking about play "an important role in the history of Belgium".

<li>In your nomination, you state that Gotem is a "very small hamlet in Limburg." I can find multiple references to this place. I don't think there is any dispute over whether this is a real place. In general we keep such articles. I would agree that the fallingrain site gives somewhat misleading population counts, and perhaps these numbers should not be used in the article, but that's reason to fix the article, not to delete it. If you feel you can show a bad faith effort on the part of other editors to add nonsense articles, then there are other ways to do it. But so far as this article goes, I don't think there's sufficient reason for deleting it. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 13:23, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Gotem is, as has been said, an existing place, though very small and non (or hardly) notable. The fact that it exists is already noted in the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borgloon.html" title="Borgloon">Borgloon</a> article. As I don't see how it can ever become more than a stub, and as none of the info currently in the article is worth merging, I suggested deletion. I could have put merge instead, but what is there to merge? Current article: population is wrong, reference is wrong (in its data), picture is not relevant, Polfbroekstraat reference is wrong... So we are left with: Gotem is part of the municipality of Borgloon, in Limburg. All that info is included in the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borgloon.html" title="Borgloon">Borgloon</a> article. No one has presented anything else that could be said about Gotem that would make it worthy of a separate place in this encyclopedia. Delete or redirect... Eiland is indeed, somewhat less verifiable, as in not at all. No city of that name exists in Flanders (there may be a cluster of three houses somewhere that is called Eiland, I don't know and care: it is unverifiable, unencyclopedic, and the current contents of the article are wrong. But I'll take it elsewhere, it was just to show the methods used by the editors involved, and the reasons to assume in this case bad faith instead of the usual good faith. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:46, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> How can you assume that the editors are ill-intentioned? By the way, you are currently the only Wikipedian favoring deletion, whereas two major Wikipedia (and other Wiki-network) contributors in addition to 5+ others say otherwise. Why do you persist in accusing our efforts (and accusing members of sockpuppeting) and trying to delete the project page instead of helping us to correct it in a less drastic manner? Is your personal attack on our collective credibilities an attempt to discredit us in light of insufficient evidence for your argument? Yes it is. As I have stated previously, your arguments concerning the population count are weak since Gotem exists in a rural location rather than a metropolis for example. If you would like, I can fish out examples from all over the world.

<li><b>Comment</b> If you think the editors of this article are ill-intentioned, consider this: the largest PC vendors on the market today started out at shady warehouse operations. In America we celebrate something called the sense of entrepreneurship. People can risk credibility but they always have the opportunity to develop something great. If you really hate Gotem so much, why don't you go to the Dutch Wikipedia and delete that article? Better yet, why don't you help us translate its text and help us construct this article instead of tearing it down? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesxavier_4417.html" title="User:Charlesxavier">Charlesxavier</a> 15:26, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Can you explain how a village that is part of a municipality with some 10,000 inhabitants can have 21,000 inhabitants?</li>
<li>It is Wikipedia policy to only include things because they are notable, not because they may become notable. Hence, your comparison to PC vendors is baseless.</li>
<li>I feel that the two Wikipedia editors that voted/vote keep have been fooled. The other users seem to be one "group", as has been shown for some of them. They are not objective.</li>

A project that starts out with such false objectives isn't worth defending or collaborating on, no matter how neutral a name it has</li>

<li>As for the people saying that the articles are (potentially) worthwhile because the placenames exist: yes, but they are streets, nothing more.

Now, if someone can give me a good text link for the medium-sized city of Eiland, I would be very grateful. Otherwise, it may be time to start believing that there is no medium-sized city with name, just like there is no village called Gotem with 20,000 inhabitants, etcetera. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 21:53, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The data in the article could be incorrect; Wikipedia is not a primary source anyhow.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That comment was not saying that Gotem is an entrepreneurship, but that we as editors are in a way.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nobody is objective in a debate, otherwise there would be no debate. We are the article creators, so of course we are not objective. You obviously are not objective, either.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You could help with the project if you felt a need to work on the articles about Belgium. Considering that you are Belgian (or at least I'm guessing this, since you claim to have been there, speak Dutch and like Belgian comics), this would help the project quite a bit. Also, the project is entirely neutral. The overall objective is to improve the articles on Belgium, and this is what we are trying to do.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That article was deleted because <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> said that it was "not a real place," which it obviously is, and not for the reasons you said. I am defending this because it was deleted wrongly, even if it was somewhat ridiculous. The new article is obviously not, and a lot of work has been done to it in the last 24 hours alone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All of the Eiland article makes perfect sense, so I'm not sure what you're talking about.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Yes, that is the cache for that article which was also deleted without any discussion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I don't believe these articles are streets, except Polfbroekstraat, since straat is Dutch for street if I'm correct. At any rate, there are many articles on streets in Wiki, and according to Falling Rain, those are cities or towns, hence the phrase on the page "nearby cities and towns."</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is meant to be a collaborative medium through which we can better understand our world. This means improvement upon legitimate articles, not outright deletion. I acknowledge that the previous articles were poorly written and perhaps not very factual. However, I have taken steps to rebuild the credibility of <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotem.html" title="Gotem">Gotem</a> and remain dedicated to improving its article page. In no way do I or my colleagues condone vandalism or creation of articles based on false subjects. As for the population count, if you can provide evidence that it is lower (around 10K as you suggest) then by all means <i>change the details</i>, but don't use it as your motivation to delete an article simply because you think the number is too large. I further challenge you to visit the coordinates 50° 47' 60" N, 5° 17' 60" E and see for yourself that there indeed is a bustling population there, so much so that there is a <a href="../../../m/a/a/Maastricht_Aachen_Airport_fd90.html" title="Maastricht Aachen Airport">local airport</a> and plenty of hotels. I have never heard of hotels or airports in insignificant villages. There is obviously some commerce going on in the region and thus <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotem.html" title="Gotem">Gotem</a> has, in addition to historical and cultural value, commercial value.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Granted the previous version of the articles seemed to be nonsense, however the proper solution for solving 'nonsense' when there is a 2 year history is reverting, not deleting without warning. Although I feel that, thanks to this deletion and subsequent battle over Gotem, the page has actually become much better than it ever was. So, in a sense, I have you to thank for this. *Also how can you claim Gotem is not notable? In my opinion <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesxavier_4417.html" title="User:Charlesxavier">Charlesxavier</a> has established this without a doubt (see castle, and origin of family name). What you say about the size of the cities themselves may be true, but the (current) information (such as on Polfbroekstraat) on the pages is not inaccurate, it is noted that the 'population' figure is taken from an x km radius.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Raven_d68a.html" title="User:The Raven">The Raven</a> 22:40, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I happen to live in Belgium, lees than 15 km from Cotthem, Polbroek and Eiland. These are simply streets in the still largely rural town of Sint-Lievens-Houtem. One of my sources for this is Stratenatlas van Vlaanderen - Guide des Rues de Flandre. Standaard Uitgeverij, ISBN 90-0-20614-3. If anyone wants pictures of these streets, I will provide them next week (I have to correct a lot of exam papers now)- I like to cycle in that area. It is time to stop this nonsense. Fram is perfectly right. All these articles must be deleted ASAP. They constitute <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a>. As for Gotem, it does exist, but is far smaller than claimed by its supporters here (according to the same source as quoted above, less than 1 square kilometre). The place in East-Flanders is called Gottem (with two t's - and that influences the pronuciation) and is now part of Deinze. By the way, the fact that these guys do note even realize that the province of East Flanders is not the same as the province of Limburg and is in fact to the WEST of it (Belgians are particular at geography, you see) proves that they have invented all this. Stop creating a parallel universe and start writing real articles. Or leave Wikipedia, which you are just rubbishing with these edits. .<a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPan_Gerwazy_3e18.html" title="User talk:Pan Gerwazy">User_talk:Pan_Gerwazy</a>--pgp 18:00, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I would like the AfD to continue for now as a place of discussion, I don't think that the current article on Gotem, which finally is about a real, though small, village (hamlet, whatever) should any longer be deleted. After the users involved have had two years of editing and only could produce wrong facts about the village, this AfD has achieved that they have researched finally the village they wanted to have an article. Why they cretade an article about a place they knew nothing about escapes me, but the current article, minus a few serious errors, can be kept (it would be better merged with Borgloon, but that is a minor point). As for the other articles, and the project: delete them all. The three articles (including Oordegemsestraat) can never become worthwhile, as there is (as opposed to Gotem) no village to describe. It's just a poin ton a map. The article Eiland is the most ridiculous of them all. The project, while having a nuetral title, is as it is presented (defending those three articles), equally worthless. If the authords want to change it in a worthwhile project, they are free to do so. I feel no need for it. As for contributing to articles about Belgium: I have done so, quite a lot in fact, as can be seen on my contributions page. I don't feel the need to create articles about smaller entities than the municipalities except in certain important cases (like the Antwerp districts, or <a href="../../../d/o/e/Doel.html" title="Doel">Doel</a>), but people that are willing to make a serious article about such villages (deelgemeentes) are of course welcome. I would never SD or AfD those. Finally, I will probably in the next few days start AfD's on Eiland and Polfbroekstraat, so the discussion of those can be held separately. I will ask some long-retm editors from Belgium to have a look at the articles and give their impression, so that we got some impartial and informed opinions on them (as most of the opinions here lacked one or both). If no new arguments or questions are raised here, I'll probably take my criticisms of the current Gotem page to the discussion page of the article, and stay out of here. I stand behind my earlier statements here, and behind the AfD, because the article at the time of the AfD wasn't worth anything and did not refer to a real village. Now it does, and now it contains some correct info, and so for me it can stay. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:47, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The project is for Belgium, and was created long after those articles existed. Since they are related to Belgium and are the work of the only current members of the Belgian WikiProject, it made sense for them to be part of the project. At any rate, the Belgian WikiProject didn't even exist until I made it, and I phrased the goals generally enough to allow work on a lot of other Belgian pages to be coordinated through the Project, which was my intention. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> 20:26, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Although I do like the idea, if memory serves me right merge and delete (which this amounts to) is not a valid vote because the history is lost. Although we could merge the team list with <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Minnesota Twins</a> and have the all-time team redirect there. I would still rather see it deleted since I don't think this inherently POV all-time team should be kept on an encyclopaedia, but a merge-n-redirect wouldn't make me unhappy. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 17:42, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Given the precedent that's been put forward already, I'm going to change to <b>neutral</b> on this. However, I believe we need a policy on this. I'm quite sure extensive boxscores for every game in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Cup_of_Hockey_f708.html" title="World Cup of Hockey">World Cup of Hockey</a>, or for the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Baseball_Classic_5e0b.html" title="World Baseball Classic">World Baseball Classic</a>, etc. would most likely be unwanted. (The fact that we already have detailed boxscores for World Series matches bothers me somewhat.) It's my opinion that a summary of one sporting event should not take longer than three lines (much akin to the *short-style* boxscores in baseball), and the fact that this is the FIFA World Cup, rather than the World Cup of Hockey, or the World Baseball Classic, etc. should not have any bearing on this. Wikipedia should not become a sports statistics database, which we are coming dangerously close to at the moment, IMO. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 22:54, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

They also contain a great deal of additional information vital to understanding the matches: lineups, cards and substitutions. As evidenced by the versions of these articles in seven other Wikipedia languages, there is still more information to be added, such as statistics and formation diagrams.

The articles also contain links to Wikipedia biographies of the players and WikiNews articles on the games, things one is not going to find on fifaworldcup.com.

<dl>
<dd><b>nothing but news</b> would be if we took an article straight out of the newspaper, rewrote it and posted it here as an article. This is the biggest sporting event in the world, the entire world is fixated on this event, peple from 200 nations wanted to be involved in this tournament, detailing that is certainly a current event, adding as much detail as possible (with sources of course) is important. It would be "world cup cruft" if we were detailing what shoes each player wore, who wears their socks up or down, what size shorts people wear, which goalies use which types of gloves, etc. As is we're posting fact, and verifiable fact at that. Hope that helped, if not i'm sorry, but its obvious that this debate will result in a keep of all information. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 14:30, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While one may not like the way the article is currently written, or have problems with NPOV, or disagree with the politics of the bloggers involved, it's obvious that both the word and the Internet "Plameology" phenomenon are real. I've been tracking its increasing use on Google over the last few months. Anyone doing a Google search now will quickly see references to <i>dozens</i> of sites using the term, not just a "couple" of left-wing blogs (and for what it's worth, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Review_8dfa.html" title="National Review">National Review</a> is a conservative publication, and <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byron_York_494a.html" title="Byron York">Byron York</a> is no left-wing blogger). Where did you get only "44 unique hits" which have nothing to do with Wikipedia? I don't get that number at all. (I see 207 current matches for "Plameology", 219 additional matches for "Plameologist", and 461 matches for "Plameologists", though none of those numbers necessarily reflects the extent of the term's use since many blog sites have only irregularly-archived comment threads. And FYI, the prominent Wilson and York quotes, footnoted above, are yet to appear in Google.)</dd>

<dd>I have made a good-faith effort to define an Internet <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> which has enjoyed increasing currency in 2005 and 2006, and which shows no sign of abating. Note that the article does <i>not</i> credit the views of any one Plameologist, does <i>not</i> recommend sites, and attempts to remain neutral on interpretation of the facts while summarizing the <i>gist</i> of what Plamelogists have been saying and predicting, sometimes with great accuracy, over the past few years. The suggestion that the word "[w]ill not be notable in a couple of weeks, let alone years" is colored both by partisanship and by a misunderstanding of the facts. Given that Fitzgerald's investigation remains open, and <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Libby_3c63.html" title="Lewis Libby">Lewis Libby</a> will go on trial for perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Plame leak in January 2007, we're bound to see continued use of the word and more print references, such as yesterday's by the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Review_8dfa.html" title="National Review">National Review</a>. (And FYI, the non-indictment of Karl Rove after five grand jury appearances, publicized earlier this week by Rove's own lawyer, by no means ends an investigation which has <i>always</i> been larger than Rove. In fact, Rove's known role leaking Plame's CIA identity to reporter Matt Cooper, and his subsequent non-indictment after facing what many believe was considerable legal jeopardy, has led many Plameologists — who number among their ranks former prosecutors with significant experience with grand juries and complex conspiracy cases — to speculate that Rove is <i>cooperating</i> with an investigation that has quietly advanced to higher levels, and which will use Rove as a witness.<a href="http://thenexthurrah.typepad.com/the_next_hurrah/2006/06/rove_will_not_b.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://thenexthurrah.typepad.com/the_next_hurrah/2006/06/rove_will_not_b.html" rel="nofollow">[62]</a><a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/06/13/hey-bob-wheres-your-letter/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/06/13/hey-bob-wheres-your-letter/" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> A number of Plameologists said this <i>before</i> Monday's announcement from Rove's lawyer.<a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/06/13/some-things-to-contemplate/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/06/13/some-things-to-contemplate/" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>)</dd>

<dd>Second, I <i>do</i> assume good faith, but I must admit my good faith has been recently shaken by a crazy situation on the <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laura_Ingraham_e1e0.html" title="Laura Ingraham">Laura Ingraham</a> page, which seems to be occupied by a wild-eyed Laura fan (already banned once) and what appears to be his newly-minted sockpuppet sidekick. I'm exhausted and wary from a pointless epic battle over — get this — whether Laura spent six or eight days in Iraq in February 2006. (For the record, her website clearly states that February 5th is her first day in Iraq, and February 10th is her last day in Iraq.) I'm wondering if an awful spirit has taken over Wikipedia, and you'll see why if you look at the Talk page. So I apologize. That's the context.</dd>

<dd>Also, there seems to be an upturn of trolls on the Plameology-related threads, possibly because of the CSPAN2 broadcast on Friday (repeated several times over the weekend) in which Joe Wilson himself said the word "Plameologists". Wilson implicitly acknowledged the term's wide currency, and sang the praises of his 1000+ audience's collective Plameology skills. I'm pretty sure the event was billed early on as a Plameology Panel. It was delivered before a political blogger convention in Las Vegas with more than 100 media members present.<a href="http://www.c-span.org/VideoArchives.asp?z1=&amp;PopupMenu_Name=Media/Press&amp;CatCodePairs=Issue,MP" class="external text" title="http://www.c-span.org/VideoArchives.asp?z1=&amp;PopupMenu_Name=Media/Press&amp;CatCodePairs=Issue,MP" rel="nofollow">The CSPAN video is definitely worth a look</a> (go to "YearlyKos Convention" 6/9/06).</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Yes, this article needs work, but so do many in Wikipedia. State forensic leagues are not mere chapters. They have hundreds of events each year, thousands of participants and are the main way in which NFL members gain experience. It is like saying we should not have a New York Mets page, since we have one for Major League Baseball. In addition, state leagues sponsor different events than the NFL does. These would be lost if there were not state level pages. In addition, there is more to this page already than there is for most of the High School pages in Wikipedia. Sure, the page needs work, but a lot of our pages do.

<li>'<i>Weak keep</i>. This is more weakly written than the similar article on the Texas Forensic Association but as per my comments there and for the Wisconsin group, I'm going to stick my neck out and say we should keep these. They have real notability in the lives of thousands of high school students in each of these states although this might not be immediately visible in Google hits. The article on Texas, in particular, has benefited from a lot of input over nearly four months. I think these others will also improve. QUESTION: is my reasoning totally wrong here?

<li><b>Comment</b> Your reasoning is good, but in this case, the question is more whether the State level organisations are notable independantly of the National Organisation (NFL). My argument is that they are not. I absolutely agree that the National Forensics League is notable, but as per many past decisions, I don't feel that regional divisions of a national organisation are notable enough for an article <i>unless</i> they can establish that notability on their own - which this article, and the others, don't do - <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 03:40, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b>. Well written and formatted, so that's a star for the writer, but it lacks notability.</s> <b>Keep</b>. After looking at the series of AfD request for these debating socieites, I have to change my opinion. Debating societies are an important part of high school life comparable to sports and spelling bees. These articles are not just vanity pages for local high schools but are generally well-ogranized collaborative efforts to describe the functioning of debating societies in large US states (California, Texas, Ohio, etc.). They might not seem too notable to a 45-year-old guy in Chicago (me!) but there are other standards of notability that they meet. Some need more work than others, but this one for Texas is pretty well advanced. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 03:21, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article was created and primarily edited by 69.137.236.54 who admits that he is the subject: Talk:Solomon_Keal. Clearly vanity and I fail to see the importance or notability of the subject. Google search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Solomon+Keal%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Solomon+Keal%22" rel="nofollow">[67]</a> brings up nothing notable, but the first two hits are the official website and the <i>unofficial</i> fan site...curiously, both of which are registered to the same person as a whois search will show. Clearly this is vanity/spam by someone who is attempting to spread his name all over the internet. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 00:04, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Also, the article uses intrawiki links to tons of famous people in an attempt to assert notability, but of course, it's not as if this guy has ever worked with (or even met) any of said people.

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. The problem is less with the Association, which has some reasonable notability, but with the info, which is just a list of standard material. The author needs to give info specifically on the WFCA if this article is going to avoid being deleted.</s> <b>Weak Keep</b>. After looking at the series of AfD request for these debating socieites, I have to change my opinion. Debating societies are an important part of high school life comparable to sports and spelling bees. These articles are not just vanity pages for local high schools but are generally well-ogranized collaborative efforts to describe the functioning of debating societies in large US states (California, Texas, Ohio, etc.). They might not seem too notable to a 45-year-old guy in Chicago (me!) but there are other standards of notability that they meet. Some need more work than others, but this one for Texas is pretty well advanced. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 03:18, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>I agree that debating is important, but this page (wisconsin, not texas) is simply the same information that already exists on <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debate.html" title="Debate">Debate</a>. It has little unique content and doesn't meet the crucial test of claiming notability.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Yes, it needs expansion, but so do a lot of stubs. State forensic leagues are not mere chapters. They have hundreds of events each year, thousands of participants and are the main way in which NFL members gain experience. It is like saying we should not have a New York Mets page, since we have one for Major League Baseball. In addition, state leagues sponsor different events than the NFL does. These would be lost if there were not state level pages. In addition, there is more to this page already than there is for most of the High School pages in Wikipedia. Sure, the page needs work, but a lot of our pages do. See also the discussions at <a href="../../../n/a/t/Talk%7ENational_Forensic_League_642e.html" title="Talk:National Forensic League">Talk:National Forensic League</a>, where active encouragement has been given to developing State league pages. --<a href="../../../c/t/s/User%7ECTSWyneken_8c3b.html" title="User:CTSWyneken">CTSWyneken</a> 13:15, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
