<li><font color="#000000"><b>Delete</b> - <b>(1)</b> All topics must meet a minimum threshold of notability in order for an article on that topic to be included in Wikipedia. Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, a topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least two, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other to ensures that there exists enough source material to write a verifiable, encyclopedic article about the topic. I searched and could not find even one work. Thus, the article does not meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> requirements. <b>(2)</b> The article itself states that the event has had only eight hundred contestants since 2002. Eight hundred people being interested in a Wikipedia topic is a relatively small number. In addition to the event not drawing media attention, none of the contestants have been prominent enough to draw media attention. The contest event website <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.ludumdare.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ludumdare.com/</a> itself is not operating, and there is no indication as to how the event will continue to be an ongoing happening. No other Wikipedia articles <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_LudumDare_0cd7.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/LudumDare">link to LudumDare.</a> The only Wikipedia article that mentions Ludum Dare is <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamumu_Software_b374.html" title="Hamumu Software">Hamumu Software</a>. With such little interest in the topic, I do not believe that there will be any published works about the topic coming forth in the near future. <b>(3)</b> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_LudumDare_fa79.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/LudumDare">The first AfD</a> (15 May 2006) mentioned a slashdot article. Seven months have passed in which this reference could have been added to the Ludum Dare article but it has not been added. Also, the Wikipedia:Notability issues brought up in the May 15th AfD #1 have not been addressed in the article. Further, Deletion Review (January 3, 2007) mentioned Slashdot and other tech news sites, none of which have been added to the Ludum Dare article as references. Moreover, in the past twelve days of the present AFD#2, none of the concerns listed in this AfD#2 have been addressed through editing the Ludum Dare article. Thus, it appears that there is no interest in bringing this article into compliance with Wikipedia policies, guidelines, etc. and that lack of interest has existed for at least seven months. <b>(4)</b> The article was relisted at AfD to give more time to discuss the article. AfDs may close after five days. This article has been listed at AfD since January 4th - almost twelve days. Thus, this article may have received all the discussion that the Wikipedia community believes it needs. <b>(5)</b> In view of the above, this article should be <b>deleted</b> because it does not comply with Wikipedia policy, there is no foreseeable media interest in this topic, Wikipedians do not have enough interest in this article to address the concerns brought up in the AfD#1, Deletion Review, and AfD#2, and it appears all those interested in discussing the article at AfD have discussed the article. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 02:47, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</font></li>
<li><font color="#000000"><b>Keep</b> - I was just notified by user Jreferee on my talk page about this discussion, and I think it 1) should be given more time and 2) actually might have a bit of notability. LudumDare to me seems quite well known in the indy gaming scene (not that I really know much about that either) - the reason there was no interest in the article and that there are no links from other articles and that the Slashdot reference could not have been added sooner was that for the past 7 months the article had been deleted (and in the past two weeks I had no idea about the relisting). Up to 800 participants (many joined multiple times of course, but still) means there are many more players of those games. There also are several commercial games (non of WP notability as far as I know) which are spin-offs of initial LD entries. As is mentioned in the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_January_2_2936.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 January 2">relisting discussion</a>, e.g. <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_day_roguelike.html" title="Seven day roguelike">Seven day roguelike</a> is a very similar competition, and also has its WP article, but it only runs since 2005 and only had 35 contestants.</font></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><font color="#000000">Therefore, I would like to keep this article around for some time, so I can look for references about notability. I know from some participants that their LD games (or spinoffs thereof) also were featured at other places, might add some info in the next days now that I know about the relisting. There are also websites about most of the competitions (except the ones on ludumdare.com which is down) which I will try to add. (Oh, and the next LD will be held in April according to people in their IRC channel, but has not been announced yet officially (as the site is down..)). I can't say how well known it really is in a global sense or how big/noteworthy the indy game developers scene as a whole is, but I guess for a lot if indy game developers LD indeed is a known term, and among all those similar competitions (pygame, speedhack, 72 hour contest, rpgdx, ...) LD probably is the biggest and most well known. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllefant_55f5.html" title="User:Allefant">Allefant</a> 15:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</font></dd>
