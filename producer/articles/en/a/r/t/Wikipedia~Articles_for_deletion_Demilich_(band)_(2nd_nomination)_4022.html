<li>Actually the first AFD is moot. It made the common mistake of thinking that "two full length" albums on a major label is *the* standard of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. That's actually just one of many criteria, that are allowed, and not the most relevant in this case. The AFD completely ignored the fact the band's music was used by another notable band. There was *no* discussion of what writing about the band existed (it's ok to reject some writing as trivial, but the AFD did not discuss the matter at all). Now, I fully understand the reason for original deletion. The article was horribly incomplete. But the fact an article was incomplete, doesn't mean it should never be completed. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:46, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Can't say I agree with this. It's not a nom.'s responsibility to scour the Internet trying to find reasons to keep it. That's the author's job. The article looked like garbage and it was deleted. Unanimously I might add - meaning even the author didn't bother trying to save it. Go ahead and keep it now - I wouldn't have even nominated it the way it currently is - but don't blame me for getting it deleted it in the first place. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 03:01, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>AfD is the place to come if something exists and may qualify for deletion under the deletion policy.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I haven't followed the saga of this article's previous deletion, but I have a large metal collection which does include this album. The band was notorious in the 90s for having a vocal delivery style unlike any of its peers. Googling for "demilich" and "vocals" returns a lot of other album reviews that make reference to demilich, like these <a href="http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&amp;sid=1&amp;id=7506" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&amp;sid=1&amp;id=7506" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.enterthedeathcult.com/Deathcult_reviews.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.enterthedeathcult.com/Deathcult_reviews.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

The band does not even fall under this category. see <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: For the record, my original nom. didn't say two albums are "required" - it said that two albums is the standard. While the article is a vast improvement over what it was, I still maintain that if we had an article for every death metal band with a single album from a label that was so shaky that it went out of business, we'd be flooded with them. I have relatives who would have an outside shot... —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 23:50, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Good question. How many of them do we have about which a verifiable article can be written? If there are 10,000 such, let's start to worry when we have 10,001 such articles. But I strongly suspect that bands of this kind of pedigree are much thinner on the ground. In fact, looking at our category "Heavy metal musical groups", we seem to have barely 200, which is laughable. We really shouldn't be deleting articles about those that we have. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 00:08, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes, 200 is very few. And Demilich have done more than release one album; they are currently on an international tour. (not to mention the fact that their one album has been rereleased on two major record labels). Is this enough consensus to keep the page?
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: As long as the articles are halfway decent ones (like this one has become), I agree with Tony Sidaway completely. But, perusing the <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com" class="external free" title="http://www.metal-archives.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.metal-archives.com</a> database, I could certainly live without quite a few of those. Like do we need seven articles to cover each of the death metal bands called "Cremation"? Or five articles to cover the "Crematorium"s? Anyway, this isn't the place for this discussion - I just wanted to make it clear that I do have a decent grasp of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> and the previous article for this band was definitely nowhere near it. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 00:38, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. So can I remove the deletion header on the page? Are you revoking your deletion? <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnson542_3be2.html" title="User:Johnson542">Johnson542</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnson542_2065.html" title="User talk:Johnson542">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johnson542_17ed.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johnson542">contribs</a>) .</small>
<ul>
<li>Just leave it there. Eventually, an admin will remove it. Also, this AFD doesn't "belong" to one person, so it's not as simple as one person ending it. There's three people who still indicated they want a delete. Anyway, the decision to do an early close is best left to an uninvolved party. The best thing you can do, is add as much relevant sources and information to the article. The only reason this was deleted in the first place, is that it was never completed. You can avoid future problems (like future deletion nominations) by completing the article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:34, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
