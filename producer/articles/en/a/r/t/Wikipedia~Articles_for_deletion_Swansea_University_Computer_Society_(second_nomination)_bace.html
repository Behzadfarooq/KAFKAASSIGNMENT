<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. This is a tough call. Here's my reasoning: straight up on "votes", it's 7-5 delete (including nominator). But if you discount two editors who registered just for this discussion and (to their credit and honor) admitted to being SUCS members, it's 7-3. That's <i>very close</i> to being consensus right there, but not quite. So let's look at the other factors: (1) The article <i>was</i> recently nominated for AfD, and <i>did</i> survive, the closing admin finding no Delete consensus even after discounting puppets.(2) The argument that <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Cox_e02c.html" title="Alan Cox">Alan Cox</a> used the club's network for important Linux development counts for <i>something</i>. That's about it; otherwise there are no strong arguments for a Keep. That there may be articles on organizations no more notable than SUCS is not really germane; this argument is usually not strongly considered by most closers, lest Wikipedia begin a race to the bottom on notability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, (1) I found the previous nom to be so rife with puppets as to be essentially of little or no value a precedent (and thus this re-nomination is in order) and (2) the argument that the club fails <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> is a strong one, and was not really succesfully refuted either here or in the previous AfD. The club <i>does</i> fail <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, I think; the only outside reference cited in the article is a Usenet post. This in my view overrides the Alan Cox connection, which does not seem to be strong enough to carry an entire article -- it could perhaps be reduced to a sentence in the Alan Cox article.</p>
<p>On straight-up counting, I see seven editors out of (an effective) ten suggesting Delete. And I see the stronger argument (fails <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> stated and not really refuted by the Delete commentors. To me, that makes for a Delete consensus. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 19:10, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This was previously nominated, discussion is found at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Swansea_University_Computer_Society1_2cf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Swansea University Computer Society1">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Swansea University Computer Society1</a>. However, I feel that the resulting discussion was not satisfactory, there were too many newbies voting, and the discussion was not properly closed. I'd like to do this properly this time round. The first time I wrote "only have 180 members, making it non-notable. Plus, its in Swansea, which is never a good place to be!" as a reason to AFD it. Which was admittedly a little na√Øve. Now, I curtail that somewhat, my reasoning being "only have 180 members, making it non-notable". I call for a recognised responsable administator to close the debate. OK, so Deathphoenix, who closed the last discussion, fits the bill. But that may've been a mistake. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDangherous_d22f.html" title="User:Dangherous">Dangherous</a> 17:59, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Student societies <i>do</i> belong here - there is even a category for them. Other universities actually have their own society list pages in Wikipedia and yet I don't see any of them up for deletion. This deletion nomination is being driven by the same user as last time. He has brought no new arguments forward and the current number of members has nothing to do with notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> The society certainly is notable and student societies do belong in Wikipedia - why else would there be a category for them? I agree with RicDod that Wikipedia can contain much more information than a paper encyclopedia, so the notability bar should not be too high - why remove information that some people will find useful? <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFury_cebb.html" title="User:FireFury">FireFury</a></li>
<li>It's a really nicely written article, quite informative, fairly written, which is why it pains me to say <b>delete</b> because the subject is fundamentally non-notable. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 22:22, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
