<p>Neologism and Blatant Advertising Donteatyellowsnow 04:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This page is up for deletion for the reason: <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> (specialized and unclear terminology and/or misnomer) per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_neologisms" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_neologisms" rel="nofollow">Wiki criteria for deletion - neologisms</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To quote from Wiki "AVOID NEOLOGISMS": "An editor's personal observations and research (e.g. finding blogs and books that <b>use</b> the term) are <b>insufficient</b> to support use of (or articles on) neologisms because this is analysis and synthesis of primary source material (which is explicitly prohibited by the <b>original research</b> policy).</p>
<p>"To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers <b>ABOUT</b> the term — not books and papers that <b>use</b> the term. (Note that Wiktionary is not considered to be a reliable source for this purpose.)"</p>
<p>The references cited do not DEFINE the term, nor do they DISCUSS the term. Furthermore, there is no such place as "Hollywood North" and it is vague, not widely used, and undocumented and unverified exactly what "Hollywood North" is. Unlike other citys named "Moscow" or "Hollywood" it is not a specific, nor documented "place". The editors of this page have argued and fought over whether it is Vancouver, Toronto or the entire country of Canada. Again, this is vague. It is also confusing because there is a real city called <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Hollywood%2C_California_8e58.html" title="North Hollywood, California">North Hollywood, California</a> as well as an already existing <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood%2C_California_ebf3.html" title="Hollywood, California">Hollywood, California</a> and a real <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood%2C_California_ebf3.html" title="Hollywood, California">Hollywood</a> filmmaking community (which this is not) -- so it is misleading and confusing and is attempting to make contact by nefarious association with the real <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood%2C_California_ebf3.html" title="Hollywood, California">Hollywood, California</a> film community and attempting to benefit financially from it. This page also has original research as well as unverifiable and/or uncited or completely inaccurate or self-serving PR-based research and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>. It is also blatant <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertising.html" title="Advertising">advertising</a> for the Canadian film industry and various related groups and companies. If not deleted, this page should absolutely be renamed the "Canadian film industry". - Donteatyellowsnow 04:02, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It's documented and verified, the article just hasn't been verified per Wikipedia standards, and whatnot.

<li><b>Delete</b> - It is not a "documented" nor verifiable term. It has never been defined in any common form -- those from Toronto trying to claim it as well as those from Vancouver (and apparently others). The attempt to define it without appropriate sources for its definition constitutes "original research" and is not permitted. There is only one Hollywood proper and it is not in Canada. Also it is blatant advertising for the Canadian film production community and various film commissions and/or groups. 76.174.42.95 04:29, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The wording and style of the previous item by "76.174.42.95" is identical to that of User:Donteatyellowsnow. An IP address search is unable to locate a point of origin for this IP address, suggesting it originates in a corporate network rather than a nationally/state/city-identifiable locale. Given these considerations, and the various demosntrations of misleading and misrepresentative nature of Donteatyellowsnow's role in the recent history of this article, as well as the near-identical wording, a checkuser report should be filed to determine the validity of this "vote". Even though IP address "votes" are automatically discounted.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 04:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually, while IPs are discounted at RfA, they aren't at AfD. In addition, donteat could have accidentally logged out.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Very well referenced, does not read as advertising. The article <i>does</i> need some cleanup to be encyclopedic, though.

<li><b>Keep</b> - well-documented, all one has to do is listen to, watch, or read the news in Canada and elsewhere to find the term in use. Notion that a Wikipedia article will influence major Hollywood producers to film in Canada is ludicrous. Misuse of AfD process, related to edit disputes at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_North_85d8.html" title="Hollywood North">Hollywood North</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runaway_production.html" title="Runaway production">Runaway production</a>. --<b><a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i><small><sup><a href="../../../c/k/a/User_talk%7ECkatz_91bf.html" title="User talk:Ckatz"><font color="green">chat</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ckatz_cb51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz"><font color="red">spy</font></a></sub></small></i> 04:39, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is well-established term in both Canadian and American media, and has currency within the US film industry, and not just when its personnel are in Vancouver or Toronto or any other Canadian film centre; a simple Google search will find innumerable references, not all of them from Canadian points of origin; even if they were, if it were only a Canadian-only term this still doesn't not disqualify it as being of encyclopedic interest. This AFD is spurious and only the latest part of a hostile and destructive campaign by User:Donteatyellowsnow to undermine the article, which has included misrepresentations of edits and content and references placed by other editors; this campaign is in and of itself apparently a p.r. campaign and entirely self-promotional on the part of a Hollywood-industry loyalist hostile to <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runaway_production.html" title="Runaway production">Runaway productions</a> (who has also attacked the Canadian film industry in that article...)). Please note above that Donteatyellowsnow has called this AFD a "candidate for speedy deletion", which an AFD is not, although earlier tonight this user tried to place the speedy deletion template, as well as other "nuisance templates", all to advance a one-sided campaign to erase "Hollywood North" as a term from existence at all. It has over 15 years of history and a widespread literature attached to it. A literature to which Donteatyellowsnow is hostile, but which exists nonetheless, and will continue to despite Donteatyellowsnow's insistence that it be done away with.....<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 04:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I fail to see how this is a "Neologism" or "Blatant Advertising".

Also the Canadian Film Production industry is vastly more complicated than the scope of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_North_85d8.html" title="Hollywood North">Hollywood North</a>. Essencially the articles would also talk about different subjects since <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_North_85d8.html" title="Hollywood North">Hollywood North</a> mainly talks about how the term "Hollywood North" came to be and the evidence to support. While a lot of information about productions is included such as the number of productions, the article <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_production_in_Canada_261e.html" title="Film production in Canada">Film production in Canada</a> should truly talk about independent films, Canada Council, Canadian film process, IATSE, budgeting, world scope, competition with US films, etc. and not about records held by Canadian cities on a North American plane. In my opinion =). I think <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_North_85d8.html" title="Hollywood North">Hollywood North</a> is a fine article that talks about a well documented and interesting topic.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is well referenced, it is not blatant advertising. It should be kept --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgarde_770d.html" title="User:Borgarde">Borgarde</a> 09:13, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> In regards to User:Donteatyellowsnow, its nothing but <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>. I also find it relatively difficult to believe that anyone who has done any in depth reading of any of the articles, critically thinks about what they're reading, will see that such references such as the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation_65d3.html" title="Canadian Broadcasting Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a>'s article <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/07/12/bcfilm990712.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/07/12/bcfilm990712.html" rel="nofollow">Hollywood North to grow again</a> directly mentions the name, and the boost it will get from tax concessions made by <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">BC</a>'s Premier Glen Clark. Lois Siegel, award winning journalist and photography who is named in Capital City's Top 50 People by the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Citizen_8564.html" title="Ottawa Citizen">Ottawa Citizen</a> wrote, "<i>In my mind “Hollywood North” is synonymous with the phrase “runaway productions” which the new governor elect of California has sworn to terminate.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is an important, well written article that has recently received some needed edits. I firmly believe that this is a bad faith nomination (one of several) by User:Donteatyellowsnow who I believe should be blocked from Wikipedia for being a heavily biased troll. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeCee_726c.html" title="User:GeeCee">GeeCee</a> 04:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article seems to be about a phenomenon/industry which is generally known by a term that merely originated as a neologism. This is the same as <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_Valley_c36d.html" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a> or the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research_Triangle_0b1f.html" title="Research Triangle">Research Triangle</a> or for that matter the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>. I can't imagine that we wouldn't <b>keep</b> this article. Although I would take yellowsnow's suggestion and create a redirect at "Canadian film industry". --<a href="../../../j/g/g/User%7EJGGardiner_acaa.html" title="User:JGGardiner">JGGardiner</a> 02:17, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Consider moving to a more formal name such as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_film_industry.html" title="Canadian film industry">Canadian film industry</a>. A sector of the economy that's this important warrants a serious and well-rounded article. The focus on its nickname looks a bit strange. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 02:53, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b> - This page was originally about the <i>meaning of the name</i>, not about the Canadian film industry by extension, and at least by its origin it didn't include all of (as the definining characteristic of "Hollywood North" is out-of-country productions/production money, not the Canadian film industry <i>per se</i>, and as already accounted in <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinema_of_Canada_94a8.html" title="Cinema of Canada">Cinema of Canada</a> and also apparently <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_production_in_Canada_261e.html" title="Film production in Canada">Film production in Canada</a>.
