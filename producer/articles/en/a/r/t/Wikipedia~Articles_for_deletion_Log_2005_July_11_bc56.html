<li>Delete: Unlike Cabrini Green or Robert Taylor Homes, there is no indication that this particular project served any role in history, was the locus of any particular action, or is an exemplar of the misguided project mentality. The number of persons passing through it is totally irrelevant, because, by that logic, again, every pizzaria in New York City would be more "notable" than the Battle of Little Big Horn. Rather, it is the effect that a thing has had on the world, and it is that solely because that indicates the likelihood of a need for discussion and explanation and the likelihood of a term being sought by researchers. There is no rule on tenements, projects, height of buildings, etc. To suggest such is to abrogate your voting responsibilities entirely in favor of "rubber stamp" votes. Each article is an individual entity. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:12, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is not some corner pizzeria; it was a community of thousands of people.

<li>There would be an objection from me. We do not cover subdivisions, housing estates, etc. We don't do that for the rich or the poor. We only do little subdivisions of perfect homes if they have some interplay with history or the wider culture. The same should be true of tenements. Again, saying "lots of people live there" is ridiculous as a criterion for inclusion or deletion. You don't feel a sudden need to look up 225 Smith Street in Shanghai just because there might be 1,000 people there. You need to look it up if it has some significance <i>other than being a big box of people,</i> if it has some place in history or politics or literature or some other way in which it needs contextualizing. To think otherwise is to think that encyclopedias are about good and bad, that they are passing values by inclusion. Not so. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:59, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not saying it's not notable because poor people live in it. Rather, because there is no claim to notability in the article, besides simply housing a lot of people. Like Geogre said, how do these buildings affect society at large? Should I be encouraged to write articles on each dormitory complex at my university? After all, lots of people live there, even if there's virtually nothing to say about them, and certainly nothing that would be of any interest or relevance to the wider culture. We live in a world of six billion people. Allowing articles for anything that holds a couple thousand, regardless of whether anything notable ever happened there, would be like allowing an article for every street in every big city. ‚Äî <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">–õ–∏–≤–∞–π</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">‚ìâ</a> 00:26, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> How is this article different then one on public housing high rise projects built in the 1950s? Didn't they all go through the same set of problems? If so, then why is this one so unique that it is encylopedic on its own and not unreasonable to just cover it in a general topic article?

<li>It's not the number of complaints that's encyclopedic. It's the fact that this was a major community of Detroit. Eighteen 14-story buildings is a real residential neighborhood, just as real as the 13 others (<a href="../../../d/e/t/Category%7EDetroit_neighborhoods_680e.html" title="Category:Detroit neighborhoods">Category:Detroit neighborhoods</a>) we have articles on.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 05:01, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm becoming more of a rabid inclusionist every time I see a needless VfD like this one. This housing project is notable enough and an interesting part of Detroit's history, a neighborhood of sorts in its own right. Why delete it? It's a symbol of, and an important part of, Detroit's particular social culture, especially as it existed in the era of large housing projects. And it's become a cliche but for heaven's sake, repeat after me, <i>Wikipedia is not paper</i>. Edit: I've read a bit about this housing development, and have consequently added some to the article as well as added a link. Actually, this was rather a notable housing development in Detroit (uh, thirteen separate 14-story buildings; don't minimize it), and serves as a symbol of the failures of the high-rise, isolated public-housing model in American cities. There are many articles about the projects (find them on Google) and I encourage everyone to read the article linked in the article now, from the Detroit News. This isn't, as someone keeps comparing these supposedly "non-notable" VfD entries to, a random pizzeria. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 06:15, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Nothing in the article established notability. As they've been mostly destroyed, I don't see how something new could happen that would make them notable. Maybe they're still known to people from that area, but I don't see how buildings (even large ones) are automatically notable. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 14:42, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notability is a minor concern for a non-paper Wikipedia. It is not a great article, but it could, with expansion and more verifiability, be valuable to researchers. Such concerns are editorial, and not deletion criteria. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 15:03, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as unencylopedic. Nothing her or in the article has shown that this neighborhood is encylopedic. It could be mentioned in a list of failed <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> projects or maybe, if they are different enough, in a failed detroit neighborhood article. This would not be the place for a researcher to look for information, they would go to the back issues of the local newspapers. This is not the place for everything non encylopedic. For this resource to be useful there needs to be quality. Without quality articles, this wiki will die. Including articles that should not belong does not help this project. Notability is not the criteria for admission, however lack of notability is clearly a reason to not include an article. Noteable articles that are not encylopedic should be deleted. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 19:09, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I disagree. Researchers <i>will</i> look here for information on topics that are encyclopedic, even if well below the bar of notability for paper encyclopediae. It is more helpful (and absolutely NOT harmful) to have such information preserved here. This would, of course, include references to the pertinent back issues of local papers. Where there is a lack of "quality", there is an invitation to improve the article, not to axe it. --- And while I'm on it, even if I were going to give "notability" more credit as a criterion for deletion, having witnessed a consensus to <b>keep</b> a <a href="../../../e/v/e/Every_time_you_masturbate..._God_kills_a_kitten_2718.html" title="Every time you masturbate...

<li><b>Comment</b> so a bad decision can be used to justify more? The issue is encylopedic and I don't see that quality in this article. I do see it for an article about the failed housing projects of the 1950s since they all had similar histories and problems. For a project to be encylopedic on its own it would have to be rather different then a general article. I suspect that you and I would agree that some VfD votes keep moving the bar lower and that may not be a good thing if it gets too low. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 00:48, 14 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We probably would agree on some. In this case, I think a single housing project is likely to have as much verifiable, encyclopedic info as entire classes of Wikipedia entries both notable and not notable. The fact that the article does not yet contain much of it is an editorial weakness. Deletion doesn't help us. Wikipedia is blessed with the potential to become much more than a paper encyclopedia. Articles like this should be left open to encourage the development of that potential. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 03:03, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Abstain</b> Original author here... perhaps it should be deleted: ZAG is indeed a joke. I guess the question is whether the joke is widespread enough to make note here. Or perhaps just the article tone is wrong. Much like TLA and GNU, ZAG is an amusing self referential joke on the tendancy to turn everything into an acronym. I guess calling it an organization is misleading... it's just that that is the form of the joke: someone complains about acronyms, and then the jokester asks if they'd like to join the association for "zero acronym growth", or ZAG. Ha ha ha. Well, that's the deal. If it should be deleted based on that, I won't argue. If it should be modified, that sounds good too. Thanks. 05:00, , 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not familiar with vfd policies and didn't find and guideline stating if I'm allowed or not to call some users I know who may vote "keep" (some people that I met while editing Chinese philo related articles). I may explain also why I feel this article on Wenlin is usefull, notably for some other articles&#160;: explaining Chinese "concepts" in English is not simple, (typically for "things" like <a href="../../../t/a/o/Tao.html" title="Tao">Tao</a>) an usefull way to do it is to give some "etymology" of the Chinese character (even if it is sometimes useless). It give a main line and/or a start. Etymology in Chinese is often very "unprofessionnal" as everyone can see "little pictures" is characters. However, there are some serious and usefull works made on every Chinese characters internal composition and history, those of Wieger and Karlgren for instance. Wenlin is one of them (or, more accuratly, is collecting them). Then, my claim is that this article on Wenlin is valuable for <i>attributing</i> an explanation of a Chinese character. I heard that a major trend in wikipedia now is <i>cite sources</i>, and this helps a lot. BTW, I'm only a user of Wenlin, I don't work for them&#160;! <a href="../../../g/b/o/User%7EGbog_d1ca.html" title="User:Gbog">gbog</a> 02:34, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I was using the phrase "original research" as per <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">No original research</a> with regards to 'synthesizes work in a non-standard way' as well as 'introduces an original argument purporting to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position described in the article'. It, in conjunction with the other article <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a> by this same author that recently passed VfD, begin to present a disturbing trend that seems to violate <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_7923.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a soapbox">Not a soapbox</a>. Please note that the above the fold here contains, <i>"A large body of research indicates that intelligence varies between individuals and, to a lesser extent, between racial groups."</i> How is that relevant to this article? Why has the author chosen to include that? This article is well written and referenced, but that is not the criterion for inclusion. Perhaps I am being <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melodrama.html" title="Melodrama">melodramatic</a>, perhaps I'm not demonstrating <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">faith</a>.

<ul>
<li>As I saw it, the reason the reference to racial groups is made is because IQ tests seem to favor certain racial groups; thus, policy that is based on IQ scores is going to run into racial discrimination problems. I definitely think that it's POV to say "intelligence varies between racial groups," as this implies that IQ tests accurately measure intelligence, which is far from an accepted fact. But, putting POV issues aside as of course is appropriate in VfD discussion, I do believe an NPOV article on this subject is possible, just like it is possible with <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race and intelligence</a>.

<li>In what way is an article entitled Intelligence and public policy encyclopedic? I could write a huge article on the stregths and weaknesses of policy issues from government's around the world, and the intelligence involved in creating them, but that's way too broad. The title is broad and meaningless. Unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 18:01, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Your description is way too broad. The scope of the article is much narrower than your comment suggests. The article, a planned expansion of related material in other articles as indicated in the second vote above, focuses explicitly on public policies which specifically regard intelligence testing (e.g. employment law and disparate impact), intelligence measures (e.g. execution of low-IQ criminals), or correlates for which a significant and specific debate exists regarding the role of intelligence (e.g. achievement gaps and No Child Left Behind). The article's title reflects the commonly used terms; that it can be read too broadly is a common problem with titles, and misunderstanding should be quickly dispatched by the article's content, which is quite focused. --<a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrummond_f766.html" title="User:Drummond">DAD</a> <a href="../../../d/r/u/User_talk%7EDrummond_069e.html" title="User talk:Drummond"><sup>T</sup></a> 18:37, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly. The title is broad and meaningless, and so unencyclopedic, and the content POV or at best poorly mistitled, since many states do not even entertain execution and all the examples seem to be U.S. based. The content would thus still be unencyclopedic as surely it's a thesis. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 22:23, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Restriction to US is hardly grounds for deletion. Specific policies cited in the article are US-only yet have their own WP pages. "...since many states do not even entertain execution" -- this is a red herring, since the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Supreme_Court_76bb.html" title="US Supreme Court">US Supreme Court</a> ruled on the issue and created a US-wide law. "Surely its a thesis" -- given the citations, one can <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verify</a> quite easily that it's not a thesis. WP editors are invited to do so. The charge of POV is of course fair, though as many voters have noted, need for POV cleanup does not imply need for deletion. Similarly, the request for a more specific title and the vote to delete seem quite disparate. --<a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrummond_f766.html" title="User:Drummond">DAD</a> <a href="../../../d/r/u/User_talk%7EDrummond_069e.html" title="User talk:Drummond"><sup>T</sup></a> 23:23, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Try these: <i>All military recruits take the Armed Forces Qualification Test</i>, what, everywhere? and <i>The present article covers particular policies and policy areas, generally in the US</i>. A self referring article as well no less. Also, at the very least it has to be Western in bias, and therefore unencyclopedic, since the scope of the article's title will not allow anything less than a broad meaningless overview of all policies, all government and all examinations of intelligence. The only true content on this page would surely have to be something akin to <i>some people think public policy in some parts of the world is designed to discriminate in some way on the issue of intelligence, which may possibly be measured in certain ways, but then again may not, and other people may disagree, whilst in other parts of the world people don't even recognise these as issues. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 22:36, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</i>

<li>Which part of the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> does that satisfy?

<li>"The only true content on this page"...fascinating. I stipulate that the Supreme Court rulings, the discussion of disparate impact, the No Child Left Behind law, the quote from Murphy, the citations attributed to Gottfredson, the statement regarding cognitive ability testing's status as the single best predictor of job performance, the reference to the theory of situational specificity, and the statement regarding the AFQT (when properly restricted to the US military) are all <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiable</a>, among (many) others. Please, don't take my word for it; verify. Moreover, the claim that an article must cover all policies, all governments and all examinations of intelligence is pure opinion (and <i>prima facie</i> difficult to swallow, IMHO); WP policy stipulates no such thing. The article is the proper place for material on other countries' policies as well. As the article is roughly 24 hours old, it can hardly be faulted for being a bit drafty. You're invited to flesh it out -- verifiably, of course. --<a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrummond_f766.html" title="User:Drummond">DAD</a> <a href="../../../d/r/u/User_talk%7EDrummond_069e.html" title="User talk:Drummond"><sup>T</sup></a> 23:23, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course, some of these statements regardless of their verifiability need to be limited or qualified in various ways. For instance, the statement that cognitive ability testing is the single best predictor of job performance: what were the other predictors against which it was tested? Obviously, not all possible ones. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 14:12, 2005 July 12 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's true. In this case the statement is part of a direct quote. Also, similar statements appear widely in the literature (and the Hunter and Hunter paper cited is among the seminal primary references for it); the statement represents the consensus position among experts. Perhaps the tweak you're looking for is "best single predictor <i>known</i>" which for experts is perhaps implicit. For the curious (and this is not meant to be a defense of the article, only a response to the comment) cognitive ability testing has been compared to job interviews, job experience, biographical inventory, education, age, personality characteristics such as conscientiousness and agreeableness, and a host of other predictors; in most cases, and particularly for medium- to high-complexity jobs, nothing else comes close to IQ testing in <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predictive_validity.html" title="Predictive validity">predictive validity</a>. --<a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrummond_f766.html" title="User:Drummond">DAD</a> <a href="../../../d/r/u/User_talk%7EDrummond_069e.html" title="User talk:Drummond"><sup>T</sup></a> 15:42, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hi folks, I am the author of this article (and make no attempt to hide who I am as owner of the WHOIS record for CastleCops) and was on the road when I couldn't log in to my account. I apologize if it makes me a "link spammer", however that was not my intention. In the past I stumbled upon some articles like <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proxomitron.html" title="Proxomitron">Proxomitron</a>. I knew the author and he hosted the Proxomitron forum at CC. Since then I made minor modifications in the past at Wikipedia, but did not start really participating until recently when reading other articles about computer security. These articles contained links to other similar sites and thought I'd enter in CC links as well. I also noticed at least one of these similar sites had their own stub page, and figured why not put something up for CC? I have read the policies (<a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, et al) on spamming just now and <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity">Wikipedia:Vanity</a> versus <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a>. Certainly this discussion and outcome will give me a practical example of what is WP permissible. In reference to the computer security articles I have modified, yes they contained links to CC, but those links were in my humble opinion noteworthy and useful. I did add other links to Sunbelt, Spywareinfo, Microsoft, and elsewhere -- some of which were also removed by others. I will of course oblige with whatever outcome admin decides, however, I would ask that the information I added in all the articles that were reverted be inspected for importance and value. I have read many comments in the VfD log section make mention of global reach (Google, Alexa, et al), I also ask that admin query the same -- the results (at least in my very humble opinion) indicate there is no reason for me to "link spam". Rather, my intent was to offer the reader as much information as possible. Certainly, an example is <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spyware.html" title="Spyware">Spyware</a> where I added a "Research" section with links to live database lists for processes, startups, services, spyware/adware, et al. I'd hate to see useful information removed (other articles I edited, and not the topic of this discussion) just because of little ole me. Thanks for your time, I hope this answers any and all questions. <a href="../../../z/h/e/User%7EZhen-Xjell_ff28.html" title="User:Zhen-Xjell">Paul Laudanski</a> 02:51, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have gone over why your links count as link spam on both your talk page and <a href="../../../s/p/y/Talk%7ESpyware_ff76.html" title="Talk:Spyware">Talk:Spyware</a>. As for the other sites you linked to, you gave very few of them (none in equal amounts to your site's links) and, as the person who has been cleaning up the link spam, I did not delete those links. What I deleted was a bunch of additions you made in the References section of the Spyware article that looked suspect (as you added citations for them that went nowhere). -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 03:04, July 12, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thanks for your prompt reply. I have thus replied in <a href="../../../s/p/y/Talk%7ESpyware_ff76.html" title="Talk:Spyware">Talk:Spyware</a> in reference to "citations" explaining my Wiki code ignorance.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Major example, the last sentence in the community section. Not enough linking to other Wiki articles. Also, try to include factual information: who runs it, what software it runs, specific dates.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Phrases like "what is hot and what is not", "and more" usually aren't found in a neutrally written article. Some of the product namings read like name-dropping; unless you're an official site for them or they're your main focus, probably don't list them. Calling a lawsuit a SLAPP is a point of view that a lawsuit is without merit (and also if I understand correctly, no lawsuit was actually filed) -- <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainR_ad25.html" title="User:RainR">RainR</a> 01:16, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hi and thanks for the feedback. This VfD has taught me so much: I was reading some more of the Policies and Guidelines like <a href="../../../w/r/i/Wikipedia%7EWriters_rules_of_engagement_cc4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Writers rules of engagement">Wikipedia:Writers_rules_of_engagement</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome%2C_newcomers_06aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers">Wikipedia:Welcome,_newcomers</a>, and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_3717.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette">Wikipedia:Wikiquette</a> which quite amazingly are very informative and have helped me better understand WP. Hence, I want to say that it was my good faith intention to share useful and important information rather than be viewed as advertisement or spam. May I ask what your thoughts are exactly on how to make it a better article?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Existing Wikipolicy on M:tG expansions seems to be to give each their own page, as evidenced by the fact that most of them have their own articles (and at least one of those articles, the Legions page, is literally a one-line substub). In short, there's a precedent for keeping it, and while that precedent may not be smart, I don't think this is the place to overturn it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarblespire_61cf.html" title="User:Marblespire">Marblespire</a> 09:09, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Or it may give a slighlty less gigantic article. Many of the other expansion set articles have much information in them, this one, as a few of the other ones, does not.

<li>I totally don't understand what <i>point</i> this is trying to make. It doesn't really make sense (but wait, is that a <i>bureaucrat</i> who wrote it?).

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm not done developing this. Stubs aren't supposed to be deleted simply because they are short. "I'm about to use this article to make a point, er, I mean ILLUSTRATE a point." There are many ways you can simultaneously (a) do something constructive and (b) use it as an example to teach somebody. "Here, let me show you what I mean." This is the <b>opposite</b> of disrupting to make a point: it's using an example of something good to encourage others to do good. Why is this so hard to understand? BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FINISHED WRITING THE ARTICLE YET. I've been busy:

Yahoo search on "American political shift" with the quotes returns 11 hits of which 4 are Wikipedia or Wikipedia mirrors, and the other 7 have no relation at all to the definition given in the article. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">Kaibabsquirrel</a> 05:50, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>--2 reasons. First of all, this isn't an actual term used in political science or history, it's a neologism--the search engine results show this, and I've never heard it despite a political science degree and years of inspired nerdiness. Secondly, it grossly oversimplifies a hundred years of U.S. history, and is thus quite inaccurate. I would vote keep if this were a notable inaccuracy, but it is not. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 14:45, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Redirect</b>. Neither IE nor Firefox on most PCs can understand the symbol (I just see a question mark). However, if there's a relevent article, I think it should re-direct, as I can imagine other Mac users typing the symbol into the search box to see if there's a relevent article (and to test Wikipedia's capabilities). ‚Äî <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> 14:09, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This may as well stand for all the pages I nominated yesterday, for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The cards that these are written about are hardly notable. Many are not even famous within the Yu-Gi-Oh! community.</li>
<li>The old "if every card had an article..." line holds true here.</li>
<li>These articles have all been created by the same IP address. If several people made them, I could possibly accept it, but this person (or small group) have created all of these short, uninformative articles.</li>
<li>The XYZ Series already has its own article, so the following pages may as well be merged with it:
<ul>
<li>X-Head Cannon</li>
<li>XY-Dragon Cannon</li>
<li>XYZ-Dragon Cannon</li>
<li>XZ-Tank Cannon</li>
<li>Y-Dragon Head</li>
<li>YZ-Tank Dragon</li>
<li>Z-Metal Tank</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An article already exists for each set, so we could always merge some of the more useful content into those articles, eg 7 Colored Fish into <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Raiders_ea0c.html" title="Metal Raiders">Metal Raiders</a>.</li>
<li>The creator appears to be somewhat biased towards WATER- and FIRE-type monsters. If these articles remain, there should at least be an even spread over the wide variety cards that could possess their own article.</li>
<li>And finally, is it likely that Yu-Gi-Oh! fans will come to an <i>encyclopedia</i> of all places to find information on individual cards? If they are, should we begin <i>reviewing</i> cards? This appears to be the direction in which we are heading, if we do not act.</li>
</ol>
<p>I made those articles and I am willing to talk about the problem. Maybe we could work things out so it benefits both of us.</p>
<p>Talk then; I have laid out my point of view. And you should really create an account if you embark on such a courageous project. <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetokaiba_c483.html" title="User:Setokaiba">Setokaiba</a> 07:30, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This subsidiary is quite notable on its own, and keep in mind that Fortune Brands is just an umbrealla holding company. They own Tequila companies, shoe makers, office supply companies, lock makers, bathroom fixture makers, etc. Because of this weird diversity, I think it makes sense to have one article for the holding company and one for each major categorical business unit (such as Acushnet, which is the sporting goods division), and possibly even one each for the really well-known individual brands that we already have like <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titleist.html" title="Titleist">Titleist</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Beam_1ce6.html" title="Jim Beam">Jim Beam</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swingline.html" title="Swingline">Swingline</a>, and <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peachtree.html" title="Peachtree">DeKuyper</a>.

<dd>That said, at some point we need to decide if WP's main goal is to be a <b>timeless, universal encyclopedia</b>, or just a db of today's pop[mostly Western]-culture (I wouldn't be surprised if we have more articles on fictional alien races from the StarWars extended universe than real human races/languages on Earth). If it's the former, I'd like to volunteer as the first paid full-time WP editor.

<li>You seem to be assuming that real things and fictional ones are fighting over limited resources, which is not true in an unlimited electronic encyclopedia. WP should aim to be an encyclopedia of <b>all</b> culture, and western/pop culture should be kept not just on its own merits but precisely because it preserves wikipedia's potential coverage of non-western/non-popular cultures. The kids in Africa should be able to use wp to tell each other and the world about whatever songs they are listening to. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 20:05, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And how many dollars have you donated to Wikipedia to build new DB servers? And how many non-Western pop-cultural articles have you contributed to or voted to keep?

<p>I sent this to vote because the article to me doesn't say anything extra "real" about this phrase. If it's a valid phrase, then a vote shall decide, no? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares33712_1845.html" title="User:Antares33712">Antares33712</a> 21:41, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If anything, the phrase should be "I'm alright Jack" or "I'm all right Jack". However, this might be better off in Wiktionary, if that handles phrases. As it is, the article struggles to say anything of value, and the usage sentence is very contrived. The only thing that might rescue it is some etymology. <i><a href="../../../b/r/e/Brewer%27s_Dictionary_of_Phrase_and_Fable_0b5d.html" title="Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable">Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</a></i> lists it (using 'all right', along with a Naval equivalent ("Pull up the ladder, Jack, I'm inboard") and an Australian equivalent - "Jack system"). If you feel it necessary to keep, then I'd suggest that those snippets are added. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">Noisy</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">Talk</a> 17:04, Jun 25, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In the UK, it is quite normal for "alright jack" to be used to describe things other than oneself. "I'm alright jack" may have been the original example, but the phrase has migrated to become a general term, and usage as in "They don't care, it's a safe seat, the MP is alright jack" (in an informal context) is common. Hyphz</li>
<li>Wiktionary accepts articles on idioms, such as <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bob%27s_your_uncle" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:bob's_your_uncle">bob's your uncle</a>, containing etymologies, examples of their usages, and explanations of their meanings. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:42, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Very, very common British phrase of the post-war era. Perhaps should be moved to "<a href="../../../i/27/m/I%27m_All_Right_Jack_b925.html" title="I'm All Right Jack">I'm All Right Jack</a>" with a disambig to the Peter Sellers/Ian Carmichael film of the same name. The film may be slightly better known outside the UK than the phrase and I have no real opinion on how the ambiguity should be resolved except that one of them should be primary. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:10, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Comment.</b></s><b>Keep</b> and <b>Expand</b>. Actually, I'm the guy who created the article, and I tend to be a critic of Steve Bennett; I also revised the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Studio_Ironcat_9ed2.html" title="Studio Ironcat">Studio Ironcat</a> article, so trust me, it's not advertisement. I had the article stubbed, as I was trying to find some others out there who have better knowledge than I of his pre-Ironcat years (he apparently worked extensively as an animator in Japan). He is well-known (and a divisive figure) amongst the anime/manga communities, so there is a basis for his entry.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 14:31, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Okay, just revised the article. Still leaving it as a stub, since I think it can be fleshed out more, but didn't want to add too much (lest I inadvertently bias the article). A peer review on it would be appreciated. I also added the information on his newest projects.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 15:58, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I appreciate your expansion, but I still hold my original vote.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Uhg. This is a mess (or not?). Have a look at <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troubetzkoy.html" title="Troubetzkoy">Troubetzkoy</a>. Try going to any of the articles listed under the generation sections, such as <a href="../../../i/w/a/Iwan_Symeonowicz_Trubczewski_35e2.html" title="Iwan Symeonowicz Trubczewski">Iwan Symeonowicz Trubczewski</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Trubczewski_ae70.html" title="Roman Trubczewski">Roman Trubczewski</a>, and <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerzy_Trubczewski_bbea.html" title="Jerzy Trubczewski">Jerzy Trubczewski</a>. These various articles are similar to the article I've listed here for VfD. The articles contain virtually nothing but a single line indicating they are/were a prince, and a bunch of links to indicate where in the genealogical tree they lie. One, possibly more, of these people have something of interest about them in the article: <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergei_Petrovich_Troubetzkoy_1342.html" title="Sergei Petrovich Troubetzkoy">Sergei Petrovich Troubetzkoy</a> for example.

The only thing that might separate it is the fact these are nobles.

Most of these articles seem to fail <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (granted, that is a guideline, not a policy).

<li><b>Keep</b>. Don't be so hasty. Is there any point in trying a rewrite at this stage? <b>Wladimir Troubetzkoy</b> (which is the spelling you have to search for) can certainly be found in the directory of the <a href="http://www.csi.uvsq.fr/applis/annuaire/" class="external text" title="http://www.csi.uvsq.fr/applis/annuaire/" rel="nofollow">University of Versailles</a>. He is author of several books in the field of comparative literature, co-editor of a handbook and editor of a congress volume. He has also translated and edited classical Russian authors like Pushkin and Dostoyevsky. See his entry at the <a href="http://catalogue.bnf.fr/framesWEB.jsp;jsessionid=0000d7oDjgYUuJm__o3LF0W2U84:-1?host=catalogue" class="external text" title="http://catalogue.bnf.fr/framesWEB.jsp;jsessionid=0000d7oDjgYUuJm__o3LF0W2U84:-1?host=catalogue" rel="nofollow">catalogue of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France</a> I have also found a couple of articles by him referenced in different places. There are probably more of the latter, although that is more difficult to locate in a hurry. Sportspeople, cartoon artists and heavy metal guitarists are kept for fewer accomplishments than this. There are, unsurprisingly, several other members of this family who are notable in some way, such as for instance the sculptor <a href="../../../p/a/o/Paolo_Troubetzkoy_ba59.html" title="Paolo Troubetzkoy">Paolo Troubetzkoy</a>.

<li>I'll change my vote to <b>Keep</b> for this article, but still believe the entire line needs to be reviewed. Are there people in their genealogical tree worth having articles on? Absolutely. I said as much above, and still feel the same. However, I do not want to withdraw this VfD as I do think we need to rethink the various articles on members of this family who are flatly unremarkable. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> does offer some direction, as I noted above. What I am unclear on is whether there is any meta page dealing with the status of nobles, and whether just being a noble is enough to readily grant inclusion. Too many of these articles are simple one-liners, with a host of links to other people in the family tree. Can they be expanded? Maybe, but for many probably not. In the meantime I think they should be merged into the parent article. Thanks for finding the more common spelling of this individual's name Uppland! --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 16:07, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think one problem is that these silly nobility categories and nobility stubs remove the focus from the individual accomplishments of people to the genealogy.

My point is simply that Ampere does not satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> but will probably be kept, therefore, the fact that this band does not satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> does not necessarily justify a deletion. Either way I don't really care if it's deleted or not, I just think deletions should be consistent. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMidnighters_8ade.html" title="User:TheMidnighters">TheMidnighters</a> 19:20, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>My bad.

<p>The list on this page has been in the "please expand" category for over a year now. It is, as has been observed, a list of some of the dogwood family. On the <i>assumption</i> that the climate is not dissimilar to the UK it is likely that they will all grow in Denmark. However it is not a complete list of cornus, nor even a complete list of cornus that will grow in Denmark. It is certainly not a list of native cornus. On these grounds I do not see why it remains and threfore suggest it for deletion. If I have misunderstood either the methodology of a vote for deletion or the grounds that should be used, I apologise in advance. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilver149_5810.html" title="User:Silver149">Silver149</a> 16:35, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I was in a high school jazz band that was quite prominent, we even went to the same MusicFest that is the origin of the picture, its basically the Canadian nationals. We never made a wikipedia article about it, and we, and the program in our community were quite highly regarded. The problem with this type of article is that these bands can loose there notablity quite quickly. There is no reason for there to be an article on this. Many local concert bands could likely make equivalent claims. This is clearly a page made by the band itself. I recoginze the name of the fesitval at the bottom, the only reason you would have it is because you were in the band. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenw_e172.html" title="User:Benw">Benw</a> 07:39, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article seems to be just speculation, and has no basis in Greek Mythology. The original page contained some wild theories <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rod_of_rule&amp;oldid=12010345" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rod_of_rule&amp;oldid=12010345" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> which were subsequently whittled down by edits. But, to my knowledge, the whole notion that <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agamemnon.html" title="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a> had some sort of magical staff called the "rod of rule" isn't correct.

<li><b>Save</b> I just started this article and have not finished it. The company is a spinoff of Ball Corporation, and has a rich history dating back over 100 years. It started in the 1800's as a home canning company. Now it includes other 100+ year old companies like Diamond Brands matches (largest match mill in the US), and US Playing Cards. There is a lot of history here that still needs to be added to the article. I'd think once this historical content is added it will be worthwhile. --mab 15:28, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>simply the knowledge of the uses of 'hagfish slime' would be useful. perhaps changing the presentation of the article so as to imply that the findings are few would do.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I specifically wrote this article to be included on the List of U.S. Companies. There are a fairly wide variety of companies on this list, some of which are not famous.

<li>Many if not most of the companies on the list have only one notable thing about them: they are large corporations. Frankly, most are quite uninteresting. Only a very small number of the companies on the list have actually done something notable (e.g., Apple). Thanks. manatee123
<ul>
<li>Whether or not the list of companies has a bias in favor of large corporations, the fact is that it is Wikipedia policy to not include things that are not notable. Besides that, Wikipedia policy also does not allow advertising and the article is clearly written as if it were an advertisment. <a href="../../../g/w/k/User%7EGwk_0d52.html" title="User:Gwk">Gwk</a> 22:27, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>The article states basic facts and is less promotional than many of the current company sites taht are currently on Wikapedia. Very few of the companies that are currently on Wikapedia have done *anything* notable at all. The *only* thing they have in common is size. Most of them are large companies. This seems unfair that large companies -- boring ones at that -- get to have entries on Wikapedia, yet our small company cannot have an entry. manatee123

It's very hard to find out how a person is to defend themselves in Wikipedia. This may be the wrong place, and if it is I'm sorry. My name is John D Curnow and I'm not a hoax, as one person suggested. I was one of the first people to record bird songs in the midwest. My tapes were sold by the Audubon Camp here in Wisconsin. The NASCO Corp of Fort Atkins, WI sold my tapes to high schools all over the US and Canada for ten years. A copy of my book "Plant Communities - Ecological Studies Of The Upper Midwest" was copyrighted and sent to the Library Of Congress. I was also awarded the outstanding alumni award from the University Of Wisconsin-Platteville and I did teach from 1951 - 1999. I may not be important enough to be found in Google and I can accept that, but I'm certainly not a hoax! John D Curnow</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Well, it's not blank now, and Angela Jia Kim appears to be a fairly notable pianist -- she released her debut album <i>Dances and Fantasies</i> in 2003 and another one, titled <i>From Vienna To Paris</i> in January, 2005. She has won the 1997 award for Best Interpretation of French Music by the French Piano Institute in Paris, as well as the 1991 grand prize at the Mozart Festival Competition in Illinois, and she's doing a 27 concert tour of in 2004-2005 across the United States. (Or maybe she's finished already, I'm not sure.) She's most certainly notable -- she's an internationally recognized, award-winning pianist, as <a href="http://www.webconcerthall.com/interview/angelajk.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.webconcerthall.com/interview/angelajk.htm" rel="nofollow">these</a> <a href="http://www.musiciansgallery.com/start/keyboards/pianists/kim/angela-jia.html" class="external text" title="http://www.musiciansgallery.com/start/keyboards/pianists/kim/angela-jia.html" rel="nofollow">links</a> tell us.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is no big deal (although I admit I did vote keep last time). But there's also a principle here: If this <b>content</b> was <i>ever</i> encyclopedic, then it still is. Maybe we should tighten up our practice on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomena.html" title="Internet phenomena">Internet phenomena</a> generally, that would wash. But deleting an article on the grounds that it was <i>once</i> significant but isn't now is a very dangerous precedent, and that seems to be the sentiment above. The article itself might be considered a candidate for redirect and merge, just so long as the content is preserved, and the redirect makes it still accessible. But that doesn't need a VfD discussion. Food for thought? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 00:21, 14 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a big "if." It never was encyclopedic, and half of it was wrong until my recent edit. (Check out the history for references to the fictional legal battle between Awesomefunny and its "rival," Funnyawesome.) Awesomefunny is not an internet phenomenon, even if "How to Kill a Mockingbird" was. And you will notice that the HTKAM wikipedia entry has been deleted. There is no matter of dangerous precedent here. The article should be deleted, not because it was once important but is no longer popular, but because it was never important, because it is self-promotative (which it clearly is, as it contains references mailing list content), because it is unencyclopedaic. Now that HTKAM is gone, Awesomefunny should follow. <a href="../../../m/i/m/User%7EMimsy_Borogoves_513a.html" title="User:Mimsy Borogoves">Mimsy Borogoves</a> 16 July 2005 00:05 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Agree with some of this. If this survives VfD (and to me it looks close) then I'll be nominating HTKAM on VfU to make it a redirect to AwesomeFunny, I think that's the correct process and I can't see how we can have it both ways. Agree that <i>if</i> the argument is that AwesomeFunny was never really encyclopedic, then there's no dangerous precedent. But that's a big if itself considering previous Alexa rankings, surely? This is just the sort of content that it's important to preserve, otherwise it will be lost.

<dd>Comment: I think they do count, but I don't think they count for <i>much</i>. VfD is a bit different to national elections and the like, in that it's difficult to police someone creating a new userid each month, for example, and contributing (and voting) under each. So the admins in practice weight the votes in a quite subjective (and I believe intelligent, fair and reasonable) way. And it works quite well enough. Part of the theory behind this is that borderline votes like this one don't really matter a lot. The credibility and integrity of Wikipedia are not at risk at all here either way, regardless of what some may think.

<p><b>Delete</b>- Bart McQueary is all hype; an expert self promoter who's turned the non-issue that is his crusade into a newstory through irrelevant inflammation. His biggest accomplishment to date is being a part of a larger lawsuit by the ACLU against a Ten Commandments monument; but that's not even his claim to fame. His claim to fame is that he's a hanger-on to Fred Phelps; if McQueary gets a page here, then all 200-some-odd other members of Westboro, who participate in the exact same activity, also need entries.</p>

<li><b>Strong DELETE</b> He's disappeared off the face of the Earth now, and what he did while he was around was nothing to write home about, except try to (unsucessfully) emulate Fred Phelps; and it's in serious debate whether or not he event meant what he said and did. If McQueary comes back out of whatever hole he disappeared into, and does something noteworthy, ACTUALLY NOTEWORTHY, then I wil be the first to put his article back on Wiki. Until then, he's just another wannabe; does every wannabe get a page? No one outside of Harrodsburg knows who this man is, and plenty of self-gratification articles have been deleted from Wiki before. What makes Bart so special?

<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> whether or not a figure is still alive, or even around, is not an issue of noteworthiness.

<p><b>Deleyte</b> of course McQueary's "existance" as it were has no bearing on his status; Wiki is full of information on dead people. What matters, though, is that his barely noteworthy actions have apparently ceased. It may have been an excuse to keep the page going as long as he was still active, therefore prolonging the possibility that he may do something noteworthy, but now he's gone from the public eye, gone, it would seem, altogether, and he took with him any present hope of being a valid entry into Wiki. He has not affected "thousands" of people; it would be a long stretch to say that more than a few hundred people have ever been affected by him in any way, shape, or form. If McQueary is allowed to stay in Wiki, then entries must be made for every garage band that has performed at venues and has a webpage, for every independant filmmaker that has had their work shown at any festival, for every writer trying to submit their manuscript, for every person who has quarreled with the government or filed a lawsuit.70.243.35.89 22:45, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Comment</i> What is your obsession with changing my words around and trying to paint me as someone who wants McQueary deleted for intolerance? I have never stated that. One of my pride and joys on Wiki is the work I've done on the Fred Phelps page (another page you have made repeated attempts to sabotage). But the difference between a man who changed the course of history my murdering the leader of a country, and Bart McQueary, IS THAT HE HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING NOTEWORTHY AT ALL. There are people in every city in the USA standing on street corners with signs like McQueary's, preaching the same things as McQueary. Phelps belongs in the article because of his noteriety; he's been on CNN, worked with/for Al Gore, possibly was involved in a girl's death, has been the topic of a nationally read book, and, despite your fervent denial of it, leads a cult. McQueary is none of those things; he's a street-corner prophet. If McQueary is allowed to stay in, then I must insist that you restore another article of mine that you were instrumental in getting deleted, about a local band in Tulsa. They have the exact same level of noteriety as McQueary, and in the realm of music, have accomplished just as much as McQueary has in the realm of religion. Again, I say, if McQueary is allowed to stay in Wiki, then entries must be made for every garage band that has performed at venues and has a webpage, for every independant filmmaker that has had their work shown at any festival, for every writer trying to submit their manuscript, for every person who has quarreled with the government or filed a lawsuit.70.243.35.89 19:36, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, I don't feel this is the place for this type of conversation, however, you do not have a talk page, per say. I have no obsession with you nor this article. I do not mean to twist, contort, or demean your comments or vote. It "seemed" your comments were of a more personal nature, and I just wanted to stress the fact that we cannot delete articles we have personal feelings against, nor keep the ones we are in agreement with. With the little research I did on the topic of the article, it was easy to find many supporters and readers of this person. Whether or not there are "hundreds" or "thousands", it seemed he had quite a few followers and readers, with or without reguard to Fred Phelps. I fealt that the person was notable enough, for inclusion, on that basis alone. As far as your band, which I do not recall, or other garage bands. It is common not to include such bands, as they are very many, and notability seems to go hand-in-hand with recording status and the ability to cite references, other than blogs. I am no expert, I just do research to attempt to establish such, I am only one voice on Wiki. Please do not take my comments on article bias as a personal attack or reprimand, as I did not intend it that way. <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who"><font color="#FF0033">&lt;&gt;</font>Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#00FF00">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¬ø</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 19:51, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>DELETE</p>
<p>Seriously, who knows who this guy is other than the alleged terrified people of that redneck town he's plaguing? Seriously, who? (Unsigned comment)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b></p>
<p>Upon further review of the page, as well as the wikipedia deletion criteria, it is obvious that this page should be deleted- as it contains serious bias, and passive aggressive attitudes.</p>
<p><b>Weak Delete</b> In terms that this guy is just sort of an interesting figure, and there are lots of people on wikipedia who are just so of strange tangenial figures without much real purpose or accomplishment. But he is just a cultist, and not every two bit nut gets his own webpage unless he makes it himself or herself.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The precautionary principle emphasizes the potential costs of innovation, and its advocates favor pre-emptive restrictions on new technology based on the _potential_ harm that the new technology may cause. The proactionary principle emphasizes the opportunity costs of _not_ innovating, and it's advocates favor restrictions based primarily on _demonstrated_ harm. Although a neologism of relatively recent vintage, it succinctly names a large body of thought in opposition to the precautionary principle, that has heretofore, to my knowledge, gone unnamed. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrasch_08ce.html" title="User:Crasch">Crasch</a> 15:29, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
