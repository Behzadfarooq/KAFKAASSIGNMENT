<dd>I hope that the author understands, wikipedia's purpose is not to provide a forum for creating hits.

<li><b>Response</b> - Well, let me address the issues that you've brought up in regards to deleting the entry about my comic. Please understand that I'm often flip in the blog on my site. A lot of what I say there is tongue-in-cheek or exxagerated. I put Detective Fork on Wikipedia because I feel I do a good comic that has depth and will continue for some time. I thought an article on it might be of interest to people who like Web comics. I won't lie and say I mind people following the link to see the comic itself. Another thing you bring up is that there are only five forum members. The forum was put up about a week ago. I do get readers on my site but Detective Fork has a regular group of readers on DrunkDrunk.com and on JellyCreations.com. I don't know what qualifies as "notable" but just have a look at my fan art section to see that a number of people follow the comic and are inspired to do their own artwork based on it. Finally, is it against Wikipedia policy to write an article on something you created? I'm not promoting the hell out of the comic, just providing info on the characters and stories. I sense your decision to delete the article is based more on a dislike of me from what I wrote in my blog and on a perception that Detective Fork is not important enough, not from hard criteria. Would you consider keeping the entry if perhaps I change something about the article you don't like? Please work with me here.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I put Detective Fork up for deletion because it hardly has any readers, gaining no Alexa rank at all. What makes your website more notable than every other website out there? It may have a core few fans, but so does every other website in the world. My decision to nominate articles on deletion have nothing to do with feelings towards the author at all, although I must say, placing a link from <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cutlery.html" title="Cutlery">Cutlery</a> was a bit cheeky. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 21:42, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - That's the point I was making earlier. Detective Fork has a good number of readers from being posted and seen on other sites. You can't judge the readership just by the hits on detectivefork.com. My site is the best resource for the comic, however, and that's why I posted that link. And the Wikipedia entry is for the comic itself, not just the Web page. The reviews I'm given by readers compliment the comic's originality. It was also a nominee for "Best Anthropomorphic Comic" in this year's Web Cartoonists Choice awards. Does Detective Fork get Penny Arcade numbers? No way. But neither do other Web comics you have listed. Looking back, yes, the cutlery thing was a combination of cheek and bad judgement. - DetectiveFork 22:10, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. In regards to the alternate proposal for posting Web comics, I have met the 33 week minimum. I am about a month shy of having 100 comics up. The entry was posted by me but I do not in it wax on about how great my comic is. It is factual. Let me refer you to the part of the guidelines that says, "Remember, however, that these are merely guidelines. Sites that are close to, but still under, these thresholds may also be included on the basis that webcomics customarily grow in size and have a higher likelihood of increasing in readership and, thus, becoming encyclopedic." It all depends on how strict you feel like being, seeing as they are guidelines and not strict rules, after all.</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> - I have nothing against your webcomic, I know you want to see it succeed, but Wikipedia should not be used as a promotional tool. You seen to have a pretty good sense of humour about you, and you've not spammed this nomination with constant numerous keep votes. But the problem with the guidelines at <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> is that they are way too lax, there are some webcomic articles on wikipedia which are even more unnotable than your one, that's true. But we will get round to reviewing them, it is because of the overly lax guidelines that so many have been let in unchallenged. But the reason for my nomination still stands, I don't see anything which lifts your website apart from any other out there. Also, did you know that there is a Wiki for comics? Yours is <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Detective_Fork" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Detective_Fork" rel="nofollow">already there</a>, and it's a great place for it. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 02:27, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> I had seen the listing on Comixpedia, which seemed to show up there automatically after placing the article here. Are you saying that the listing on Comixpedia would remain even if this one is deleted? Also, I acknowledge that the job you've undertaken is to keep Wikipedia credible and that, although the guidelines aren't concrete, most of you have a belief about what the qualifications of a webcomic should be. I don't seem to have won anybody over with my arguments so far and, while I hope they do, the outlook on the Magic 8 Ball is grim. If the entry is deleted, I can only hope my comic gets the kind of hits someday that earns itself back an entry and inspires someone else to pen it. I understand even Penny Arcade started small...DetectiveFork 07:46, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> - It will stay on Comixpedia, where you can add and edit it. When it does gain a popularity and widespread recognition, you can migrate it back over. - 83.151.204.235 14:46, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
