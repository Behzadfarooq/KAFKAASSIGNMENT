<li>I am the artist and I added the art after I received the request. My art is very dear to me and it is all privately held, I do not sell my art so it is rarely shown in the public (the sale of art is the common reason for a living persons art being displayed and few galleries show art that provides them with no profit). I do not hold the same level of fame as someone like Picasso or Pissarro and I fully understand if my work is not appropriate for your listings. I thank you for the time each of you invested in this. Perhaps it will be a better fit at a later date.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Looking at a few articles from a Google search, it seems that the term has indeed entered the political vernacular in the UK and in the US (at least within the white house itself). The page could easily be expanded by providing brief chronological actions taken by the EU 3 and their repercussions, as well as comparing the common goals and interests of the member nations. The article needs expansion, and I believe it to be a valid topic. <a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 00:54, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> I think that phrase <i>is</i> commonly used. I'm not sure I'd call it a neologism though. At the worst you could accuse this of being a dictdef and you might have a point but I disagree that there's no room for it to grow. For instance it could be extremely interesting if someone were able to trace how this informal group happened to form. I don't know and I'd certainly welcome an explanation. For instance, Germany's involvement in military affairs was pretty much unthinkable before reunification. It's yet another attempt by European countries to form some sort of coherent counterweight to the US in foreign affairs and should be documented as such. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 00:54, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Never heard of it. EU politics is a constant circle of blocks forming and breaking-up over different policies.

<li><b>Comment</b> for the record I strongly disagree with the above four comments. As I tried to explain in my keep opinion, there is probably a lot to say about this subject. I also suggest that anyone who "has never heard of it" is watching too much of CNN and FoxNews and not reading enough of <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Monde_6137.html" title="Le Monde">Le Monde</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankfurter_Allgemeine_Zeitung_3701.html" title="Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</a> or foreign policy publications. The fact that "EU politics is a constant circle of blocks forming and breaking-up over different policies" is certainly the American point of view on the EU but it is debatable at best and even if that's the case, then isn't it precisely Wikipedia's role to document how and why these blocks and circles form and evolve? Note also that the merge to <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> is most certainly not an option as that page is already too long and not at all focused on such issues. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 16:43, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't get CNN and FoxNews where I live. Neither do I read French or German newspapers, as they are not written in English. As an UK citizen living in the Netherlands I would say that the average man on the street would not be familiar with the <i>EU three</i>. It certainly has not entered the political vernacular in the UK. Either way the article needs to be rewritten to make clear that the phrase relates to the three countries recent policy towards Iran and not EU politics in general or renamed. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 19:40, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> well this Google search for instance shows that however informal the group may be, the term "EU three" is in wide use even in the english media. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=+iran&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Recherche+Google&amp;as_epq=EU+three+&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=+iran&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Recherche+Google&amp;as_epq=EU+three+&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> I still think a lot can be said about the subject.

<li>The google search above demonstrates more that the term is Iran policy wonk jargon that has occassionally strayed into press reports than wide use in the english media.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>: this term is a journalistic neologism used in the context of the nuclear talks with Iran. Since these talks include other non-European nations (eg, the USA), and those three countries generally act in concert <b>in the context of those talks</b>, it is convenient to refer to them as "the EU three". For example: «the US is calling for an ultimatum, while the "EU three" prefer to continue the talks without setting a deadline». However, this is only valid within the context of this specific international crisis; in other instances, those countries can easily be on opposing sides (see, for example, their stance on the Iraq war), and within other groups, you can have an "EU three" or "EU four" or "EU five" consisting of different countries, depending on the situation. 82.55.199.200 14:26, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not contesting that it is a convenient term and not much else. However it seems like a particularly good encyclopedia topic. Would you also recommend deleting the article "Collaboration of Germany, United Kingdom and France during the Iran nuclear crisis of 2005-2006"? I think "EU three" is just a convenient title for that article and one that is likely to be a search by users. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 20:32, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Extra comment</b> I'm not sure why I'm fighting for this but I do think that the delete opinions expressed here are too weak. The fact that the common man has not heard the term is not an argument for deletion, especially since the common man doesn't read the foreign affairs section of his newspaper. I am certain that people who have followed closely the negotiations with Iran have heard the term or at lest recognize this group of countries to have had a particular, coherent role in this affair. In any case, this debate has focused on the notability of the term when in fact it should focus on the wisdom of keeping the content of the article. I think the content is uncontroversially valuable and we can always move the page to another article. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 21:03, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I dont like this: "especially since the common man doesn't read the foreign affairs section of his newspaper". All the more so because as with your other assumptions - that those who vote Delete live in the USA and only see US TV - you are mistaken. (I know that in my own case I have voted for delete because I have NOT previously encountered the term and I DO read both politics and EU matters in newspapers and on the internet. I also watch French mainstream TV and listen to France Inter. And I have heard no mention of the 'EU Three'. Consequently whilst I dont doubt that you have encountered the term I do doubt that it is both widespread and of note/significance). So please, no more assumptions about what others do or do not do. That is not the way to "win" an argument. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 19:08, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I meant no disrespect to you or, God forbid, the common man. But it's not uncommon for Wikipedia articles to be about little known things and the fact that 90% of people have not heard the term is beyond the point: it does not resolve the basic question of whether or not this is an encyclopedic topic. And I will say again that the debate should not be about the prevalence of the term but about the value of the content of the article. Certainly the history of this alliance would be an interesting contribution to the project. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 22:51, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I fail to understand why naysayers wish to delete this article. It is a fair, brief, objective description of a household name within American education circles, particularly conservative ones. Teach For America is the premier teacher training programs in the nation, and Kaplowitz's story represents the zeitgast of its failure. Moreover, Kaplowitz' later article was widely read and cited around the country, including articles in the National Review and Wall Street Journal. If you feel the article is incomplete, by all means expand it. But it is censorship to delete it without rational explanation. First off the "notability" criteria is not official Wikipedia policy; even if it were this entry would qualify under 4 different notability headings: newsworthiness, published and widely cited and reviewed, and a strong local character.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Dellis21 (<a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDellis21_3b9b.html" title="User talk:Dellis21">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dellis21_9d55.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dellis21">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> both. Jon Finkel is the subject of a book published by Random House: I will admit, his article needs to be refocused, since he is now much more well-known for his poker accomplishments than his M:TG ones. And while we're at it, there's no new reason here (or in the speedy kept debate) for deletion other than notability, which was adequately settled in the first debate. Kai Budde meets the WP:BIO criteria. There are plenty of sources out there on him; see <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1411666798&amp;id=yTPvW4r3kQsC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22Kai+Budde%22&amp;sig=5j6eyd2XVN8HNfQ8rNHx44_y27c" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1411666798&amp;id=yTPvW4r3kQsC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22Kai+Budde%22&amp;sig=5j6eyd2XVN8HNfQ8rNHx44_y27c" rel="nofollow">this</a> for instance, which is a published book, that describes Kai as "the best player in the world as of this writing." Lots of columns published on the Wizards site too. If it needs better sourcing, it should be fixed, not deleted. Let me add: under consideration, I don't think MTG or other CCG (or, really, any non-mainstream sport) competitors should automatically become notable for being in a professional league: I wouldn't think that EVERY professional tournament player would deserve an article. However, both Finkel and Budde could be considered "other professionals whose work is widely recognized and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record in their field", and both have been the subject of multiple MTG-related columns, and most importantly, WP:BIO is not intended to be exclusionary. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:13, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As this article stands, it does not meet the criteria at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and badly needs sourcing. Sources should be included in the article, not the AfD debate. It takes a very broad interpretation to fit these subjects under the category of "athlete." The first bullet was not intended for participants in a leisure activity; it would require another broad interpretation, this time of "field." It does bring into question the inclusion of articles on poker players, champion backgammon players, chess grandmssters, and any other indoor game of skill; and Nlu does bring up a good point of where we draw the line at inclusion of champions of a particular activity. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> draws a fine line, and I could see an argument for broadening the notability criteria to include champions of popular activities.

<li><b>Additional Comment</b> If a verifiable citation of a reliable third-party source can be included in the articles outside of an article by WOTC for the purpose of demonstrating the subjects are "widely recognized" as performing at the highest level, I could be persuaded to change my position on CCG players inclusion.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I stop short - but <i>just</i> short - of agreeing that this a bad faith nomination, but I have big problems with nom's handling of this issue. There are venues on Wikipedia to argue for the general non-notability of CCG players (although given that there are articles on world-class chess, poker, backgammon and Scrabble players, it's a crock), but an ambush AfD of a World Champion in a professional circuit is certainly not one. And winning "only" $300,000 isn't notable?

<li>I would imagine that he would be featured in numerous trading card game magazines, websites, forums (not quite as 'professional', but still a form of notability) and from ESPN2 when MTG championships were shown.<a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 13:58, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your inline link is really a press release from WOTC republished on that site. The problem with citations from WOTC is that they are the makers of the product and would naturally want to hype it through a large tournament. It doesn't demonstrate that the event's participants are "widely recognized."

<ul>
<li>And what you're doing now is being argumentative for the sake of being argumentative. Are you genuinely suggesting that a former World Champion and the lifetime career earnings leader in a game's pro circuit is not notable within that field? (If so, could you tell us what within that field you <i>do</i> consider notable?) You could, with just as much justification, claim that the notability of many prominent scientists only stems from scientific journals and thus aren't "widely recognized." <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:29, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A line still has to be drawn somewhere on notability within profession -- depending on what that profession is and whether that profession is itself notable. I'm sure that there are professions for which even the most notable people within the profession can be agreed on as being not sufficiently notable overall to be included. The question is whether professional Magic-playing is such a profession. I think it is. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 16:52, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>If the line is drawn here, then we might as well delete all the players of any CCG, as well as a good chunk of Scrabble, dominoes, and other "traditional" game champions. As stated, Kai is the winningest player of the game ever. He will get in the game's Hall of Fame on the first ballot (he's not eligible yet), and the only other player of the game that even comes close to him in notability is Jon Finkel. To be less argumentative, my line is drawn at Hall of Fame members, World Champions, and players who are notable in other fields (like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Williams_%28card_player%29_98ff.html" title="David Williams (card player)">David Williams</a>). -- <a href="../../../i/l/g/User%7EIlGreven_50ab.html" title="User:IlGreven">Grev</a> 18:16, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>They still have to meet the criteria of being "widely recognized." Promotion by WOTC doesn't cut it as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. This is because coverage by WOTC is inherently unobjective; they want these people to seem notable.

<ul>
<li>Two things: (1) WOTC employs semi-independent columnists. Sure, they write about and promote MTG, but I see no reason to doubt their authority when they describe someone as a prominent player. (2) I'd stop pushing the point about WOTC and independence. You've made your point, clearly and cogently.

<p>I entirely agree with the summations posted. The band has no notability nor sufficient prominence to be included in this encyclopedia and like many aspiring bands are merely trying to use this site as a vehicle for publicity. I eagerly await their swift removal, so that we can all get on with our lives, and so that they too can join the pioneers of indie such as Art Brut, Hefner and let's not forget the not forgotten Special Needs (now renamed The Needs) who rose to success through the notoriety of obscurity.. rock on! The band definately exist though and it's not a hoax.. I promise</p>

<p>The Stormfront (website) wikipedia article has been embroiled in a massive edit war for several days. I uncovered evidence of sock puppetry/meat puppetry on a massive scale (see below). The editors continue to scrap other editors' contributions, including one with 11 cites that was claimed to be inappropriate due to "original research".</p>
<p>The article is, in my opinion, essentially being used as an extension of the Stormfront forums. There is only the weakest form of criticism permitted in the article. It has the look of a recruiting tool for the 'organization' including a link to a page where donations can be made.</p>
<p>The editors continue to reinsert a link to a donations page on the Stormfront website. There is no indication that Stormfront is a non-profit organization, a status that must be applied for and must meet rigorous requirements including rigid tax reporting requirements and fiscal spending constraints. At least, no one has alleged that it has such status and it is extremely doubtful that such an 'organization' would qualify.</p>
<p>The Stormfront forum also contains a post to recruit editors to 'keep an eye on' the Stormfront article dated September 14th: <a href="http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:seUEv9D__TQJ:www.stormfront.org/forum/showthread.php" class="external free" title="http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:seUEv9D__TQJ:www.stormfront.org/forum/showthread.php" rel="nofollow">http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:seUEv9D__TQJ:www.stormfront.org/forum/showthread.php</a></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm not sure if I get a vote or not since I posted the tag, but... As for notability - I also believe the article should be deleted on that basis. Its 'notability' appears to stem merely from a concerted attack on a tv news dial in vote on whether or not people would want a segregated prom. Ironically, people solicited voters on the Stormfront website and stuffed the ballot box so that the results were not announced and Stormfront was named as the culprit. One or two pranks doesn't seem to satisfy notability. It seems that most of the articles that are cited that are alleged to be about Stormfront are actually about Don Black.

<dd>That something is a cliche in another media/genre (and may well be mentioned in an article about that media/genre, or cliches in it) actually helps convince me that it should be included. See for example <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction_themes.html" title="Science fiction themes">Science fiction themes</a>. As to technological restrictions, in fact I was actually thinking that that explanation should be included in the article (when I saw the 255 and 65535 I thought to myself, that I really should explain the memory issues behind htat). As for existing in the Real World, that too doesn't bother me, as the character of an inclusion can be relevant. Once again, see SFT. Clones exist in the real world, yes, and even Robots. But the issues brought up in Science Fiction about them are still important. Video Games being a different and less communicative media may not have the same depth of meaning (and due to their relative newness have a lot less depth of research and respectiiblity), but that doesn't mean they don't have any, or that expanding it is not a good idea. That said, if you care to name a suggested wiki to move it to, I'll be glad to support it. I'd look, but you seem more involved in the situation, so you might remember something from past discussions. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 06:01, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, if most of the cliches in the list apply to all media forms, what's the point of having a seperate article on one for video games? Also, it isn't considered a cliche if it's unintentional, such as due to technological restrictions. After all, note that a cliche is defined as "a phrase, expression, or idea that has been overused to the point of losing its <i>intended</i> force or novelty". This also applies to things that exist commmonly in real life, which are seen in video games due to common sense, not for an intended force or novelty. As for a good wiki to transwiki it to, I reccommend Encyclopedia Gamia.--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 07:23, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because computers and video games are a seperate and distinct media, that often have their own genres which are not directly comparable to the genres in say books and film, that's why. It's a question of presentation, they are different enough that they can't be linked. Your objections as to whether or not any particular thing constitute a cliche more properly belong in a discussion about the article, not in a VfD, but I note that if you examine the various entries under cliches (like the Doctor Who cliches, cliches in animation, and probably others), you'll find many of the same things. So you may have a lot of work to do. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:53, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And since you brought up EG, if you want to make the transfers, and get a consensus agreement on that, it would seem to qualify, but you'll have to check with its members to see if they'll accept the concept. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:57, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>AfD is defined as a place for "Wikipedians discuss whether an article should be deleted". I feel that the article should be deleted since <i>all</i> of the listed cliches are technically <i>not</i> cliches, thus AfD is a perfect place for it to be discussed. Also, you don't need the consent of Encyclopedia Gamia to tranwiki an article there, since they are a wiki as well.--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 19:49, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, the reason that articles like Doctor Who cliches and cliches in animation exist, is that there are cliches that are specific to that series/genre, whereas this article is simply listing cliches that have existed in <i>all</i> forms of media, such as Area 51, jungle, grassland, etc. settings.--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 19:55, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm afraid I can't concur with you that all of the items are not cliches, as I've read more than a few articles which mention those things. Sorry, not sufficient. And note, cliches in animation is as specific a genre as video and computer games, in fact, there are some overlaps with the two. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:21, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Though I do respect your opinions, if there really are "a few articles which mention those things", then why haven't you referenced them in the article? Also, if the cliches of animation and other forms of media "overlap" with video games, then what's the point of having a seperate article for video game cliches?--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 05:19, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> What I find funny is that you could have asked for it to be moved without an AfD, why did you chose to go about it this way and not ask the people who have contributed to the article to move it, and maybe even started a discussion on the WikiProject CVG page?

<dd><b>Comment</b> Though I admit that transwiki'ing is certaintly a possibily, I'm personally advocating for the page to be <i>deleted</i>. Also, as I've stated before, I feel that the article <i>can't</i> be cleaned up since so much of the article is original research, that if the original research were to be removed, the article wouldn't have enough content to merit either a seperate article or stub.

<dd>Maybe I didn't make myself clear, why did you not start a discussion before you put it up for deletion? Going around deleting things is bad practice, specially for the people who have worked on said article. Starting a dialog and trying to come to an agreement first might be the best way to handle such matters. Example, like I stated, you could have asked for it to be moved to another Wiki and forgo the AfD all together. You had several choices in the matter, and you chose to AfD it and at the same time step on the toes of the editors behind the article. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 07:25, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. While the stereotypes/cliches listed do exist in the real world and other forms of media (why this makes them not cliches I do not know), there are definitely unique things that can be said of them and their significance to video games in particular. The way something like a Lava World or Ice World setting is used in a video game (and the rapid juxtaposition of these things as video game levels) clearly differs from the cliched use of a Lava World or Ice World as literary settings, and they are probably far less recognised as cliches there as well. The article rambles and probably needs cleaning up (as you said) but I'm not convinced this isn't a good starting point. And again, the fact that there are tropical islands in the real world, and as the settings for many things, does not mean you can't say anything about it with regards to its use in video games as the typical brightly coloured first level, etc. Do you think this article would be valid if it looked at typical literary settings and the devices each tended to use? Despite the possibly large number shared settings that that article would have with one like this, the discussion in an article like that would differ greatly from one like this simply because they ARE different media and the settings clearly have vastly different uses for them. Being stuck on a glacier in a video game means you probably carry a lot of momentum when you move which makes comlex platform jumping much more difficult. It means something very different in a movie or a novel. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERankler_6eec.html" title="User:Rankler">Rankler</a> 15:31, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> An article on or list of cliches in film and fiction is hardly comparable. People have written books and articles, made TV programmes, and given courses on those topics. They are not original research. The only sources for this article, on the other hand, were the observations of the editors. If and when someone writes about this in a reliable, then there should be an article on WP, but not before. Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought and this article contains nothing else. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 14:05, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

(2) But why do we have to have a seperate list for them? Can't we keep information on technical restrictions in the articles on games in which they occur?

<dd>Answer to #3 is simple - rename the page, perhaps to 'Typical computer and video game settings' or something. One can easily fold in reason #2 within it, explain that these come about due to technical restrictions. Also, I think a major point of this is not just that they exist, but are often "within the game world" bizzaringly in proxminity. As for #1, well, if you can't see why then you're probably not going to be convinced. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelodia_4ad5.html" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a> 12:52, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. As an actual gamer, I can recognise many of these level types, and I certainly would consider them to be clichés. The article lists common types of obstacle or enemy found in several of the levels, which are clichés. The article also describes many things that have nothing to do with technical restrictions and are largely exclusive to video games - for example, shops where the proprietor charges someone for items necessary to save the world, lava that collects in pools and doesn't harm those who approach it, and fire-based weaponry that continues to work underwater. The lack of citations is certainly a problem, but I'm sure it could be overcome with careful research. Actually, I don't see why the games themselves can't be cited as evidence. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbieG_0f97.html" title="User:RobbieG">RobbieG</a> 15:35, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Since I was the one who had originally prod'd the article, I must outline my reasons more specifically here. The article tries to list families belonging to the <a href="../../../e/z/h/Ezhava.html" title="Ezhava">Ezhava</a> caste of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>. There are thousands of such families in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, and hence it is totally un-encyclopedic to have such a listing. The references given does not substantiate the claims, hence the article fails on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiablity</a> too.

<li>It's probably hazardous to even begin to comment on this without a background on the subject, but I feel it worth pointing out that there are hundreds of pages on Wikipedia that serve the sole purpose of being redlink graveyards for caste family names.

<dd>No, it just happens to be that current events are, by virtue of current news reporting, much easier to research. It just happens to be that researching old world events needs some extra work, but when it comes to current events, everyone's practically dumping references here with a wheelbarrow, because there's a lot of stuff, easy to find. It would make it a lot easier to research, say, the beginning of World War 1, if all of a sudden, half of Internet-based newspapers screamed "that one guy shot the other guy" and reported on all fascinating details of the case, don't you think?

<dd>Nope, there is no policy or guideline here... I can completely see why you initiated this AfD. in practice though, physical places like cities, towns, etc, usually get kept. As far as neighborhoods, it gets a bit murkier as you start to get into "what defines a neighborhood". I only speak for myself, but personally I have no problem with a "neighborhood" article as long as it can be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliably sourced</a> that a specific area of a city is refered to by a specific name.

<li><b>Keep the Data</b>, although you should probably rename this article, or redistribute into sections of similar relations (all the temperatures in one table, for example).

<li><b>Keep</b> — Part of a limited, interesting and encyclopedic set of articles on orders of magnitude. Wikipedia is not paper. These articles are also being used for article links in places.

<li><s><b>Delete</b> - I went ahead and merged all of the articles' info into the main one; the 1 E2 K article in particular had a lot more detail and was already tabulated nicely (unlike the others, which are mostly a couple of lines each), so I just made a new section for it and copied the whole table over; seemed like the easiest way to do it.

<li>Okay, as <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> pointed out to me, there are a lot of articles linking in to these "1 Ex K" pages, so I think it makes more sense to <b>Redirect</b> all of them to <a href="../../../o/r/d/Orders_of_magnitude_%28temperature%29.html" title="Orders of magnitude (temperature)">Orders of magnitude (temperature)</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> per Valarauka. The information seems more useful if collected together.

<li><b>Keep and Rename</b> as above 1 E2 K is a strangely cryptic title. I don't really have a clear idea what the new title should be, but all of the similar 1 Ex K pages should probably be renamed in a standard manner. Perhaps "Temperatures from 100 to 1000 Kelvin" or something readable like that. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool3_2ec0.html" title="User:Cool3">Cool3</a> 19:59, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a significant event in Michigan. It receives many more hits on ASK.COM than the Soccer and Rowing tournament.</p>
<p>The last comment was mine, but I've signed in now. I'd also like to point out that the article does not fall into any of the categories identified in "What Wikipedia is not."

<p>Non-notable place. Couldn't find a single Google reference to this name or its alternate Kuntayithode. Since no references are cited, I suspect that this article violates the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy. <a href="../../../s/u/t/User%7ESuttungr_f732.html" title="User:Suttungr">Suttungr</a> 12:32, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The article should be kept. Google gave you no results merely because there is no standardisation about transliterating Malayalam words or names in English. You can google Kundayithode and find at least a dozen references. There is nothing original about it and that will be later made clear. As such I can only cite certain research papers and that will be done shortly. A word about Google Fallacy: Search kozhikoad on Google and tell me how many results you get. That was how Calicut or Kozhikode or Kozhikkode or Kozhikkot was spelt for more than a century when Kozhikode Taluk was referred to. <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKuntan_2339.html" title="User:Kuntan">Kuntan</a> 13:28, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Then can you give us the Malayalam script and some sources for it? They can be book sources too and someone can verify them.

<li>"Any place that exists" doesn't work. Notability is not a blanket. The patch of grassland to the side of my house exists, and I can point to government documents that are authoritative on the subject. It doesn't deserve an encyclopaedia article.

<li><b>Question</b> The article says something about "After devastation by the flood many archeological objects which lay buried for centuries came out. The maritime artifacts suggested the existence of a busy port there." Which flood is this referring to? Earlier in the article a flood in 1963 is mentioned, but this quote is from an entierly different paragraph. I <i>suspect</i>, but am not certian that the flood this referrs to might be the 2004 tsunami, in which case I wonder if the place this article is talking about is the "lost city" exposed by the 2004 tsunami mentioned in <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg18524883.800" class="external text" title="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg18524883.800" rel="nofollow">this article</a>?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am a very strong follower of the religion "Elliottism". I find it insulting when members from other religions question our faith and what we believe in. Elliottism has been kept quiet for many years. It isn't a world wide religion, but now Elliott and his followers have decided we should try and make it worldwide.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.70.133.87 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.70.133.87_516a.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.70.133.87">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - We have over 200 hundred members of Elliottism and we wanted to let other people know about the interesting rituals we perform . Seeing as Wikepedia is used to find out about many different religions and cultures we thought it would be acceptable to inform people of the goings on in our Town. We do not wish to upset, insult or force anybody to join our religion.
<p>We just want to let people who view Wikepedia to find out interesting things that happen around our area.

<li><b>Wait!</b> - There was no vanity in the attribution. I agree that WP is not a dictionary. While it may have been coined by a few stoners one day (several years ago), the phrase has since been used far and wide, and I hope to expand the meaning of this very soon. If possible, I would appreciate if some time could be given for this expansion, before reconsideration of deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b> because the museum is unique since most Orthodox Jews do not visit secular museums - yet this one has the approval of being "<a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosher.html" title="Kosher">kosher</a>" for Haredi Jews to go to. It's located in the largest American <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haredi_Judaism_f269.html" title="Haredi Judaism">Haredi</a> community of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boro_Park_08f8.html" title="Boro Park">Boro Park</a> where tens of thousands of Haredi Jews live. Many of the most prominent rabbis in this community have come to the museum and praised it. It contains mostly archaelogical artifacts from Biblical times and often serves as a hands-on experience for many subjects studied in the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> on a theoretical level. The rabbi who runs it, Rabbi Shaul Deutsch (and it is not a "crime" to be red-linked on Wikipedia as far as I know), also writes a weekly lengthy column about the subjects in the museum in the American <i>Modia</i> newspaper (which in itself would make him notable in many Haredi circles and always remember: <b>notability is relative</b>), a widely-read Haredi weekly read in Brooklyn and beyond. Google <i>alone</i> is no way to judge issues and subjects of importance to Haredi Jews, and how else is the world going to learn about Haredi Jews if articles about such things will be wiped off the map as illustrated by <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a>'s comments. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 02:26, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> My Heroes of Destiny books are self-published and they are not available on Amazon; they are only and exclusively available from my official website: www.kevinwong.ca . That is why you didn't see any "hits" on Amazon for "Heroes of Destiny" or "Kevin Wong". "Non-notable" - who determines what is notable? You? (Whoever you are)? Just because I wrote what I - Kevin Wong - genuinely believe and am about, and hence my books are about too, does not make me vain. Just because I started two Wikipedia pages about me and my books does not make me vain; I only wanted to START them. My fans and future fans - clearly none of which are you, the posters above, and the admin / editors who harrassed or even prematurely deleted my entries - will maintain them from this point forward. Thus far, I have unfortunately only encountered regarding my entries the following people: the people who have harrassed or insulted me to this point; the people who have shown blatant disregard towards me and my books; and, last - but certainly not least - the people who have exercised a complete abuse of power by deleting my Wikipedia pages MULTIPLE times - without ever reading them even ONCE as far as I am concerned. Wikipedia is a place of knowledge and learning. I am trying to get people to know and learn about me and my books. But as is often the case with computers - and some unfortunate souls sitting in front of them - they get pleasure from causing other people pain. Even if you delete my entries now, in time, you will all eventually have to allow them, because I - Kevin Wong - and my books - Heroes of Destiny - will be too famous and too successful to deny. It's just a matter of time, and it's just a personal question of whether you want to be my enemy, or my friend. I'd rather the latter, but I've dealt with my fair share of enemies before, and if I have to here too, then fine; this comment of mine here is my side of the story - and my half of the battle. But ultimately - far beyond this inane discussion - me and my books becoming successful is all that will matter; and when - not if - this happens, I have to admit, it will be even sweeter if I did it in SPITE of today's events - not because of them. I've said what I had to say. Do as you will.

<li><b>reply</b> Notability of a person is based on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and the fact that you are self-publishing the books weighs against you, as the popularity of your books is probably small. This has nothing to do with the quality of your books. Adding in that you are writing the articles yourself, which violates <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAuto_aa00.html" title="WP:Auto">WP:Auto</a> and you have a poor case. If you wish to get people to know about you and your books there are better ways. Send your books to reviewers at major sites. Advertise in the right forums. If that succeeds, then you can certainly be included in Wikipedia, and I hope you don't feel any rancor about it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:39, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It seems that you have taken the deletion debate very personally. I assure you, this is nothing personal (around 1000 entries on Wikipedia are up for deletion at any one time, and we have no time to hate them all.) We just have policies for what articles are allowed on Wikipedia, based on the <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia:Five pillars</a>. The fact that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia (a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>) and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> means that there can be no <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. That means that everything has to be sourced with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable third-party sources</a>, like newspapers, magazines, reviews, etc. This has nothing to do with how the quality of your work, it's just that there are no sources in the article about this book (it seems that the Daily News, a paper in Halifax, has written a review, but I have no idea what the review is about or if the review has been grouped in with other books.) In summary, please read all the policies I've listed to get more of an idea about Wikipedia and why the policies are in place. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 17:28, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This was a notable event, receiving world-wide news coverage over a span of days.

<dd>Yeah, but the nightly news still runs pieces about cold season and flu vaccines, and even though a Bonner County Idaho brown-out is a news item, it does not make any of the three (in addition to the subject of this AfD) notable or encyclopedic. Further, the common cold kills more people each year than blackouts...doesn't make it any more or less notable. In all actuality, the reasons aren't absurd, they're rather apt. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 04:43, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A brownout is a deliberate voltage reduction, typically 2.5% or 5%, done by a utility to reduce line loading and maintain service when the demand exceeds the supply of electricity. Our utility does that to us on about every hot day, but it is not much of a news item, and those without voltmeters are unlikely to notice it. A blackout is a prolonged failure to supply any electricity to a large area, resulting in people trapped in elevators, fire pumps not working, food and medicine spoiled, possible looting due to lack of night-time lighting in urban areas. When it occurs in a large city, it make worldwide news until restored. I do not see the logic of comparing a blackout to someone with the sniffles. There are dozens of articles on every known infectious disease. So what?

<p>Firstly there is no such thing as a shared universe for all characters in the comic 2000ad - It's an anthology comic where links between comics are the exception rather than the rule. The major exceptions to this are the various spin offs of Judge Dredd, which could probably be the basis for a Judge Dredd Universe article, and those of Pat Mills, who liked to join his stories together and then roped in Judge Dredd as well. In addition there are a few stories which spin off from other stories (such as Strontium Dog spawning Durham Red), but that would be better dealt with by the main articles for the stories and a few one off crossovers. There is no overall 'shared universe' or 'shared timeline' and the various stories often completely contradict each other.</p>
<p>I don't believs this is correctable within the article and so the article should be deleted. I considered puttuing in a bunch of qualifiers but that would make the whole thing into an essay (which it leans towards anyway) and would at any rate would be contradicted by the title.</p>
<p>Secondly, and probably more importantly in wiki-terms, finding joins between these stories and trying to fit them together as a shared universe and a shared timeline consititute original research. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">Artw</a> 16:54, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> There is a large central section to the timeline which is rock solid part of a shared universe (from Bill Savage to Hammerstein to Dredd and back to Hammerstein again, with various time travelling excursions stretching things forward and backwards in time) and other stories have interwoven with this (some have even been tweaked at a later date so that they fit better within the same shared Universe but that is a clear sign that there is such a thing as a 2000 AD Universe). As in the <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Universe_3c38.html" title="DC Universe">DC Universe</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Universe_3203.html" title="Marvel Universe">Marvel Universe</a> entries there is a core timeline with other elements from parallel univserses which is a similar situation to the one we hav here. I'm unsure how to address the original research accusation - the information is in the stories so does reading the stories count as original research? I'd have thought it was more a rather important prerequisite. (<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> 21:55, 19 September 2006 (UTC))</li>

<dd>The existence of the storylines and characters isn't original research, but the argument that they are connected (making up a single "universe") appears to be.

<dd>The work that's been going on on the 2000AD entries has been uniformly superb. However, I have to say I agree that this article seems to contradict <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> guidelines. Despite a small handful of crossovers, most (all?) involving the comic's central character Judge Dredd, the idea of a shared 2000AD universe on the same lines as the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Universe_3203.html" title="Marvel Universe">Marvel Universe</a> is certainly not widely accepted by the comic's editors or writers (which is why the title doesn't have wank like <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_Crisis_5b73.html" title="Infinite Crisis">Infinite Crisis</a>). Although many stories do have dates attached, there is no sense of continuity between events - so Scotland, for example, can be destroyed in Dredd, and be just fine for the later Strontium Dog. <s>For all of which reason, I vote to <b>delete</b></s>. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 22:40, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep:</b> <i>Firstly,</i> the article does not suggest that <i>all</i> of the stories in 2000 AD are connected, just a good proportion of them, and there are many more of these than just those involving Judge Dredd. It does not really advance the case for deletion very far to say that one writer, Pat Mills, was responsible for most of this, because his contribution to the comic has been massive, and the series which are connected to each other are all major ones. When you consider that Dredd, Strontium Dog, Flesh, Nemesis, ABC Warriors, Rogue Trooper, Harlem Heroes and Invasion/Savage are all explicitly linked to each other -- and I haven't even mentioned their respective spin-offs, like Durham Red or Anderson Psi -- this is just as valid a subject for an article (provided it is not original research) as the Marvel Universe, as long as this article makes it clear that it does not encompass every story in 2000 AD. (Of course, I agree that speculation about how stories might fit together should certainly be avoided, so the "Smithiverse" entry should be separated from the main part of the article and should have its own section at the bottom. Any other speculation needs to be either verified or removed.)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Secondly,</i> this is only original research to the extent that the article speculates or hypothesises about how stories might fit together but where the evidence is thin or non-existent, eg. the paragraph about the "Smithiverse" -- anything which can be called "suppositions about possible connections". Things like this should of course be edited out. However, there are many crossover stories in which the characters from respective series have actually met each other, and I don't mean (for example) that Judge Dredd has met Judge Anderson. I mean that Dredd has met Rogue Trooper, the Harlem Heroes and Strontium Dog, for example, all of which were original series, not spin-offs from one source strip. So to describe this as "original research" is simply to deny objective and verifiable facts. Arguing that there is <i>not</i> a shared Universe because Scotland was destroyed in one story and then was OK in another story comes much much closer to constituting original research than merely pointing out that Dredd and Johnny Alpha have met each other twice. Using facts to propose a theory is original research, but merely collecting uncontroversial and indisputable facts in the same place for ease of reference is not -- and splitting everything into lots of separate article would just make it hard to follow.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>To conclude:</i> This article could use some further editing to address the issues raised by Artw, but I do not accept that the identified problems are not even correctable, and that the only possible solution is to delete and to "throw the baby out with the bathwater." No thought at all seems to have gone into how the article could be edited to resolve these points: just a knee-jerk reaction to delete at once. (I am not suggesting bad faith, just impetuousness.) I will have a go myself in a day or two (no time tonight).
<ul>
<li>It needs to make completely clear, if it does not already (I think it does, IMHO), that the 2000 AD Universe does not include all stories, but that the quantity and significance / endurance of the stories it does include make the Universe notable enough to warrant an article.</li>
<li>It needs to be confined to stories with clear and unambiguous links to each other. Where there are two universes with no clear connections between them, this should be made plain, and they should be under separate sub-headings to avoid confusion.</li>
<li>The References section should (if it doesn't already, I haven't checked) list each story which explicitly ties one series to another.</li>
<li>The article as a whole should distinguish which stories are spin-offs from another story (eg. Judge Anderson from Judge Dredd) and which stories began independently form each other and were later tied together (eg. Nemesis and Flesh).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I think that the intercompany crossovers section is worth keeping regardless.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the input. I suppose it depends on where the line is drawn on original research. If it is suggested that this could be the core of a Judge Dredd Universe entry then the main part sof this are deemed OK and the problem is with my clumsy introduction which attempted to put it in context (the mentions of the Smithiverse and Rogiverse are largely to say it is unclear how they fit in - not as an attempt to fit them in). However, a Judge Dredd Universe timeline would basically include much of what is already there due to a number of characters overlapping providing continuity over long stretches of time (Savage, Hammerstein, the Giant family, Dredd, etc.) and wouldn't be a Judge Dredd Universe timeline it would be a timeline covering the core of the 2000 AD Universe which brings us back to where we are. I do agree that a lot of this sounds like grounds for heavy edititng and clarification not for deletion and that is why I've been trying to get as much input on this as possible and it has imporved and I was confident it could have been improved further with further input.

<dd>What you shouldn't be doing is advancing your own arguments, even if you are qualifying them with "probably" or "seems" etc. (that, in fact, makes it worse) or drawing your own conclusions from existing sources. I'm currently of the opinion it should be deleted because the timeline is an amalgam of different sources which purports to represent an established timeline referenced in the comic, but with no evidence that it is anything other than your interpretation; the first section consists of possibilities and references to other established universes which does nothing to advance the argument for the article; and the crossovers section is just that: a section on crossovers, rather than providing evidence of a 2000 AD Universe (although that probably comes closest to establishing a basis for the article's existence). I'm not saying it can't be saved, since I don't think notability is a problem here, but you'd essentially be starting a new article under a different title. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 01:25, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The rewrite still doesn't address the central problem of verifying the existence of a 2000 AD Universe. Right now that argument is still <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. You need to provide a third party source that argues for the existence of the concept. I suggested to <a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> that this be rewritten from a crossover perceptive (as the comics themselves provide the sources in that case), and I still think that is the best idea. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 14:44, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Even though it only covers the central period of the timeline it shows the existence on one continuous timeline covering at least 4 different sets of stories (Invasion/Savage, ABC Warriors, Judge Dredd and Strontium Dog) not including the Helter Skelter event. There has also been at least one other longer timeline which has formed the basis of the current Origins story (hence the hat tip at the start of the story). The fact that there are some continuity errors is down to them <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retconning</a> originally distinct stories into the main 2000 AD Universe (as with Strontium Dog appearances - as time travel technology is used it is clear they don't just don't exist in parallel universes but on the same timeline) - this is actually a sign they are now considered to exist in the same universe. I wouldn't 100% object to it being moved to 2000 AD Crossovers (or some such) but the fact is that some of the things there don't exist as crossovers but as the history of other stories (I'm thinking of Invasion/Savage which shows the first stages of the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volgans.html" title="Volgans">Volgan War</a> and the ABC Warriors show the end of the war and then mainly through <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammerstein_%28robot%29.html" title="Hammerstein (robot)">Hammerstein</a> carry on through the Judge Dredd era to the far future and including <a href="../../../n/e/m/Nemesis_the_Warlock_85ac.html" title="Nemesis the Warlock">Nemesis the Warlock</a>.

The <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#Primary_and_secondary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> page says: <i>"Wikipedia articles include material on the basis of verifiability, not truth. That is, we report what other reliable sources have published, whether or not we regard the material as accurate".</i> Whether you agree that the fans are right or wrong is outside the scope of Wikipedia's responsiblity, as long as it's verifiable. Secondary sources are actually preferable: <i>"most articles should rely predominantly on secondary sources".</i> The external sources are enough to make this source-based research rather than original research.</dd>
<dd>Also I can not see any significant distinction between a "2000 AD universe" and a "Judge Dredd universe with non-Dredd stories integrated in" (to paraphrase). It's a secondary source which illustrates how some Dredd and non-Dredd stories relate to each other chronologically, and for the stories to appear in the same history/timeline then they have to exist in the same universe. As for the Dredd timeline only covering the middle part of the bigger 2000AD timeline, that is dealt with by the information on Hammerstein. In short, this article does not postulate some new and innovative theory that has never been described before, it just reports on an already existing idea discussed outside Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard75_cb86.html" title="User:Richard75">Richard75</a> 18:06, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Those articles only back up your ideas if, as you say, there is no difference between there being a "2000ad Universe" and "Judge Dredd universe with non-Dredd stories integrated in". I'd argue that theres a huge degree of difference there, and also that an article defining the term "2000ad universe" as "Judge Dredd universe with non-Dredd stories integrated in" would violate <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> - check out the low number of GHits on the term. Conspicuously the current article doesn't stop there, and that's were the bulk of the OR comes in.</dd>
<dd>Also by citing fan created sources the article risks becoming an OR compendium of fancruft, which would be further reason to delete it. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">Artw</a> 19:01, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But the entry doesn't say anymore than those sources - a number of 2000 AD stories exist on the same timeline (Invasion, ABC Warriors, Judge Dredd, Strontium Dog and Nemesis the Warlock) and a number of others have interacted with this core as parallel universes. That's not original research that is a fact - its all there in the comics. Also as you've suggested it could form a Judge Dredd Universe and Yomangani and Vizjim have suggested it might work better as "2000 AD Crossovers" (although I highlight problems with that above) it suggests to me the issue is with the wording and the focus (and possibly the title) which is an issue for debate rather than deletion. (<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> 11:29, 24 September 2006 (UTC))
<dl>
<dd>Possibly moving it to "2000 AD shared timeline" might solve the problem? That doesn't posit the existence of a universe per se, and seems supported by the sources. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 12:16, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not unreasonable but some of the crossovers take place with parallel dimensions (thanks to the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Judges_6a5e.html" title="Dark Judges">Dark Judges</a> and their dimension jumping technology. I'm still unsure what is controversial about a number of 2000 AD stories occupying the same universe along a timeline which interacts with other stories in parallel universes. Its all there in the comics and isn't based on guesswork. Although there is a <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Universe_3c38.html" title="DC Universe">DC Universe</a> and a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Universe_3203.html" title="Marvel Universe">Marvel Universe</a> this doesn't imply all DC or Marvel stories share that universe - some exist on a general timeline (e.g., from say the Justice Society to the Legion of Superheroes), others interact with this core from parallel universes, some stories are completely separate and some others are of unknown relation to the main "spine" (although one suspects they might try and retcon some into it at some point). All of which exists in the 2000 AD Universe. It may be the article needs its focus shifting to emphasise this but in all this I haven't actually heard an arguement explaining why someone doesn't think such a thing actually exists. (<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> 13:56, 24 September 2006 (UTC))
<dl>
<dd>I actually wouldn't mind moving it to "2000 AD crossovers", because it's a broader title, and this would mean that the sections on intercompnay crossovers and John Smith stories would be more relevant. I don't think we can fairly say that Batman, Lobo, Aliens and Predator are part of a "2000 AD universe" because they are not 2000 AD stories, and we have already conceded that Smith's stories are not necessarily crossovers with the others. I doubt that it would be enough to satisfy Artw (unless we removed the timeline, which I am loathe to do and I do not believe is necessary), but it would help to build a consensus. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard75_cb86.html" title="User:Richard75">Richard75</a> 16:41, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of all the moving/renaming solutions its crossovers that sounds the best one - my main concerns are that it doesn't really include Invasion/Savage (although one could suggest that the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volgans.html" title="Volgans">Volgans</a> provide the crossover) and that a number of important events from the Judge Dredd part of the timeline would need removing (although again as so much is crossover material most of it can stay). If a better solution presents itself we can always move it again but as things stand that seems the best solution on the table at the moment.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I know nothing about these particular comics and I found the article through the AfD listing. It appears you folks are really into these, like others are into Marvel. Keep in mind that WP is for the masses, not for experts. The article seems to provide quite a bit of information for someone not familiar with the topic and per above it does rely on sources. If there is some debate about whether particular stories are part of the timeline, the appropriate thing to do is point that out in a section of the article, not delete the article.
<ul>
<li>I do suggest renaming the article. Judging from the name alone I thought it might have something to do with physics or history. <b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickReinckens_8aaa.html" title="User:RickReinckens">RickReinckens</a> 05:21, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</b></li>

<li>Changing my vote in light of the arguments above to <b>Keep and rename</b> as 2000AD crossovers. Maybe a separate Judge Dredd timeline article as well? <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 07:30, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I've missed the main bulk of this disccussion but the article should be kept. In the early days of 2000AD the intention was always to have a shared universe for some of their stories. As has been pointed out, there's numerous examples of this throughout the comics histroy going right back to 1977. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogan1138_186c.html" title="User:Logan1138">Logan1138</a> 15:00, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can't believe you guys would want to delete this page. It's brillant and it also defines a term widely used on forums and other bulletien boards. While the term is rather new it is catching like wild fire. To attempt to put it out would be silly and absolutly pointless because there is not enough water to extinguish this flame.

<li>Your second and third links are "media reprints of press releases", which are expressly disqualified by the passage in question, and the fourth link does not qualify as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. The first article is legitimate, but too brief to be of much value, as it contains only two sentences. The revised Hoovers link (thank you for fixing it) seems to describe the parent company Marlyn Nutraceticals, rather than the subsidiary which is the subject of the article. I also believe that you are misinterpreting clause 2 of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> as applied to the Hoovers profile, as that section is meant to apply to printed statements of being "the Nth-largest manufacturer of Commodity X", or the "Nth-largest company in Country Y". There are more than 18 million company profiles in the Hoovers database, and as such, the distinction is not a particularly exclusive one. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 22:10, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

In regards to the link indicating that Marlyn Nutraceuticals received the Arizona Association of Industries Manufacturer of the Year award, AAI only publishes the most recent year. This year Intel and Armor Works were the recipients. While yes, the press release was generated by Marlyn, the award was provided by AAI and can be verified by contacting them. <a href="http://www.naturalproductsmarketplace.com/articles/571news.html" class="external text" title="http://www.naturalproductsmarketplace.com/articles/571news.html" rel="nofollow">Here is another link, not Marlyn's press release but a mention in a 3rd party publication regarding the same award</a></dd>

<dd>In response to the point 2 in the Criteria for Companies and Corporations, the criteria is that the company is "listed" in the ranking indices. Hoovers by it's nature is a ranking index and Marlyn is listed. Where a company falls within the listing or the number of companies in the index are not stated in Point 2, and I consequently I feel your point that Hoover's has 18 million companies listed is irrelevant. Please understand, I get your point, it's just not part of the criteria listed in WP:CORP.<small>—comment <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">added</a> by</small> Mrenzyme<sup>(<b>t</b>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mrenzyme_02f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mrenzyme"><b>c</b></a>)</sup>

<li>You are correct in your assumption about link one and four; apologies for getting my wires crossed.

NutraIngredients-USA.com is not peer-reviewed, it is not produced by an well-known independently-published journalist, its articles do not cite their own sources, and the degree and quality of editorial oversight are unclear. As such, it doesn't meet our guidelines for sources. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 13:39, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok, I don't have any more arguments. Y'all are toughies.&#160;:) but I appreciate your purpose. Let me pose a question...I have noticed other companies in the nutraceutical market that have listings on Wikipedia. It appears they are listed in food-company-stub. Is it appropriate for the Naturally Vitamins page to be moved into that section? <small>—comment <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">added</a> by</small> Mrenzyme<sup>(<b>t</b>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mrenzyme_02f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mrenzyme"><b>c</b></a>)</sup></li>
<li>Generally speaking, an article's categorization has no real effect on an AFD discussion; it's basically just an internal filing system. That said, it's certainly possible that the articles for some of those companies don't belong on Wikipedia either, and you're welcome to list them here for discussion if you feel that is the case. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 03:04, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I generally agree with that sentiment, and you seem to make a good argument for notability. Are you interested in expanding the article? Also, the "Muslim feminist cowgirl" thing sounded like a joke or something to me, so I wondered if the article was a serious entry. Also, 2 of the 3 links referenced in the article point to external pieces highly critical of her; I wonder if the article has an NPOV.--<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliga10_0ee9.html" title="User:Caliga10">Caliga10</a> 13:25, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. The creator and principal defender of this article has been blocked for some pretty vitrolic personal attacks, so I will summarise his arguments: (1) Some people choose to write 'American' as ethnic group in the United States Census (2) there are articles on WP about hyphenated Americans (3) The people who write American are clearly descendants of the original colonists, and deserve their own article (4) Those who disagree fall into three mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories a.Liberals with White Guilt b.Hyphenated Americans who dont understand what it is to be American and c.Communist Europeans. (This is not an exaggeration.) The article as its stands is therefore pretty OR and quite unbelievable (the districts with majority "American" respondents are mainly in the rural South, and there are no citations explaining why this is so, for example, and how it squares with the assertion that ethnic Americans came over before 1776). Its unsalvageable, and should go. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 20:24, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>One should also note that many of the 7.2% who marked "American" as their ethnicity on the Census are also "hyphenated Americans" as many are likely to be European-Americans (the descendants of European settlers) as well.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I guess that there are no ethnic groups and no races, because we all came from somewhere else and intermixed with others. This becomes moot, even though there are articles for other ethnic groups and hyphenated (immigrant) Americans. How you fail to see the difference between original people and subsequent additives, is beyond me. The barbarians who came to Rome may have assimilated to Roman culture and took Roman wives, but were not the Roman people themselves who founded Rome. Do you not understand such a comparison? The mere fact that the Trojans (or Greeks) were originally squatters on Etruscan (ooh, Indians--anybody?) land does not nullify the concept of a Roman people, as they were established in existence. There is no regard for traditional thinking in Wikipedia--you lot are actively hostile to the recognition of the New World's version of the Roman experience with all the parallels before you and admitted in common discourse. I guess I may have to phone up my Appalachian-based American grandma of mostly Virginia descent to inform her that she doesn't exist. <i>Our</i> ideals are "gone with the wind", which you are apparently blowing to knock our house down. It is you who have no perspective on the American experience. My coworkers agree with my every argument and supplement with their own personal experiences of abuse at ignorant godchilds like yourselves. Their heritage likewise dates to the colonists who fought in the Revolution to define their future and give you the place to bash them for it, as you are doing now by dismissing their existence. Know then, what stereotypical portrayals of Americans come from and why. George Bush's cowboy image is only one of the original American getups that we have--another is the planter and another is the mountain-man. I and all patriotic Americans would object to you categorizing George Washington as a British or English American. He was the Father of my country and all the ethnic colonial intermixture is encompassed within the American identity, but the Dutch and Germans strangely have chosen to identify with their previous roots as if Romans thought of themselves not as Romans but still as Trojans (what Trojan Empire?!). Ask any pro-American history buff, or military re-enactors of past wars and any soldier who bears the American flag. Don't tread on me. You are bringing the conflict onto one who never thought it possible that there could be this convergence of ignorance in one place and one time, with regards to American history!

<li><b>Neutral</b> (closing admin, please do not count this vote) The comparison to Rome has some validity. The United States census bureau does list this as an ethnic identity, although it provides no definition for what it would mean and its staticstic represents self-selection. I suspect this deletion nomination has a good deal to do with one disruptive editor's attempt to own the article and conduct original research.

<dd>Actually editors could expand it to state that this is a self-identified group and a newly created census category. Interested editors might seek news reports about the new category.

<dd>Agreed with RandomP. I think this bit of info from the Census bureau is very enlightening. "What does the Census Bureau mean by the term ancestry? Ancestry refers to a person’s ethnic origin or descent, "roots," or heritage, or the place of birth of the person or the person’s parents or ancestors <b>before their arrival in the United States</b>" (bolding mine).<a href="http://www.census.gov/population/www/anc-faq.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.census.gov/population/www/anc-faq.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> Also, <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/socdemo/ancestry/c2kquest10.gif" class="external text" title="http://www.census.gov/population/socdemo/ancestry/c2kquest10.gif" rel="nofollow">here</a> is the actual question from the 2000 census. My point is that it's still OR, no matter how you slice it, to say that there is somehow an American ethnic group based on the census. Even the census' definition of the term precludes the existence of an American ethnic group. This conversation might seem a bit silly a century from now, but for now, it's original research to claim that there is such an ethnic group. · <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">j e r s y k o</font></a> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 14:35, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Besdies often people mark American as their ethnic group becuase they may not know their actual ancestry, becuase it doesn't fit into the box, becuase their of multiple ancestries and they just chose to simplify things by stating American or becuase of any othe reason you can think of. It is quite similar to an "decline to state" or "I don't know answer." Bottom line is that we only have one sentence of info about this people which is too little to justify an article especially as we have an article on demographics in the United States.

<li><b>Keep</b> The current version has been stubbed down to the verifiable content - the census results and the map thereof. Based on the history, the article may need policing to ensure rigorous use of reliable sources. But there is a legitimate, sourced phenomenon here. What, if anything, it means would be speculation on my part, as I haven't done any research. (Given my involvement in my family's genealogy, I'm not surprised that a significant fraction are not identifying any particular source of immigration from outside the U.S. - we can't say where my wife's ancestry comes from, and what we know of mine includes most European countries west of Russia that don't border the Med, plus some Native American tribes.) JASpencer didn't make it clear above, but the OR was eliminated within the article even before it was nominated for deletion. I got the opposite impression reading the discussion, which makes me wonder if the discussers were looking at the version nominated for deletion or just remembering the material purged from the article prior to nomination. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 14:25, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Exactely, we would need to move this stub to "2000 US Census Respondents who stated "American" to be part of their ancestry." Also, the fact that 7.2% of Americans reported "American" as their ancestry is already mention in other demographic articles.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Could someone do me the favor of pointing out where in the wikipedia policies it says that non-mainstream/pseudo science are criteria for deletion? If this is the case, then <a href="../../../h/o/x/Hoxsey_method.html" title="Hoxsey method">Hoxsey method</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Beach_Diet_383f.html" title="South Beach Diet">South Beach Diet</a>, and a billion other documented alternative therapy are going to need nomination, too. Probiotic research is more mainstream than most alternative theories on good health. That notwithstanding, I feel like all of the various articles started by this editor would probably do better as maybe 2-3 total articles on the topics (e.g. <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufficient_causes.html" title="Sufficient causes">Sufficient causes</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disease_Causal_Chain_ef31.html" title="Disease Causal Chain">Disease Causal Chain</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Component_causes.html" title="Component causes">Component causes</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defining_the_diseases.html" title="Defining the diseases">Defining the diseases</a>, and <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_morbidities.html" title="Multiple morbidities">Multiple morbidities</a> would probably make a single good article...under Disease Causal Chain, maybe).

<dd>I originally responded to your first comment. Regarding the second half of your comments, I agree with you that some of the articles that the author has created are legitimate terms; my objection is that they are all solely framed within a Probiotic perspective (and I also agree that some of them do not merit their own article; <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_morbidities.html" title="Multiple morbidities">Multiple morbidities</a>, for example, is probably not expandable to anything more than a dictdef. <b><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">OhNo<font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font></a> <a href="../../../o/h/n/User_talk%7EOhnoitsjamie_2359.html" title="User talk:Ohnoitsjamie"><sup>Talk</sup></a></b> 20:53, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, that's understandable, although if an article is solely framed from a single PoV, it seems {{pov}} would be more appropriate than deletion. I'm also just not thrilled about the irrelevance and bias that a deletion reason of "probiotic claptrap" followed up with "delete as pseudoscience" and "delete other contributions although some fit mainstream science" give to the discussion. None of those three comments are justification for deletion...improvement, to be sure, but not necessarily deletion. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 21:02, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When I write probiotic claptrap, I mean just that. If you believe that an article exists that reads, in full "the <b>Human Microbial Organ</b> is what a finge of pseudoscientists insists on calling a Human in an attempt to dupe unknowing sick people into giving them money," I am happy to have that article. <a href="../../../j/b/k/User%7EJBKramer_42bf.html" title="User:JBKramer">JBKramer</a> 17:58, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>If at any time you took a moment to read anything written about this writer, you would not make that statement. A semi knowledgable person just has to google him to see his contribution to this type of media. Wereas, I googled you.... found nothing. I am not trying to say that you are not who and what you claim to be, that would be assuming and pretentious.</p>
<p>For a " Non-notable graffiti artist", he has been in the NY Times, in several on-line and off line magazines. In serveral documentaries and most recently, his artwork appeared in an internationally published Blackbook. And low and behold, all of this information is verifiable.</p>
<p>I intially created the page under a different username. As a new member, I was unaware of how to go about posting the article using PRIZ-ONE as the subject. I then created this username, not only to post the article the way I wanted it to be seen, but also to ensure that no one else had the username.</p>

<p>In reading your debate as whether to keep or delete this article, I have noted that the search criteria used by |Erechtheus]] was made in error. If you remove the "" you will find a much more larger search result.</p>
<p>The search I found at <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=graffiti+PRIZ&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=graffiti+PRIZ&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">various results</a> came up with a much larger result. As to the content being in the correct catagory, I am writing about a graff writer who has some notability. As explained previously, I am planning on expanding on the article to make it a much better bio than it is a the moment. My main concern was to clean it up by Wikipedia standards. Before any further debate, please view the search result I have listed so that a more consise determination is made. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPRIZ-ONE_39a5.html" title="User:PRIZ-ONE">PRIZ-ONE</a> 19:48, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm a bit puzzled by your comment above. I wouldn't terribly mind merging (I'd prefer deletion). Once a few people have already suggested merge it is well within the closing admins discretion to count merges as keeps for the general purpose of keeping the content so your above change doesn't do anything. If you are actually of the opinion that this should be merged then say so but "voting" to cancel out another user's comment is not a logical procedure. AfD is not a vote. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:33, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think it <i>should</i> be merged, I voted to merge in a spirit of compromise. That was obviously a mistake. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 03:18, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Two comments: first, if you think something should be actually kept it is best to say so. We aren't going to have any productive dialogue over these issues if people don't at minimum say what they are thinking. Similarly, if you don't say something like "I'd like to keep but merging is a reasonable compromise" then no one knows that you are saying merge as a way to compromise. It is unreasonable to accuse someone of a "brutal rejection of compromise" when they have no idea a compromise has been proposed. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:27, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Voting to delete when there are keep votes and merge is possible is always rejection of compromise. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:06, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Um, no it isn't. Merging is a valid solution it isn't necessarily a "compromise" some people actually prefer merging. And in any event as I pointed out such dialogue is only productive when people actually give their opinions. If you want to keep it you should say something like "I would favor keeping, but I'm willing to merge" which indicates a compromise offer. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:08, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into district article. Not clear that there is enough out there to expand this into an improved article. A four-child school would be ridiculous and would not merit a Wikipedia article in most cases. But a school with a dozen or more students passes my test.

<li><b>Keep</b> This legend is as valid as any other and while the victim wishes to remain anonymous, a first-hand account does exist. If anything this story carries more validity than any other urban legend, or suburban legend, because it is known to be true. As far as its importance to culture and Wikipedia, it merely serves to spread knowledge and keep the story straight, just as any current written record of mythology does. jic26
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Wikipedia is not the place for this story to establish any legacy. This project relies on appropriate secondary sources and bans original research.

<li><b>Keep</b> I would like to point out that this is basically the same as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Aristocrats_9241.html" title="The Aristocrats">The Aristocrats</a> joke, except that it's better known because of the movie by the same title. If this sourcing issue had been around before the movie came out, there would be a bunch of people on this site who would find it irrelevent and frivolous. By having it deleted, we are stifling free speech and possibly stopping another <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristocrats.html" title="Aristocrats">Aristocrats</a> from coming into being. The fact is, there is an oral tradition that exists and is constantly propagating. The unfortunate side effect of an oral tradition is that it doesn't strictly conform to sourcing. tarzanman21

<li><b>Comment</b> The article says "The telling of the story has become an artform for those who know it, much like the Aristocrats joke." tarzanman21 says "I would like to point out that this is basically the same as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Aristocrats_9241.html" title="The Aristocrats">The Aristocrats</a> joke, except that it's better known because of the movie by the same title." Exactly right. That's precisely why this article should be deleted. We need an article about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Aristocrats_9241.html" title="The Aristocrats">The Aristocrats</a> joke <i>because</i> of the movie about it. When someone releases a documentary featuring a dozen different comics each telling "The Jolly Rancher Story," we <i>should</i> have an article about it. Even if there is no movie about it, if someone has <i>a verifiable source</i> saying that this story is well known and the telling of it has become an art form among professional comedians, we should have an article about it. If it's just another dirty story, we shouldn't. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:57, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> I think the reliable source code for wikipedia must be updated for cases of urban legend. When it comes down to it, there is no "reliable" information out there that can confirm an urban legends "urban" status. By its very nature, urban legends are spread by word of mouth. Therefore, blogs, discussion board posts and the like should be considered an acceptable source.[tarzanman21]
<ul>
<li>The other alternative is that Wikipedia is not the place for listing urban myths that have not been documented by appropriate secondary sources. Wikipedia never claimed to be the place for urban myths. I have struck your "keep" under this bullet because you have expressed your "keep" opinion above. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 04:37, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Though I will say the line <i>"After some hot n' heavy foreplay that lasted for a good 15 minutes..."</i> got a laugh out of the wife reading over the shoulder. Apparently that is a "typical male assumption" of a good length of foreplay. Personally, I thought he was holding out.&#160;:p <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 10:38, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Even if the story were not true, it would still be a common myth/urban legend among college and high school students. Although the story has not grown enough to be nationally or even universally recognized, a great deal of people do know this story. A third party source may not exist as of yet, but the story still remains in circulation. Too keep it on wikipedia would allow for a more recognition of the story and spread its information. To delete it because of a lack of sources seems hippocritical to wikipedia's main goal of being an encyclopedia and allowing people to share and add articles. If sourcing was that vital to the wikipedia project, then every single sentence in all 1,383,000 articles would have to have a source and also be verified. Why even bother writing articles on wikipedia if we could just list hotlinked sources for each topic? If this article is deleted you are witholding information, sourceable or not, and this seems to be the polar opposite of what wikipedia is all about. bfkiesel

<li>If something isn't notable enough right now, and needs Wikipedia to make it notable, then it's not fit to be on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I've spent a little time trying to revise and condense sections of the Euro article, so I'm fairly familiar with it. This list offers no additional insight not already provided in the Euro article. All of the positives are covered at much greater length in the Euro article excepting perhaps #4, which is not an argument for the Euro so much as a statement of fact. Similarly, argument against #2 is dubious given that it could plausibly appear in the "arguments for" section with very little rewording. Anyway, there's nothing here that hasn't been explored at greater length elsewhere. Jelklan 17:06, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article appears to be a possible hoax, and was (mostly?) the work of one editor, who is now permabanned from WP. The consensus of virtually all others on the Talk page was to start a new page of Opposition to the theory of relativity, where possibly some material can be lifted from this article. At this point in time, the only activity on this page is the repeated attempts by the permabanned editor to edit it under multiple anon socks. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 20:48, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. As an editor who spent some time dealing with this page (and as a PhD student in particle physics), I am quite confident that the only way to make it usable would be a complete rewrite, as Crumb375 states above. Since nobody has time to do this, I think the article should be deleted. In principle, if it turned out some material from it was useful for a rewrite in the future, undeletion is easy to do. However, to keep the article in its present form for an extended period is to misinform our readers. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 20:56, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
<dd>I could be (and have been) accused of being "biased" in favor of mainstream physics, but presumably I cannot be accused of not knowing a good deal about relativistic physics or <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/RelWWW/wrong.html" class="external text" title="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/RelWWW/wrong.html" rel="nofollow">fringe physics</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let's get one thing out of the way right away: the article in question and other edits by KraMuc (or his many sockpuppets and IP anons) expresses a <i>tiny, tiny minority view which is about as contrary to well-established science as can be imagined</i>. Relativity is one of the best-tested scientific theories of all time; there simply is no such subject as <i>"modern Galilean relativity"</i> [sic] known to modern physics. This line of crank thought has of course a long pedigree, going right back to the 1920s, but it was cranky even then.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I expect that many Wikipedia users who participate in this AfD, who have no particular axe to grind but happen not to be familiar with the problems faced by members of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Physics_630e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics</a> (the membership of WikiProject Pseudoscience seems to be a small subset) in controlling cranky POV-pushing in physics-related articles in the Wikipedia, will conclude that "Wikipedia's mission includes <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> description of well-known crackpots such as <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a>". In an ideal world, they would not be wrong (and I myself have made this argument in the past). The trouble is, <i>current practices at Wikipedia for controlling problem edits and problem editors are far too cumbersome to admit any attempt to describe Wikipedia as an ideal world!</i> While I and other editors of good faith are working hard to try to ameliorate this situation (which requires reforming the cumbersome policy creation/implementation process, so that we can emplace wise and effective policies for protecting Wikipedia articles from being traduced by those who come here to pursue some personal agenda which does not serve the interest of our readers, who come here seeking accurate information about topics of interest to them, including technical topics such as physics which require considerable background and expertise to write about knowledgeably, accurately, and well), at present it is far too easy for one disaffected crank to endlessly tie up, not one, not two, but a half dozen Ph.D. physicists/mathematicians whose time here should be spent in more useful activities than trying to "reason" with KraMuc. See User:Hillman/Dig/KraMuc (<i>look but don't touch, please!</i>) for evidence of the magnitude of the problem in trying to deal with KraMuc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the basis of my extensive experience here, I feel that until better policies are in place for enforcing <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> without imposing an undue burden of time/energy upon the still too rare "physics expert" population here, it is my judgement that it is best to delete this article, because as a practical matter <i>there is currently no way to maintain it in an neutral state at an acceptable cost to the Wikipedia community</i>. I also would point contributors to this AfD to User:Hillman/Dig/Sarfatti to see the kind of abuse which can result when the community tries to maintain in neutral form an article on a controversial fringe figure. I would respectfully request that anyone planning to vote <i>keep</i> take the time to read the above cited pages and then <i>decide whether they themselves would be willing to invest a sizeable portion of their own time at Wikipedia in helping the membership of WikiProject Physics try to maintain Modern Galilean relativity in a neutral state</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In a phrase, my argument in this and in similar cases is that <i>"deletion is the best part of valor"</i>. If the experiment in the German Wikipedia with various cruft control measures succeeds, and if our policymaking efforts here succeed, so that cruft patrol becomes <i>much, much less onerous</i> for Wikipedia users with a strong physics/math background, we can no doubt recreate articles such as this, in the fullness of time.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 21:49, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - there is a wide range of secondary literature on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>, and it would be possible to create a well-referenced article on this subject. Would it be possible to revert the article to a stub until such time as someone can work on it? The argument here is that this would make it easier for someone to work on it at a later date (maybe copying material to the talk page or a subpage so that it can be reworked and properly referenced). Merely deleting makes it harder to incorporate and/or reorganise the existing material. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 23:04, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Everything that I saw in this article has been published elsewhere. This is a nice, but far from fabulous, complilation of analysis of themes in LOR that can be pulled from an abundance of secondary literature. Indeed in principle, (though not in execution), this is nicely encylopedic. But of course they have not cited any of their of these possible sources and so this article is in violation of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. First, I think the violation is not as severe as some might claim. A lot of this could arguably fall under "common knowledge" at least as it relates to LOR. A great deal of what an encylopedist does is organize common knowledge about a subject in interesting and informative ways. Second, how do we get some movement on improving the citations? Looking at the history, a number of people are working on this article. The prompt for citations has only been out there for 10 days. My understanding is that "good faith" requires that an article with potential, that has had a good amount of work done by multiple contributers should be given the benefit of doubt and be given a chance to become better. 10 days is not a chance. Keep the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> on the page and come back in a couple of months. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 04:59, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> (Defer) Per Jdclevenger, Carcharoth, and Mister.Manticore. I've never seen articles on themes of books being discouraged from creating as long as there are references to back it up. I also beg patience to my fellow Wikipedians: somebody <i>will</i> clean it up and perfect it. After all, writing a solidly good article that describes the themes of a novel is not an easy thing. The article just needs a lot of work and sources to back up its claims. —<b><a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirlen_c835.html" title="User:Mirlen"><font color="coral">Mir</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirlen_289b.html" title="User talk:Mirlen"><font color="darkorange"><span style="cursor:help">l</span></font></a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirlen_EA_ae3a.html" title="User:Mirlen/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirlen_289b.html" title="User talk:Mirlen"><font color="darkorange"><span style="cursor:help">n</span></font></a></b> 01:28, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

If we deleted everything which is not currently properly sourced 90% of Wikipedia would have to go.

<p>How come this article is recommended for deletion when articles such as List of firearms in films and List of firearms in video games are allowed to go unchallenged? As for the 'Moonraker shuttles', the description of this article clearly discourages fictional military vehicles and civilian vehicles reconfigured for military use, and is also centered around motorized ground vehicles, not spacecraft.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Nothing wrong with 'list of ___ in films/video games'-type pages, unless the list items are so commonly found as to be unmaintanable. I bet at least half of the major Hollywood movies that came out in the last year contain military vehicles of some sort, and i bet in 90% of those the specific vehicle models were totally irrelevant to the story. Like someone else said, if lists of 'military vehicles' and 'firearms' are allowed, what's to say 'list of kitchen utensils in films' isn't appropriate? Where is the line drawn? If it's at all significant, it can be added to the film artcile's summary or possibly to the trivia/references section of the vehicle's article. I appreciate the work that must've been put into this list though. ~ <a href="../../../l/a/v/User%7ELav-chan_eb6b.html" title="User:Lav-chan">Lav-chan</a> 08:16, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Actually, articles along the lines of List of spacecraft in films or List of fictional spacecraft in films would be good articles.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think a non-list article Military vehicles in films would be more valuable. Prose comparing the phyical characteristics of the tanks etc. used; why certain vehicles are used more often, in different time periods or situations; how some vehicles are disguised as others; and the ease/difficulty of getting qualified people to operate them in films (cited, of course). Good examples could then be given, and it'd be useful for military vehicle and film enthusiasts as well as interested laypeople, because they'd be able to easily identify the differences for themselves in other films (and on the news), and there'd be text describing other aspects of using such equipment in films. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransUtopian_743a.html" title="User:TransUtopian">TransUtopian</a> 23:14, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
