<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: This is an encyclopedia, a forum for truth and accuracy. These "troll groups" support the very opposite of truth and accuracy. I am not aware of any encyclopedia of any merit that suspends integrity and allows the publication of lies, nonsense, vindictiveness, and fluff, just because those things can be "funny". The fact that something is "all in good fun" (a matter of opinion) does not excuse any indiscretion and make it automatically acceptable for every venue. There are many appropriate places for anarchistic comedy but a serious and fact-based encyclopedia is not one of them.
<ul>
<li>So the pages about frauds and impostors and terrorism should be removed too? Mind you, they don't contain any frauds or lies at all, nor does this article. Can you prove otherwise?</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: If you want an encyclopedia to be a "forum for truth and accuracy," you really should prevent people from anonymously making edits to it. Also, as I am sure you're aware, because of this open nature (not preventing anonymous edits to articles), Wikipedia is considered a bit of a joke when it comes to content that encyclopedias are traditionally consulted for. This is simply an attempt by whoever started this VfD to stifle and suppress a certain demographic. If we only have articles about Slashdot, CmdrTaco and the editors et al., we're showing a certain amount of bias toward that side of site. Like it or not, Trolling is definitely a huge part of the Slashdot culture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With all due respect, you are absolutely missing the point and also, I think, compromising Wikipedia's mission. Of course we do not want Wikipedia to include "lies, nonsense, vindictiveness, and fluff". If the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolltalk.html" title="Trolltalk">trolltalk</a> entry contained LNVF I would support its deletion. But it most certainly does not. The article is NOT itself a troll. Rather, it <i>describes</i> the activities of trolls. This is a crucial difference, and, honestly, it shouldn't be too difficult to grasp. It's the same difference between an article on <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Qaeda_48e2.html" title="Al Qaeda">al Qaeda</a>, and a piece of al Qaeda propoganda. Wikipedia would obviously include the former, but exclude the latter. Would you argue for deleting the al Qaeda entry because "Wikipedia is not here to wage jihad"?? <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 21:23, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While I think this article should go, I believe judging the merit of an article by whether or not sockpuppets vote to keep it is absurd, and such votes should not count. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 21:12, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If an article's support comes almost entirely from sockpuppets, that's strong evidence that it's nothing by a vanity article created &amp; maintained by the very people the article is about. Vanity articles can sometimes be hard to identify but the character &amp; identities of the persons editing/supporting them can help to determine if an article's only purpose is self-promotion.</li>
<li>Yes. It might sound absurd in theory, but in practice any article that deserves to be kept on merit, won't attract sockpuppets because it doesn't need them. Only articles that "should go" will atrract socks supporting them, because they're the only ones that need them. It's a useful rule of thumb. <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> — <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson"><small>(talk)</small></a> 21:20, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think that's a crap rule of thumb. With that as our standard, we would delete every article related to Islam, the Holocaust, Ukraine, Sino-Japanese relations, and god knows what else. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 21:28, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Good point, but how often do serious articles about Islam, Sino-Japanese relations, etc. get nominated for VfD in the first place? And when they do, it's usually socks wanting them deleted for not supporting their POV. And then the corollary applies: If the sockpuppets want to <i>delete</i> an article, it deserves to be kept. <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> — <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson"><small>(talk)</small></a> 21:58, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oh, I didn't realize the rule of thumb only applied when an article was already up for deletion. I thought it was a general way of determining which articles (in VfD stage or not) were worthy of deletion. Okay, so even in this more tightly circumscribed form, and even when we invoke the corollary you describe (in which sockpuppets are voting for deletion, thereby guiding us to "keep") we must still recognize the mutliple exceptions to both the corollary and the proper rule. For example, some articles go to VfD (<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-semitism.html" title="New anti-semitism">new anti-semitism</a>, for example) and have POV pushers and sockpuppets aplenty on both sides. In these cases we must invoke an exception to the corollary of the circumscribed form of the rule. It is at this point that I think we should realize that we're better off trashing the rule altogether, and voting not based on a dubious rule-of-thumb regarding how other votes have been placed, but rather <i>according to the merits of the article</i>. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 23:09, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>But this <i>isn't</i> a hypothetical situation with "POV pushers and sockpuppets aplenty on both sides". Is it? <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> — <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson"><small>(talk)</small></a> 23:37, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>These are the same people who call non-sockpuppets sockpuppets. I voted to keep and was instantly mis-identified as a sock puppet by one of these crack investigators. Many voters seem to not have even read the trolltalk entry. They make false accusations about GNAA association, and persue vendettas against trolls in general which clouds this vote. Their judgement deeserves to be questioned.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia <b>is</b> an encyclopedia, however, and being such it should contain articles on a wide variety of topics. Again, by deleting this, Wikipedia shows a bias toward the editors and "group think" mentality of Slashdot. While a large amount of Trolls have a destructive nature, many posters on Slashdot are classified as Trolls simply because they do not agree with the standard line of thinking agreed with by many of its regulars. Trolling is and shall most likely always be a large portion of the Slashdot culture, and deleting this article harms the impartiality of Wikipedia and punishes many because of the actions of a few.</li>

The rest was mostly a bunch of mindless one-liners of kids hurling grade-school insults at each other, exercising their limited vocabularies of racial, ethnic, and sexual-orientation-based slurs; and bragging about "muh dick" while making grand pronouncements about the comparative inferiority of the genitals of their rivals.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- this vote was cast shortly after a "call to arms" was posted in the Trolltalk forum (<a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=20721&amp;cid=12856190" class="external free" title="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=20721&amp;cid=12856190" rel="nofollow">http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=20721&amp;cid=12856190</a>) asking for help to derail the VfD - you can expect many sock-puppet accounts to be created over the new few days for purposes of voting "keep" on this article. Trolltalk is affiliated with the GNAA, which has used sock-puppets, spamming, and intimidation to survive four votes for deletion, bragging about "defeating Wikipedia" (<a href="http://www.gnaa.us/pr.phtml?troll=gnaa-wikipedia" class="external free" title="http://www.gnaa.us/pr.phtml?troll=gnaa-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnaa.us/pr.phtml?troll=gnaa-wikipedia</a>) after each one.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- There is no established connection between the GNAA and Trolltalk. I urge whoever posted this to keep arguments for deciding the fate of this article based in fact and reality and not about some mindless vendetta against the GNAA. Attempting to invoke the name of this troll group in an attempt at using the emotions of other Wikipedia readers against this article is not only unprofessional, it is out of line and clearly juvenile.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- The close affiliation between Trolltalk and the GNAA is obvious to anyone who is familiar with either of them and can be easily proven by searching the Trolltalk Archive for GNAA and taking a look at some of the results. Although the archives don't go back this far, many will recall that the GNAA was born on Trolltalk, and even though they now have off-site forums most Trolltalk people are still GNAA.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- Can you provide proof that most "Trolltalk people" are GNAA? If not, I suggest you attempt to keep your comments to facts next time, please. This is a serious matter and it's not right for you to lie in an attempt to keep your POV the dominate one.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> We are here because Afcassidy has some sort of vendetta against Trolltalk. More than likely, he will continue to attempt to delete this article until he succeeds. I think someone needs to possibly scrutinize his motives in this deletion attempt.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> This is a lie -- you've failed to produce any evidence that Afcassidy was even <b>AWARE</b> of the previous VfD, or that Afcassidy has any personal interest in the article or that any form of bias or vendetta exists. It seems to me to be a case of someone who sees an article that he/she feels shouldn't be there and takes the logical step. Please stop with the unsubstantiated allegations; you're just making the entire pro-Trolltalk crowd look foolish.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not a member of the "pro-Trolltalk" crowd; I am a member of the "pro-Impartiality" crowd. I was mistaken about the Afcassidy link. However, there is much more logical grounding in keeping the article than in deleting it. I could see deleting this article if it were somehow consuming a large portion of the Wiki's resources or if it were obscene in some way, but this article does neither. By deleting this article, you're showing that you're biased toward the entire "Slashbotism" thing that most trolls are against. In regard to failing to provide any evidence that bias exists, look throughout this page. Many accusations are made linking Trolltalk to GNAA. This is obviously not the case, yet I do not see you policing these edits as you have mine. That alone shows some bias (perhaps not much) on your part.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The last VfD was over a year ago; many things can change in a year. Furthermore, last time around there weren't a lot of people who wanted to keep the article -- more supported deleting it and some others wanted to merge the information into other articles. But with the vote split like that, there was no clear consensus and thus, for the time being, nothing at all was done.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Correct, and now there is a significant number of users who want to keep the article, and a lot of spirited debate around the VfD. That alone speaks in favor of keeping the article, since the only legitimate reason for deletion now would be a vendetta against the subject matter. If Trolltalk wasn't notable there wouldn't be half the number of votes and comments here. --<a href="../../../b/k/0/User%7EBk0_a429.html" title="User:Bk0">Bk0</a> 02:40, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with that completely. There is clearly plenty of strong feeling on the part of genuine Wikipedians that we should keep the article.

<li>The KKK is way more notable than these guys. I don't know how many times I've said this: It's not about because a dislike of TrollTalk.

<li>The KKK article: 1. Was not written entirely by KKK members. 2. Contains information that can be verified by non-KKK-members. 3. Isn't being championed &amp; defended by KKK sockpuppets. If, on the other hand, the KKK article WERE written entirely by the KKK, presenting their own highly distored version of their official "history" (i.e. how they valiantly and unselfishly saved the innocent women &amp; children of the south from being raped and murdered by rampaging gangs of violent negroes after the civil war), and no REAL information on their history was available because nobody but themselves gave a shit about them, then I'm sure their vanity Wikipedia article would wind up deleted.4.89.246.65 13:52, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

It is, rather, an excellent description of the forum, and includes unflattering info about how the moderation system has successfully limited the trolls' effectiveness. You're either a very poor reader, or you are intentionally misrepresenting the article because you have a personal distaste for the subject matter. And <a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html" title="User talk:JiFish">JiFish</a>, as I think I've already demonstrated above, there are loads of far less notable articles than <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolltalk.html" title="Trolltalk">trolltalk</a> on Wikipedia. The difference is that people <b>dislike the subject matter of this article</b>, and this is what is driving this VfD. Sorry, but that's just reality.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- votes from anonymous users are not counted, also, everyone should be made aware that the term "female creature" is taken directly from the movie with a very offensive title (which I won't repeat here) which the GNAA is based around. The heroes of that movie have never encountered women before, and when one of them does encounter one, they all make a big show out of shouting "female creatures!" in shock and alarm.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- There is no evidence that trolltalk has anything to do with GNAA, other than the fact that they both troll slashdot.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- Congratulations on demonstrating that GNAA members post on trolltalk. It is a PUBLIC forum, genius. Anybody can post there. By your logic, the dozens of forums that have been vandalized by the GNAA are also affiliated with the GNAA. Search slashdot for GNAA and you will find similar results.

<li><b>Comment</b> Congratz to whoever just deleted a string of legitimate comments, both Keep and Delete. Here was mine: Obviously no one who believes in Wikipedia believes, as Paul M claims to, that Wikipedia should include articles on anything and everything. But it really is starting to feel like Wikipedia is being taken over by people who think the project should only include articles on topics like <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_the_Great_9da3.html" title="Frederick the Great">Frederick the Great</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_theory.html" title="Atomic theory">Atomic theory</a>, because these are the types of articles contained in dinosaur, Gutenberg, pre-internet encyclopedias like Brittanica. Like the hidebound architects in Ayn Rand stories who use fabulous new materials in the same tired way they used older, weaker materials.

<li><b>Comment</b>, My ISP, Comcast has a dynamic IP system. Just because we share the same IP doesn't mean we are the same person. Wikipedia is pretty popular you know. You've grown so paranoid with vandalism you've lost your ways Wikipedia. Anyway my comment was not to keep everything. But to keep things that are useful. And indeed trolltalk is a useful article that contains information on a well-known subculture. Also I'd like to add I'm a long time slashdot user (<a href="http://slashdot.org/~Stalyn" class="external free" title="http://slashdot.org/~Stalyn" rel="nofollow">http://slashdot.org/~Stalyn</a>) - Paul M.
<ul>
<li>The deltionist tendencies of Wikipedia as a whole can be <b>clearly seen</b> from the consensus decisions to: a) keep every single school, regardless of notability, because some people like them, and b) keep pokemon, digimon, and whatever other irrelevant fancruft may be out there. So, although I am a deletionist, Wikipedia as a whole is, perhaps, not so hide-bound as is claimed.--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 15:45, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yeah let's delete trolltalk but keep your entry on Sean Brown.. who sucks and doesn't even play in the NHL anymore. Are you related to him or something? - Paul M.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> How can you have a category Internet Trolls (which Wikipedia has) and exclude Trolltalk from it? Trolltalk is a place where trolls converse, thus being a part of this category. I don't see anyone trying to delete <a href="../../../m/e/o/Meow_Wars_55bb.html" title="Meow Wars">Meow_Wars</a>, which is most definitely not as notable as Trolltalk.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Trolltalk has next to nothing to do with trolling, it's just one of millions of no-topic social discussion boards out there, with the major difference that it's even smaller, more obscure, harder to find, and of even less consequence than the majority of the aforementioned millions. And if you think the "Meow Wars" entry should be deleted you're free to register an account &amp; nominate it for VfD (I think anonymous VfD nominations don't count).
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> And when <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Meow_Wars_a0f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Meow Wars">Meow Wars was nominated for VfD</a> we didn't have various Meowers and their socks trying to disrupt the vote. I think that's one reason why it survived. <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson"></a> — <a href="../../../p/_/i/User%7EP_Ingerson_2d72.html" title="User:P Ingerson">P Ingerson</a> <a href="../../../p/_/i/User_talk%7EP_Ingerson_766c.html" title="User talk:P Ingerson">(talk)</a> 21:32, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You're part of the reason why Wikipedia has problems. This deletionist frame of mind isn't helping anyone. Again, the article survived a VfD before, so why are we even here? I predict that if the VfD fails this time, someone will just attempt one again and will keep trying to delete this article until they succeed.</li>

<li>How do we know you didn't post that or the first one to make it look like the keep votes are sockpuppets? also 1) I don't think many trolltalk posters care enough to come here and subvert the voting process 2) trolltalk posters are not a group with common interests beyond trolling, it's likely that they would come here and post anti-trolltalk comments in order to "troll" the poster of the rallying call.</li>

<p>Please do not refactor the discussion into lists or tables of votes, however much you may think that this helps the process. Again, the votes are not the ends in themselves (Wikipedia is not a democracy). Both the context and the order of the comments are essential to understanding the intents of contributors, both at the discussion closure and during the discussion. Refactoring actually makes the job of making the decision at the closure of discussion much harder, not easier.</p>

<li><b>Question</b>: as I look around Wikipedia and see a vast number of articles that are infinitely less notable than <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolltalk.html" title="Trolltalk">trolltalk</a>, it strikes me as patently absurd that many of the delete votes claim "non-notable" as their justification. It leads me to wonder: does Wikipedia have any suggested criteria/guidelines for determining whether an article is notable or not? Otherwise people are free to vote "delete" for selfish, prejudicial reasons (e.g., "I hate trolls!" or "I hate Abba" or whatever) and then claim "non-notable". <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 19:35, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you can find a page less notable than trolltalk, please put a VFD on it. --<a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiFish_180b.html" title="User:JiFish">JiFish</a>(<a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html" title="User talk:JiFish">Talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JiFish_b9a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JiFish">Contrib</a>) 22:10, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you kidding? A person could work a 40-hour week for a year and not ferret out all the Wikipedia articles less notable than <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolltalk.html" title="Trolltalk">trolltalk</a>. For the first five, how about <a href="../../../f/n/o/Fnord.html" title="Fnord">fnord</a>, or <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_A._Grout_d630.html" title="Daniel A. Grout">Daniel A.

Since Wikipedia by its very nature has the ability to be wonderfully capacious in its subject matter, I think all those articles should be kept. But if we'd prefer a boringly traditional encyclopedia that only covers topics likely to be found in Brittanica or whatever, and if we are going to delete anything as or less notable then <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trolltalk.html" title="Trolltalk">trolltalk</a>, then we have A LOT of deleting to do. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 01:08, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, I am not kidding. Firstly, I don't consider <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_panic.html" title="Penis panic">Penis panic</a>, a condition documented by the World Health Organisation, less notable than a thread on Slashdot. I'd vote delete on <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pompatus.html" title="Pompatus">Pompatus</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> This isn't a referendum on "Do trolls behave appropriately in Wikipedia?" The issue here should be purely whether or not the article "Trolltalk" should be deleted--and whether Wikipedia would be diminished by removing it. I think Wikipedia is uniquely well-placed to cover topics of great interest to small groups, because those topics will also interest people who want to learn more about such groups, Pokemonians, Plushies ... or even trolls. The non-notability criterion makes sense for deleting pieces about someone's high school band--it is destructive when it gets used to try to remove articles of real interest to many people (even trolls). <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 04:05, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Betsy, you are of course absolutely right. This VfD is the most disturbing thing I've yet seen on Wikipedia: a strong push to delete high-quality Wikipedia content because some Wikipedians personally dislike those who are described in the article. Even more disturbing, the "delete" crowd includes an administrator (<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg">Jayjg</a>), who should really know better. I'm so disappointed in Wikipedia. I didn't think it was so easily compromised by prejudice and whim. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 20:55, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
