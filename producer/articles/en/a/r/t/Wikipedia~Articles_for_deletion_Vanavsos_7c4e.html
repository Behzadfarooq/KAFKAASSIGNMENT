<p>This article is problematic in many superficial ways and in one deep way.</p>
<p>The superficial failings of this article could be corrected. The very name of the article, "vanavsos", is incorrect -- the Greek term has a standard English equivalent, "banausic" (see OED). The meaning given for the term is incorrect -- in fact, inconsistent with the quotes the article itself gives. The transliterations and etymology aren't quite right. The discussion of the sense-development in Greek isn't quite right. There are anachronistic references to modern fields, which could be removed. There is a connection to the constitutions of the Doric states which is not justified in the article, which could be removed. Etc. etc.</p>
<p>If those were the only problems, the solution would be to either edit the article, or to list it in <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPages_needing_attention_a7b2.html" title="Wikipedia:Pages needing attention">Wikipedia:Pages_needing_attention</a>.</p>
<p>But there is a more basic problem: it is not about an important, recognized concept. It is taking a common Ancient Greek word which Aristotle uses in its ordinary meaning and elevating it into some sort of technical term in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_philosophy.html" title="Political philosophy">political philosophy</a>. At best, this constitutes <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, an essay on the relationship of the Greek concepts of virtue (arete) and how it is incompatible with banausic occupation.--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 05:49, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the spirit of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiLove_dbab.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiLove">Wikipedia:WikiLove</a>, I'm ignoring some of the provocative things that have been said, and will try for a constructive, positive, egoless resolution, taking advantage of everyone's contributions.</p>
<p>The core of this article as it currently stands seems to be the political role of the artisan class in ancient greece (the <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">βάναυσοι</span>). That is an encyclopedic subject, there is accepted non-original research on the topic (which it would be nice to cite at some point), and in fact it's not a bad name for it.</p>
<p>That seems like an awfully specialized subject, though, and I'd hope that we could come up with a more general article on the <b>Artisan Class in Ancient Greece</b>, with more content on its economic role, its relations with other parts of the population (<a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen.html" title="Citizen">citizens</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metic.html" title="Metic">metics</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douloi.html" title="Douloi">slaves</a>, etc.), well-known members (<a href="../../../p/h/i/Phidias.html" title="Phidias">Phidias</a>?, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socrates.html" title="Socrates">Socrates</a>?), patron gods/demigods (<a href="../../../d/a/e/Daedalus.html" title="Daedalus">Daedalus</a>?), and all that.</p>
<p>As for the name of the article: In the academic literature on this class, it is referred to either using the English term 'artisan', or with the Greek name in Greek letters, or the Greek name transliterated as 'banausoi' (the plural of 'banausos'). Liddell &amp; Scott (the standard dictionary of Ancient Greek) translates it as 'artisan' (noun); as an adjective, it started out as the adjective 'of the class of handicraftsmen or artisans' and later developed into 'vulgar' etc. (in Modern Greek, it means something like 'uncouth', but that is not really relevant here). Of course, it doesn't have precisely the same denotation or connotations as the English word 'artisan', but there doesn't seem to be any danger of confusion by using that term. The printed index of the 1911 Britannica doesn't use the term banausos/banausic, and, to the extent one can trust the scanned version at 1911encyclopedia.org, they don't appear in its text, either (even though it <i>does</i> use the term 'metic'). Hence the recommendation to use the term 'artisan class'. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 23:06, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>A truly inspired suggestion, Macrakis. I do hope that this takes some of the heat out of this debate. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 01:00, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is the importance of the term: <b>This ancient Greek term delineates the ethos of the commercial class from the ethos of the warrior class. It shows the bias of the warrior ethos and established, in the Greek republics, a <u>"psycological distance"</u> between the citizens and the traders.</b> "Artisans" in the Greek language is "texnitai". This word "vanavsos" is to show that they created a term to describe their "bias" against the trader classes and to seperate the warrior ethos from the commercial ethos. This article is very necessary for understanding ancient Greek republicansim!<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:15, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aristotle is pretty clear on this in Politics 1277a/b: <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">ὧν ἓν μέρος κατέχουσιν οἱ χερνῆτες: οὗτοι δ' εἰσίν, ὥσπερ σημαίνει καὶ τοὔνομ' αὐτούς, οἱ ζῶντες ἀπὸ τῶν χειρῶν, ἐν οἷς ὁ βάναυσος τεχνίτης ἐστίν. διὸ παρ' ἐνίοις οὐ μετεῖχον οἱ δημιουργοὶ τὸ παλαιὸν ἀρχῶν, πρὶν δῆμον γενέσθαι τὸν ἔσχατον.</span> That is: “One department [of slave/bondsman] belongs to the handicraftsmen (<span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">χερνῆτες</span>), who as their name implies are the persons that live by their hands (<span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">χειρῶν</span>), a class that includes the mechanic (<span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">βάναυσος</span>) artisan (<span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">τεχνίτης</span>). Hence in some states manual laborers (<span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">δημιουργοὶ</span>) were not admitted to office in old times, before the development of extreme democracy.”</dd>
<dd>I think it's pretty clear from this passage that "banausos" is <i>not</i> the term of art in political philosophy that you're making it out to be, at least in Aristotle—in fact, he uses the word <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">δημιουργοὶ</span> to refer to the manual workers who were not admitted to office, not <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" style="font-family: Athena, Gentium, Palatino Linotype, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Code2000; font-family &#160;:inherit;" xml:lang="grc">βαναυσοι</span>. Your own quotes demonstrate that banausic does not refer to the <i>commercial</i> or <i>agricultural</i> sector, and your quotes about the love of money don't refer to banausoi at all. So where does that leave this article? Is a common Ancient Greek word for a kind of artisan worth a Wikipedia article? That said, as I suggested above, I <i>do</i> think it is worthwhile to have an serious article on the social/economic/cultural position of artisans in Greek society in the Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 18:50, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Nixon said, "Let me make this perfectly clear"---This is not about the "artisan class" it is about the ancient Greek warrior clan using a word to seperate their "*culture*" from the commercial culture. First, It is a word that describes the "prejudice" of the warrior class for the "values" of the commercial class. Moreover, it was a psycological device to train their people to turn away from the commercial fields of endeavor. To label this as the "Artisan class" is to destroy the fundamental meaning that this article is trying to portray.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:21, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I know this is a hard concept to grasp. Not only am I a Doric Greek, but I have been trained as a soldier all my life and did six years in the USMC. This is my ethos. Most of you have been brought up in democracy, liberalism, modernism which colors and influences your thought. I have done nothing but read about the Greeks all my life. I have read Werner Jaeger, Kitto, Hamilton, Muller and others. I know ancient Greek culture, though I am not a Greek linguist whatsoever, but I do know Ancient Greek culture and because I have the same lifestyle and was trained as they were, I know from whence they speak.

<p>On the title, the title needs to capture the essence of the material in question. I am all up for a better title, but "Artisan Class in Ancient Greece" is not one of them. This title is misleading because it is not about the "Artisan Class". It deals with virtue and how money is destructive of virtue and the warrior ethos.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 14:32, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My point on presenting my culture and my ethos is that I see what they see. The Spartans are a strange people, Rousseau commented on this, Paul Cartledge commented on this and many others. Why? Because they are namby-pambies. They are academics, soft and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_definition_of_effeminacy.html" title="Classical definition of effeminacy">effeminate</a>. How can soft and effeminate, lovers of themselves and lovers of money, understand a warrior culture. They can not. The Spartans are a "strange people". They don't understand and so they can not "correctly" speak of them. What they conjecture is misleading because they miss to catch salient points. Culture is very important. If <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_determinism.html" title="Cultural determinism">cultural determinism</a> is important to understanding people's actions And that culture impacts politics, Then Culture also impacts knowledge! What do the proverbs say, "It takes one to know one"; "Unless you have walked in a mile in the moccasins of the other, then you can't understand". Understanding is the key to knowledge. How can academics that have spent their whole life in a classroom have any understanding and/or sympathy (therefore "knowledge") for a warrior culture and ethos in which they <b>despise</b>.

<dd>I think Macrakis you are turning this into something which is not intended in the article. you state that "this is an essay on the relationship of the Greek concepts of virtue and how it in incompatible with banausic occupation". This article only presents the concept current in Greek philosophy, and the language of the aristocratic classes. This article JUST presents the concept. In the minds of the Spartans, Kretans, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch, there was <u>already</u> a concept of incompatiblity. It was a given. Why do you think that in <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_%28Plato%29_ef8e.html" title="Republic (Plato)">Republic (Plato)</a> that Plato doesn't give any room for the vanavsos. In order to understand Platonic and Aristotelian political philosophy and the actions of Thebes and of the Doric Greeks in this regard, this concept is necessary. Your attempt to slight and construe this into original research is an attempt at censorship. I agree that 30% of the [classical definition of republic] was original. But the vanavsos article is not original research at all. You are sliding the facts to get this deleted.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 17:57, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - whilst I agree with <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> raises a good point. The actual article should be on Wikipedia, but there are many flaws with it in its current state. It is original research - see the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> definition, in particular: an article is original research if it "provides new definitions of old terms". In the article, you state (as an example) "Plato and Aristotle teach that the highest thing in man is reason and therefore, the purpose of human perfection lies with the activity of reason; i.e. the 'theoretic' or contemplative life. Trade, industry and mechanical labour prevent this idea.". Well, you may think trade, industry and mechanical labour prevent activity of reason, but playing the devil's advocate, I'd be perfectly prepared to refute that claim (I am, of course, assuming that the "therefore" is your own thoughts and ideas, and not Plato's or Aritotle's. If I've misread the passage I apologise, but my point remains - much of the article is original research). <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick04_a2be.html" title="User:Nick04">Nick04</a> 19:39, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is precisely my point in this whole debate on the deletion process here at wikipedia. NickO4 is the perfect example. The article states the thought of Aristotle and Plato. nick04 wants to argue with them and place "modern" ideas back into the classical world. "<u>Well, you may think trade, industry and mechanical labour prevent activity of reason, but playing the devil's advocate,</u>. This article is not about MODERN people agreeing with the thought of Aristotle or Plato, it is about presenting their thought AS IS. Only by Understanding HOW they thought can you understand the WHY they said the things they said. This response by this Wikipedian shows the falacy and the damage being done to the Classical world and its studies. This man wants to "reinterpret" Classical thought in the light of Modern Thought!!!

<dd>Your comment, <u>"The conclusion that "Plato and Aristotle teach" <i>anything at all</i> about "modern fields such as lawyering and journalism" is inappropriate on Wikipedia"</u> is very impertinent. You may not take any teaching from the Classics, but all of Roman Catholic philosophy, theology and ethics comes from Plato and Aristotle. You and your people may not like this information and refuse to read anything classical because they are "DWEM" and you despise classical learning and philosophy doesn't mean that you can delete information based on these grounds and your prejudices. What about the rest of us that have a love of the classical world? What about the Roman Catholic philosophers and students who love to have this information?

<dd>If you look below, I answer all the charges of it being 'original" research. And I ask you, How can it be "original research" when, the word was taken into the English language as early as 1845? And what do you mean by 'modern'? 1935 is not "modern" enough for you? When does "modernity" start, anew every 20 years. So books in the l960's is ancient and no good?<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 16:24, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

And yet, and yet... the only genuine English word that corresponds to the Greek is an adjective — and it seems odd to have an encyclopædia article with an adjective as a title (banausic <i>what</i>?); we do seem to be dealing more with a dictionary article.

Discussion of the concept doubtless has a place somewhere (in a discussion of Aristotle, in a discussion of ancient Greek class-consciousness, etc.), but there's just no reason to think that the Greeks (who, aside from Aristotle, seem not even to have used the noun to refer to people, according to my <i>Liddle &amp; Scott</i>) recognised the concept concerned.

<dd>I'm unfamiliar with 'deadjectival noun'; how do they differ from ordinary nouns?

<p>To Theo, we just start a new line. Look, the word in Greek is a noun not an adjective. It may be an adjective in English, but it is a noun in Greek. One just says "vanavsos" and one means the working class. One can say of the perioci of Lacedæmonia, that they are vanavsos. The vanavsoi don't have political rights. The vanavsoi are in rebellion. The vanavsoi are not literate enough to do politics. It is a noun in Greek texts. <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 21:24, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, no, it's a noun in modern Greek, we're agreed — it's just that there's no noun in English that's derived from it, only an adjective. I'm a little surprised that you say that it means the working class, though; isn't that a figurative, not a literal use? In modern Greek, I thought that <i>vanavsos</i> meant literally 'crude', 'coarse', 'rough', 'vulgar', even 'obscene'. In ancient Greek, though, it was an adjective, surely; I can't find a mention of it as a noun except in Aristotle, and he seems to be creating a noun for his own purposes. Do you have any other references for it as a noun? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:48, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, the transliteration is fine for modern Greek (and modern Greeks pronounce ancient Greek as if it were modern).

<dd>The "b" in Greek is pronounced as a "v" sound. If the "B" is used then English speakers would say the term with a "b" sound. I don't think that would sound right. And i would like to add that in understanding freedom and liberty, the Greeks did not consider the vanavsos as participants in a city's political life. Aristotle, and Plato did not include the vanavsoi in the political franchise. This word and concept are important to understanding the Greek mentality.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 21:42, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Neither Plato nor Aristotle were democrats, so I'm not clear what you mean by 'franchise' here — and they were surely included in the franchise in the Athenian democracy at the time (given that the term itself was only used as a noun describing a class of person by Aristotle, so far as I can tell). But that's a discussion that should really take place elsewhere. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:59, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, β in Modern Greek is certainly pronounced like English 'v', and it would be completely appropriate to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcription.html" title="Transcription">transcribe</a> a Modern Greek word that way. However, the term in question is being cited from <i>classical</i> sources (as I mentioned in the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Talk%7EVanavsos_3f21.html" title="Talk:Vanavsos">Talk:Vanavsos</a> page). The conventional <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliteration</a> of β in the Latin alphabet is 'b' -- we don't even need to worry about what the actual pronunciation was in classical times, just know that this is the standard convention. Surely it doesn't make sense to re-write all Greek words borrowed into English following the Modern Greek pronunciation?: 'violoyia' (not biology), 'taftoloyia' (not tautology), etc. Moreover, there is an <i>existing</i>, <i>established</i> English version of this term: banausic. And what's wrong with saying 'the franchise was not extended to banausics'; anyway, the WikiPedia is not about introducing new terms like 'vanavsos'. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 23:07, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You're confusing two things here: English words with Greek roots, and transliterations of Greek words. 'Biology' is no more a transliteration of the Greek than would be 'viologhia' or 'violoyia'; it's an English word whose etymology is Greek.</li>
<li>What's wrong with the sentence you suggest is that 'banausics' isn't an English word.</li>
<li>In so far as Wikipedia delas with concepts that have only non-English names in non-Roman alphabets or other symbol-systems, then transliteration is necessary, and doesn't constitute the introduction of new words.

“But there is a more basic problem: it is not about an important, recognized concept. It is taking a common Ancient Greek word which Aristotle uses in its ordinary meaning and elevating it into some sort of technical term in political philosophy.”<br />
All the research that I've done supports this; the ancient Greeks simply didn't use the term in a way that warrants an article. Aristotle himself didn't use it in the way that the article states. Some of the quotations offered below <i>could</i> be taken to support WHEELER's contentions, but are more naturally read otherwise (references to 'the corrupting influence of the marketplace' just don't naturally refer to the supposed concept of 'vanavsos'). I do agree that some of the material would probably fit somewhere, so WHEELER's undoubted hard work needn't be completely wasted. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:27, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Mel. This is not a concept of Aristotle. It was common throughout the ancient Greek cities. Aristotle just gave it a philosophical underpinnings.

I probably wouldn't have looked at this article myself, unless there are links to it from some other philosophical article I was reading.

<dd>I see your point. And it is very clear to me. This is in a sense "stricter quality control". Yes. But the "quality control" on wikipedia is Marxist and Fabian, Humanist and Modern. You have laid out very clearly to me that "who is in control here". The standards being that people who are ignorant of any subject but with a bias to protect can delete stuff off of Wikipedia. And that is not professional, academic, righteous (justice) or truthful. I understand perfectly what you are saying. I will not start another page nor work for Wikipedia (though I will transfer stuff here). I see clearly where this is going. I can do better and stop wasting my time here because surely I am. Thanks Mr. James MLane. You have certainly opened my eyes to the fundamental core of Wikipedia. And that yes, then Wikipedia is run by a cabal.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 14:37, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Furthermore, you have exposed the "hypocrisy" here. All evil is hypocritical as Cicero has pointed out. "Coherence" and "Consistency" are hallmarks of truth which is missing here at Wikipedia. If this is "Free and Open content" and "Open Source" then why is there a deletion notice on <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanavsos.html" title="Vanavsos">vanavsos</a> and why did the Classical definition of republic get deleted?

<dd>Ad hominem arguments. What is the major flaw in the system (as opposed to the people who run it), apart from the fact that some articles which you like are being deleted? I understand your desire to defend them tooth and nail, but you need to pick your fights and decide which things to compromise on (easy for me to say I know), rather than to make enemies with anyone who disagrees with you. Personally, I think that your articles (the ones I have looked at) are good writing about things which deserve to be included in Wikipedia and do not constitute 'original research', but probably should be parts of a larger article on Ancient Greek society as it impacted philosophy, rather than separate articles.

Do Software engineers decide who gets degrees within the philosophy department? No. People in the academic system are judged by their peers. All I am saying, is that the "Vanavsos" Article be judged by people who are classicists! Why should people ignorant of the subject matter be voting about something they have no clue on what they are saying?

<p>I've started this in order to avoid cluttering up the voting any further. I'm not arguing for the retention of this article (my vote, above, stands), but a number of people have raised and argued about an issue that's of more general importance.</p>
<p>An article on, for example, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grave_%28burial%29.html" title="Grave (burial)">graves</a> should start with the origins of the term and associated concept (in fact the Wikipedia article is a stub, but the principle holds); nevertheless, the article is given the modern English spelling, not 'græf', and the modern spelling is used when talking about ancient grave mounds, etc. Why then, when we're talking about a word that exists and is used in modern Greek should we use a transliteration alien to the modern pronunciation? It's not even as if such transliterations are accurate representations of how Aristotle or Euripedes, for example, would have pronounced the language. Is it, at least in part, that non-Greek Westerners feel that <i>they</i> own the ancient language and culture, and that modern Greeks are merely its degraded descendants who can be ignored? I'm sure that such an approach is usually unconscious, but I suspect that it's widely prevalent. (There's a <a href="../../../g/2E/_/G._K._Chesterton_dbf7.html" title="G. K. Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a> essay on this sort of topic, but I don't have the reference to hand.)</p>
<p>If there's an English word <i>derived from</i> the Greek, then of course it should be used in an English-language encyclopædia, but where the word is solely Greek, then surely good practice (not to mention good manners) dictates that the Greek pronunciation be used to transliterate it — not a transliteration of the conjectural (at best) pronunciation of people dead for 2,500 years, but of the pronunciation of the living, breathing users of the language. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 12:03, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is, Modern English has borrowed this word from Ancient Greek, not from Modern Greek. Using a transliteration reflecting Modern Greek pronunciation would be like borrowing a word from Latin and using modern Italian pronunciation for it, or borrowing a word from Sanskrit and using modern Hindi pronunciation and transliteration for it. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 14:14, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But, first, this word doesn't <i>exist</i> in modern English — that's the point (as has been pointed out a number of times above); English has the adjective 'banausic', but no noun, so it hasn't borrowed it from anywahere. Secondly (and less importantly), the relationship between Latin and Italian is very different from that between Ancient and modern Greek, nor is transliteration an issue in the former case (besides, Latin is pronounced in many ways; being brought up a Catholic, I was taught to speak Latin in a much more Italian way than my current colleagues in Classics in Oxford — and you should hear the Latin grace as spoken in Pembroke College, Oxford; I'm told that it's the northern European style, <i>very</i> Italian, much more so than my early training). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 14:50, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's get this right: we're transliterating an <b>ancient</b> Greek word into English, right? That word currently does not exist in English. Modern Greek ࣔ Ancient Greek. We do not know exectly how people spoke in Ancient Greece. We should use the system used by the greatest number of people, particularly scholars. While some scholars would pronounce Ancient Greek with a level of the modern style coming in, they would not read the one as the other. The normal way of transliterating β into English is as "b". The way to obtain a "v" would be to use the pre-Classical digamma (Ϝ). If we were expecting the French Wikipedia to transliterate a modern English word, we would like them to use a modern system, not Chaucer's pronounciation. Mel's point about his pronounciation (and Pembroke College's) is about a modern dialect of Latin, not of the original language. It would also make most sense to someone who is not <i>au fait</i> with Greek tradition or pronounciation to comprehend. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">Smoddy</a> <a href="../../../s/m/o/User_talk%7ESmoddy_5430.html" title="User talk:Smoddy">(t)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Smoddy_689b.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Smoddy">(e)</a> 15:21, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, we're transliterating a Greek word into English; it existed in Ancient Greek, it still exists in modern Greek — it's just Greek</li>
<li>The normal way of transliterating 'β' varies according to context; when dealing with modern Greek, the normal way is to use a 'v'. Modern scholars, especially when writing in more popular contexts, often use old-style transliterations (such as 'Euripedes' rather than 'Evripidis' or even 'Evripithis') when dealing with familiar names and words, and more accurate modern transliterations otherwise.</li>
<li>Transliterating isn't an issue from English to French.</li>

<li>But the article is about the ancient word.</li>
<li>I am currently studying classical Greek. I have recently been to Greece. I do know quite a bit about transliteration. If I could pick you up on one thing: <i>writing in more popular contexts</i>. Are we not trying to make an encyclopedia understandable to the average man-on-the-street? I would also say that the concept is classical, ergo the transliteration should be by normal standards for classical work. If someone said to me, "Who wrote <i>Iphigenia in Aulis</i>" (for example), I would say Euripides, not something along the other lines. I realise that is, to an extent, your point. However, it is highly inconsistent. This encyclopeda should be clearly understandable to someone approaching the concepts for the first time. This inconsistency isn't.</li>

<li>My point is that there isn't an ancient word and a modern word; there's a Greek word. Besides, I'm not talking about this article (which I think, on balance, should be deleted as non-encyclopædic).</li>
<li>The point about popular writing is precisely that; as we're involved in popular writing, we might think of following the lead that I cite. (Also, however it's <i>transliterated</i>, I'd say <i>Evripidis</i> (the 'd' being more of a 'th'), as would most Greeks.)</li>
<li>&#160;</li>
<li>My Latin comment was a response to yours; you then treated it as a separate point in itself.</li>
<li>The consistency can be found if one treats well-known names to be English borrowings (as in the 'biology' example used at one point above); then borrowed words, being English, are spelt as the English spell them, but transliterations conform to the Greek pronunciation.</li>

<dd>To be entirely fair, I'm not. I'm studying for my GCSE, but I do read an awful lot (far too much) and consider myself to have something of a flair for understanding languages.</dd>
<dd>I'm now rather confused as to the points I was making. However, I think: a) article should be deleted, but not enough to vote; b) use the transliteration that makes the most simple sense. I think I shall leave this discussion now. Sorry to have had a bit of a dispute... Oh, and I think Wikipedia should respond to trends, not try to set them. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">Smoddy</a> <a href="../../../s/m/o/User_talk%7ESmoddy_5430.html" title="User talk:Smoddy">(t)</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Smoddy_689b.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Smoddy">(e)</a> 18:05, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>“I'm studying for my GCSE” — that's good to hear; there's still someone out there doing it. The Classics faculty here has slowly been forced to admit people who have neither Greek nor Latin, because of the shortage of qualified candidates. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 18:20, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>After considerable thinking... for the Greek word Barbarian we use the English word "b". I am all for changing the title of the article to "banausic" or something similar. <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 18:49, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But that's for an English word with a Greek root; it's not relevant to the question of transliteration. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 19:10, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have sitting in front of me the OED and the word is used in English language as an idea from the Greek classical world. So the "idea" was transported to English culture. The word may be dead now but in Victorian England it was real. As for transliteration, we can keep that in the body of the article but for the title of it, maybe we go with banavsos, banausos as with like "Euripedes". The word was used as late as 1957.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 19:26, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
