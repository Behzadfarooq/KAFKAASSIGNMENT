<ul>
<li>As a note none of the users commenting on the talk page are from a "sockpuppet". I don't know why you think that, but I know that there are at least three distinct people commenting on the page. I am one of them, the author another, and another person that is neither him nor I. I hope that before considering to delete this page you visit the homepage and listen to the song "Got Wheat". If you don't have the time to research this issue, I don't know why you would take the time to consider deletion of the page. 64.223.180.118 02:08, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The talk page for the article is turning into a farcicle, could people please read that before expressing judgement. It makes the article come awfully close to db-nonsense<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 02:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - 1) I do not appreciate the insinuation that I have been using sockpuppets. I have in fact signed each and every one of the comments coming from me. I see no reason to do otherwise. I believe that there are enough different IPs commenting on that page to show that Mr. Ryan is throwing around false accusations. If you end up deleting the page, I will respect that decision, but I'd like to see this fellow take some heat for throwing in nonconstructive insults and accusations with no evidence to back them up.</li>
</ul>
<p>2) Since we have now established (at least, I have said as much as I possibly can to try to convince you) that the other comments are NOT me, I'd like to point out that I can't control what they say. Whether their arguements are good or bad is irrelevant to me, because I did not make them. If that page has degenerated into farce, it is not good for me either, so why would I be doing it?</p>
<p>3) I realize that you may call me on 'meatpuppeting', but the fact is this: I myself never bothered to create a Wikipedia account until I decided to create this entry. I admit that some the people whose attention I have called to the article probably created accounts just to comment, but I can assure you that they are all regular Wikipedia users. I realize that that may not have any relevance, and also that I have no way to prove it, but I thought I might throw it out there on good faith.</p>
<p>4) My main arguement for the relevance of the page is this: The band does not meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines, that much is quite clear. However, as previously stated on the page's discussion, the main purpose of the band is promotion of Celiac Sprue awareness. That purpose comes ahead even of making music. Since that is the case, I would prefer that the entry be judged as a disease awareness tool, rather than as a band. If that is unacceptable, so be it, but please, Mr. Ryan, give me some specific points that we can debate instead of throwing the same sorry links at me when I have already accepted your point and explained why I think the entry is still relevant. I'd like to establish a dialogue here, but all you have done is paste internal links, insult me, and throw around accusations. But as I said, I respect the judgement of Wikipedia in the end. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShathaniel_1081.html" title="User:Shathaniel">Shathaniel</a> 03:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>There's already an article on <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coeliac_disease.html" title="Coeliac disease">Coeliac disease</a>. Wikipedia doesn't need an article on this band to call awareness to it. You don't get to decide the criteria under which your aricle is reviewed. It's an article about a band and the band does not merit inclusion in Wikipedia under the appropriate guideline, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:01, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I would in turn argue that Wikipedia doesn't "need" a lot of its articles...but if the article is not competely farcical or frivolous, why go to the trouble to delete it? Obviously I can't decide the criteria under which the article is reviewed, but I am allowed to recommend the light in which the article is viewed. If you believe that the entry should be deleted, then I respect that opinion. But please do not talk down to me. I believe that the article does contribute something, whether as a band or otherwise, but as I have repeatedly stated, I will respect the final judgment of the Wikipedia admins.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShathaniel_1081.html" title="User:Shathaniel">Shathaniel</a> 04:07, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
