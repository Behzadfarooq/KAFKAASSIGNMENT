<li><b>Delete</b> Almost certainly a cut and paste job from an official site - but that doesn't make it a copyvio as it's a work of the U.S. government.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The Major General seems to have an "outstanding" profile, perhaps even more than average of a typical military officer. I'm sure he has made a significant contribution in the U.S.'s military history and perhaps future; due to the fact of the many impressive military activities, events, and commands he has participated in. Also, he seems to have a wonderful assortment of high achievement awards from the military. -<a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniReb_3c1b.html" title="User:UniReb">UniReb</a> 20:41, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. I've put some serious thought into this one. I don't think every Army divisional CG is worthy of an article; most of the pages would just be CVs with boring assignment histories, kind of like the one in question here. Take it from me folks, every military commanding officer from Lt. Colonel to 4-star General has a rap sheet like <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyd_J._Austin_6552.html" title="Lloyd J. Austin">Lloyd J. Austin</a>'s. It doesn't make them notable. <a href="http://www.3maw.usmc.mil/macg38/mass3/commandelement/cobio.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.3maw.usmc.mil/macg38/mass3/commandelement/cobio.asp" rel="nofollow">Here is the rap sheet</a> for my old unit's current commanding officer, who I can whole-heartedly assure you is not notable in any way.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Generals are notable enough for mine and there is the potential for further promotion. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 00:59, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Major Generals are far more notable than many of the minor actors and actresses (particularly in adult entertainment) who are featured in Wikipedia. If command over thousands of men and tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment in the most powerful military in the world doesn't make an individual notable, then I don't know what does. In my opinion, all General officers (Brig. Generals, Rear Admirals, on up) are notable. True, there are hundreds of officers who fall into this category, but there are thousands of other individuals on Wikipedia who would never be found in Britannica (professional athletes, porn actors, etc, aside from major stars). --Honorius</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, voting on the guy, not the rank. I don't think people are notable based on rank, but based on achievement. Generals are more likely to be notable because they have the power to do very notable things, like Patton, Longstreet, Ike, and many others. They all did something, This guy rose in the ranks, put together a nice resume, but did nothing, as far as I can tell, to impact the world. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 03:54, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'd say that any general, or equivalent, has far more notability, and place in an encyclopedia, than many <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_players_5e07.html" title="List of Major League Baseball players">MLB</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_American_football_players_ef33.html" title="List of American football players">NFL</a> players, all of whom seem eligable for their own article. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelight_76ef.html" title="User:Icelight">Icelight</a> 00:22, August 2, 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, they pay tens of thousands of dollars in taxes to watch those generals on CNN. <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Sosa_e94a.html" title="Sammy Sosa">Sammy Sosa</a> I can understand, but I doubt anyone other than their imediate family paid to specifically see some third string defensive tackle warm a bench.

<ul>
<li>That's almost exactly my point. Have you seen this general on CNN? No. This gentleman is not Norman Schwartzkopf, who is the equivalent of Sammy Sosa in your reckoning. This guy is the 3rd-stringer. Even with your logic, Icelight, he's non-notable. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 18:40, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>My point is not that he's wildly notable. It's there are vigoursly defended policies on creating and keeping articles for those very 3rd string athletes I mentioned. I won't make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> by nominating the lot (and there are hundreds of one-two sentence stubs on the most minor NASCAR drivers and semi-pro golfers, etc...) but that to be consistent, we should include this man as well, as he has clearly had a much larger influence in the world, simply by being in command of so many men, irregardless of any exceptional notability. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelight_76ef.html" title="User:Icelight">Icelight</a> 18:53, August 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But what has he done with his command? As far as I can tell from the article he's never sent his men into battle, and anything short of that is going to be pretty minor. Peacetime soldiers have a hard time attaining notability, which is probably why many seem a bit over eager for war. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:59, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
