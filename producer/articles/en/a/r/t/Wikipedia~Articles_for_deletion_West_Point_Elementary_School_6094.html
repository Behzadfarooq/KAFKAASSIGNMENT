<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Here's that slippery slope we were assured wouldn't happen.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't buy the argument that high schools (sic) are notable, yet elementary schools are not. Just because there is a tradition of attending high school reunions in the USA does not make high schools more notable. All schools are notable, each have a profound impact on 1000s of people over the years, equiping them with the ability to enjoy wikipedia, for one. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 07:26, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: and to concur with Markb and add to my Keep vote above: All public schools are public institutions no matter the grade, and are administered by the same authorities. Enrollment in elementary schools is mandatory whereas not as much in high schools traditionally, and probably have a greater impact on the development of a person than high schools do. They also tend to be institutions as old or older than high schools. High schools granted are larger institutuions, but it is one factor among many to compare notability. I do not see the obviousness of how high schools are inherently so much more notable than elementary schools. And in my eyes, the reason why notability has any concern to a non-paper encyclopedia is because of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and as public institutions there should be enough information available via these public agencies to ensure verifiability. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 08:03, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is that most of the borderline school articles have no source citations but the school's own website... while easily obtained official sources usually contain only basic statistics that would be better presented in tabular form than as a stubby paragraph. As I write this, <b>this</b> article cites no sources at all and thus is not in accord with the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:06, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A <i>few</i> elementary schools are certainly notable. <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Wilhelm_August_Fr%C3%B6bel_2262.html" title="Friedrich Wilhelm August FrÃ¶bel">Froebel</a>'s original kindergarten (which literally included a garden... there I've seen cute pictures of little German kids working in it), the original <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montessori_method.html" title="Montessori method">Montessori</a> schools, <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summerhill_School_ea51.html" title="Summerhill School">Summerhill</a>. These would be encyclopedically explained by reference to the unique, pioneering and controversial educational philosophies of their founders. It is very unlikely that West Point Elementary School falls in this category. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:49, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, it's a fact. They've been using it in various forms for at least a century. AFAIK it's not trademarked or anything. I don't believe for a microsecond that Jimbo is unaware of it. I don't know for sure but I rather think Jimbo expects people to catch the reference. "The sum of human knowledge" means "something sorta-kinda-vaguely-like the Britannica, not some whole totally 'nother thing." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 03:21, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It's a fact that the Britannica used it as a slogan, but I was wrong about Jimbo intentionally referring to it. I emailed him and he said "I had no idea actually. It could perhaps be that I subconsciously got it in that way, of course." He credits the line as you quoted it to Erik Moeller and himself, when preparing his first public talk about Wikipedia in Berlin circa 2003. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:20, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
