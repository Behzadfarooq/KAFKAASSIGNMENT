<li>No there isn't. This as it stands is a dictionary article, not an encyclopaedia article. There's nothing here that cannot be said in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beaner" class="extiw" title="wikt:beaner">wikt:beaner</a>, and in fact there are several things that Wiktionary says that this article doesn't. It has <i>zero</i> information to sustain an <i>encyclopaedia</i> article. There's no scope to write an encyclopaedia article about beaners here, for the simple reason that the proper title for writing about Mexicans is of course <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican.html" title="Mexican">Mexican</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. We don't have separate articles for each individual slang name for parts of the human body, and we don't have separate articles for individual slang names for classes of people. We have articles on parts of the human body, and on classes of people, by their proper titles.

<ul>
<li>No, we don't. You appear to be confused by thinking these are the <i>only</i> slang names that can be used. I suggest learning more about slang. A quick trip to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wikisaurus:chav" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wikisaurus:chav">wikt:Wikisaurus:chav</a> should prove to be an informative start. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:37, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, I don't know what the heck you're talking about, so we must be on two totally different wavelengths.<br />
"<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chink.html" title="Chink">Chink</a>," "<a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>," "<a href="../../../k/i/k/Kike.html" title="Kike">kike</a>" and "<a href="../../../s/p/i/Spic.html" title="Spic">spic</a>" are individual slang names for classes of people. You claimed that "we don't have separate articles for individual slang names for classes of people," but each of those terms has a separate article. What am I missing here? —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 20:45, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll elucidate. Look at the Wikisaurus entry that I pointed to. There are a <i>lot</i> of slang names for this class of people. We don't have individual articles about chavs under all of those separate titles. We have one article on the stereotype, and redirects from a few alternative names (including <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charva.html" title="Charva">charva</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chavette.html" title="Chavette">chavette</a>, for examples). Now look at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wikisaurus:penis" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wikisaurus:penis">wikt:Wikisaurus:penis</a>. We don't have individual articles about penises under all of those slang names. We have one article about penises at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a>, with (largely preventative) redirects at a few names such as <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schlong.html" title="Schlong">schlong</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weenie.html" title="Weenie">weenie</a>. The task of writing individual articles on individual slang words, documenting their multiple meanings and when they were in use, and collecting and cross-referencing lists of synonyms, is lexicography, that is the remit of the "lexical companion to Wikipedia" whose goal is to be a dictionary (of slang and otherwise, like other dictionaries) and thesaurus. As you can see from how far it has got with it <i>already</i>, it is a task that Wiktionary can do exceedingly well, far better than one could <i>ever</i> hope to do at Wikipedia (given, for starters, that Wikipedia's article titles are in English).
<p>Now an article title in Wikipedia denotes its subject. An article entitled beaner should be about beaners. But "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beaner" class="extiw" title="wikt:beaner">beaner</a>" (considerations of "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Beaner" class="extiw" title="wikt:Beaner">Beaner</a>" being a surname and our having a name disambiguation article here aside) is simply a slang name for a Mexican. We shouldn't have an article on Mexicans under <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaner.html" title="Beaner">beaner</a> any more than we should have an article on penises under <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weenie.html" title="Weenie">weenie</a>. Similarly, we could have an article on the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantic_change.html" title="Semantic change">amelioration</a> of slurs. But that, too, doesn't belong under <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaner.html" title="Beaner">beaner</a> because (a) the subject of the article would be amelioration of slurs not beaners, and (b) "beaner" isn't the only ethnic slur that people are attempting to ameliorate, by a long chalk, and such a scope is a ridiculously narrow one for the overall discussion. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:42, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>None of the above is relevant to fact that your claim was false. We <i><b>do</b></i> have separate articles for individual slang names for classes of people.<br />
Of course we wouldn't write an article about Mexicans under the title "Beaner." That's a straw man argument. The "<a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>" article isn't about black people, nor is the "<a href="../../../k/i/k/Kike.html" title="Kike">kike</a>" article about Jews. These articles document the words themselves (and <i>can</i> extend far beyond the level of information appropriate for a dictionary). I'm not implying that we should have such an article for <i>every</i> ethnic slur (or for "beaner"), but it's patently incorrect to claim that we have articles for none. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 22:08, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Rubbish. It's entirely relevant, because it's what I have asserted right from the start. <b>No, we do not have separate articles for all of these slang names.</b> I've given you several examples of where we have just one article, for things that have lots of slang names. Your straw man argument, saying that I asserted that we don't have articles about these stereotypes at all simply in order to rebut it as "patently incorrect", is no more than that: a straw man. "We have articles on parts of the human body, and on classes of people, by their proper titles." was in what I wrote right at the start, too. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:13, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, what the hell are you talking about? It certainly isn't the same thing that <i>I'm</i> talking about.<br />
1. When did I say that we have separate articles for every slang name? On the contrary, I explicitly noted that "I'm not implying that we should have such an article for every ethnic slur." In fact, I don't even believe that we should have an article for "<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaner.html" title="Beaner">beaner</a>."<br />
2. I did <i><b>not</b></i> claim that you asserted that "we don't have articles about these stereotypes at all." In fact, I made no reference to articles about stereotypes, and I don't know why you keep referencing such a concept. The articles that I cited are about the words themselves (just as the "<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaner.html" title="Beaner">beaner</a>" article is), <i>not</i> the people that the words offensively describe.<br />
Again, you claimed that "we don't have separate articles for individual slang names for classes of people." <b>WE DO.</b> We don't have one for <i>every</i> ethnic slur, but some have had enough cultural impact to warrant such write-ups. Is "beaner" one of them? I don't believe so, but that's beside the point. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 01:42, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've explained what I'm talking about at length. When you said it was just above in this very discussion. (Your very words were "Yes, we do.".) You most certainly did create that straw man which you then proceeded to knock down. (Your very words were "claim that we have articles for none".) And we do not have separate articles for the individual slang names. You can see this for yourself, and your continued assertions to the contrary are flying directly in the face of evidence that we can all actually <i>see</i>. Just look at the things that I said to look at above. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:03, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>We <i>do</i> have separate articles for the individual slang names. You can see this for yourself, and your continued assertions to the contrary are flying directly in the face of evidence that we can all actually <i>see</i>: <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chink.html" title="Chink">Chink</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Nigger</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/k/Kike.html" title="Kike">Kike</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spic.html" title="Spic">Spic</a>.<br />

<ul>
<li>Once again: Look at the lists of slang names that I've already pointed to; and note that we don't have individual articles for each individual name on those lists. You can actually see for yourself that we don't have separate articles for each of the individual slang names for these classes of people/parts of the body. I've even pointed out some of the redirects. Just look at the things that I said to look at above. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:28, 31 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Once again: Look at the list of slang names that I've already pointed to (<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chink.html" title="Chink">chink</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/k/Kike.html" title="Kike">kike</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spic.html" title="Spic">spic</a>) and note that we have individual articles for each individual name on that list. You can actually see for yourself that we have separate articles for each of these individual slang names for classes of people. Just look at the things that I said to look at above.<br />
You've listed words for which no articles exist and cited them as evidence that "we don't have separate articles for individual slang names for classes of people." That claim is false, as are your claims that "an article entitled beaner should be about beaners" and that a hypothetical <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weenie.html" title="Weenie">weenie</a> article would be about penises. Again, the articles that I have cited are about the slurs themselves, <i><b>not</b></i> the ethnic groups to which they offensively refer. The fact that many slang terms lack the societal impact to warrant the existence of standalone articles does <i>not</i> mean that we shouldn't have articles about <i>any</i> slang terms. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 16:50, 31 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>You've listed words for which no articles exist and cited them as evidence that "we don't have separate articles for individual slang names for classes of people."</i> — That's because the non-existence of articles <i>is</i> evidence that we do not have articles. I'm not sure how much plainer that fact could be. And if you don't think that an article entitled "beaner" should be about beaners, then you clearly need to read our <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a> and other help pages. Article titles denote what articles are about. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:38, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1. You've provided evidence of the fact that we lack articles about many slang terms (which is not in dispute). <b>This does not establish that we don't have articles about <i>any</i> slang terms.</b> (I've provided evidence that we <i>do</i> have articles about some.) What you're doing is comparable to naming people for whom we have no articles and citing this as evidence that we don't have articles about people.<br />
2. Again, the article's subject is the word "beaner." Hence, the title is "<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaner.html" title="Beaner">beaner</a>." Similarly, our "<a href="../../../k/i/k/Kike.html" title="Kike">kike</a>" article is not about kikes (an offensive term for Jews). It's about the word "kike."<br />
But again, I'm not arguing that we should have a standalone "beaner" article. I'm pointing out that your rationale is 100% incorrect. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 03:51, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are confused about our <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy. We don't keep dictionary articles simply because they have more than 1 paragraph. We keep <i>encyclopaedia</i> articles. There is <i>still</i> no encyclopaedia article content in this article. All that has happened is that <i>more dictionary article content has been added</i>. More usage information has been added, on the point of whether the word has pejorative connotations or not. This is canonical "usage note" territory for a dictionary. The article is <i>still</i> a dictionary article, only longer. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:31, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The problem here is basically simple: damned if I do, damned if I don't. If I keep, we have a dicdef as an article. If we delete, a technicality causes us to remove content that is otherwise documentable.

<li>Uncle G: I'm guessing by your style of English that you're hailing from outside of North America; I think in your hastiness to condemn this article as being unworthy of an encyclopedic article, and being merely a slightly expanded dictionary entry, that you're failing to realize that his term does indeed carry quite a bit of cultural significance in the southwesten United States, particularly in southern California. Yes, as the article stands now it is only a stub, but given the nature of this specific term there is unquestionably the capability for it to be expanded substantially. Certainly to well beyond the scope of the ethnic slurs article. --<a href="../../../y/o/r/User%7EYorick8080_7e8c.html" title="User:Yorick8080">Bri</a> 07:54, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Per the GFDL, we cannot delete the revision history while leaving the merged text in place. Does anyone actually advocate removing it from that article?

<li>My stance is this - in the current condition, it's a dictionary definition. Like you point out, it could use more information - but for the simple definition portion, it's not suitable for WP's purposes. We're not a dictionary.

<li>In the short term, I don't really care. In the long term, that page should also be moved into Wiktionary. The growing consensus across both projects is that <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Appendices" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Appendices">Wiktionary appendices</a> are better suited for list of slang (or list of pretty much any other set of words) pages. We can easily create cross-wiki links wherever that is appropriate but, in general, the editors who frequent Wiktionary have better skills and tools to write, source and verify lexical content than we do. Since the content of Beaner has already been transwiki'd, there would be no remaining GFDL issues once the slang list is also moved over. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 23:24, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and expand.</b> The article for "nigger" contains substantial information on the word's changing usage (especially in public discourse), its representation in literature, and so on.

<li><b>Keep.</b> <i>Deletion simply doesn't make sense</i>. Even if this is determined to be a dicdef (which I'm not certain it is) it still should be merged with Wiktionary, since no one's arguing the content isn't suited to Wiktionary. If this is to be redirected, again, simply merge the content.</li>
<li>As for whether this is dictionary or encyclopedic content, the main issue seems to be what constitutes usage notes. According to the standard presented in <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">"Wikipedia is not a usage guide"</a>, "Wikipedia is not in the business of saying how words should be used." Which is basically the standard, prescriptivist usage writing philosophy, as enunciated by Geoffrey Nunberg<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/7.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/7.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. There is also the descriptivist view, which simply "records the facts of how a word is used and presents it in a neutral way". Which is the only way I can see this article being construed as a dictionary article. The problem with this definition of a dictionary article is that there isn't a very clear line between encyclopedic and dictionary content, since both try to "record the facts and present them in a neutral way". If you hold that <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> is talking about descriptivist usage notes, even though <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> is clearly talking about usage notes under the prescriptivist model, then the logical consequence is that all articles about words ought to be deleted, since there isn't anything to write about a word other than how it has been used historically and how it is perceived, all of which can be parts of a descriptivist usage note. However, since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> doesn't forbid articles about words, and even explicitly states that articles about slang terms are acceptable, and since <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> describes usage notes as "describing how a word should be used", we shouldn't impose outside conceptions of what usage notes are on Wikipedia and just follow policy. I would say this should be merged into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">List of ethnic slurs</a>, but the size of this is getting to the point where it should be in a separate article. --<a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotJackhorkheimer_b41b.html" title="User:NotJackhorkheimer">notJackhorkheimer</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/User_talk%7ENotJackhorkheimer_17fc.html" title="User talk:NotJackhorkheimer">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NotJackhorkheimer_ed1a.html" title="Special:Contributions/NotJackhorkheimer">contribs</a>)</sup> 18:28, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
