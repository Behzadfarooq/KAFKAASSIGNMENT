<p>Failed candidate for US Senate in Maine who got 5% of the vote. A previous version of the page also discussed his academic career, but he does not meet <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>, as he is not a noted expert in his field and hasn't published a well-known work.

<dd><s><b>Comment</b>: 5% for third party candidates is not unusual (or notable, for that matter) in races where there is not a competitive major party challenger. I'm all for a generous definition of notability while an election is under way: People need a real-time reference. But after it's over, if the subject of an article's only claim to notability is that they lost an election, and not even a close one -- how does that article serve the readers of Wikipedia? Who is possibly going to look it up, and to what end? 5% of Maine voters is more than enough to overwhelm "rough consensus" here, but not enough to warrant what would be, in effect, a memorial. If this article is going to be kept, then we need clearer guidelines that will be applied across the board to protect the articles of similarly non-notable candidates that get deleted every day in the absence of a Wiki-literate fan club. Otherwise, a keep decision would enforce an arbitrary bias. -- <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShunpiker_0ed5.html" title="User:Shunpiker">Shunpiker</a> 18:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</s></dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: I still think this article is more of a memorial than a useful reference, but I'm withdrawing my "delete" vote based on the fact that the bar seems to be lower than I imagined: I found more than a few unchallenged articles for candidates who polled significantly worse in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_elections%2C_2006_21cb.html" title="United States Senate elections, 2006">2006 Senate elections</a>, and who also appear to be notable only for their lapsed candidacies: <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Ferrucci_6d38.html" title="Ralph Ferrucci">Ralph Ferrucci</a> (0.5% CT), <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Fitzgerald_%28politician%29_6aeb.html" title="Robert Fitzgerald (politician)">Robert Fitzgerald</a> (3% MN), <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Cavlan_1f45.html" title="Michael Cavlan">Michael Cavlan</a> (0.5% MN), Ben Powers (0.3% MN), <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Jones_3fd6.html" title="Stan Jones">Stan Jones</a> (3% MT), <a href="../../../n/2E/_/N._Leonard_Smith_a522.html" title="N.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Actually, 5% in a major election is considered a major accomplishment for a 3rd party candidate in the US and is frequently considered past the threshold of "factor". In California it was the case with <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Camejo_e4c1.html" title="Peter Camejo">Peter Camejo</a> in the 2002 Gubernatorial election where he got just over 5% of the vote (that's why he was allowed to participate in the 2003 recall election debates). --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 05:50, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Nonetheless, this discssion is about this person in particular. Arbitrary thresholds are just that: arbitrary. If this person was a factor in the election, it will have been reported and documented, and you will be able to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">point to</a> non-trivial published works that discuss this person.

<li><b>Keep</b>As the original contributor who fought to have him stay on here for the election, and then shrunk his bio down to mark his relevance to the national election, I would say, he has a place. A small place, but as a third party candidate running against the most popular incumbent in the senate, and still getting 5%, I would say it is worthy of note...small note yes, but noteworthy.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitchsensei_57ae.html" title="User:Mitchsensei">Mitchsensei</a> 06:37, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure why you advocate keeping a stub that you think should not be expanded and that, looking at the article history, you appear to have shrunk from a longer article. If we do not have a proper article on him (and by your own admission we shouldn't have one) it is better for our readers to discuss him in a larger context. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 20:51, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wikipedia is a place people go to seek information. I can think of a lot more useless information on here than information on a third party candidate for one of the most relevant political institutions on the planet. Now, having said that, I don't think there will be much extended discussion about Mr. Slavick. In fact, this deletion discussion is perhaps the biggest post-mortem his candidacy will get.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitchsensei_57ae.html" title="User:Mitchsensei">Mitchsensei</a> 04:34, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I would not object to that outcome.

<li>It's an arbitrary figure and should not be a criterion. As stated above, if this person was a "factor" in the election, that will have been documented, <i>whatever</i> the percentage of the vote.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> per Oakshade and SYSSMOUSE. I don't think that getting five percent is a priori notable. For major party candidates it is almost impossible to field below 10% because partisans will automatically vote for their party's candidates. However, it is somewhat impressive for a third party candidate he does have election coverage from very faw away so he wasn't just a local phenomenon. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:45, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
