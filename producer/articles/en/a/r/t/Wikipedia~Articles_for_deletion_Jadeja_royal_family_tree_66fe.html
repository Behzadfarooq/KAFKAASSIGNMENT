The liniage is certainly notable. There are notable people along it. It does need work and explication. It would be nice to have proper references, the author indicated that his source was <i>Kutch deshno itihash</i> by Aatmaram Keshavji Dwivedi. Printed from "Nirnay sagar" Mumbai Samvat 1932; shake 1798. With my limited library and not speaking Hindi, I haven't been able to verify its existance. But the book <i>The coinage of Kutch</i> by Richard K Bright (1975), may provide additional verification.

<li><b>Delete</b> First of all, and I may be wrong about this, but Wikipedia is not supposed to be any sort of genealogical guide. Second of all, the 'tree' isn't really a tree, doesn't even seem to show marriage and the like. Third of all, none of the names offer links to articles or any context whatsoever. The 'article,' if you can call it that, isn't the least bit wikified. No explanation of relevance, no sources. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:13, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

It is primarily a list of rulers, although it does have a genealogical component just as does the list of the rulers of the United Kingdom. <a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 18:33, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Point Two. This is not a tree, despite the label. One needs to look at what it is, not what one thinks the label suggests it to be. This article needs work and constructive criticism. But its notability should be above challange.</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Point Three. This clearly needs work. However, when <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Waywrote</a> his comment the article did state its relevance at the beginning, as per <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> above. That edit was at 04:36, 25 October 2006. Yes the article is not properly linked. It does need work as does most of the history of Kutch.

<dd><b>Comment</b> There are at least a couple of ways to look at you comment. We should delete all fiction from the Wikipedia, or legendary ancestors require deletion, or as an anti-religious statement that decent from the creator, Brahma, must be fiction? Regardless, as argument for deletion, it would require deletion of the Japanese imperial family who are decended from the sun god. Rationally the need to separate fact from fiction is not a reason to delete entire articles. It may be a reason to work as an editor on an article. <a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 20:04, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I meant it should probably be said that mythology says that they are descended from Brahma. The way it looks now is as if it is absolute fact. Legendary ancestors do not require deletion if they are verified as being legendary but if they are passed as legendary then that is confusing to the reader. Even so I doubt that Brahma is considered part of the Jadeja royal family in the same way as <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom_5e8e.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> is not considered part of many royal families in Europe except for the British royal family. They both had descendants in many royal families. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinosaur_puppy_8f46.html" title="User:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:yellow" face="Verdana" color="darkgreen">T REX</font></a><sub><a href="../../../d/i/n/User_talk%7EDinosaur_puppy_fe12.html" title="User talk:Dinosaur puppy"><font style="background:darkgreen" face="Tahoma" color="yellow"><b>speak</b></font></a></sub> 20:51, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have moved this article to List of members of the Jadeja royal family to better reflect that it is a list and not a tree. I've also cleaned it up a bit. Some others here have apparently found some sources and additional information about these people, which should be added to the article. I'd say <b>keep</b> an list about a royal family in a part of the world that many Wikipedia editors know little about. ~ <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</small> 16:14, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - It's somewhat easier to research British royals than Gujarati royals, especially for English speakers with internet access. This is one source of systemic bias. It isn't surprising that our English royal articles are better. Still, the subject is notable, the content verifiable, and this text, even if it is poor now, contains some information, and may be helpful to someone who wants to improve it. Not worthy of deletion IMO.- <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 20:36, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm reconsidering my support for deletion... however, there are still significant problems with the article. First of all, it's just a list of names and the little blurb doesn't supply anywhere near enough context. The names certainly ALL need to be accompanied by the years in which that person rules. Also, any names which have articles of their own should link to that person's page. More context, years of leadership and article links... if it had these I'd support keeping it, especially because of Wikipedia's drive to rid itself of systemic bias. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 18:42, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
