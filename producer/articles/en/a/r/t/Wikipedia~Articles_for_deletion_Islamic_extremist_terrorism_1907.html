<p>Fictitious concept created by a small faction of Wikipedians in an effort to be politically correct. This concept is clearly separate from the real topic it pretends to address, <b>Islamic terrorism</b>. The same thing applies with Zionist political violence, which should be Zionist terrorism, and "Allegations of Israeli apartheid," which should be Israeli apartheid. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 03:44, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>While some editors might suggest moving the current page to the title Islamic terrorism, there really isnt anything worth salvaging from the current, pov, uncited mess. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 03:46, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strongly Delete</b> I wonder these people who claim to be philosophers and intellectuals on wikipedia. Tell me, you people really dont know the hypocrisy of news media? Did you ever hear the term 'terrorism by israel'? How many times you hear the 'christian extremist terrorism' on FOX and CNN. Does one FOX, CBC and CNN comprise all the media of the world. You Americans please come out of this Bubble created by few news channels. There is more to the world than a couple of hypocrite American channels.</li>
<li>Now people will think why am I criticizing in this way. My point is, there is no such thing called 'islamic terrorism' or 'islamic extremist terrorism' in under the definition which is being provided by wikipedians here. How many countries North Korea or Syria or Iran have ruined??? NONE. How many countries American regime ruined? Dozen. How many people killed by American regime? Millions. Even then there is not even a single day when the channels dont yell the self created term 'islamic terrorism'. So my point is, the same is happening on the wikipedia articles. Muslims just cant defend by correct editing because very very minor percentage of Muslims have access to the internet. Any website goes to number one in the ranke which is used by Americans , that does not comply that it is number one in the world too. Please see the www.msn.com ranking on www.alexa.com <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=http://www.msn.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=http://www.msn.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Its number second, but in non-American and non-Eu countries, nobody even thinks to visit that site. So to be fair please give value to the limited number of disagreeing people who come from technologically less developed areas. Please see <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9071731896689197790" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9071731896689197790" rel="nofollow">this</a> and [<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7828123714384920696" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7828123714384920696" rel="nofollow">this</a> refernce before reacting to my post. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualEye_6b62.html" title="User:VirtualEye">VirtualEye</a> 12:25, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The nominator seems to be making two arguments, that the page is uncited, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_terrorism.html#References" title="Islamic terrorism">which is absurd</a>, and that it's POV, which he's made no evident attempt to fix or address first. There's really no valid reason presented to delete this article.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 04:26, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>About 40% of the article is uncited. And for your information, I have done more to correct Wikipedia's information on terrorism than is required for me to open a debate on this topic, which is none at all. I suggest you take a look at <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism_in_Kazakhstan_a7b2.html" title="Terrorism in Kazakhstan">Terrorism in Kazakhstan</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-terrorism_in_Kazakhstan_6caa.html" title="Counter-terrorism in Kazakhstan">Counter-terrorism in Kazakhstan</a>, the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Movement_of_Uzbekistan_4513.html" title="Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan">Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan</a>, <a href="../../../j/c/a/JCAM_430f.html" title="JCAM">JCAM</a>, and <a href="../../../h/t/_/HT_90d6.html" title="HT">HT</a> before making such bold statements. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 05:10, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If 40% is uncited, then add cite tags. Just because an article lacks citations for asserted facts does not mean that it is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>, which then would prompt deletion. In any case, the fact that you've tried to make other articles neutral has no bearing on this article. Deleting for POV concerns comes only after thorough attempts have been made to make the article NPOV. Only irredeemably or inherently POV articles get deleted. The current POV tag was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_extremist_terrorism&amp;diff=83505788&amp;oldid=83505513" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_extremist_terrorism&amp;diff=83505788&amp;oldid=83505513" rel="nofollow">added 24 October</a> and there has been no conversation related to <i>that</i> POV claim on the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamic_extremist_terrorism_0719.html" title="Talk:Islamic extremist terrorism">talk page</a>. In fact, the tagger, <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFarhansher_7fdc.html" title="User:Farhansher">User:Farhansher</a>, hasn't posted to the talk page since placing the tag.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 05:56, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sure, footnote 24 is citing a source discussing the issue. Googling "Islamic extremist terrorism " gets me a few thousand hits (not counting Wikipedia and its derivatives). This <a href="http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/02/585e69f9-0847-4e76-9750-14d31a46bd81.html|news" class="external text" title="http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/02/585e69f9-0847-4e76-9750-14d31a46bd81.html|news" rel="nofollow">story</a> an Islamic extremist supporting terrorism. OTH, if all it is you want is "Islamic extremist terrorism" together, your barking up the wrong tree. What you seem to object to is the words "Islamic", "extremist", "terrorist" put together in describing Islamic terrorism. I suggest a name change for the article as described below. --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 06:44, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Why is there <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_extremist_terrorism.html" title="Christian extremist terrorism">Christian extremist terrorism</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_extremist_terrorism.html" title="Islamic extremist terrorism">Islamic extremist terrorism</a> but no <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_extremist_terrorism.html" title="Zionist extremist terrorism">Zionist extremist terrorism</a>? Instead, there is <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_political_violence.html" title="Zionist political violence">Zionist political violence</a>. I see a clear double standard here. Either the Zionist article should be renamed to this convention, or the Christian and Islamic terrorism articles should be renamed to "political violence", i.e. Christian political violence and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_political_violence.html" title="Islamic political violence">Islamic political violence</a>. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> applies especially to cases such as this. metaspheres 06:08, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is no such term as "extremist terrorism." They should all be terrorism. That's what people call their acts. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 06:15, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think the article is supposed to be about <i>extremist terrorism</i> but <i>terrorism by Islamic extremists</i>, highlighting the fact that only a minority viewpoint within the religion have engaged in terrorism. If called <i>Islamic terrorism</i> it would suggest the entire religion engages in or supports terrorism. -<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 12:11, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'd suggest a centralized discussion in an attempt to create a consensus for the naming of all three articles. That's what was attempted with the "...apartheid" articles, though I'm not sure how successful it was at achieving consensus.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 06:16, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This kind of thing is always prone to stubbornness, so I agree that it is probably very difficult to reach any consensus, but I believe it's still possible, though we could probably kill two birds with one stone by renaming this right here and now. Though KazakhPol's point is valid, the fact remains that we have to be consistent with NPOV, which would necessitate replacing "terrorism" with "political violence" in the article titles. The reason being that the article does not simply discuss al-Qaeda (which is universally viewed as terrorist except by its own supporters) but other groups as well. I'm not sure why KazahkPol would nominate this article for deletion when he seems only opposed to the article title. Anyway, for what its worth, I say <b>rename</b> to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_political_violence.html" title="Islamic political violence">Islamic political violence</a>. Same for the Christian one. metaspheres 06:45, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that should be discussed here. Usually renaming discussion happens on the article's talk page. If you need more input, list at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">Wikipedia:Requested moves</a>, which is also linked above. Forcing mergers sometimes happens at AfD, but there's really no point in forcing a rename, especially with the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Talk%7EIslamist_terrorism_Archive_of_page_move_debate_20c8.html" title="Talk:Islamist terrorism/Archive of page move debate">enormous history of controversy</a> over the name of this article. AfD, with its five day time limit, is too quick and stressful and dirty for a rename of this article, let alone a completely different one. Also look at <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html#Religion_and_terrorism_pages" title="User talk:Kchase02">User_talk:Kchase02#Religion_and_terrorism_pages</a>, as KazakhPol may be starting a centralized discussion on the names of all the articles sometime soon.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 06:52, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The AfD process is not a vote, but a discussion by which to reach consensus. Often times the result is to merge or rename an article, rather than to delete. See for example <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ethnic_politics_of_Khuzestan_2890.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ethnic politics of Khuzestan">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ethnic politics of Khuzestan</a> which resulted in a rename to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a>. This is as good a place as any to discuss and the issue is clear cut and simple. Either you are in favor of "terrorism" or you are not, and five days is more than enough time to reach such a consensus. If consensus can't be reached within five days, it won't be reached in five weeks or five months. metaspheres 08:32, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You'd be surprised how many AfD's can't reach consensus in five days and go through relisting, deletion review, mediation, etc. Anyway, it's unusual for a rename to happen at AfD, in part because the forum isn't necessary for that purpose. Just look at the numbers below "move" that you see at <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_AFD_summary_All_8df7.html" title="User:Dragons flight/AFD summary/All">User:Dragons_flight/AFD_summary/All</a>. Frankly, saying it's as "clear cut and simple" as whether you favor "terrorism" in the title or don't is reducing the issue to a vote. My experience through hundreds of AfD discussions has taught me that a simple vote isn't usually helpful for consensus building.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 09:17, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please do not move comments. As I have stated, the AfD process is a discussion, not a vote. metaspheres 09:17, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep, rename</b> metaspheres is right on. These articles should be kept. But there is no justification whatsoever, other than home bias, for naming the "Christian", "Zionist" and "Islamic" forms differently. "Political violence" is probably more appropriate than "terrorism", but the most fundamental thing in keeping with Wikipedia's NPOV and <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> is that they be labelled <b>the same</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> on rename. If these pages are to be renamed I propose the format: "<i>terrorism by X'</i>" or "<i>political violence by X</i>". Otherwise it reads as if one can commit acts of terrorism/political violence in a Christian or Islamic manner. The religion is relevant to the cause the terrorists are attempting to advance, not the acts of terrorism per se. An act of Christian terrorism would be in substance the same as an act of Islamic terrorism, but with a different objective. -<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 14:34, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep, no move</b>. Articles like this make WP superior to many other info sources, even if they're controversial and under contention. My OED (Concise, 11th Ed.) defines "Islamist" as both <i>n.</i> and <i>adj.</i> but moving pages just for a usage of similar words is trite and disruptive. I also find the grounds for deletion to be FAR from neutral. Better to work on the article to make it concise, NPOV, and well cited than to complain.

<li><b>Comment</b>The crusades deals with a specific historical event (actually a series of events) which is very well defined. "Islamic extremist terrorism" is whatever any editor wants to make it of it no matter how ludicrous including at various times, believe it or not, the Barbary Pirates and the PFLP (Marxist-Leninist organization). Recently there's been an endless revert war over whether to include an enormous chunk of quoted material from a US university student (reputedly a heavy stoner) who went nuts and injured some people with his car. Since the guy claims to be a Muslim and he claims that God told him to do it, therefore it's "Islamic extremist terrorism". I argued against it till I was blue in the face and finally gave up in disgust. There is NO need for this article. It's just a place for people to vent their paranoid fantasies about Islam. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 15:34, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It is a violation of NPOV for Wikipedia to call anything terrorist. We can have sentences like "X claims that organization Y is terrorist...", but not something like "Organization Y is a terrorist group founded by Z". Terrorist is a pejorative term, and unacceptable as a classification in a encyclopedia.

<dd>???? You have to do your homework better. "Terrorism" is a legally defined term by a United Nations Convention. <b>It is not a pejorative</b> term, it is in the same category as "murder", "rape", "theft", as defined by laws. Calling someone a murderer if he has been convicted of murder is not pejorative. There is a distinct definition of the word "terrorism" (see the relevant UN Convention) and <b>those who commit terrorism are terrorists</b>. It is as simple as that. I had enough of this politically correct bruhaha jumping into a wide range of articles and pretending that they know better as if the others are not aware of the bulk of human knowledge and civilization. Terrorist is not the same thing as nigger, since there is no such act "to nigger" - if there was such an act, then the people who niggerded would be niggers. However terrorism is an act, and people who "terrorize" (as defined legally by the UN) are terrorists. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 09:56, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're missing the point. Using the United Nations Convention's definition of the term "terrorism" is a violation of NPOV. This is Wikipedia, an international encyclopedia that should not adhere to any points of views, and in this case the view of the United Nations. I am arguing this point because if we use "terrorist" or "terrorism" the way you intend to do so, it will contradict our very own article on <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a> which discusses this in depth. Also, "murder", "rape", and "theft", are not internationally agreed upon crimes. In one country, an action can be "murder", while in another "manslaughter", while in yet another "justifiable homicide". by calling someone's actions <b>murder</b>, Wikipedia is promoting a POV, which is a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV policy</a>. Same goes for "rape", "sexual assault", etc. We <b>can</b>, however, say that "according to the UN, these are acts of terrorism" etc., but if we go and say "This is an act of terrorism", then that is impermissible as content for an article. This has nothing to do with political correctness, and has all to do with Wikipedia policy. --<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirbytime_cc43.html" title="User:Kirbytime"><font color="red">Ķĩřβȳ</font></a><a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam"><font color="green">♥</font></a><a href="../../../k/i/r/User_talk%7EKirbytime_d8cd.html" title="User talk:Kirbytime"><font color="pink">Ťįɱé</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kirbytime_b7f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kirbytime"><font color="blue">Ø</font></a> 22:45, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know that policy very well. It says words to "avoid" and <i>not</i> "banned" words. It can be used if there is an overwhelming concensus.

<dd>Aha.. Why are people pretending not to have "common sense" and the basic rules of the English language? <b>Those who are committing their acts <i>with the intent</i> of terrorizing civilians are terrorists</b>. I mean, is this so hard to understand? It doesn't even matter one bit what they believe or feel. This is the BASIC tenets of English language, your intent is to terrorize? Then that's terrorism. Quite simple really. It is definitely political correctness to say "oh well, he murdered that guy, but we cannot call him a murderer; we have to say "he was convicted of murder by this court". WP:ENGLISH also applies in Wikipedia I am afraid. There are those who have been repeatedly called terrorists, and they do act to terrorize others, therefore they are terrorists. You honestly cannot expect others to say "September 11 was a militant attack committed by those who have been labelled as terrorists by X, Y and Z"!! It doesn't matter that those wackos falsely believed that they would be banging 40 virgins after they exploded into thousand pieces&#160;:) They did it to terrorize others, ergo they are terrorists. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 23:06, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Lee Hunter is absolutely right, you know. If there was an admin with the balls, he/she would delete this on the grounds that it's an egregious breach of the policies here, regardless how many vote for it. Articles that are titled with epithets should either be about the epithet or have their titles and tenor changed to something more neutral. And an epithet is what this is. It's a ragbag term for any act of violence that a/ we disapprove of, b/ is done by Muslims, c/ whose views we can characterise as extreme (while ignoring that they would characterise our secularism as equally extreme). We do not call the bombing of Baghdad "Christian extremist terrorism" even though Mr Bush a/ is a Christian, b/ is intolerant of solutions to governance that he doesn't approve of and c/ has ordered the destruction of civilian infrastructure and acts that he knew would kill civilians, among other acts of violence. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 08:16, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
