<p>Lack of notability, nothing in this page meets the parameters outlined in <s><a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> or</s> <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>.

<li>I have been stressing over this particular AfD since I nominated it. And the more I'm watching it and digging into web-based sources, the more I am leaning toward thinking this article should be kept. Primarily because I think that there is something notable here, not long after I nominated this article the original writer made an edit at 01:08, 20 November 2006. This edit concerned gang violence and was almost immediate removed by the writer stating "Taken out 'Gang Violence' Para, Staff requested removal." I am thinking that I would like to revert this article to the edit listed above, and give this article some more time to declare itself notable, time to dig into this subject a little bit more and research the gang violence problem this school has. That being said, I am changing my opinion on this article to a weak <b>keep</b>. Should research fail to pan out any useful claim to notability, there is plenty of time to revisit deletion later. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETrusilver_ae53.html" title="User:Trusilver">Trusilver</a> 07:48, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Schools educate, mold our youth, create memories, experiences and should be considered something more. I'm Wiki newbie, but feel strongly about this, am I misunderstanding something?? -- Chisrule 01:59, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's an argument for schools being notable as a whole not an argument for schools being notable in the particular (there's some term for this fallacy but I don't remember it off the top of my head). Note also that school deletions have generally been highly controversial. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:19, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But doesnt their staus imply notability in itself. They also have multiple non-trivial works published about them.

<li>Are you arguing that that means it passes the notability guidelines? <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:54, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And some people (such as myself) wouldn't object to revisiting the rules for villages and professional athletes. Just because we have a bad precedent on one thing doesn't justify it on others. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:19, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We all all know that public schools, especially high schools, receieve regular independent coverage in local media. Pretending otherwise is nonsense. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 08:12, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, the get regular coverage, i.e. routine and and trivial coverage with minimal editorial oversight or anything else. Indeed, it is often difficult to tell when such coverage is even independent and even when it is its very regular nature makes it trivial. We don't have articles about every single murderer even if the local papers will cover each one in depth. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:54, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you think this is about whether the school has an article or not you are abusing the deletion system and wasting our time, something I am very bitter about. You may equate "routine" with "trivial" but there is not particular reason anyone else should; yes many trivial events are covered but so are important ones. It adds up to proof that the school is important in the community and that there is potential for separate article if enough research is done. A one-off murder is usually a news event, not a enduring institution. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 03:02, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> on the grounds of duplicated information ONLY. The notable aspects are already covered at <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macgregor%2C_Queensland_c70b.html" title="Macgregor, Queensland">Macgregor, Queensland</a>. There's no need for duplication in two articles. <b>Delete</b> - the article is not notable enough to have its own article. The notable aspects, including the destruction of the school by the tornado, are covered at <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macgregor%2C_Queensland_c70b.html" title="Macgregor, Queensland">Macgregor, Queensland</a>. However, I'm very tempted to ask for a keep. Just because the subject requests deletion should not mean that it should be deleted. Wikipedia needs to make a strong case against this sort of thing happening.</s><b>Keep</b> - as per Capitalistroadster, the school appears to have students that excel in multiple fields in outside activities, and may present a borderline notability case to fulfil criteria 2, 3 or 4 of WP:SCHOOLS3. I have 2 provisos, get rid of any copyrighted information from the School's website (or cite it properly) (to keep our friend below happy), and slap a cleanup tag on the article to get it fixed up. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 07:21, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>See, thats the point. No one has a source from YouTube.com, or any other website about the "Gang Volince" Para. Sure, we do have fights, just like every single other high school in the world, (serioulsy, name one school who hasn't had a fight in the last month, and I'll take that back). But were not as bad as other school in the area, such as Runcorn State High School.

<li><b>Delete</b>: As per request of the staff of MSHS. I would myself, being a student of MSHS, would love to see thsi page kept up. But, the owners of the information, MSHS, or if you want to acll them, the subject, don't seem to think it is Noteable enough to be in wiki, although MSHS is one of the best high Schools in Queensland. i could a list of acivments that MSHS have done, over the last few years, and many schools would not be able to start making a list bigger than ours.....ut still, the subject here doensn't want anything to do with Wiki, at thsi current time. <a href="../../../t/a/y/User%7ETayuke_e361.html" title="User:Tayuke">Tayuke</a> 03:13, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Tayuke, you can't "own" facts as you claim that the school does, and wants to have the information deleted. Sure, we can't just copy the information from the school's website, but that hasn't been done here. All the article is is just a factual information article on a school. The school has no rights over the information at all, and where the information is copyrighted, it would be easily covered by a fair use or fair dealing provision under Copyright law - it is for research purposes. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 01:18, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Too bad. MSHS seems to belive that they do own the information, that has been given on thsi Wiki page. I could even get copyright laws, here in australia, proving that MSHS does own these bits of inofrmation, and that they do have rights. I should know, I spent a whole term learning about copyright, and thsi legal stuff, last year. <a href="../../../t/a/y/User%7ETayuke_e361.html" title="User:Tayuke">Tayuke</a> 02:11, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, it's not "too bad"... it doesn't matter what your school told you about copyright, but you need to realise that we will remove copyright violations, but we will not delete articles just because you ask. You should know something hopefully about fair dealing provisions under Copyright law, which exist in Australia and are even broader under US Law as far as I know. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and there are clearly allowed exceptions for fair dealing where a small amount of the work is used and cited properly for the purposes of research or study law as well (see s. 40 of the Copyright Act 1968 in Australia). While your school may "own" the work, unless there is wholesale copying of the text (which I don't think there is), I doubt this would ever constitute a copyright violation, either under Australian or US Law, which is more applicable. And despite the school's objections, there's still nothing to stop us putting up things like "Macgregor State High School is a high school in the suburb of Macgregor, Queensland." That's a fact- it's not owned by anyone. Wikipedia does not delete articles because someone asks for them to be deleted. If you want to edit here you have to follow the policy, of which that is a part. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 07:15, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>MSHS do not own the information. They own the content of their own website, but much of it would itself be derivative.

<li>Well, let’s say MSHS have realized that I have broken copyright. What if I got a letter, signe by the principal herself, telling you all, that I did the wrong thing, and although I was intending to do the right thing, by making a page for MSHS on the school itself, and its awards, its achievements, and that this whole page should be removed. Yes, there are few things that that can’t be copyrighted, but I sure we can take away the History of the school, which at the moment is th only major part of the Page. <a href="../../../t/a/y/User%7ETayuke_e361.html" title="User:Tayuke">Tayuke</a> 00:15, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable, though I'm willing to revisit if a <i>verifiable</i> claim of notability can be made.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This once again brings up the old <i>all schools are notable: fact or fiction?</i> debate which I find to be quite pointless. There is no official WP:SCHOOL and it would just be easier if we just kept all school articles. Also, this has to be one of the biggest schools in the country, it has to be notable. <a href="../../../a/t/l/User%7EAtlantis_Hawk_7e10.html" title="User:Atlantis Hawk"><font face="Ancestory SF" size="4" color="#006400">Atlantis Hawk</font></a> 09:58, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>What is easier is not necessarily what is right or what is in line with consensus.

Concerns the school may have about content which is what I would call non-encyclopaedic in nature is easy to maintain by simply insisting that every reference made has a source.

<dd>yea, well as you may recall from the lengthy debate about schools way back when, there are plenty of us who simply disagree <i>in toto</i> with the School "policy," which I take to be a proposal anyway. We can disagree, but citing faux-statute like this will not change my mind and editors like myself who generally favor deletion have advanced every argument under the sun in explication, so consult the archives if you need further elucidation.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have video evidence of students engaging in fights, however I will not post these videos up without permission of those involved, this will provide hard evidence of the "Gang Violence" Paragraph. You can also contact Garden City Management on what some students at Macgregor State High School have done. Also there has been posts of youtube.com which showed evidence of students punching and kicking other students in the "Alley Way". The principal of Macgregor State high School found out about this and ordered students that posted up the videos remove them or face suspension. Contact the principal herself for confirmation of my accusation, there are plenty of people which would back what I have accused.
