<li><b>Keep</b> where in the criterion for notability does it say someone has to be internationally famous for them to be notable? let's follow the criteria as written, per WP Bio winning a notable contest, being a ranking contestant in a notable national contest and appearing on television all could make her notable in and of themselves, taken together she is clearly notable. These types of articles I do think point to a problem with over-inclusiveness in WP:BIO, something I'd certainly be up for helping with, but I still think they should be followed until superceeded. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWintermut3_ab25.html" title="User talk:Wintermut3">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wintermut3_88aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wintermut3">contribs</a>) 20:05, 22 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Any winner of The Amazing Race is at least as notable as a main character of a season of a TV show, since that's effectively what they are, and all the finalists are as notable as a major character would be if this were fiction. MacRusgail, like some other people, I'm uncomfortable with this entire series of nominations... I hate to accuse any serious editor of any kind of bad faith in things like this, but this feels like an attempt at making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, especially given the canvassing for votes you've done. On the other hand, I notice that you have in some of these discussions brought up the question of these people's international fame, and I wonder if you just are of the belief that national notability does not confer notability for the Wikipedia (which I'd strongly disagree with). Or, similarly, perhaps it's a case of <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTKNOWIT_b3be.html" title="WP:IDONTKNOWIT">WP:IDONTKNOWIT</a>, since you're not from the U.S. -- I'm sure plenty of people here might be inclined to nominate <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jade_Goody_d2c9.html" title="Jade Goody">Jade Goody</a>, for example, but I'm guessing you have a better concept of her notability as opposed to that of the reality contestants you've nominated.

<p>Non-notable housing estate. There are some brief references to it on housing-related websites, but nothing specifically about Oliver Close Saikokira 00:55, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Two things interest me, a) the number of blocks of flats, which is reasonable, and b) the claims about its crime rate/poverty. If its crime rate/poverty is so bad, then it is notable, IMO.

I found no evidence the editor (Rick Carruth) is known for anything besides the magazine, and without some notability for the editor, I can't see why an ezine with a limited readership should be kept. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:39, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I've heard of this but can't confirm it's notability--but I think it's been around a long time.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The copyvio issues are improved. But I think I was mistaken in thinking the JC Holmes ghits are his — I was confused by their being on parasitology by someone named J. Holmes. The Warren Wilson Holmes lists his initials as J.A. The first hits to J.A. Holmes are <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author:ja-holmes" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author:ja-holmes" rel="nofollow">six and eight hits down, with 44 and 42 cites</a>. Still respectable but not as good. I guess Jeff Holmes isn't even the most notable parasitologist named J. Holmes? —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 04:31, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I've touched up the article to avoid the copyvio issues David Eppstein correctly pointed out, and note that there is a <i>Holmes JC</i> from the "Department of Biology, The Rice Institute, Houston, Texas, USA" according to PubMed <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=12099408&amp;query_hl=2&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=12099408&amp;query_hl=2&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>; that could provide further proof this gent is notable, or mean we can discount the gscholar results. I am hesitant to conclude that his current position means he is not notable, as it is possible that he took this position in spite of academic advantage available at another institution. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 03:56, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That was not my meaning.I meant that a 4yr schools faculty are not necessarily required to publish much, and, unlike a research university, his research quality cannot be assumed from the nature of the institution. I've known many 4yr college people who have published quite a lot. But in his case he doesnt seem to have done so. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:37, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And I didnt mean to imply that you meant otherwise&#160;:-). It was just that when I searched for him as "Holmes JC", he seemed above par for 4yr college people so I had starting assuming there was more to the story; as David Eppstein has now pointed out, he is "Holmes JA", and when using that search criteria, he doesnt appear worth the effort. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 06:20, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article contains only a brief definition of the term in question, is unsourced, and could be considered only useful as an advertisement for a particular brand name of insulin, which may or may not still be in use. However, User:DragonflySixtyseven says the drug was apparently widely used in its day, and people apparently search for it on Google, so I would be willing to consider that it just needs to be rewritten. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolfrog_505f.html" title="User:Carolfrog">Carolfrog</a> 01:47, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>In general, I think that any prescription drug will have been the subject of several articles in peer-reviewed journals and be notable on that basis.

<li>If the info in the sources can be used to expend the article, I would say <b>keep</b>, otherwise a <b>redirect</b> is appropriate. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:43, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I will accept the argument that all prescription drugs are notable; however, the brand names of those drugs don't necessarily need their own pages, unless they refer to a specific formulation of a drug that has no generic name. My feeling at the moment is that <b>redirect</b>ing this page to <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insulin.html" title="Insulin">insulin</a> (much as <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advil.html" title="Advil">Advil</a> is redirected to <a href="../../../i/b/u/Ibuprofen.html" title="Ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a>) would be appropriate. I tried to figure out if there was a more specific type of insulin (for which a page might exist) that we could redirect it to, but I can't even figure out reliably what type of insulin Actrapid is. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolfrog_505f.html" title="User:Carolfrog">Carolfrog</a> 20:13, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, the project in itself is by far vaster than your average high school project, my problem is that I see no external reference and therefore notability is rightly questioned.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Notability is neither asserted nor supported by the references. Being founded in 1916 doesn't exactly make the school old - unless my mathematics fails me that's less than a century - and anyway age per se isn't notable. The good teacher may ( or may not ) be notable, but the school doesn't automatically acquire notability by contagion. Doing well in a sports or academic league doesn't automatically convey notability, since the results could be simply due to random events: if we saw consistent evidence of the inculcation of ( say ) great academic prowess or softball skills this would be notable, but right now there's nothing to say that these events are due to the school doing something out of the ordinary. The closed circuit TV system and drug abuse are, sadly, entirely un-notable within the public school system. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 13:35, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

His publications are mostly pre-Web -- but the same could be said of Shakespeare. (Edited later to add): And just to give an idea of the perspective of Lefly, the main instigator of this deletion campaign, take a look at his own articles: numerous paeans to obscure rock bands no one's ever heard of, flop TV shows from 15 years ago, and totally inconsequential arts nonprofits.

<li><b>Comment</b> - To those who are new here - Welcome. To those who have supplied sources - Thanks. To those who are new to the wikipedia deletion process, please be aware that a nomination for deletion is <i>not</i> a call to arms to delete an article but instaed is the beginning of a process intended to improve wikipedia's handling of a page of claims about a subject. The result varies among: redirect to another article, merge content into another article, improve the article, or sometimes to delete the article if no other choice makes sense. This process is working well here. Thanks again to everyone for helping. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 18:10, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You can hardly blame him. At least two-thirds of the "Oppose" votes are from new accounts or anonymous IPs. If it's not sockpuppetry, it's certainly canvassing.

<li><b>Oppose deletion</b> I see that the guidlines themselves are the subject of dissent so some care should be used in trying to apply them in sitautions like this. I note under special cases <i>The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field</i>. In my own experience as a DEC customer dating from the 60s I have to say that was the case for Terry. He was a very important piece of the DEC user culture for many years, giving us all a look inside DEC that was otherwise not available to most of us and that allowing us to make better decisions. As to citations and the like, we should keep in mind that much of what he did was under a pseudonym. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.116.166.40_5089.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.116.166.40">68.116.166.40</a> (talk) 18:32, 22 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Oppose deletion</b> I agree this article requires a complete rewrite. However, Terry Shannon was not "non notable".

<p>An article on an IP address that happens to be the current home of a DNS server operated by a notable company.

<li><b>Keep</b> the article asserts that this particular IP is notable because it is commonly used to check for an active Internet connection. It's a bit difficult to find a quality reference for that, but some googling shows promise.

<li>My point is: Other countries/networks/regions will have their own super-fast DNS servers that the local network gurus swear by. If we're going to have an article on all of these, we're going to end up with thousands, if not tens of thousands, of articles which say nothing much more than "1.2.3.4 is a fast DNS server". Being a fast server is not an assertion of notability, even if your only job is to serve DNS to millions of people. <a href="../../../a/w/y/User_talk%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3248.html" title="User talk:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Awyong J.</a> <a href="../../../a/w/y/User%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3b01.html" title="User:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">M.

<li>That handout demonstrates nothing. 4.2.2.2 is used as an example therein, nothing more. Another example in that handout is 64.64.120.40. They are both only examples. You'll find that the difficulty that you have experienced in sourcing the statement that 4.2.2.2 is primarily used to check Internet connections is directly caused by the fact that <i>that statement is false</i>. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:27, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The number of articles created about this school and individuals involved with it, all linking to the school's web page, shows that they are part of a concerted spamming effort (<a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G11" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G11</a>). <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPubliusFL_ece6.html" title="User:PubliusFL">PubliusFL</a> 15:45, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. No indication at all why this is potentially notable.

<p>This is the 2nd AfD. THe first was below for conflict of interest. During this nomination it was apparent that sources do not claim notibility or verifability. The article has a number of extra readings which are all mainly internal references. The 3 external sources to no assert notibility in any way.<br />
<br />
The first source claims to be for the sentance "Many of the Great Walk Networking participants had been involved with other organisations that were formed prior to 1988 to address significant threats to Western Australian forests: the Campaign to Save Native Forests (CSNF) and South West Forest Defence Foundation (SWFDF)" but the source makes no mention of Great Walk Network participants being involved. The 2nd source is a passing mention in a list of hundreds of other non profit organisations who support land conservation. The 3rd reference is merely an ABN listing, for which there are millions in australia.<br />
<br />
The article therefore does not have verifability (in reguard to claims on the number of walkers and significance of the club) and has shown nothing to indicate it is notable for <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> standards, thus <b>Delete</b><a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> 04:17, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am actually neutral on this. It just had a template suggesting deletion, with no discussion (the equivalent of a time bomb).

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I think the criteria needs to be tightened up, ie, only notable records (ie, records that have been written about by independent sources) and major label releases should be in there. And of course, records that dis a vague, unnamed person or group should be disqualified, which probably comprises of 40% of all hip-hop tracks. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 08:03, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. None of the entries in this list show any sources stating that the song <i>is</i> a "diss song".

<li><b>Delete</b> Every song is based on the editor's personal opinion and original research. There are no citations for the term "diss song" which seems to belong in urbandictionary.com. The list is just a list of loosely associated songs with no assertion of notability for themselves. And they, nor the term, are no more significant than the call-out songs and insult songs sung since way before hiphop was a musical art form. The <a href="../../../d/i/s/Diss_song.html" title="Diss song">diss song</a> article (if it stays after some sourcing) should list only a few of the most influential, and best examples of the style.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> the article's scope has currently exceeded the scope of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Diss_song.html" title="Diss song">diss song</a> as defined in the article, and the song lacks sources which indicate that the specific song is a diss song.-- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanntm_6305.html" title="User talk:Danntm">T</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danntm_aafb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danntm">C</a></sub> 22:39, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - this is a text book example of indiscriminate information - a long list of unsourced material with little or no criteria for listing.

And that just doesn't mean "notable records" - that means that each song needs a solid reference that it belongs on this list in particular.

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> It's a comprehensive list and I feel we would loose a lot by starting from scratch. Diss songs are normally documented in the media so finding sources for many shouldn't be that difficult.

<p>non notable symbolic "memorial" to Congress asking it to declare the 14th amendment invalid; I see no sign that it received great or lasting notice, except from a small fringe element of conspiracy theorist types (other than several such websites, it gets very few Google hits.) The dispute over the legitimacy of the amendment is covered in the 14th amendment article in some detail. And, of course, the article has been the site of long-running edit wars. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 06:12, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I was trying to prod this article just a few days ago, but now I find it to be a rather interesting and worthwhile article on a notable subject. The article is all <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> at this point and has become much more stable in the last 24-48 hours. I believe it is notable because it is unique--it is uncommon, to say the least, for a state legislature to urge the federal government to repudiate two constitutional amendments (especially ones that had been around for nearly 100 years). This being the case, a simple Google search is not adequate to test notability. Given the context of the civil rights movement's beginnings in the 50s (including the then rather recently decided <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_v._Board_of_Education_9aee.html" title="Brown v. Board of Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>), it is indeed remarkable that the Georgia legislature was making a (symbolic) attempt to excise the equal protection clause from the Constitution and even remove the right of African-Americans to vote. I do not believe an adequate ground for deletion based on sound policy/guidelines has been presented thus far, thus I respectfully dissent from those who have commented. If deleted, I hope it will be mentioned in relevant amendment articles per the above. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 14:34, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This article has gone from being a long, painful, monumental train wreck consisting almost entirely of fringe, unverifiable, non-neutral, <i>completely erroneous</i> original research to what it now is: a short article that at least has the possibility of development. Assuming that the 1957 Georgia resolution is real (and it appears to be so at this point), I second editor Jersyko's comment that it is "remarkable that the Georgia legislature was making a (symbolic) attempt to excise the equal protection clause from the Constitution and even remove the right of African-Americans to vote." Let's give Wikipedia editors a chance and some time to develop this into something better.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article, hitherto dominated by conspiracy theorists and fringe forum posters, can become something quite valuable. It is truly rare for a U.S. state legislature to attempt to repudiate two constitutional amendments (one of which was passed to allow African-Americans to vote). This sort of measure is of much interest to historians of the period, as it is a good example of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massive_resistance.html" title="Massive resistance">massive resistance</a> to the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955-1968%29_a2ad.html" title="African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)">U.S. Civil Rights movement</a>. A trip to the microfilm department of a good university library will certainly turn up a plethora of newspaper articles on the measure, both critical and supportive. I'd wager that there are some good law review articles on this matter as well. So I must respectfully disagree with the delete votes on two counts: this topic is certainly notable, both by its rarity and importance as part of massive resistance. Secondly, provided we go offline in our search for sources, we shouldn't have much trouble finding them. (Looking offline, looking in older sources is something we need to do much more of anyway).--<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZantastik_9813.html" title="User:Zantastik"><font color="black">Zantastik</font></a> <a href="../../../z/a/n/User_talk%7EZantastik_58c9.html" title="User talk:Zantastik"><font color="darkgreen" size="1">talk</font></a> 18:18, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I certainly agree that this is historical, and it is part of the history of the resistance to the civil rights movement, but the question is, was it a small part or a large one? I'm not sure anyone took this that seriously at the time, let alone now. Unless this got a lot of attention in 1957, I suspect it is too trivial for its own article. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 18:34, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Even if I'm not exactly fond of their music, even I've heard of them, and that's saying something for a pop band. On <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo%21.html" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo!</a> Music Videos (see <a href="../../../l/a/u/LAUNCHcast_08d9.html" title="LAUNCHcast">LAUNCHcast</a>), their video "Year 3000" is ranked number 64 at this time. That qualifies <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> number 1, and if I'm not mistaken, didn't they record the theme to <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney_Channel_faad.html" title="Disney Channel">Disney Channel</a>'s <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Dragon_389d.html" title="American Dragon">American Dragon</a>? (That's what the American Dragon page says at least...) That would qualify them for WP:MUSIC number 9. I just went to Billboard.com and saw them on the main page. According to the Billboard Artist Index, <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/images/pdf/index_artist.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/images/pdf/index_artist.pdf" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, they are #58 on the Hot 100, #31 on the Hot Digital Tracks chart, and #45 on the Pop 100.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: Wrong process, and raises no policy-actionable rationale for deletion under <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>. What I <i>actually</i> suggested three times on two pages (my talk page, and <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> where nominator tried improperly to speedy it as noncontroversial, even after it was controverted), was for nominator to take this <i>to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_mergers_1a61.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed mergers">Wikipedia:Proposed mergers</a></i>, and warned <i>against</i> going the AfD route. I don't like being misrepresented as supporting things I clearly oppose, thank you. There is no justifiable reason to destroy the edit history of the original stub, which was a good faith effort on another editor's part to create a meaningful stub, simply so that the author of the better article can falsely appear to be the first author to address the topic on WP. I can't see any policy-based reason that this stub should be successfully AfD'd just because someone would rather use this process to do a roundabout merge than use the proper one. <a href="../../../p/m/_/WP%7EPM_ae77.html" title="WP:PM">WP:PM</a> exists for a reason. The stub has certainly needed copyediting, and its author didn't understand what talk pages are for, but that's no reason to preted he/she doesn't exist. Oh! I take part of that back! I was the <i>present nominator</i> who has added signed comments to the article, not the original stub author! I have tried really hard to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> with this nominator, but am left with no conclusion to draw but that this is a self-serving vanity deletion - based on this twice-in-a-row refusal to use PM, on blatantly mischaracterizing me as advising this AfD, and on previous debate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequested_moves&amp;diff=110028100&amp;oldid=110028093" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequested_moves&amp;diff=110028100&amp;oldid=110028093" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html#Your_oppose_on_Wikipedia:Requested_moves_.28Drascombe.29" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">here</a> in which the objections to nominator's trying to "take over" the article and obliterate its past history were never addressed, <i>at all</i>, and responded to with complaints that I was "making a big deal" out of something trivial. I even offered to immediately support a proposed merge. This outright usurpation request should be sent to <a href="../../../p/m/_/WP%7EPM_ae77.html" title="WP:PM">WP:PM</a> where it belongs. PS to Harryboyles: Which version is better has no relevance. Although of course the nominator's version surely is better, that's not what's at issue; I don't think anyone in their right mind would oppose a merge. The issue is these repeated attempts to bypass policy processes, not to mention fundamental misunderstanding of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, demonstrating (see details at previous discussion links, particularly the 2nd one) an unusually high disregard for WP process and policy in the first place. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 12:34, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>One side is clearly the group of editors that revert or remove text they simply disagree with. It is a pattern for nearly 2 years and it destroys the credibility of Wikipedia in the meantime. In fact, one of them has had an arbitration ruling against them for that very abuse. 4 of the 'speedy keep' votes are of members of the one side abusing the system to protect their POV. -- <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_aboutme_96fb.html" title="User:Mnyakko/aboutme">Tony of Race to the Right</a> 14:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The page is a constant edit war and it chases people away. The version that the administrators 'overseeing' the article continuously revert and delete for implies there is actually very little controversy. Read the talk page and you will see that there is clearly little "weight" due to one side of the controversy relegating the entire article to an encyclopedic equivalent of Flat-Earth Controversy. Much of the content is duplicating other articles.

<li><b>Delete</b> If Wikipedia had any value as an information resource, this article would not be aloud to get as bad as it is, but the majority of people don't want Controversy to be listed in the page about Global Warming Controversy. Much of the information in this article is listed with "yea but's" and even the opening paragraph has been constantly changed back to a version that states how little "controversy" there is. If that is the way it will be (as from what I can tell, there is a group of several users who have made this, among other "Environmental" pages a cause they are standing behind) then there is no reason for this page to exist. A "Global warming controversy" page should include as much "Controversy" as can be put into it, or should be deleted.--<a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">Zeeboid</a> 14:42, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

But this cannot be stressed enough&#160;: <i>A "Global warming controversy" page should include as much "Controversy" as can be put into it, or should be deleted</i>. Right now, a group of editors, some of whom are admins with strong opinions about GW, is using this controversy article to promote GW theories that are already presented in many other articles about GW. <b>An article about a controversy is neutral by focusing on the controversy, not on the majority opinion.</b> There is much to say about the controversy surrounding GW and I would be sad to see this article disappear, as it (could) also contains valuable information. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildhoodsend_bd14.html" title="User:Childhoodsend">Childhood's End</a> 15:26, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would have like for the RfD to have waited until the neutrality issue was closed, but I do think the logical step shortly afterwards would have been to delete the article as unnecessary and irrelevant since it portrays the topic as resolved, implies any controversy is overhyped and undersourced and thus equivalent to flat-earth types and the article functionally serves one purpose: to justify preventing the topic from being mentioned on any other global warming page.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm new to this article and debate (to avoid any of the seeming straw man arguments above) but I've now read through the entire article and the majority of the links to talk page debates. As far as I can see this article is well-written, evidently notable, and extremely well cited (although the article needs to be edited to arrive at a uniform footnoting format, currently there are two overlapping numbering systems representing either true footnotes or external sources). As such, this article clearly passes wikipedia's standards to be kept, particularly since POV issues are generally not considered sufficient reason for an AfD nomination (please see <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_not_be_needed" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">here</a> for that policy). I believe the only real AfD issue here is whether editor disagreement is sufficient reason to delete an article. As such, this is clearly a keep. There is no such thing as an article that is impossible to improve or maintain. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 15:49, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Are you volunteering to come and help ensure that happens? But seriously, Markeer, I would be very interested to know how we can tackle this problem. To be honest it almost needs a full time editor to ensure the more resourced side doesn't just squash the other - this just isn't practical. I don't think it is possible to reprimand people for enthusiasm, nor is it easy to convince the scientists that evidence from a non-science article (of an opinion) is evidence. My recommendation would be to totally reorganise the pages to better demark the science articles from those that are a record of opinion so that it is better understood what constitutes "appropriate sources" .... then have an experienced editor to monitor the situation to ensure that science articles were based on scientific sources, and opinion articles didn't e.g. reject opinions simply because they aren't in scientific papers by climatoligists. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 16:50, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps I could say that better. In order to document a controversy which is now essentially between a mainstream science/climatologists on one side and various people including geologists/economists/politicians/"opinionists" and others, if the only evidence that is permitted is science evidence from respected climatologists, then obviously the article will not accurately capture the nature of the controversy. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 17:13, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Are you both arguing that when a plurality of scientists believe something, it is therefore suspect? Because it strikes me that you're on shaky ground with that argument.&#160;:-) However, regardless of your point, it has nothing to do with whether or not this article should be deleted, only how or if it should be improved...which is of course the point I was making. This is not an AfD candidate article, this is a "Cleanup" or "has NPOV issues" article. Even Mike's reply to my "vote" was to suggest expert oversight or reorganization of the article instead of deletion, which of course highlights the inappropriate nature of this AfD nomination. Not liking the way an editors' debate or disagreeing with an article's thesis are NOT, emphatically NOT valid reasons for deletion according to wikipedia's guidelines. I voted Keep above having absolutely no opinion on the issues addressed in the article. MY issue is with this nomination, which in my opinion should never have been brought to AfD.

<dd>Hey, wait, I'm a computer expert, and I always thought the Y2K thing was bogus nonsense that would have no impact. I was correct. And for those of us who bothered to make their thoughts known, in the circles I was in, it was the prevailing opinion. But in general, that's not what was reported and not the experts quoted. (Kinda reminds me of Lindzen or most "man on the street" interviews.) Regardless, it was just my opinion, and there was no way to prove it -- but with time. Kinda like GW. Only time will tell. As such, since we'll all be very long dead before it gets <i>proven</i>, that provides the controversy on GW. With that in mind, how else would anyone think this page would be? I do agree mainly all the GW pages are in general controlled by those with an obvious POV that the evidence is clear. When others of a more um neutral stance on it make points that are against that view, they are looked at as being "on the other side" so it becomes very difficult to get anywhere. All that said, this article needs to stay, simply because it illustrates the lengths some will go to to keep their own ideas of what the truth is as being portrayed what the truth is. <a href="../../../s/l/n/User%7ESln3412_14b9.html" title="User:Sln3412">Sln3412</a> 19:59, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tony, when a few lines on the Hockey stick controversy are so heavily censored that one side will not permit it to say what the hockey stick controversy is, then it is obvious the page will never be worth having in Wikipedia. Most people are not employed to edit Wikipedia - it can't have permanent editors, without someone to enforce the normal give and take which builds good articles the page will never tell the reader what they need to read to understand the issue. There has got to be a point when Wikipedia admits it can't cover every article with a NPOV because too many people (including me) are here because they have an opinion - like Iraq, it is time to retreat! <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 14:32, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having contestants who have gone on to other pageants does indeed convey notability. This system is important to the history and development of those contestants. Deleting all information about this and the Miss International (usa) pageant would be a mistake and leave holes in the articles about those women. However, I would compromise for a merging of the two articles and an article on the international system as a whole. I do not know how to do that, though. <a href="../../../b/e/b/User%7EBebedebroadway_a2b3.html" title="User:Bebedebroadway">Bebedebroadway</a> 22:49, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> the problem with Ghits is that often pageants are confused where they have similar sounding names. "Miss Teen America" is often used as a generic name for any teen pageant in America (it is most commonly mixed up with Miss America's Outstanding Teen)... if you checked out the GNews links... one relates to a 1970s spoof on a pageant titled "Miss Teen America", one is valid (about a state pageant for the Miss Teen America system calling for applicants) and the third incorrectly uses the Miss Teen America title when in fact they're talking about the Miss America's Outstanding Teen pageant. I would suggest you take a look at the first few pages on Google before you start suggesting that the number of ghits make this notable. -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 02:12, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This player is not listed on gmfc.net (the official Greenock Morton website), none of the fellow 'Ton fans I've spoken to have heard of him, and I spoke to a Morton youth player who hasn't heard of him, either. If he does exist then it's on the very fringes of the club and as such he's not competed in the professional leagues, so he's non-notable in any case. <a href="../../../n/a/c/User%7ENach0king_5d94.html" title="User:Nach0king">Nach0king</a> 21:30, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's not supposed to represent all people with the name, it's supposed to discuss the history of the name, which is perfectly encyclopedic. I'm sure sources can be found for this, so I would suggest pushing this to a relevant project for cleanup. It would be a shame to delete an article for a lack of sources if they can be found.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A consensus appears to have developed that the level below national in Scouting is an appropriate level for a WP article. Below that at District level or Troop/Group level is not appropriate. The level below national in the UK is the Scout County and this is what this article is about.

I will work on this one. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 22:27, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure that such a consensus exists. I have seen various articles on individual troops come up for AfD and they have always been deleted, but I can't recall previous discussions about sub-national scouting groups. At any rate, it's not clear to me that Scouting in Greater Manchester North is different from Scouting in other parts of England other than the fact that it is in a different location. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 01:25, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Sure, that is about the US and US States are larger than UK Scout Counties, but it is intended to apply more widely. There is no larger entity than the County other than national in the UK. Some of the County Scout articles have grown into good valid articles. This one of course has not but in time is could well do. I agree about troops and I would also not support an article about a Scout District, but the Scout County is much larger than these. I still plan to work on it but have been tied up. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 01:57, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am from the Greater Manchester North area, and lucky/unlucky enough to have gone to one of these organisations as a youth. However, <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Z-man_cef0.html" title="User:Mr.Z-man">Mr.Z-man</a> raises an important point, that the article is in bad shape, and is currently acting as an internal and external link repository! Images of the neckerchief designs, former projects, division (pack?) badge motifs, history, numbers, etc etc really ought to be included, otherwise I see strong grounds to <i>merge</i> the North, East and West Greater Manchester Scouting pages into one article.

<li><b>Comment</b>, the number of pubs lead towards notability, however number of redlinks that popped up throughout the article was surprising. Then "Maharashtra Prize" has surprisingly few ghits. More investigation required in light of COI. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 12:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> for now</s>, we need more information about the notability of the Maharashtra Prize before being able to make a informed decision. As far as I can gather it is an award from the Bombay Art Society and presented by the governor of Maharashtra annually. The point is that I have absolutely no idea what the entry and awarding criteria are. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 16:59, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> has done international exhibitions and is author or co-author of several books. The mentioned award should also be investigated as annual awards by relevant art societies add to a person's notability. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:59, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Doing international art exhibitions and authoring three books doesn't make on notable -- what matters it the notability of works. The article, Bhaskar Hande's sites<a href="http://bhaskarhande.tripod.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://bhaskarhande.tripod.com/" rel="nofollow">[37]</a><a href="http://pimaa2.tripod.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://pimaa2.tripod.com/" rel="nofollow">[38]</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=bhaskarhande" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=bhaskarhande" rel="nofollow">[39]</a><a href="http://www.vaishwik.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vaishwik.com/" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> or Google results don't establish the notability of the art works, the books or the project ("Your form is my creation"). The article doesn't mention what is "Maharashtra Prize"; even if we assume that it is same as the "Governer of Maharashtra Prize and medal" (which I doubt), it alone doesn't indicate notability -- the prize is one of the 18 prizes awarded by The Bombay Art Society every year. It is not a major award that makes one a deserving candidate for a Wikipedia article (although in addition with other sources, it would add to notability). The burden of establishing notablity, providing references lies on the creator of the article. The article has been tagged for long -- unless there are secondary, reliable sources, this should be deleted as a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> case. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 13:55, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Utcursch and others. It would help to know who published the 3 books - if a big publisher I might change my mind, or if press mentions were produced (harder in asia I know).

<li><b>Comment</b>. It is as an Indian artist that he would be notable for; "Your Form is My Creation" is almost certainly not only a book -- it was a visual work, but I havent spent time to nail that one down yet. He has attended two respected Art academies (the redlinks I was initially worried about have been fixed). I have added more content &amp; sources, including Bios which list all of the exhibitions. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 22:46, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - thanks for that extra info, which rather firms up my opinion for deletion. He has had, apparently, only one solo Exhibition, in Dortdrecht. "Respected art acamemies"s around the worls produce hundreds, if not thousands, of graduates every year, most of whom never become notable. A book/catalogue of his prints has been published by a gallery, and he has been on Dutch TV once. It's not enough. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 02:17, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The article has to contain validation of notability. At present it does not, and I don't think there is enough achievement to be able to find more information to do so. The Blackheath Gallery shows appear to feature him as one of several artists in a commercial gallery group show.<a href="http://www.blackheath-gallery.co.uk/ac.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blackheath-gallery.co.uk/ac.htm" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> This establishes his credentials as a practicising professional perhaps, but not someone who in any way stands out from that level to achieve notability. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:48, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The wiki I linked earlier uses the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_licenses_d4d4.html" title="Creative Commons licenses">Creative Commons by-sa license</a> rather than GFDL so a transwiki is probably no possible. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a></li>

<li><b>comment</b> note that transwikiing to UESP wiki is fairly useless since similar information is already available there. <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Skills" class="external text" title="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Skills" rel="nofollow">(information is mostly distributed throughout subpages)</a> note that the only skills considered on this page are those in <a href="../../../o/b/l/TES%7EOblivion_08a3.html" title="TES:Oblivion">TES:Oblivion</a>, so the information on this page or subpages is consistent with that on this page. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 16:59, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>the above being said, my vote is <b>weak keep</b> since I am not entirely sure this qualifies as useless gamecruft, but then again, i seem significantly more tolerant of cruft than other editors. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 16:59, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

That said, the vast majority of the article is about the series, with only one line (the first one) out of the whole article concentrating on the actress herself. —&#160;<a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFireFox_263b.html" title="User talk:FireFox"><span style="color:darkorange"><b>FireFox</b></span></a> 17:51, 16 February 2007</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>; Famous and influential prog-rock band. Has All Music Guide and LastFM entries. Songs have been covered by other famous bands. Commercial Success of Swaddling Songs at the time it was released is not a fair basis for deletion - we would not propose deletion of the article on <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Van_Gough_da92.html" title="Vincent Van Gough">Vincent Van Gough</a> on the basis that his paintings didn't sell while he was alive. Google search for Mellow Candle reveals a large number of pages on the band, most of them not fan sites - and this despite the band being famous before the rise of the internet. Finally, the Wikipedia is quite often the first recourse people turn to when looking for information on (for example) a band they have just heard of. I did for this band and would have been extremely miffed had I found no artcile. <a href="../../../a/1/o/User%7EA1octopus_952d.html" title="User:A1octopus">A1octopus</a> 10:31, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is a highly notable (Celtic) folk-rock band, and their reputation has grown hugely over the years. Their main album is widely considered a classic by collectors and cognoscenti types. Up there with Pentangle, Fairport et al. I have another album by them (alternate versions etc) from a couple of years back - because people are interested in them! One of the singers went on to work with Mike Oldfield, I believe. There's a resurgence in interest in this music at the moment - due to today's 'wyrd folk' movement. 'The Unbroken Circle' website (about wyrd folk music and its history) calls the album "legendary". (Maybe someone who's au fait at editing wikipedia can put a URL link in to that site; this is my first post and I don't want to inadvertently mangle the main entry) Why isn't there an entry for 'The Trees' too..., another classic&#160;;-) Do not delete the 'long tail' - especially when it's better than most of the, er, other bit of the graph. Does this kind of silly (potential) deletion of entries happen willy-nilly across wikipedia. That's a bit concerning... 194.66.90.23 13:14, 23 February 2007 (UTC)Matthew</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> There is an entry for Trees under <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trees_%28folk_band%29.html" title="Trees (folk band)">Trees (folk band)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am the developer of the Unbroken Circle web site and one of the main writers on esoteric folk music. Mellow Candle are an increasingly important band whose acclaim far outsrips their sales. They pioneered a form of folk-rock that resonated with the new paganism that arose from th late 1950s onwards. Their ethereal sound has been adopted by dozens of artists. The members have gone on to solo careers and working with such as Mike Oldfield and Brian Eno. At present one member has a notable solo career and another is part of the leading avant-garde band 'Fovea Hex'. Their influence will continue to grow and removing the band from Wikipedia will limit coverage of folk music considerably.</p>

<p>The article is basically a re-write of the script and could not be improved without significant re-writing. It contains no information as to the voice cast or creative people involved in the ep, nor does it cover the creative processes or ideas that went into it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewinchester_2be0.html" title="User:Thewinchester">thewinchester</a> 13:29, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- This article is not a stub, it's not "poorly written" but it isn't the best written. it could do with some trimming, expansion and excising and it would be a decent episode article. There is a consensus episode articles <i>are</i> encyclopaedic (Wikipedia is also <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">not paper</a> remember), the article does not appear to be "indiscriminate information" and looks perfectly notable enough, I also advise tagging for {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} and secondary sources. <span style="font-style: Tahoma; font-size: 84%;"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></span> 16:35, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It's not a stub, but it is pretty poorly written. I'm also not sure how much of it would remain if unencyclopaedic plot outline were removed. GassyGuy 01:22, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- The article at the moment contains way too much plot outline and far too little commentary, particularly seeing as it was the first episode of a popular series: there ought to be a lot of commentary out there that could be cited. But a lot of the outline needs to be cut out; there's way too much of it, and it may not qualify as fair use. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 18:08, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Strong do not delete.</b> This game has its own community and it is being actively developed. It is prominent as the most openly developed free software MMORPG. It is difficult to see what is unsourced in this article - provided that all information is freely available at the project site and that the game itself is free and everyone can install it. The installation disks of some very popular GNU/Linux distributions (e.g. <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debian.html" title="Debian">Debian</a>) include Crossfire. --Zinoviev 12:52, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fair enough, maybe I should explain what I meant by "unsourced". <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> dictates that <i>"Software is notable if it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the software's author(s)"</i>.

<li>Yeah, but still, since inclusion in the dists is so very vague as a yardstick of notability, what's a <i>better</i> alternative? Discussed in publications <i>and</i> having been included in a number of Linux dists for a long period of time <i>and</i> still, apparently, doing somewhat well?

<dd>The game has a passing mention in the Linux Journal, and it really is a passing mention (part of which is also referencing Happy Penguin, itself simply confirming that CF actually exists). Every link listed (and that I've found googling) stack up to nothing more than "CF is a rogue-like MMORPG that exists". What we're left with is that:</dd>

If <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daimonin.html" title="Daimonin">Daimonin</a> can be sourced, some info on CF could be included in a development section there. "CF exists" and "D evolved from CF", cited, would be enough to anchor it there.

<li><b>Keep</b> First, Crossfire is older than heaven (it has historical weight) and has been included in major Linux distributions for, ungh, just about as long as I can remember (which is to say, it was there when I started using Linux, circa 1996). My memory is a bit hazy there, but that's not the point - the point is that this is <i>old</i> and <i>widely known</i>. <a href="http://popcon.debian.org/by_inst" class="external text" title="http://popcon.debian.org/by_inst" rel="nofollow">rank #8637 in Popcon</a> isn't very awful either. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 08:35, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Guys, interesting point of view and appreciate your work in keeping wiki clean and to the point. While your point maybe be valid for other such articles, the creation of this article initially by me was to introduce a new artist as well as a new movement in "Iranian" music to the world and specially the Persian-American community living outside of Iran. I would like to open this discussion with you on the merits of deleting this article based on the points raised with in this page.</p>
<p><b>A -</b> Article appears to be written with the intention of self-promotion only: This is not true, the content of this article originally comes from the underground Persian magazine called Zirzamin which did an article as well as an interview with Erfan in 2006 when his first two singles were released. The article was then later published by www.persianhiphop.com as well as www.021-music.com, the text of the interview can be found at: <a href="http://www.zirzamin.se/interviews/inter_2006/erfan.html" class="external free" title="http://www.zirzamin.se/interviews/inter_2006/erfan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zirzamin.se/interviews/inter_2006/erfan.html</a></p>
<p>At the same time, Erfan has had interview's with major Persian alternative music magazines and E-zines including: 1- Radio Javan: <a href="http://www.radiojavan.com" class="external free" title="http://www.radiojavan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.radiojavan.com</a> 2- Zirzamin Magazine: <a href="http://www.zirzamin.se/" class="external free" title="http://www.zirzamin.se/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zirzamin.se/</a> 3- Iranian.com: <a href="http://www.iranian.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.iranian.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iranian.com/</a> 4- Bebin.tv interview: go to <a href="http://www.bebin.tv/" class="external free" title="http://www.bebin.tv/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bebin.tv/</a> and scroll to get to it or direct link on you tube: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF6ta-sdtK0" class="external free" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF6ta-sdtK0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF6ta-sdtK0</a> 5- BBC interview coming out soon: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/</a>, detailed in the BBC employee Behzad Bolour's blog <a href="http://www.behzadbolour.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.behzadbolour.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.behzadbolour.com/</a> 6- He is currently in the process of signing with major record label (<a href="http://www.avang.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.avang.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.avang.com/</a>) which should be compeleted in a week from what I've heard, he is currently with underground label Major Records(<a href="http://www.majorrecordsinc.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.majorrecordsinc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.majorrecordsinc.com/</a>), his album which is competleted is to be released in a few weeks with Avang Music company (<a href="http://www.avang.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.avang.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.avang.com/</a>) as the first major release of a Persian Hip Hop CD. Feel free to contact them for more information.</p>
<p>Again I understand your concern as a dedicated member of the Wikipedia community, but your lack of knowledge about the Persian Hiphop movement will obfuscate your judgement on the validity of this article. If you want to discuss this more, I can talk to you and put you in contact with all the above people to legitimize the details of the Erfan page. At the same time, you don't speak Persian so you are missing out on lots of information about this artist as well as lack understanding if his lyrics and poetry, the interviews, ETC.</p>
<p><b>B -</b> Google results for (erfan hip hop -wikipedia) returns 679 hits while (erfan rap -wikipedia) returns 861. Most returned links seem to either be links to MySpace, blogs or YouTube: Just because you did a "string" google search and came across what you refer to as "seem to either be links to MySpace, blogs or YouTube" is not a good reseason to pass judgement on something. The persian blog community is one of the largest in the world (Iran is the fourth largest country for bloggers (sourced from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Blogs" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Blogs" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Blogs</a> ). Because of strong censorship in Iran, the bulk of newspapers, writers and free thinkers use the medium of blogs to express their opinion and pass information to the community. Iran has the worse reputation for freedom of speech and has been labeled the biggest enemy of publications (reporters without borders: <a href="http://www.rsf.org/country-43.php3?id_mot=92" class="external free" title="http://www.rsf.org/country-43.php3?id_mot=92" rel="nofollow">http://www.rsf.org/country-43.php3?id_mot=92</a>) as well as the Iranian government has actively started blacklisting websites (<a href="http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21052" class="external free" title="http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21052" rel="nofollow">http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21052</a>). So for most people, blogs are the only way to pass information, do not discredit it based on "your" personal opinion. Again just because you found something on google, doesn't mean this article is not valid. If you are not happy with the format, then please include what specifically you think is "opinionated" and we can move on from there to make it better or possibly correct incorrect information.</p>
<p><b>C -</b> Not signed to any major record labels as far as I can tell and his notability has not been established as required by the criteria provided by the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a> guidelines: The guidelines states:</p>
<p>1- It has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable: Details are listed above, let me know if you need anything else. He is not 50 cent being pushed by a giant such as "Interscope", or SONY, yet he is signed to a hip hop label currently and is finalizing his contract with the biggest Persian record company in the world, he is releasing his CD in a month. 2- per the notability clause of wikipedia, he matches clause "SIX" which states "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city; note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability. " 3- also in the notability clause, section "other", part 3 states "Has established a tradition or school in a particular genre", he has created the genre Persian Hip Hop as stated in major Iranian national radio, go to <a href="http://www.radiojavan.com/music/interviews.php" class="external free" title="http://www.radiojavan.com/music/interviews.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.radiojavan.com/music/interviews.php</a>, search for Erfan, listed among the major Iranian musicians, interview in Farsi, hope you understand it. also article "4" stating "Has composed a number of melodies, tunes or standards used in a notable genre, or tradition or school within a notable genre." as well as "Is frequently covered in publications devoted to a notable sub-culture. ", sub-culture being the new genre of "Persian hip-hop".</p>
<p>All the above was to cover the concerns of "Netsnipe", as far as "Cornellrockey" is concerned, he makes no specific points. I have nothing to add to "Todd661", he makes no sense and as someone making a claim on this page, I expect him to be more professional, your comment comes across as childish.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Adelhaj (<a href="../../../a/d/e/User_talk%7EAdelhaj_a61d.html" title="User talk:Adelhaj">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adelhaj_bf74.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adelhaj">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>: Article was cleaned a bit more based on "non detailed" reports from this group, I have also detailed reasons above on keeping this article, please review and give feedback. Still waiting on a case by case dialog on this article, "non-notable" is not acceptable, if we are discussing something, then it should be opened up for detailed discussion, you can't convict someone without a trial, you have to have a case! To my understanding another beauty of Wikipedia is collaboration on articles, I started this and have maintained but an article such as this or any other grows over time with contribution from all, you can't say there are many complete articles on this site since they are evolving all the time anyway, I'm starting to think this one is getting picked on!Adelhaj 10:50, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Ok, My above comment was probably not as detailed as it should be. The article seems to be about a non-notable identity. Notability is a cornerstone of Wikipedia Policy and is perfect justification and perfectly acceptable for an AfD debate - a place for discussion. User:Efran and User:Adelhaj have made repeated claims as to the subjects notability, yet the ARTICLE does not make this clear. Moreover, there are several other issues with the article, such as it opening with a quote (violates <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>), having more external links than is necessary (against <a href="../../../e/x/t/WP%7EEXTERNAL_75f7.html" title="WP:EXTERNAL">WP:EXTERNAL</a>) and sentences such as <i>He is not into creating the fusion of Persian music elements in his music but believe it or not he thinks in Persian and he raps in Persian and he talks to his folk through his own Persian Hip Hop style</i> which has the word <i>he</i>or <i>his</i> seven times! But those are cleanup issues, and not for AfD debate and that is why the above <b>Keep Votes</b> have not recieved any feedback on the quality of the article. This article was brought to AfD because there is no claim to notability. No matter how many times I am called me childish, or how many times you say Notability doesn't matter, I will endorse my <b>Delete</b> vote until Notability is addressed. <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodd661_2494.html" title="User:Todd661">Todd661</a> 04:39, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a> mess, written like a press release.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Scientizzle, thanks for taking the time to contribute to this article for de-POV, I've tried to explain the case for legitimate Media outlets, there are not many sites that comment on Iranian hiphop, it's a new thing and there are more sites soon that will be publishing details on Erfan. If a keep is cool with the guys here, I can spend sometime in the next few weeks, reading on other artists and de_PV'ing this thing more, WORK WORK WORK is keeping me occupied, hate to see this page go for "now", I'm sure that it will be back up in a month with better links and coverage. It looks good after Scientizzle edit, anyone else have comments on this.

<dd>No, we don't necessarily include every criminal, but according to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> we <i>do</i> include anyone who has been the subject of multiple non-trivial coverage in independent reliable sources. This person has had four separate news reports, in the Times, Guardian and BBC, written about him. Therefore he automatically passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If he had defecated in 22 trains and it hadn't appeared in the news, or had appeared only in the local newspaper, then he wouldn't be notable. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 09:35, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - four separate news reports counts as multiple non-trivial coverage in third-party sources, per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The person may not seem notable, but he passes WP guidelines. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 13:21, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> Almost empty article describing a non-notable person. A very poor article. If you want to keep it, ask "How can the article be expanded?" Maybe when he also defecates in a bus that could be added? (That's sarcasm!) <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinson_weijman_cd79.html" title="User:Robinson weijman">Robinson weijman</a> 13:27, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, the article has now been expanded (by me). There's plenty more information out there as well, if anyone wants to look it up and add it to the article. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 15:06, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The version recently updated by <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> is fine. This person clearly passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. In fact looking at the previous version, that had enough in it to assert the notability of this person. Just because an article is in need of improvement doesn't mean that the subject is not notable. Should this article have been tagged for cleanup or improvement rather than AfD? <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 15:28, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Correct me if I am wrong, but the various articles are all describing a single event (OK, several instances, but the story was mentioned once in the media). Therefore I still do not think this individual meets the Notability criteria. But maybe this is because I have an "outside of the UK" perspective? Those living in the UK may consider it more newsworthy. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinson_weijman_cd79.html" title="User:Robinson weijman">Robinson weijman</a> 15:36, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> He's done one thing (defecate on trains) many times. I (based in the UK!) think he's done enough (as it were) to be notable. Having read <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> again I can't see any requirement that a notable person has to be notable for more than one reason, they just have to be notable. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 17:12, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, as far as I can read wiki guidelines both WP:BIO and WP:V have been satisfied. It is a question of debate whether being noted (or notorious) for asocial behavior is enough to warrant an inclusion in an encyclopedia, but as it stands it meets the rules <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 21:50, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> person being hunted for defaecation and desecration, a horribly gross (vulgar) crime but misdemeanour. We've deleted articles on people who have had coverage for repeatedly getting arrested for wandering around the streets naked, and this is on about the same level. The references supplied are covered by the "one coverage" rule, whereas it actually requires multiple coverage to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (The pirate king cites BBC article as its source). <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 06:35, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>ok this is my page that we are talking about deleting i move this info from the main Thuringowa page and put a link to it on the Thuringowa city page, so can somebody please tell me why it needs to be deleted, i have seen a lot of other pages do this and they are all ok look forward to your replies <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 02:34, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, WP:Not a directory. Thuringowa isn't known for it's prowess in delivering health services, which would be the only real reason for such an article. A list of health services should be a list of health serivces which have articles on Wikipedia.<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 10:41, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, Wikipedia is not the yellow pages. Each article needs to be encyclopedic, and this is not defensible as one. The content in this article would be better included in the articles <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Thuringowa_a2a0.html" title="City of Thuringowa">City of Thuringowa</a> and a new article Kirwan Health Campus; also <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_medical_facilities_in_Townsville_0425.html" title="List of medical facilities in Townsville">List of medical facilities in Townsville</a> could be moved to List of medical facilities in Townsville/Thuringowa or similar to incorporate the greater region. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 02:40, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per others - John Vandenberg's ideas regarding possible remedies of the situation have merit. The biggest problem I have with this article is the listing of trivial medical centres, which as we all know start and end without notice at any time, and hence is a list nearly impossible to maintain. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 03:43, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Let nobody say that gathering <i>everyone</i> to come and build an encylopedia is easy or ends up being overly orderly! As a perfect example of this, you blanked the article and Zpb52 has very thoughtfully restored the prior text because your edit looked vandalish. Amongst all the confusion, an rather complete encylopedia somehow emerges. Let me clarify my own thoughts a little. Kirwan Health Campus "feels" like a notable subject, so you could move all of the content that relates to that organisation to its own article. I like what you have done moving this list over to <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Thuringowa_a2a0.html" title="City of Thuringowa">City of Thuringowa</a>, but what I was meaning was that the section "Health Services" should discuss the state of Health services in the region as a whole; and the details of each institution is probably best left to the website for each. By that I mean the current content of that section (i.e. listing the types of services that are available at "Bluewater Medical Practice") is rather fine grained information, and probably not necessary. Maybe you could find sufficient sources to justify an article on Bluewater Medical Practice. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 07:32, 28 February 2007 (UTC); updated <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 08:01, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>As far as experimental music is concerned, I think C. Spencer Yeh and Burning Star Core are very notable. I created the page in order to gather more information on the label, and help create a better discograpy than I have found. Also, Drone Disco has released splits or full releases from other artists (Hair Police, Jessica Rylan, Hototogisu, Pete Nolan from the Magik Markers) who are definetly notable in the noise/experimental music genre. I've been searching for some better sources, but the most reliable so far are what I have listed in Related Links. MKPP</li>

<li><b>Abstain but comment</b> - It is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> (or we would have to delete thousands of less notable UK local FM, satellite, cable and DAB radio stations!) to hold its own article on Wikipedia because it is a national radio station broadcasting on the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeview.html" title="Freeview">Freeview</a> platform, unique in that it allows people to call in and buy the songs played on the station. However, I do share the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> concerns with the article, and indeed it will need a major cleanup for spam and references added to establish its notability. If it was a small local station, I would vote delete, but because it is a national UK station on the most popular digital television platform, I would like to see how this AfD nominations pans out. If it is deleted because it is not notable, then it sets a worrying precedent for the vast majority of less notable UK DAB, FM, satellite and cable radio stations, and I will contact the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Radio_Stations_b292.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Radio Stations">radio stations WikiProject</a> for a major review of UK radio station articles. --<a href="../../../t/g/h/User%7ETghe-retford_2fb2.html" title="User:Tghe-retford"><b>tghe</b>retford</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/g/h/User_talk%7ETghe-retford_e470.html" title="User talk:Tghe-retford">talk</a>)</small> 19:01, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. (a) The article is inadequately reference/sourced, and (b) the article was created by someone who has been going along creating schools articles on a regular basis without then asserting or demonstrating notability. I don't have a problem with individual articles being created and then giving them time to grow, but this particular article is part of a whole group, many of which display the same pernicious pattern. It would be better for EagleFan to create articles on one school at a time, and work on them till they meet our standards, rather than simply impose his preference for inadequately documented schools articles on the project as a whole.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I very strongly feel that it is EagleFan who is exceeding good faith here. EagleFan, let's be clear about this: by adding vast numbers of articles without providing any reason to believe that their subjects are notable you are simply spamming Wikipedia in an attempt to impose your personal view that all schools should have articles. Wikipedia works only when we all accept the common principles that guide and bind us, and one of the chiefs of these is that the topics we cover meet our guidelines for notability and verifiability. Notability <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:NOTE">is not subjective</a> within this project. You may not like this any more than I do - we all have subjects that we feel should be included, but which fail our community guidelines - but we have to live by these shared principles, or our project will fail. There is no room here for prima donnas who seek to impose their personal likes and dislikes. We are all trying to build the best encyclopedia we can, but right now your approach is counter-productive, and I strongly feel you should stop, and try to work in a more consensual way. By all means add articles about schools, but make sure that they are well documented and researched, and provide clear evidence of notability to support them: do this and I will be the first to applaud you. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 13:58, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Notability (or its lack) is a potential conclusion of an argument, but if offered without grounds it is a naked assertion. An argument has at least two parts: a thesis and the support for that thesis. "Not notable, just a load of nonsense" may be what 24.132.57.116 would like to show, but he or she offers no evidence to support this assertion: no discussion of any theory of notability, no citations to the article or anything outside the article, and nothing to support the vague "load of nonsense" accusation. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Daly_c5cb.html" title="User:Richard Daly">Richard Daly</a> 00:25, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If the information is junk in the main article, it is no less junk in a split off "...in popular culture" article. Junk is junk. The correct response to garbage information is to remove it, not to dump it off into another article because it's inconvenient to deal with. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 07:32, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm sorry, Otto4711, I cannot accept that the argument "Junk is junk" as an argument any stronger than the fact that 'othercrapexists' you cited above. While the amount of truly insignificant trivia should be pared down, an article such as this does server a dual purpose. Firstly, as a repository for significant, verifiable, pop-culture references to the subject, which would otherwise be nearly impossible for the causal reader to collect for himself. And secondly, to keep these references from dominating the subject's main article. The fact that we want to prevent these points from dominating the original article is of no consequence to their validity. It is just an effort to keep that article from being too long for the casual reader. Pop-culture or not, articles will be split off from any long article. I have no qualms with monitoring this article closely so it doesn't become a list of "hey one time this character talked about scientology in an episode of my favorite show". However, deletion of the entire article is not the solution to that problem. —<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo">siro</a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><i>χ</i></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Siroxo_49da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Siroxo">o</a> 21:19, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: the <i>mechanics</i> of this deletion should be deletion of all revisions, and replacement by a Rdr to something like <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedcubing.html" title="Speedcubing">Speedcubing</a>, but please note that this should be distinguished from a decision to <i>merge</i> with e.g. <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedcubing.html" title="Speedcubing">Speedcubing</a>, in that the purpose of the Rdr would be to give access to our coverage of the practice via one of the rdr'd versions of his name (for e.g., those who caught the name but can't recall a name for the practice), without merging any part of the content of this bio into <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedcubing.html" title="Speedcubing">Speedcubing</a> -- since presumably (and deleter can remedy if not) <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedcubing.html" title="Speedcubing">Speedcubing</a> already has the same lks to other Web coverage of him. The few people who want to learn hints from his bio on how to accomplish what he did, or to test hypotheses about what such experts have in common, are a tiny niche interest, and beyond the scope of WP; it's not even clear we can do more than give them <i>hints</i> at what the closer-to-primary-sources literature is.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> That Rubrik's cube is a "faded craze" is not supported by the WP article on it or on speedcubing, both of which has 2007 references. There are 908,000 ghits for <b>+2007 +"Rubik's Cube"</b> and 72,308 for 2008, though probably only about 1 in 10 are relevant. in any case, one N, always N. That people can find information elsewhere is not relevant to our decisions. Even if one thinks this a tiny niche, tiny niches are suitable for the subjects of WP articles, as long as there are sources for N. That he is a notable player, is demonstrated by the article. He has won other RC competitions besides speedcubing, and they are mentioned in the article. More refs can be added. If it is thought there are too many articles on RC, a merge should be suggested on their talk pages.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The fact the Rubik's Cube is less popular than it used to be hasn't affected it's notability, so it shouldn't affect the notability of someone who is a champion in it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Bob Burton is one of the most well-known cubers in the sport and so the notability should not be an issue.

The Daily Targum is the second oldest collegiate newspaper in the United States and has a circulation of 17,000. Moreover, this should take care of the verifiability. With respect to original research, everything on the page is true and can be verified at www.worldcubeassociation.org -- Finally, cubing competitions are much more common now than they were in the past. The sport has increased greatly in popularity and the "craze" is not much of a craze at all. Cubing competitions have been running longer and more commonly in the past few years than when the puzzle was introduced (www.speedcubing.com). - thexvb| 23:08, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, the majority of the information is incorrect. The first thing that's incorrect is the 'myth' status. Many of these 'myths' are merely political claims and anti-gun propoganda.

In response to your "controversy" over OR vs common knowledge, I submit to you that the article is rife with non-common knowledge that is not cited, ie "<i>Only the rare Glock 17 Mariner variant... allows safe firing underwater</i>". Your testimonial contribution to the article would amount to original research. I would also suggest that if you move facts to a relavent article, like the Glock 17 Mariner's ability to safely fire under water, and remove insignificant trivia like the fact that some video games will not allow the M1 Garand to be reloaded mid-clip, what you'll be left with doesn't justify the rest of the article. It becomes even more a list of trivia, which implies "<a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIV_4692.html" title="WP:TRIV">interesting without being notable</a>". --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 22:07, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, I think it's notable indeed that the M1 Garand can be reloaded mid-clip. Also, you have to take things into context... when the article talked about the Glock 17 Mariner's ability to fire underwater, it was using it as an example to show that some (although not all) guns can fire underwater. Anyways, I gave the article a massive clean-up... so please, take another look at it, I removed as much useless information as I could. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavenStorm_f0b6.html" title="User:RavenStorm">RavenStorm</a> 22:23, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who ever said that the Garand can't be reloaded mid-clip? It's in the manual how to do it. There's already mention in the Garand article of this very fact. The Glock 17 requires only a modified firing pin to fire underwater, but who ever said it could or couldn't? Where's the myth. Where are the references that say that knowledgeable people every said it was a myth? We can go item by item rebuking of all of this crap, but it'll take a while. You bring up what's worthwile, then make sure it's duplicated elsewhere so the article can be deleted without losing that content which you can show is useful, factual, and encyclopedic.--<a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsams10_5cf0.html" title="User:Asams10">Asams10</a> 00:59, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Re-name and re-classifiy to Firearm Myths in Media</b>: By removing certain myths and adding others, as well as re-writing some of the information in this article, I believe it would be an excellent way to add on to the <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firearms.html" title="Firearms">firearms</a> article.

<li>Renaming it does not change the nature of the article. It's still a collection of trivia with zero encyclopedic value. You can't take what is in this article and make another article out of it. Virtually everything here is unsupportable. Whether you like or value the information, Wikipedia is not a place for what ammounts to a firearms forum.--<a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsams10_5cf0.html" title="User:Asams10">Asams10</a> 03:12, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I disagree with the "re-name and re-classify" suggestion. Eventually you'll have to rename it "Mistakes, misconceptions, and myths about firearms in the media". But why is it notable? I haven't searched for it, but is there an article called "Automobile myths in the media" that debunks the myth that cars will fly through the air as if from a ramp instead of slamming into a parked car, and debunking the myth that the wires that cause the starter to crank when hotwiring a car should be twisted together after the car starts? That's trivia, which by definition is not notable. Does "interesting" transform "trivia"? --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 04:09, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why should it still be worth zero encyclopedic value? I really hate to use the old "but x article has it" procedure, but there are PLENTY of articles that branch off and have their own trivia or "in the media" page (look at <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-earth_in_popular_culture.html" title="Middle-earth in popular culture">Middle-earth in popular culture</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler_in_popular_culture.html" title="Hitler in popular culture">Hitler in popular culture</a>). I don't see why Firearms should be any different! If we remove everything EXCEPT myths that have been specifically used in movies, video games and other forms of media, then it is no longer a trivial, unfounded list, it is something notable about firearms. Listen, all I'm really trying to do here is solve the problems you guys have been complaining about instead of removing the article outright. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavenStorm_f0b6.html" title="User:RavenStorm">RavenStorm</a> 12:50, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, there are plenty of other articles that have their "trivia" or "...in popular culture" sections split off. Usually that happens because the trivia section is ridiculously long and the people who maintain the article think that splitting the garbage information off into its own article will give the people who want to add every instance where Hitler flashes past on a TV screen a place to dump it. A great number of those sorts of garbage dump articles are being deleted, and even if they weren't, as I noted previously <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">the existence of another article</a> or even batch of articles is not justification for this one. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:28, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>These facts aren't notable about firearms. They're only tangentially related to firearms. They're generally trivia specifically related to movies, television, and video games, where there are an infinite number of other mistakes and misconceptions and misuse of many, many things, including firearms. Maybe there should be an article called "Trivial mistakes made in movies, television, and video games", with "Firearms" as a sub-section. Then you could include facts like: cars don't explode upon being shot by a .357 Magnum as seen in Dirty Harry (is that a car myth or a firearms myth?), and a still photograph can not be scanned into a computer in order to zoom from a wide shot of 5 people to see a reflection of the photographer in the eyes of the 5 subjects of the photograph as seen in CSI (is that a photography myth or a computer myth?). --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 17:00, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> as this stands it is almost entirely unsourced, OR and even if sources could be found it would be an unencyclopedic collection of mistakes made in movies. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 07:44, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The information is encyclopedic and, if it is properly reformated and rewritten with a reasonable attempt at citing sources, an unconventional and informative colluction of uncommon knowledge about a very misunderstood subject that is socially important. I think the focus should move away from references to individual sources or movies unless that has caused a widespread misconception (like the "Glock 7" issue). Additionally, the argument about the M1 Garand further up and it's appearance in multiple games is an illustration of how these myths (or misinformations) tend to exhibit themselves. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathbunny_3da9.html" title="User:Deathbunny">Deathbunny</a> 04:20, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> article as a useless list that can be split into other lists.</p>
<p>Firstly, the article appears to be named after a page under <a href="../../../n/a/t/Category%7ENational_Register_of_Historic_Places_939b.html" title="Category:National Register of Historic Places">Category:National Register of Historic Places</a>, an American organisation.

Secondly, there are separate lists for this kind of information (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_forts.html" title="List of forts">List of forts</a>, for example) as well as a comprehensive list of buildings under <a href="../../../b/u/i/Category%7EBuildings_and_structures_in_Malta_241f.html" title="Category:Buildings and structures in Malta">Category:Buildings and structures in Malta</a>.</p>

<li>Malta isn't a U.S. state, territory, or commonwealth, so it doesn't have anything on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The list of historic places in Malta is unsourced because there's no citation of any agency that has certified these buildings and structures as being on a register. I'm hesitant to recommend deleting this article altogether, but it should at least be <b>renamed</b> as just a list of historic sites in Malta, without any association implied with the U.S. National Register. <a href="../../../w/o/r/Category%7EWorld_Heritage_Sites_in_Malta_9891.html" title="Category:World Heritage Sites in Malta">Category:World Heritage Sites in Malta</a> might be an appropriate starting point for this list, and a list of other palaces and structures in Malta would also be worthwhile. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 20:36, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> There does seem to be a "National Protective Inventory" for Malta, commonly called "listed buildings", as well as "urban conservation areas" and "scheduled areas", equivalent to historic districts etc. <a href="http://www.mepa.org.mt/npi/pieta/frame_index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mepa.org.mt/npi/pieta/frame_index.htm" rel="nofollow">City of Malta guide</a> (slightly broken). It seems as if there is a list, if it exists and can be sourced, Malta should be treated the same as the US, UK, and other nations. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 05:01, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Dhartung's comments. Nobody thinks to delete the American <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_4c8b.html" title="National Register of Historic Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> and other countries similar lists should be treated the same. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 04:27, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b>: it is a kind of own research (probably), it could be compared to the US National Register and could be taken as something official (it is neither nor), we have an official list - the UNESCO heritage one, and any other list will stay very subjective and own research - first of all when we call it <b>list</b>. Let us make a catogory for such things, or the mentioned list of museums etc., there is no subjective problem. The page mentioned by Dhartung seems to be something else, although it could be used in an article. Sure, Malta has a lot to show, and there can be done a lot, but I guess not this way. <a href="../../../-/j/k/User%7E-jkb-.html" title="User:-jkb-">-jkb-</a> 10:55, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I can see no evidence on the website provided by Dhartung that the Malta Environment and Planning Authority is committed to preserving Malta's historic buildings. As far as from what I've read, the company is Malta's national environmental regulator and land use planning agency <a href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/grdp/922670/1069742/1069766/?version=1&amp;lang=_e" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/grdp/922670/1069742/1069766/?version=1&amp;lang=_e" rel="nofollow">[60]</a> and does not participate in building conservation.<br />
However I have just found an organisation that does. <a href="http://www.heritagemalta.org/about.html" class="external text" title="http://www.heritagemalta.org/about.html" rel="nofollow">Heritage Malta</a> is a national agency set up by the Maltese Government, and I guess this is the closest thing to an official register available.<br />
Instead of having another list, I think it would be best to incorporate the list into a <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heritage_Malta_821b.html" title="Heritage Malta">Heritage Malta</a> article. Unless anyone has any other ideas, I shall get to work on it. ~ <b><span style="color: #427D42">► W</span><span style="color: #498B49">y</span><span style="color: #519951">k</span><span style="color: #58A758">e</span><span style="color: #74B674">b</span><span style="color: #82BD82">j</span><span style="color: #8FC58F">s ◄</span></b> <small>(<a href="../../../w/y/k/User%7EWykebjs_87bd.html" title="User:Wykebjs">userpage</a> | <a href="../../../w/y/k/User_talk%7EWykebjs_a954.html" title="User talk:Wykebjs">talk</a>)</small> 19:27, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Wykejbs's comment of 25 February 2007 and Dhartung. jkb, your problem may be that it's <a href="http://www.heritagemalta.org/heritagesites.html" class="external free" title="http://www.heritagemalta.org/heritagesites.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritagemalta.org/heritagesites.html</a> (and not .com).

<li><b>Keep</b> per Dhartung. Malta is a popular tourist destination within Europe, and one of its main attractions is the cultural heritage; this list would be useful for anyone wishing to find out more about the islands.

<dd>Once again: if Wykebjs makes something like <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heritage_Malta_821b.html" title="Heritage Malta">Heritage Malta</a> from that page, it will be fully OK, but the present list makes an attempt to be something official - and this is not (no source etc.).

<dd>I find no objection to that. The reason I recommended keeping the article is that it will probably take longer than the duration of the AfD nomination for such an article to be set up. Just a thought: How about renaming the present article itself to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heritage_Malta_821b.html" title="Heritage Malta">Heritage Malta</a>, and then replacing it with Wykebjs's version once it is completed? <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounterFX_ea25.html" title="User:CounterFX">CounterFX</a> 14:01, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I bet there is other pop culture and popular article on WP that are similar to Internet phenomena. What this list would support is the WP article regarding <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> and add weight to this technology being so influential in so many areas including entertainment and viral marketing..etc --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikecraig_dd6f.html" title="User:Mikecraig">Mikecraig</a> 00:38, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Honestly, the article was a mess before, and I question whether some of the content should have been removed (not naming names, everyone knows what I'm talking about), but this article is the best place to keep random shit that people might look up which doesn't merit articles. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 01:46, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Main problem is lack of internal structure: arranging the items by date within each group might be better than alphabetical. But this, and considerations of the proper criteria, and Objections to individual items for BLP etc. should go on the talk page of--and sometimes on the talk page of the article being linked to.

<li><b>Keep</b> it but only include entries with either a Wikipedia article, or reliable sources. —<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo">siro</a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><i>χ</i></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Siroxo_49da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Siroxo">o</a> 02:38, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Article is at least as relevant as many other pop-culture articles on WP. Notability is definitely not a problem, nor is verifiability. If ever, rename to [[[List of Internet Memes]] or List of Notable Internet Memes and then narrow down the requirements in order to be on the list. WP:IAR should be the case here with using Internet sources as this IS a topic regarding the Internet. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 06:02, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> per Guy above. As long as there are some rationale guidelines for inclusion (third party sourcing, evidence of notability, etc.) there are no content policies that this list <i>must</i> violate. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, etc. problems need to be delt with but that doesn't require deletion.

<p>Article seems to exist only to support her Teddy Bear therapy and that article has been prod'd and now sent for AFD since it fails to explain what it is and therefore why it is important. Ms. Stoner would be better served if she signed up for a free website service such as Geocities and explained both herself and her therapy there. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostcard_Cathy_a0f9.html" title="User:Postcard Cathy">Postcard Cathy</a> 11:17, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> There is a lot of information in this article, and I think, sufficient enough to warrant its own article. There are articles on things that are far less relavant than this one. Érika's sister is Princess of Asturias, which gives her some claim to notability, even prior to her death. For example, <a href="../../../p/i/a/Pia_Getty_9dbe.html" title="Pia Getty">Pia Getty</a>, sister of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie-Chantal%2C_Crown_Princess_of_Greece_73d1.html" title="Marie-Chantal, Crown Princess of Greece">Marie-Chantal, Crown Princess of Greece</a>. I don't think she'd have an article if her sister had not married so well, and I believe this is the case for Érika. She was notable enough to recieve a mention in CNN (can't find the article, the summary is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/02/07/wednesday/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/02/07/wednesday/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

She was on newspapers in Spain two days because she died, but it had no political impact, just the news. She was totally unknown until the time of her "normal" dead. This article talks about an ephemeral news, not the biography of a notable person. Besides, who was in press was not she but her sister and the king, they are notable.

<dd>Of course, she was not totally unknown, in fact she went to her sister's public wedding and she was not hidden. But she had no public life. It is interesting to see that the special issue of <i><a href="../../../%C2%A1/h/o/%C2%A1Hola%21_edf6.html" title="¡Hola!">¡Hola!</a></i> shows Letizia and the Royal Family, focusing on them and not on Erika. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarcex_186f.html" title="User:Barcex">Barcex</a> 19:29, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, i'm afraid you know nothing about Spanish yellow press, she appeared in several Spanish TV programs (such as <i>Aquí hay tomate</i>), they do that: they follow people when they are in the supermarket, when they are going to work, etc. She was known because of that, but of course, that's not a reason to be in an encyclopaedia.<a href="../../../g/a/u/User%7EGaudio_61cd.html" title="User:Gaudio">Gaudio</a> 20:03, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Keep</b> - I understand what the nominater is saying. However, many of the BMTH fans (especially the girls) really like Oli.... This to me gives him some notability. Fair enough, Drop Dead Clothing isn't very big. So that doesn't add to his notability. However, he is the lead singer of <a href="../../../b/m/t/BMTH_bc70.html" title="BMTH">BMTH</a> - who I do believe easily meets the notability criteria, as one can buy their material from many good retailers including HMV (I saw their cds there last week), also they are doing a UK tour (not that big, but are being supported by <a href="../../../i/k/t/IKTPQ_1c62.html" title="IKTPQ">IKTPQ</a>), <a href="../../../b/m/t/BMTH_bc70.html" title="BMTH">BMTH</a> also won the Kerrang new-comer award, so they appear to be easily notable enough.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Self-promotion is the act of promoting one's own businesses and/or one's self, so I do not find it feasible that my creation of an article can be self-promoting for someone else. Perhaps it could be classed as promotion; however, apart from mentioning Drop Dead Clothing, there is nothing that I can see that could possibly be classed as promoting. However, Drop Dead Clothing is Oli's own business, so needs to be mentioned in a biographical article. <b><a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsics_b0e1.html" title="User:Asics"><span style="font-family:impact;"><span style="background:black;color:aqua">Asics</span></span></a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/s/i/User_talk%7EAsics_ba81.html" title="User talk:Asics"><span style="background:black;color:aqua">talk</span></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Asics_3155.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Asics"><font color="black">Editor review!</font></a></sup> 16:51, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Caterina Bandini is a has-been, an EX news anchor, and a brief fluff piece in the Boston Globe hardly constitites a biographical justification for a Wikipedia article. Her tenure as anchor was mercifully brief (about 5 years), and during that time, despite WHDH's generally high ratings, she was not a popular anchor, as evidenced by numerous postings on local media forums. Note that the Globe has media ties with WHDH.</li>
</ul>
<p>Somebody please tell me what she did in her entire career as a reporter/anchor that was at all noteworthy, anything at all. Reading a teleprompter five days a week does not count. She is gone and soon forgotten. She won't be back as anchor anywhere in Boston either even if she wants to return - what station would have her? She will be over 40 in a business that worships young and pretty. Her stiff humorless on-air persona was a frequent source of comment among news watchers. She would likely demand more money than any station would be willing to pay. She has no fan base, never did. Her career is done.</p>
<p>If you are going to allow this article to stand, then anybody else who has been an anchor in local news deserves an article as well, and I just can't see that. If any current Boston anchors deserve Wikipedia articles, it would be the likes of Natalie Jacobsen or Jack Williams, who at least have both had very long TV careers in Boston and will no doubt be remembered for some time. But again, does local popularity equate to Wikipedia notability? A decade or less from now, people will be saying "Caterina who?" I have asked some people, and they cannot even name her as the person who preceded the current female anchor. Is that notability?</p>
<p>Given that she seems to be just about the only local Boston anchor or reporter to have an article here, the question naturally arises, who posted this article in the first place? Bandini herself? Possible. Some random TV news groupie that has an infatuation with her? Possible too, but other anchors are far more popular here, so why don't they have articles on Wikipedia. Draw your own conclusions. (Chingachinga 21:51, 22 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Let me offer some comparisons. Other things being equal, a national anchor is more notable than a local one. A local anchor with a long career is more notable than one with a brief career. A local anchor with some additional accomplishments, either within or outside their news position, is more notable than one lacking them. I would suggest that a popular local anchor is more notable than a relatively unpopular one because in TV news it's all about ratings and Q scores.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bandini was a local anchor. Her career as a anchor was quite modest in length, and she has admitted that she is no longer interested in returning to that particular job, so that career will not be extended. To my knowledge she had no genuine additional accomplishments at all, e.g. Pulitzer Prize, best-selling book, etc. Even her supporters have admitted that her public persona needed improvement, as she had something of an 'ice queen' image. Newspaper articles from the 'Lifestyle' sections about her decision to choose family over career are not that substantive and barely add to any claims of notability. I'll wager the frequency of those articles will drop quickly as she fades from public memory.</p>
<p>A high-profile job may imply notability only to the extent that it raises the issue. An undistinguished short career in a local market does not establish notability.</p>
<p>Say what you want, she fails the notability test.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> to closing admin. This is getting silly. Chingachinga has now voted <b>Delete</b> three times as well as being the nom. Meanwhile, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is easily proven. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR">EliminatorJR</a> 17:03, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It is my understanding that "votes" are no longer tabulated and used as the sole criterion for deletion, so if EliminatorJR chooses to vote Strong Keep I reserve the right to reaffirm my Delete vote.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I find silly is that EliminatorJR, who claims to be from the UK and claims to know nothing about Bandini, should take it upon him(her)self to promote Bandini's notability by posting insignificant media articles when he(she) is utterly unfamiliar with Boston TV news, the very context of Bandini's alleged notability. I, on the other hand, have been watching local news for decades, back to the days of Don Kent and Jack Chase among others. It is my opinion that Bandini was a minor figure, that such press as she received was perfunctory, and that she will quickly become less notable over time as her name recognition diminishes.</p>
<p>I also fail to see how WP:BIO establishes Bandini's notability.</p>
<p>With reference to "Primary criterion" - "Person has been a subject of multiple non-trivial published works". Not really. Whenever a new anchor is promoted it is standard fare for local print media reporters to write a brief piece about him or her. It's pretty trivial, usually appearing in the TV or Lifestyle pages. Stories relating to her decision to quit her position to care for her twins are human interest stories, and may be juxtaposed with an opposing position by a feminist critical of women leaving the workplace to raise children. Such articles are relatively trivial, and hardly bolster notability, as any other successful woman, famous or not, would serve the illustrative purpose just as well.</p>
<p>Under "Special cases, notable actor and television personality" - "Multiple features in popular culture publications" - no.</p>
<p>"Large fan base, fan listing, or 'cult' following" - no. To the contrary, Bandini was reportedly relatively unpopular because of her stiff demeanor. The success of WHDH was widely attributed to the glitzy, fast paced look of the news, not to the anchors' celebrity.</p>
<p>"Independent Biography" - no. See the above comments under "Primary criterion".</p>
<p>"Name recognition" - doubtful. Bandini was only known in the Boston area, and was the station's female anchor for only 5 years. Her name recognition will no doubt decline rapidly now that she is off the air, and Frances Rivera has proved a popular, successful replacement for her.</p>
<p>"Commercial endorsements" - no.</p>
<p>Under "Proposed alternative criteria" - "Expandability - will the article ever be more than a stub?" - Almost certainly not, and a brief stub it is at that, despite recent external references. She is out of the news business and has expressed a desire not to return. Her agent may make hyped up claims that a local station would pick her up, but I find that hard to believe.</p>
<p>100 year tests - fails both.</p>
<p>Search engine test - questionable. Google hits are mostly station posts of news stories she covered, and reports of personal appearances anchors are expected to make during their tenure. None of these items bolster notability, and many hits will no doubt be taken down over time as the stories lose their releveance.</p>
<p>So again, I fail to see anything that establishes notability to keep this article. Chingachinga 12:49, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a difficult time finding notability in any local anchor lacking other legitimate accomplishments, since for starters any notability hardly extends beyond the local viewing area, which might be rather small in many cases. Other than your own, how many local anchors can you name, excluding those who might have experienced some measure of fame for activities unrelated to their anchor position? None? I myself cannot name any anchors in Providence RI, or Manchester NH, or in any of the other surrounding media markets, never mind the rest of the country. That is not to say that local anchors do not merit an article just because they are local and not nationally recognized, but rather there must be something sufficiently notable about them that might impress others unfamiliar with their careers. Achieving only a very local celebrity as an anchor is not a significant enough accomplishment in my view.</p>
<p>Let me offer some TV newspeople examples as illustrations. Paula Zahn was an anchor in Boston for a while, also at channel 7 where Bandini later worked, but moved on to a national morning talk show, and eventually got her own national cable news program. No problem with a Wikipedia article here: a long and diverse TV news career including national exposure in several programs, and with an ongoing program on CNN. People throughout the country recognize her, and name recognition certainly counts in notability. If her career had ended when it did at channel 7, Zahn would not qualify on notability in my opinion. Too obscure and brief a career.</p>
<p>Chuck Scarborough was also an anchor at channel 7 for a time, but moved on to a very long-term high visibility anchor position at WNBC in New York City. Even though known primarily as a local anchor, I would say he qualifies on notability first, because NY is the largest media market in the country (or maybe a close second behind LA). Perhaps millions of people would recognize him, and he has been an anchor at WNBC for over three decades. That's a substantive career in the public eye in itself. Additionally he has had national network exposure throughout the country, and he has also had several successful books published. That body of accomplishments warrants a Wikipedia article in my opinion. Even the NY local news anchor position alone might qualify, given the market and his tenure. If he had only been a NY anchor for one year and not done the rest, would he qualify? I would be inclined to think not. If his career had ended in Boston with nothing else, definitely not - not enough substance.</p>
<p>I do have some question about Natalie Jacobson's inclusion in Wikipedia, though I would not contest it. She has been at WCVB in Boston for decades and is likely the most recognized TV newsperson in Boston today, and arguably one on the most famous in Boston TV news history. With her then husband Chet Curtis as co-anchor, "Chet and Nat" dominated the local prime-time news ratings until they divorced and he moved on to NECN. Jacobson still lead the ratings as solo anchor in her time slot. My problem with her notability is that she is no doubt completely unknown outside her viewing area, and Boston is not NY or LA, and there is no reason that she should be known elsewhere either. In some sense she is a big fish in a relatively small pond. At some point the market size matters. Have any of you ever heard of her, even if you have a keen interest in American TV news? Does a long-term anchor on Jerkwater Cable Access News lacking other accomplishments qualify?</p>
<p>Another interesting case to consider is WHDH's investigative reporter, Hank Phillippi Ryan. She has been at Bandini's station for some time and covered many stories, but one was a career maker. She reported after a long investigation on a pattern of collusion and corrupt practices involving construction firms promoting remodeling projects to homeowners in some of Boston's poorer neighborhoods, with ties to banks offering dubious loans. The story was significant enough that the state itself investigated and initiated new rules regarding registration of contractors and changes in bank lending practices. Ryan's story was notable for its genuine impact, but would she merit a Wikipedia article? That's a tough one to call.</p>
<p>I cite these examples to illustrate that the criteria for notability for TV journalists are rather vague. Some individuals clearly qualify without discussion - who could doubt, say, Walter Cronkite? Some are iffy, and subject to legitimate debate. Some don't make the cut.</p>
<p>Bandini's career lacks notability. Her Wikipedia article boils down to the first sentence: an 11 year position at WHDH (only the last 5 of which were as anchor). That she co-anchored with Randy Price adds no weight. Boston is neither NY nor LA as a media market. The cited articles recently added are trivial ephemera. Apparently she did nothing of substance outside her anchor chair, e.g. wrote a book of note, held elected office, etc. Bandini fails to make the cut, as would any other local anchor with a brief, uninspired career. In the panoply of local TV news, she did not rise much above that of the general assignment reporter. Unfortunately such is probably the case for the majority of local anchors.

<li>The very fact that they did raise a future Wimbledon champion makes them notable to people who have more than a passing interest in the sport. There have sadly been few enough champions to emanate from the UK, so it should be of considerable interest to find out further details about the past of one of them. James was playing in the first team at the age of 9 and was a regular member until he obtained a scholarship at Bisham Abbey as a teenager.

<p>Notability. I have done some internet searching on this person, but cannot find anything. This was created by a new user, and might be a "test". Either way, it seems that the person who created this article created it about him/herself, or knew that person as a friend. In summary, this hardly seems notable. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim.bounceback_15a6.html" title="User:Tim.bounceback">Tim.bounceback</a> 21:34, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Oh good grief, not another one&#160;! Hasn't this guy got anything better to do&#160;? <b>Delete</b>. (a) The article is inadequately reference/sourced, and (b) the article was created by someone who has been going along creating schools articles on a regular basis without then asserting or demonstrating notability. I don't have a problem with individual articles being created and then giving them time to grow, but this particular article is part of a whole group, many of which display the same pernicious pattern. It would be better for EagleFan to create articles on one school at a time, and work on them till they meet our standards, rather than simply impose his preference for inadequately documented schools articles on the project as a whole. As Wikipedia editors we all surely want high quality articles: we are not well-served by the bulk creation of low quality articles. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 14:11, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Anyone can see that the vast majority of these sources have a good number of the tracks (or, at least, artists) in common, both amongst themselves as well as with the article. I would consider it <i>severely lacking</i> for an encyclopedia not to have a list of defining trance records, such as, at bare minimum, <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_Finary_d45d.html" title="Binary Finary">Binary Finary</a>'s "1998", <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Love_a33b.html" title="Age of Love">Age of Love</a>'s "The Age of Love" and <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_52.html" title="Energy 52">Energy 52</a>'s "Cafe Del Mar". I admit that the lack of citations <i>are</i> problematic; however, I am sure that there are at least a few entries for which an authoritative non-disputable claim to notability can be made, such as <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_Stone_dc71.html" title="Solar Stone">Solar Stone</a>'s "Seven Cities" being credited as "The best trance record of the last 10 years" by <a href="../../../d/j/m/DJMag_b2d2.html" title="DJMag">DJMag</a>. <i>What I strongly recommend should be done is to clear the list, and allow it to be reconstructed on condition that each entry is backed by a notable (authoritative) source.</i> <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounterFX_ea25.html" title="User:CounterFX">CounterFX</a> 00:51, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've nothing against a new article, however I think this article isn't a good starting point for it and should be deleted. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 00:56, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>So, what's the standard for deciding that any particular declaration of a track as a "classic" or "defining" or whatever term is used is sufficient for inclusion? If an individual track is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> then write an article about it and put it in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Category%7ETrance_music_cdfe.html" title="Category:Trance music">Category:Trance music</a> or an appropriate sub-cat. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:37, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Several of the tracks do have their own articles already. In the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trance_music.html" title="Trance music">trance music</a> scene, notability is typically measured by the number of compilations the track appears on, the number of remixes that the track has enjoyed from leading artists, and the frequency of its inclusion in sets played by leading DJs (such as <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_van_Dyk_6031.html" title="Paul van Dyk">Paul van Dyk</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/%C3%AB/Ti%C3%ABsto.html" title="Tiësto">Tiësto</a>). Just to demonstrate my point about the earlier mentioned tracks:

<dd>The point I am trying to get across is that, despite there possibly not being a single conclusive listing on which the article may be based, a set of tracks which enjoy worldwide recognition as classics <i>does</i> exist . Notwithstanding, I would concede to <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a>'s point that the present article might not be a good starting point. I was wondering, how about moving the present list to the article talk page (or a subpage), trimming the actual article to three or four tracks (possibly using the above-given justifications for notability; specifically: notable remixes and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discogs.html" title="Discogs">Discogs</a> figures), and allowing future editors to re-introduce tracks provided that they explicitly demonstrate the tracks' notability when doing so?</dd>

<li><b>Keep/Trim</b> Article should be retained. By the article's nature it is subject to editors adding a lot of opinion-based, unsourced additions; similarly, a lot of additions which are relevant but unsourced, compromising the lists integrity. This is not a reason for deletion, it is only a reason for some heavy-handed, counter-POV/weasel editing. I have attempted this to a degree in the past, but it is a mammoth task, and I don't have the boldness to make such cleanups. Starting from a clean-slate is viable. I think it is perfectly reasonable to construct a veritable list of notable trance records, by using creditable sources such as those outlined by Counter FX. It should simply be noted that unreasonably verified, or unverified additions will be deleted, unmercilessly&#160;;). <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarly_Q_25f2.html" title="User:Early Q">Early Q</a> 23:18, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Update</b> I agree that restarting the article from a clean-slate (and subsequently watching the page for unreferenced additions) would be the best way to go, although I still suggest making the old list available (through the talk page) for editors who wish to take up the task of finding authoritative sources for the present tracks. Regarding the comment that the article has always been unsourced: this is, in my opinion, a false claim. The entry for <a href="../../../z/y/o/Zyon.html" title="Zyon">Zyon</a>'s "No Fate" asserts that it was "the first successful trance release on <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eye_Q_72ae.html" title="Eye Q">Eye Q</a>", as is corroborated on <a href="http://www.eye-q-music.de/about/vaeth_engl.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.eye-q-music.de/about/vaeth_engl.htm" rel="nofollow">the label's own website</a>. The entry for <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_Stone_dc71.html" title="Solar Stone">Solar Stone</a>'s "Seven Cities" gives a citation from <a href="../../../d/j/m/DJMag_b2d2.html" title="DJMag">DJMag</a> identifying it as "the best trance record of the last 10 years" - an indisputably valid claim to notability (provided the citation is correct).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I have also actually managed to locate one authoritative listing: <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Sound_ba63.html" title="Ministry of Sound">Ministry of Sound</a>'s <a href="http://www.ministryofsound.com/sites/fifteenfifty/chart.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.ministryofsound.com/sites/fifteenfifty/chart.asp" rel="nofollow">Fifteen:50</a>, a chart giving the "50 biggest dancefloor filling tunes of the last 15 years" which also includes several of the trance tracks mentioned in the article. The chart states that it is the result of "numerous interviews with DJ’s, loads of posts to this site and some very heated arguments" (valid criteria for notability); this, coupled with the indisputable status of MoS, is sufficient (in my opinion) to refer to it as an authoritative source. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounterFX_ea25.html" title="User:CounterFX">CounterFX</a> 02:26, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But the question remains, what about the next source that the next editor decides is an authoritative source? What if that authoritative source conflicts with your authoritative source? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:43, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You're also confusing asserting (alleged) notability with being sourced, because the link you provided for <i>No Fate</i> isn't in the article. What makes the first successful trance release on a particular record label notable? Were there more successful releases before that on other record labels? Were there subsequently even more successful releases after that on the same record label? Even then successful and notable aren't the same thing, and I certainly wouldn't accept a record company's claim that a record was "successful" as a claim of notability, bare minimum would have to be independent verification that the record was successful even if that was the same as notability which I don't think it is. The <a href="../../../d/j/m/DJMag_b2d2.html" title="DJMag">DJMag</a> claim is not sourced, it isn't a citation. It simply claims it's one of the "best" (which I don't consider to mean notable anyway) releases of the last 10 years, but provides no information so anyone can verify this. Which issue of DJMag is it in? They don't have an online archive, so without a publication date it's an unsourced claim. The MoS list isn't a list of notable records, it's a list of popular records. Notability and popularity are not the same thing. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 11:50, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> But popularity makes something notable, if only notable for being so popular. Perhaps what you are suggesting here is a change to the phraseology of the article's title. Such a change would be pedantic rather than effecting any real change. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a>'s comment seems to undermine the policy of sourcing and citation too much. DJMag is the international herald of information with regards to dance music; it may not be accurate or make positive statements, but then neither does the BBC or Rolling Stone. If conflicting statements do arise in sources, then this makes an interesting point in the article&#160;:). <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarly_Q_25f2.html" title="User:Early Q">Early Q</a> 18:48, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps the last two examples I gave were not the best choice. I agree that the <a href="../../../d/j/m/DJMag_b2d2.html" title="DJMag">DJMag</a> claim not being sourced destroys its verifiability.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The main issue, as I see it now, can be split into two arguments:
<ul>
<li>The legitimacy of the list itself existing as an article in conformance with Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> policy. As I see it, it was the disputing of this legitimacy that motivated the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AfD</a> nomination</li>
<li>The criteria for notability against which candidate trance music records may be evaluated</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>For the latter argument, I would maintain my original position that, in the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trance_music.html" title="Trance music">trance music</a> scene, notability is defined by
<ul>
<li>the number of compilations the track appears on</li>
<li>the number of remixes that the track has enjoyed from leading artists</li>
<li>the frequency of its inclusion in sets played by leading DJs</li>
<li>its influence on the evolution of the trance genre in general or a subgenre in particular</li>
<li>(non-exclusively) a measure of the track's popularity</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The first two criteria are verifiable against <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discogs.html" title="Discogs">Discogs</a>, the third and the fifth were addressed by the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Sound_ba63.html" title="Ministry of Sound">MoS</a>'s <a href="http://www.ministryofsound.com/sites/fifteenfifty/chart.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.ministryofsound.com/sites/fifteenfifty/chart.asp" rel="nofollow">Fifteen:50</a> chart. Of course, I am not insisting that the criteria given above are conclusive - I am certain that they can be improved - but rather that a set of objective criteria for notability <i>can</i> be defined, and should be reached by community consensus.</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, the legitimacy of the list is addressed by the Wikipedia-endorsed assertion that <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability is not subjective</a>. Thus, a track's inclusion warrants more than just it being an editor's favourite, and would not violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> provided that it satisfies the criteria for notability (as discussed above). Given that the criteria are accepted and abided by, the legitimacy issue should also be resolved.</dd>

<li><b>Proposal</b> I have constructed (from scratch) a draft version of what could be used as a starting point for the new article. I would appreciate it if you reviewed the <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounterFX_List_of_notable_trance_music_records_%28draft%29_bf63.html" title="User:CounterFX/List of notable trance music records (draft)">proposed article</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/u/User_talk%7ECounterFX_List_of_notable_trance_music_records_%28draft%29_2971.html" title="User talk:CounterFX/List of notable trance music records (draft)">proposed talk page</a>. As you will see, all claims are referenced and the notability of the tracks is explicitly stated. I believe that, in this form, the article would successfully resolve the issues of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a>. However, as has been earlier pointed out, rebuilding the entire article using this level of referencing is a massive task; I would propose starting off with just the three given tracks and see how the article evolves.</li>

<dd><b>Recommendation</b> If no-one finds any objection to my proposal, I would recommend that the article be blanked and replaced (<i>not</i> <a href="../../../m/o/v/Help%7EMoving_a_page_3be0.html" title="Help:Moving a page">moved</a>, so as to preserve history) by the draft, together with its talk page. The old contents of the talk page would be archived within a subpage of the talk page (since they would no longer be applicable to the new article).

<li><b>Keep</b>: We have a Fictional Battles category, and the Battle of Metropolis is a fictional events still bearing consequences in every DC title One Year Later related. SO, I think it can stay.

<li><b>Comment</b> - the existence of a category does not justify the article's existence. I have found that few of the articles in this category belong here because they suffer from the same problems: reperesenting fictional events as if real, using only primary sources (something WP:CMC has said is grounds for deletion as non-notable), and generally just focusing on minutiae without really discussing the real-world publishing information. These attract a lot of OR and speculation because they are cruft articles without basis in anything but primary sources. This isn't a guide to comic book storyines. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:black">☓</span></a></big>) 09:05, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If the lack of secondary sources is the matter, Peregrine Fisher has posted something of regular. I also think that the fictional quality of the events is quite evident. Plus, the <i>Battle of Metropolis</i> event was a metafictional event told in more than one publication, so it's more than a simple plotline, but a closure event. If it's really needed to delete it, but I still cast my vote for keep, we've at least to put a passing reference of the death count in <i>People died during Infinite Crisis</i>. But we'll lose reference of a focal event of the whole comic event. DrTofu83 11:06, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Contested speedy deletion. Article's author notes on the talk page the person is notable because he has some minor state fame. I say he has no fame and the sources aren't notable, just some school stuff. When you add your vote please mention how little we at Wikipedia think of this person's so-called fame. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENardman1_ed82.html" title="User:Nardman1">Nardman1</a> 23:42, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Notability not asserted. I would however advise Nardman to be a little more civil. No reason to disparage the subject of the article. I would happily change my vote if reliable sources sufficient enough to write an article are provided. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<li><b>Delete,</b> nothing in the article or the links supplied demonstrate the subject has any notability beyond his immediate school system. Also second Daniel's comment above- even if there is a series of rather unconvincing meatpuppetry in support on the article's talk page, that's no reason for this nomination to have been couched in such uncivil terms.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> <font color="#DAA520">|</font> <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small><i>TALK</i></small></a> 02:56, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Should have been a speedy delete instead of a regular delete action. In reference to Nardman1's deletion comments above, I think we need to be mindful that some new, contributing editors don't fully understand Wikipedia's notability guidelines and we shouldn't insult them or their work just because we move to delete the article of which they were the primary (or only) editor. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 03:14, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Re indiscrimate collection of data:<br />
In most works of literature, puns are of little importance. But in Hamlet, puns are very important for understanding the play and for understanding the literary form of puns and for understanding the evolution of the English language. Although the main article on <a href="../../../p/u/n/Puns.html" title="Puns">Puns</a> links to the main article on <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a> for examples of puns on names, the Hamlet article has no mention at all of puns. The new Puns in Hamlet includes (so far) three puns on names: "Claudius/cloud", "Polonius/Poland", and "villain dwelling/Hamlet." (Not yet included: my sinews grow instant old, the book and volume of my brain, a book of old men with weak hams.) In modern literature, puns are usually synonymous with triviality. However, as the Puns article notes: "In the past, the serious pun was an important and standard rhetorical or poetic device." It's possible that the puns on Polonius' name elucidate the meaning and structure of the play more than the character himself. The understanding and misunderstanding of the puns in Hamlet may have had a significant impact on the English language. More than once I've looked up a Hamlet pun word in a dictionary and found a reference to Hamlet in the definition of the word.<br />
From the Folger Shakespeare Library, "Wordplay in Hamlet," Adapted from Barbara A. Mowat and Paul Werstine (editors), the New Folger Library Shakespeare edition of Hamlet. © 1992 Folger Shakespeare Library, (<a href="http://www.folger.edu/template.cfm?cid=953" class="external free" title="http://www.folger.edu/template.cfm?cid=953" rel="nofollow">http://www.folger.edu/template.cfm?cid=953</a>): "In many of Shakespeare’s plays, one may not be aware that a character is punning, and the dialogue can seem simply silly or unintelligible; one must thus stay alert to the sounds of words and to the possibility of double meanings. In Hamlet, puns carry a heavier burden. Hamlet packs much of his feeling about Claudius into his single-line “aside”: “A little more than kin and less than kind,” where “kind” has the double meaning of “kindred” and “kindhearted.” Many of Polonius’s speeches also cannot be fully understood until one untangles the puns and related plays on words"<br /></p>

<p>Re no original research:<br />
A good pun is difficult to spot, but, once found, it is obvious. The puns I've included so far are some that I discovered independently (though I wasn't the first - I was preceeded at least by Shakespeare, and probably by hundreds of unpublished high-school English students, among others). However, once pointed out, a true pun needs no authority to verify it. If it's not obvious once pointed out then Shakespeare probably did not intend it as a pun. If I point out lines in Hamlet that describe something that walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, I should be able to call it a duck without referring to higher authority. However, even if the particular puns I've included so far fail that test, there are other important puns which have been endorsed by authorities (e.g. Diet of Worms). Or perhaps the page would satisfy the "no original research" test if all commentary was deleted. Only the quotes from Hamlet would be listed, with the puns indicated only by emphasizing key words and grouping related quotes. Any doubtful puns would be deleted, unless documented by reference to "by some elder masters, of known honour." - from the submitter of the Puns in Hamlet article, Ray Eston Smith Jr 18:14, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

This comment, by Skalzey 16,was in the talk section of the main Hamlet article in April, 2006: "I get no sense of the play's language, structure or themes / concerns..."

<p>time and looking for help in understanding the play. A play summary is inadequate for this purpose. Knowing the plot of Hamlet tells you nothing about the essence of Shakespeare's play. Shakespeare is notable for his mastery of language, not for the originality of his plots. To help the prospective play-goer, we need to give him a summary of the language. A listing of related lines is a language summary, one which can be compiled with much less effort, "original research," and POV than a plot summary.<br /></p>
<p>Without a plot summary, a first-time play-goer could still understand the plot from the exposition within the play, but, without a language summary, he or she would almost certainly fail to notice most of the word-play relationships between lines scattered throughout the play. There is reason to suspect (Ophelia: "will he tell us what this show meant?"), that Shakespeare curried favor with special patrons by explaining word-play which was visible only to the initiated.<br /></p>
<p>(This discussion reminds me of one I had with my boss about 20 years ago. I was working with a collection of about 50 computer programs which totalled about 50,000 lines. All the programs used the same data fields. I suggested to my boss that we needed a master cross-reference to list all the different lines of code which referenced each data field. My boss disagreed. I went ahead anyway and, on my own initiative, wrote a computer program which generated the master cross-reference listing. I was subsequently fired for doing "unauthorized work.")<br /></p>
<p>If "Related Lines Within Hamlet" is not acceptable for Wikipedia, would it be acceptable to put an external link in the main Hamlet article pointing to a Wikibook entry for "Related Lines Within Hamlet"?<br /></p>

<li><b>delete</b> - as this is, it should maybe be called, "list of puns in Hamlet," but still it would be unencyclopedic. A page called "Puns in Hamlet" could maybe work at Wikipedia if it were about the puns, not a listing of them. Yes a Wikibook link could go in the main article. <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/m/User_talk%7ESmmurphy_5e09.html" title="User talk:Smmurphy">Talk</a>)</sup> 06:49, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It is currently a sparsely populated frontier, but that situation could be remedied if wikipedia editors would link to it when rejecting articles for "orignal research." It might also help to have a wikipedia article on Academic Publishing Wiki. It's currently small and obscure, but it's a unique and important category of wiki communication.
