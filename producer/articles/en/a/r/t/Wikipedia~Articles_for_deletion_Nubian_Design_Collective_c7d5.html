<li>That is not my intention. I was just saying, that if you're going to delete all the minor Star Wars stuff, then <b>everything else fictional</b> needs to go too, or else we're not being consistent. The article stays. -- <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 02:46, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)

<li>That is the worst logic I have ever heard in my life. So if we delete an article on Cantina Band Member with Kloo Horn, we also have to delete <i><a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a></i>? And your vote is counted as much as mine. What a system. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:09, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But it's a <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a>, you start with Cantina band members, then you get to <a href="../../../r/2/-/R2-D2_552c.html" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a>, then <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a> is next... <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:16, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And if you start including articles on Presidents of the US, then you start including Senators, then State Senators, then State Senators' clerks, then the clerk's wife, then the clerk's children, then his unborn child, then each of his individual sperm, so unless we want articles detailing several billion sperm swimming around in some random guy's sack, we shouldn't have a wikipedia at all. The slippery slope works both ways, you see. I find it's best to judge articles on their individual merits, not on what the illogical conclusion of the process could be. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:46, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: As far as I can tell this is completely unverifiable. Looking at those google hits, I see absolutely nothing to indicate this is even a real thing. The only page that even gave <i>any</i> context that I could see was a message board in which some fanboy was mentioning some fan fiction he was writing. 4 unique google hits? For a Star Wars thing? since when does 4 pass the google test even for things which aren't completley disproportionately mentioned on the internet? I am really dumbfounded about how many keep votes there are for this. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:56, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>That doesn't mean it's not a criterion. Besides, any time something gets 4 unique google hits one has to wonder how verifiable it is, depending on what exactly the hits are. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:01, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Now that this has been tranwikied to the new Star Wars Wiki ("Wookiepedia", I believe some call it) there's no reason for it to stay in wikiepdia. Especailly something so obscure that it only got 7 google hits.

<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b>: Thank you for your follow-up, R. fiend. Two questions: At the close of this discussion, should this article redirect to the Wookiepedia? And in your opinion, how many hits should a Star Wars article garner to merit inclusion? --GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 22:34, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Personally I'm against a redirect to Wookiepedia, as it would be much the same as keeping it in wikipedia. I was also unaware wikipedia allowed for external redirects, but as I am not involved in any of the wikimedia projects outside of this one I admit I know little about how they interact with wikipedia. I believe when we transwiki a word to wiktionary it is no longer an active link from wikipedia, and I see no reason why this should be different. I have no objection to articles on more significant aspects of Star Wars being included here (and my bar for inclusion may be lower than many would imagine) but this doesn't cut it for me. Those people interested in the Nubian Design Collective know it's a Star Wars thing and would know its better to check Wookie- and Wiki- (once word of its existence reached the Star Wars online community, and I certainly expect it will). Those who don't know its a Star Wars thing would most likely expect to find some sort of <a href="../../../n/u/b/Nubian.html" title="Nubian">Nubian</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design.html" title="Design">design</a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective.html" title="Collective">collective</a>. Wookiepedia seems like it will be a great place for Star Wars fans (and I am, in a way, one) to write an in-depth article on the two stormtroopers who were having a personal discussion while Obi-Wan was deactivating the tractor beam, without having to defend it at a VfD every 3 months. As for the second part of the question, well, there are no real hard and fast numbers. I wrote about the google test on its discussion page, though I'm not sure any more than 2 people read it, and I think I should have addressed fiction with a large online following. Maybe I'll go back an add a section. Anyway, I would say anything Star Wars related will be disproportionately over-represented on the web. Though even if that were not true, I know of no example in which 7 hits passes the google test. Perhaps if those hits were strikingly significant, but I think it's been established here that they were not. None of them even said what the collective was. The best one could say is that the test is not relevent in this case, though I'm not convinced that would be true. So how many hits passes? Can't say, but it's more than 4 unique ones. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:15, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
