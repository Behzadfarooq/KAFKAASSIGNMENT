<dd>I'm aware, thanks. There is potentially a very good justification, however. See the sections of that page headed "Segregation and security" and "Keeping heated issues in one small area." If you're going to argue that it's an <i>abusive</i> sock, it would behoove you to provide some evidence, I think (through <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_ea9e.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets">appropriate channels</a>, not here), rather than engaging in <i>ad hominem</i> attacks. And I don't see the username as inflammatory, for the record. Immature, yes, and probably unwise, but it's not an attack or a slur or any of the other things listed at <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username</a>. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 05:12, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no justification at all. It directly violates <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESock_d787.html#Avoiding_scrutiny_from_other_editors" title="WP:Sock">WP:Sock#Avoiding_scrutiny_from_other_editors</a>, which is forbidden. It is not a sanctioned legitimate use for a sock puppet account as spelled out in the policy. Your interpretation is wrong. It's pretty simple, if you want to use sock accounts, use your regular account for AfD noms. The username violates numerous areas of <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUsername_b87d.html" title="WP:Username">WP:Username</a>. The result is that the debate is tainted, due to the suspicion of double voting. It may also be a banned vandal account within the parameters of Speedy Keep. Based on the number of established editors ready, willing and able to nominate school articles for deletion on a daily basis, we do not have to sanction sock nominations and I am shocked by the constant rush to defend these nominations. And I have launched no ad hominem attacks - I pointed out that this was a new user. You implied it wasn't. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 05:27, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it doesn't. It is not difficult for editors to detect a contribution pattern in his edits; it's rather easy. And no ad hominem attacks? So you're not alleging bad faith, violation of policy, and now double voting on the nom's part? It might very well be true, mind you, but lacking any evidence to the contrary, I'm willing to assume good faith. In any event, I think this is getting rather tangential, so I will respond no further here. I do, again, encourage you to take the matter up through proper channels if you feel this is a case of sock abuse. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 05:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A contribution history dating back ten edits is not a real contribution history. I have a right to have an idea who is nominating articles for deletion based on their history - that is explicit in policy. I'm alleging violation of policy (bad faith is irrelevant) and as to double voting, a sock nomination automatically raises the suspicion. How could it not? Furthermore, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> mandates discounting sock puppet "votes" in deletion discussions. Why should it be different for nominators? I am not aware who is behind the account - the user in question has declined to respond to messages on his talk page - and am not particulalry concerned with abuse. I am concerned with what I view as an invalid nomination by a new account. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 05:51, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It isn't clear to me where there is a reason to speedy keep or to make an AfD invalid simply because an obvious sock was used to make the nomination. I see nothing in the deletion policy or in <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> that implies it. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:56, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's clear that <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincipal_Schoolswatter_8153.html" title="User:Principal Schoolswatter">Principal Schoolswatter</a> is a sockpuppet. Sure there are a limited number of legitimate reasons for sockpuppetry, and I'd love to assume good faith, but creating an ID exclusively for AfDs creates far more opportunity for mischief, and very few sound arguments to justify the practice. That someone is unwilling to put their real contribution history behind a series of AfDs, every single one of which is aimed at a school article, seems to have more than a whiff of bad faith. That no one voting delete has expressed any concern whatsoever with this state of affairs, pooh-poohing any possible issues as merely hypothetical and "tangential" concerns, is at best disappointing. I guess if there are no objections to the practice, maybe I'll create a whole crew of sockpuppets to support my votes. As long as no one minds. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 06:28, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Alan, we've already had your school <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> made with WP:SCHOOLS4. In any event, I don't see why this sort of AfD should be discounted when there is a simple and obvious thing any admin will do - simply treat the nominator as having zero weight in deciding consensus. If there were an ID that did nothing but vote on school articles that user's comments should also be given zero weight. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 06:35, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not making any points here, but our Unprincipled Flyswatter is. If even one person on the delete side of the fence were to express even the slightest displeasure at the fact that there are sockpuppets pushing your agenda, it would be a strong show of support for fair play in the AfD game. Part of finding a middle ground is recognizing that there are folks on both sides who don't follow the spirit of the process., and not standing by idly or minimizing the offense. And besides, aren't all of these AfDs violations of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 07:07, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b><s>Delete</s></b> No support for its rather weak claim through independent reliable sources is offered. Little content. Article has remained in the same condition since March, so it's not being actively worked on.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Although the school is just K-5, the article's creators have taken the trouble to put some info in the article tied to several independent mainstream press articles, and it does make some claims, however weak, to innovative programs. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:25, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It appears that <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincipal_Schoolswatter_8153.html" title="User:Principal Schoolswatter">User:Principal Schoolswatter</a> may be nominating numerous schools for deletion for no clear reason as a "schoolswatter." If you look at <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive</a>, you will notice that over the past two years a developing community consensus has emerged favoring keeping articles on <i>bona fide</i> schools for which there is verifiable information available. Also, WP:DP explicitly states that an article being a stub is not, in and of itself, reason for deletion. Finally, at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> there is a proposed policy in development--I would suggest we hold off on this (and any other school articles anyone may wish to nominate) until that policy is finalized and adopted, unless there is a policy specifically requiring the deletion of the given school--otherwise, we risk removing content that may turn out to be explicitly acceptable according to a broader community consensus. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukini_322a.html" title="User:Kukini">Kukini</a> 15:05, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, the editor's edits seem to have a clear reason- to nominate non-notable schools for deletion. Furthermore, as I have pointed out to you on multiple AfDs there is no such consensus. Most of the kept schools were kept as "no consensus, defaults to keep" AfDs. Furthermore, in the last month or so successful deletions have become more and more common. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:46, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> almost a full delete as being non-notable. The only reason for being weak is that a lot of work and research seems to have gone into the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> It is a school; schools are generally not notable; hence delete. I would like to reiterate <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a>'s point above to <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukini_322a.html" title="User:Kukini">Kukini</a> that claiming consensus has emerged that schools are inherently notable is simply wrong. No such consensus was ever achieved. In fact, most editors favoured deletion last time we went through this. But the margin of preference was insufficient to establish consensus, and no consensus defaults to keep. You may be on <i>slightly</i> stronger ground to say that more of a consensus has emerged that high schools are notable, although again, opinion remains very divided as well. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 10:44, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Kukini. Lovely article about school. Lots of sources were added. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 20:17, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This business about a group of admins and teachers having a schism with another school and then starting this one is interesting. The article should elaborate on the schism; that's what gives this school notability. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 22:51, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b>.</s><b>Speedy Keep</b>. Not any more "notable" than any other pre-school with a handful of students, but that doesn't matter because "notability" is not policy. That being said, the article passes WP:V with a nice bunch of references and encyclopedic presentation of the school's background, campus and frogs. All schools have a story to be told that serves the interests of a very small portion of our very large range of readers. And all it takes is a bunch of editors willing to do the hard work of building the article in order to further extend wikipedia's coverage. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:53, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'd prefer to see more detailed content, but it is fully sourced with relevant independent articles from reliable verifiable sources. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 04:05, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The fact that this school has received so much media attention tends to demonstrate notability above and beyond most other primary schools. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 06:48, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Pains me to say it, as I'm not a fan of school articles, but this one looks like a <b>Keep</b> to me. Notability has been demonstrated. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:27, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
