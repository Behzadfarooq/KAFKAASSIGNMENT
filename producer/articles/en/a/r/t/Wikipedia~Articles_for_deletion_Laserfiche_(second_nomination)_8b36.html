<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. I'm disturbed by the possibility that this discussion may have been influenced by recruitment and the presence of people associated with the company, but the article does seem to be considered keep-worthy in its present state. I assume the nominator's threat to take me to arbitration if I closed as keep is nullified by his later 'keep' opinion. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:19, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Eek, I think I may be guilty of asking people within the Laserfiche community who already have editor accounts to participate in the debate. i.e. <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wp%7Esockpuppet.html#Advertising_and_soliciting_meatpuppets" title="Wp:sockpuppet">Wp:sockpuppet#Advertising_and_soliciting_meatpuppets</a>. And, as you might note, someone without an editor account has been posting under the name "Employee". So it's not as if I was encouraging people to be deceptive. More like trying to bring "my side" to the discussion. Which, as I've learned from reading the soliciting meatpuppets article, is a no-no. I am very sorry about this. To make up for this, I went to the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Document_management.html" title="Document management">document management</a> article to invite people who have done linkspam removal to weigh in on the debate. The two people I found who seem to be doing this are <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMushroom_3f08.html" title="User talk:Mushroom">Mushroom</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/n/User_talk%7ERenesis13_5466.html" title="User talk:Renesis13">Renesis13</a>.

<li>History of Laserfiche outlined in AIIM Pioneer Award interview
<ul>
<li>Looked good, but is a Q&amp;A with the founder of LaserFiche when she was elected to the board of directors of AIIM. A tad self-serving?
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> This article was used as a reference source in the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laserfiche.html" title="Laserfiche">Laserfiche</a> article because it provides company history information. As a side note, Nien-Ling Wacker was on board of directors of the Association of Information and Image Management from 1994-1997. This article was published in 2002, eight years after being elected to the board of directors, and five years after the three year term ended. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocmgmt_46c5.html" title="User:Docmgmt">Docmgmt</a> 16:37, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> This isn't a catalog listing, it's what PC Magazine calls a "product bulletin" about a new release. If PC Magazine didn't find Laserfiche to be notable, they probably wouldn't print a story about a new release. I found this article when looking for references about <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laserfiche.html" title="Laserfiche">Laserfiche</a>, and it helped provide background detail on the software. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocmgmt_46c5.html" title="User:Docmgmt">Docmgmt</a> 16:41, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am an employee of Laserfiche. I've been watching the drama unfold. So my 2 cents may be biased. Laserfiche is a not well know consumer brand but it is well known within the industry. Many installations do not get public coverage because document management is not sexy. BTW, the Iraqi deal was sold though a foreign contractor (not US). One of our larger customers is the the 'social security' of Saudi Arabi. It is a distributed system covering different cities connected to a main system in Riyadh (over a bad internet connection). Another interesting application is in US Congress where mail was converted electronically because of Anthrax scare. For what it's worth, CIA (can't say what they are using it for--but they do pay for support and I have been involved with their support incident;) We do have a tens of thousands of government installations (small towns, cities, counties, parashes all over the US) helping local government go paperless and publish documents online. A lot of installations all over branches of the military. I'm sure all this can be independantly verified if you google it (but I don't have time for this). I'm not here to start an argument just posting information in good faith.

<li><b>please read the guidelines for notability</b> Boy, I sure am sorry I've managed to piss you off. I thought I was helping by showing how Laserfiche follows the guidelines for inclusion for corporations. And it follows the guidelines for notability for software. For people like <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlextangent_35bc.html" title="User:Alextangent">Alex</a> I notice you've never before been involved on a deletion for either a corporation nor for software. Since I wouldn't want to think you work for a competitor and have a grudge against Laserfiche due to its notability in the document management or document imaging industries, I have in good faith been trying to demonstrate how the article actually follows both <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">Wikipedia:Notability (software)</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> by showing a long list of non-trivial third party references. As stated in both those links. Perhaps if you had been involved in more deletions of either software or of corporations I wouldn't be feeling suspicious. Why do I get the feeling that the more I try to provide evidence that the article follows the guideline for inclusion, the less it seems to matter? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocmgmt_46c5.html" title="User:Docmgmt">Docmgmt</a> 00:57, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not particularly concerned that you're "pissed off"; my only concern is (and was, see below) that the article <b>at the point where I nominated it for deletion</b> did not meet the criteria for inclusion. I do not work for a competitor of LaserFiche. Also note that this looks and feels like a vanity page. I do, however, commend you on attempting to justify inclusion on the grounds of notability, and the research you have undertaken. My voice is just one amongst many. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlextangent_35bc.html" title="User:Alextangent">Alex</a> 19:03, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>oh yes, regarding the autobiography issue. There used to exist an article on Laserfiche here on wikipedia that <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlextangent_35bc.html" title="User:Alextangent">Alex</a> nominated for deletion back in March. (The only article he's ever nominated for deletion BTW) I took a look at this article through one of the wikipedia mirrors, and I suspect this article was written by one of our resellers, who are independent companies that are involved in integrating solutions for clients. I didn't know about any of this and so when I learned that we had an article, and it had been deleted, I set out to create a NPOV, independently verifiable article with no original research. Its one thing to edit the earlier article, to conform to wikipedia policy, but as it no longer existed, I felt that I could commit this faux pas to preserve a listing of a notable software product, and a notable company (as defined by the earlier mentioned policies/guidelines). I hope I can persuade others to see things this way, and I thank you for you time and understanding. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocmgmt_46c5.html" title="User:Docmgmt">Docmgmt</a> 01:13, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your suspicion of a reseller being the original author of the deleted article is immaterial to the current request for deletion.

<li>just out of curiosity, is there <i>anything</i> that can be done to demonstrate that this article should be included in wikipedia? I mean, is there a certain length of story that would make you feel the third party reference is notable? Is there a certain circulation size that would make you think the third party reference is notable? I mean, let's be reasonable here. Does the mere presence of an entry written by an employee make the article deletable, with no consideration of attempts to ensure the article is NPOV, verifiable or notabile? Are there any circumstances under which the article could be edited to satsfy you feeling that Laserfiche could be listed in wikipedia? I.e. If you feel that certain sentences are unverified, or biased, could those sentences be removed, and make you feel that, finally, the article should remain? Please let me know under what circumstances you'd be satisfied that this document management software company would qualify for inclusion.

<dd>This dispute is over <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)</a> and the consequent request; <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a>. Notability and the avoidance of advertising or vanity pages is the issue. I would recommend that you raise this article for <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">Wikipedia:Mediation</a> should the article be deleted as a result of this deletion request. However, you have not helped your case by having a keep vote by an employee, and another by a possible sockpuppet. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlextangent_35bc.html" title="User:Alextangent">Alex</a> 14:47, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So, if the issue is Notability and the avoidance of advertising or vanity pages, what burden of proof do you require to satisfy these concerns? For example, let's start with "non-trivial." Since it seems that the links I've provided to show that the company has been "the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself," do not seem to fit your criteria of "non-trivial," could you perhaps help provide some criteria that you use to determine if a work is trivial or not? It's OK if your criteria are extremely strict, I just want to make sure I am not wasting your time by providing links that don't meet your criteria. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocmgmt_46c5.html" title="User:Docmgmt">Docmgmt</a> 16:01, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocmgmt_46c5.html" title="User:Docmgmt">Docmgmt</a> asked me to enter my opinion on this AFD <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Renesis13&amp;diff=58243374&amp;oldid=57677037" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Renesis13&amp;diff=58243374&amp;oldid=57677037" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. After reading this discussion (with the exception of checking all the external references), I felt that this debate could really go either way. I hate to base a decision on the <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOG_53bf.html" title="WP:GOOG">Google Test</a>, but in this case it became the deciding factor. In a Google search for <i>document management</i> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=document+management&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=document+management&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, Laserfiche comes up as #4. In my opinion, if <a href="../../../d/o/c/Document_Management_7364.html" title="Document Management">Document Management</a> has a Wikipedia article, and the fourth listed company in search engine results for that topic has someone willing to write an <i>encyclopedic</i> article about it, then it is helping Wikipedia and not hurting it. What we really need to worry about is the linkspam coming from companies listed much, much lower and linking directly from the article itself using common search keywords. I vote Keep. -- <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenesis13_6b6b.html" title="User:Renesis13">Renesis13</a> 21:52, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per Renesis13. Even if it's a violation of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, I think the company is notable enough to deserve an entry in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMushroom_bc66.html" title="User:Mushroom">Mushroom</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMushroom_3f08.html" title="User talk:Mushroom">Talk</a>)</small> 22:35, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> notwithstanding the sockpuppetry. The article is now much better researched; is no longer POV and meets (if only just) the criteria for notability imho. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlextangent_35bc.html" title="User:Alextangent">Alex</a> 11:41, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
