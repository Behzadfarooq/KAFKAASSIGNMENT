<dd><b>Comment</b> You have provided us evidence that this award exists. Now prove to us that he won it. I hope you can upload the evidence if you have to. I know for a fact that <a href="http://www.katha.org/kathaawards.html" class="external text" title="http://www.katha.org/kathaawards.html" rel="nofollow">Katha Awards</a> are not awarded by the President of India as the original author claimed (that person isn't even mentioned as having the job of handing it over! Who first made that claim? The publisher?). Where would I find out who <i>really</i> won a Katha Award in 1993?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I remember that Wikipedia is for a global audience. I also remember that the existence of those other novels needs to be verified (and that internet evidence may be in Tamil script). Perhaps a search of for them using the original script is in order (it wasn't given in the original article). He is said to have written five other novels. I've looked more closely at the article and it appears that one of those novels I couldn't even find a seller for was already translated into English (<i>Pinaingkalin Mukankal</i> (<i>The Faces of the Dead</i>), I believe it was allegedly called). <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22+Pinaingkalin+Mukankal+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22+Pinaingkalin+Mukankal+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">All four of the Google hits for that</a> were Wikipedia and her clones.--<a href="../../../r/m/k/User%7ERmky87_07f5.html" title="User:Rmky87">Rmky87</a> 17:34, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Kathaimalar was the Saturday supplement of Dinamalar years ago and is not in print now. It is obvious that you cannot <i>find Kathaimalar anywhere</i>. It is either because you do not know to search properly or because it is not in internet or because it is there with some font (one of hundreds) that cannot be searched. By the way their Sunday Supplement is Vaaramalar (வாரமலர்) and their Friday Supplement is Ciruvar Malar (சிறுவர் மலர்)</dd>
<dd>My point is that IF SOMEONE COMES TO THE CONCLUSION THAT KATHAIMALAR DID NOT EXIST BECAUSE HE COULD NOT FIND IT IN INTERNET, His mental acumen has to be questioned.</dd>
<dd>Tirukural is not reviewed in Amazon. Ramayanam (Kambar) is not reviewed in Amazon. That shows that only someone who does not have the slightest idea about the presence of tamil literature in internet (as of today) will use this as a benchmark in fixing the notability. The penetration of Tamil Literature in Amazon on 3/12/2006 is such that even Tirukural and Ramayanam are not reviewed. Just because they are not reviewed does that make these books as non notable. Any one can not see as to HOW USELESS IS TO USE AMAZON REVIEW TO JUDGE NOTABILITY of a TAMIL BOOK.</dd>
<dd>Award or no award this person is a notable person in Tamil Literature. Full Stop. Please don't try to use useless means to justify your decision about something regarding which you have no idea or knowledge.</dd>

<dd><i>The least you could do is give me the titles of those works</i> You have enough of his titles already in the article.</dd>
<dd><i>I want bibliographical citations</i> Kumudam does not have Bibliographical Citations. You seem to be TOTALY IGNORANT ABOUT TAMIL LITERATURE. No way arguing with you&#160;:)</dd>
<dd><i>or links if you can</i> SO there is no world outside Internet for you. You believe in only links. Common. Wake up&#160;!!</dd>
<dd><i>Anyway, what exact sort of work did he publish in there?</i> Novels and Short Stories. My God, we are talking about an novelist.

<p>Comment&#160;: <i>Why have none of you bothered with this, instead of making almost completely unsourced assertions?</i> For the simple reason that tamil works are under represented in Internet. There is no use in killing a Horse because it does not lay eggs. Chickens are supposed to lay eggs and horses have their own use. Since tamil works are not represented in Internet (Even no one has reviewed Tirukural and Ramayanam) there is no use in proving or disproving notability through internet. Is it plain and simple.

<dd>Though in no way related to this article, My next point is to support my claim that AN IMPROPER SEARCH BY SOMEONE WHO HAS NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE SUBJECT IN DISCUSSION can turn a well known entity into "non-notable". For example <a href="http://pkp.blogspot.com/2006_05_01_pkp_archive.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://pkp.blogspot.com/2006_05_01_pkp_archive.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.tamil.net/list/2000-04/msg00278.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tamil.net/list/2000-04/msg00278.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> By the way the Singapore Pancha was a story written in Tamil making fun of the prize schemes of announcing Plane tickets for literary competitions. Hence there is nothing special that it does not turn up in internet.</dd>
<dd><i>Is there anything about him in the media that anyone can show me?</i> Good Question</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>:While I am generally sympathetic to Bruno's arguments about under-representation, the article makes no real claims to notability. The two awards won are relatively minor; the Katha awards are handed out by a nonprofit that works in translation and three short story writers in each of India's eighteen or so languages win every year; traditionally, a different three! A 'novelette competition from Air India' isnt good enough either. Very simply, even on the basis of the unverifiable claims in the article, it fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 19:58, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reluctant Delete</b>. I'm sympathetic to the desire of many participants in this debate to increase the level of global inclusivity for the English version of Wikipedia. However, I find this particular article to be inadequately referenced as it stands. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 19:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for lack of any sources for his supposed achievements. Put these sources in the friggin' <i>article</i>, people. I'm not wading through kilobytes of hot air on this AfD and clicking on dozens of external links to find them. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 20:44, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
