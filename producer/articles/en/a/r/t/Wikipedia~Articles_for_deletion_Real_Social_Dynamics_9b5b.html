<dd>It is <i>not</i> the only reference, and the standard of the newpaper is <i>not</i> "irrelevant".

<li><b>Keep</b>. This seems like a frivolous AFD. The article has three sources, one of which is linked to for easy access, and one of which is a New York Times bestselling book. The book establishes notability (though it may not be the best source for verifiable information on this subject), and the Times article provides verifiability (notwithstanding the personal opinion of some editors on the quality of the Times). All this being said, the article is currently not written from a neutral point of view and needs to be rewritten; it sounds too promotional. The article should have been flagged with a POV tag, not an AFD. Part of the problem is that people affiliated with the company have often engaged in vanity-type whitewashing of the article. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 07:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It is difficult to establish notability of entities within the seduction community, as its existence within the World Wide Web <i>is</i> mainly blogs, commercial sites and discussion boards. It is perfectly feasible that entities are notable within their community, but little-known outside. What is more, the youth and nature of the seduction community itself, as well as the aims of its members, mean that there are few independent written publications in the same way that there are for many other such communities.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Nonetheless, there will be ways to measure notability. I will accept that Real Social Dynamics and its founders, Tyler Durden and Papa, are not the direct subject of The Times article cited. However, they are well-known in the seduction community, so I think this debate should have to come to some other criteria for notability in the seduction community. Do not think that I'm trying to change the rules just so that what should be a non-notable article can stay; I believe that the rules do not adequately support as distinct a sub-culture as the seduction community, and that subjects that are notable enough within this sub-culture that they should have a presence here are being knocked aside.</dd>
<dd>My first proposition would be the mention of a person or entity within Neil Strauss' book <i><a href="../../../p/e/n/The_Game%7E_Penetrating_the_Secret_Society_of_Pickup_Artists_35d6.html" title="The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists">The Game</a></i>. I've not yet read the book myself, but from what I know of it, it appears to be an authoritative work on the English-speaking seduction community. I shall purchase a copy at my first opportunity.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Neil Strauss' book is a work of fiction. Some of the characters are "composite characters" and timelines are crunched down to make the book more readable. It is listed as "Fiction", as opposed to "Biography" for those reasons, and is not a useable source for a wiki entry beyond than to say "Tyler and Papa were characters of the actual book." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.209.184.127_e18f.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.209.184.127">75.209.184.127</a> (talk) 00:04, 30 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Interesting. I found the book in the Fiction section. I suppose I'm somewhat skeptical of Strauss' perspective as shortly after releasing his book he proceeded to start a competing business (www.only375.com) charging $3,750 for his DVD set. When I participate in the editing of a wiki, my intentions are to keep it as neutral and accurate as possible. If one business decides to write a slander piece against another, even if in a "legitimate book", it's not really what I'm looking for as far as a base for the article. If this article is to be re-written it should be based on RSD's ideas and philosophies.</li>

<dd>Wouldn't go so far as to call it a work of slander. I believe the critical aspects of them has been dealt by putting it into a seperate sub section called "Criticism". On the flip side, another point to consider is that Mystery wasn't exactly portrayed overly favourably in the book by Neil Strauss. Yet Mystery has done very well from the publishing of the book and they both still remain good friends of each other. Likewise I'd suggest that everybody who was mentioned did better of than if they hadn't been mentioned regardless of if they were portrayed favourably or not. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 03:16, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
