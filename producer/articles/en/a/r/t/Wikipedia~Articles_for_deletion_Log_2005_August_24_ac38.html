<li>cardioretinometry certainly was original research. And the parts of the two autobiographies by <a href="../../../s/y/d/User%7ESydney_J_Bush_c6d5.html" title="User:Sydney J Bush">User:Sydney J Bush</a> that also presented that theory directly, were too. But to be original research <i>as a biography</i>, Sydney J. Bush would have to have presented a novel interpretation of the biography, or have been primary source material. With no arguments that this is a novel interpretation, and cited sources for practically every individual sentence in the article, I suggest that this is not so. As it is a biography article: rather than addressing it as if it were about the theory propounded by the person, which it is not, it's best addressed on the grounds of whether the person, that it <i>is</i> about, satisfies the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>, as <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">MacGyverMagic</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a>, <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a>, and <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> have done above, discussing such things as whether people have written about this person and what this person's recognized achievements have been. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:10:45, 2005-08-24 (UTC)

<li>Vanity, then. This is why I'm usually not fond of merging VfDs for related articles, because the reasonings may differ. Building a bridge from one reasoning to the next, though, I don't think coming up with a theory that fails <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> gets you sufficient notability to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. --<a href="../../../i/b/y/User%7EIByte_f0c6.html" title="User:IByte">IByte</a> 18:58, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Groups of articles nominated together are sometimes troublesome in that regard, yes. But this wasn't a group of articles, just a rewrite done as the discussion progressed, a rewrite to replace an autobiography with a biography, about the same subject. That your opinion about a rewrite may differ from your opinion of the original is the idea. ☺ Moreover: It's better to bring rewrites created as new articles under the same umbrella than not to. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:47:53, 2005-08-24 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: The present article is badly written and confusing, but Martg76 makes an interesting point. In common usage 'masculinity' is the opposite of 'effeminacy', and 'virile' is the opposite of 'feminine'. OTOH, 'virile' and 'feminine' are still largely terms of admiration, not of abuse. They correlate not only to sexual attractiveness but to positive characteristics of individuals. Cspalletta 18:04, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous. There is not even a majority for outright deletion, so it stands between redirect and outright keep. There are seven votes to keep, five votes to delete and six votes to redirect. If I put the redirect and delete votes together we have 11-7 for discarding the content, which I will not call a consensus either. Also, I'm not sure if a redirect at this title to <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beta_Theta_Pi_98b2.html" title="Beta Theta Pi">Beta Theta Pi</a> would be really useful, or just confusing. Therefore, I will call this an outright <b>keep</b> (no consensus) for the time being. If anyone wants to merge or redirect, they may do so. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:34, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a published author who has produced two volumes of an ongoing work on Iranian music which has been well received within his community. He's been interviewed by the weekly literary magazine Ketab-e Hafte, the Iranian.com (which featured him in 2002 as their <a href="http://www.iranian.com/PhotoDay/2002/February/pejman.html" class="external text" title="http://www.iranian.com/PhotoDay/2002/February/pejman.html" rel="nofollow">Iranian of the day</a>) describes him as "the keeper of all things Persian". He is listed by persiangulfonline.com as one of two "Research and Publication Members". If I were Iranian (I'm not, as it happens) I'd want to know a bit about this fellow. I'm not Iranian (as I said) and I want to know about this fellow. This is why we have encyclopedias. This is why I write for this encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think the parent article, <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salad_Fingers_e87c.html" title="Salad Fingers">Salad Fingers</a>, has gained enough notoriety to warrant an interesting and well thought out article on the sense behind the nonsensical that is Salad Fingers.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think all those involved have done an excellent job in explaining the aspects of the Salad Finger universe and the article is both entertaining, enlightening and informing. I don't see how Salad Fingers Theories needs a deletion its presense only serves to be of help. And somehow I believe fans of the series would likely look on Wikipedia anyway for analysis rather then synopsis. I really don't mean to offend those who want to delete the article but i doubt their critical reasoning, those who aren't so keen on Salad Fingers shouldn't be voting as to them it may be seen as a mindless cartoon. This would prevent an argumentum ad numerum which is largely swindled by lack-of-knowledge decisions rather then of informed decisions.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Kaonashi, this new page was created beause it shares nothing at all with the last page besides the name. It wouldn't be fair to keep the same votes for a page that has been completely redesigned. You've all probably seen the episodes. From discussion I know that 90% blow off the series as non-sensical and weird, while the other 10% ask if there's moe to it than what they see on the surface. David Firth even admits that there is more to the series than most people think, and I believe it's a great idea to keep theories (that were actually the result of discussion on David's page and <b>not</b> the result of one person's effort) so interested people can have a resource to help them with their own analyzations. -- <a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKyle_Michelson_445a.html" title="User:Kyle Michelson">Kyle Michelson</a> 24 August 2005</li>

<dd>The guide(s) weren't really done in time. I doubt that any of <a href="../../../p/c/w/User%7EPcw_09dd.html" title="User:Pcw">User:Pcw</a>'s students even saw it. But let's relax. Last year there were literally dozens of articles like this one. This year, I think there were only a handful. This makes me think that even though the written assignment doesn't mention it, the word must have gotten out anyway. If the ratio of good articles to problem articles is 100:1, as I think it is this year, I don't think we need to do anything special about it at all. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:11, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Are you saying that as an Australian you have never heard John Howard speak of the Anzac Legend/Spirit? I see that you are at the University of Adelaide. Look up the referance and it will give you plenty to read. The main point of this Vfd is to decide if a thing is notable enough for an encyclopaedia.

<p>You appear to be obsessed with trying to tell me what to write about. These pages aren't just talking about measures. In the case of the page on the Aroura we are talking about the differenc e between public and private architecture, the power of landholding, feudalism, Land Tenure in the time of the Ramesides, things about which you are clueless on every level.

<p>A combination of fan speculation, very mild fancruft, original research, and opinions. Disney cartoons aren't specially singled out; nearly all network and syndicated animated shows stop after 65 episodes (because at 65, the studio have enough episodes to broadcast for each weekday for 13 weeks--a full season). I'd say to <b>delete</b> this article with no redirect, and make a mention of the policy at an article for <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_syndication.html" title="Television syndication">television syndication</a>. <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 10:43, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>What more can be said besides providing the reasons why the shows are cancelled after 65 episodes that doesn't venture into fan speculation/wishing? Anything that can be said about the topic can be said in two sentences.

<li><b>reluctant Delete</b> i agree that it should be deleted but i despise the elitist anti "fancruft" philosophy of Freddy - i hate those people that want Wikipedia to only be about stuff like Shakespeare and nuclear physics. 143.238.233.214 10:57, 30 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My use of "fancruft" here is to define the non-neutral speculation and blaiming for the shows' cancellation, as if there were some sort of a conspiracy for their cancelations, and the inherent non-neutral opinions and suppositions that new episodes should have continued to have been made. The article is not encyclopediaic, and it is not an encyclopediaic topic. No, Wikipedia doesn't have to be just about Shakespeare and nuclear physics, but it should treat all subjects in a scholarly manner, and not present articles about children's shows based upon fan speculation. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 14:32, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why not? 'Ə' is just as valid an extention to the Latin alphabet as 'Þ' and both are supported by the bar at the bottom of the editting window for easy entry.

<dd>The David Jasper you found may be worthy of an entry, but comparing his bio on the Glasgow University site to the article makes me doubt it's the same person. I strongly suspect a hoax.

<li><s><b>Do not Delete</b> The only way people will FIND this page is if they explicitly search for "e-gameshow". This page adequately (if primatively) describes what an e-gameshow is and furnishes an example of one that isn't mired with popups, as well as provides a link to the usage of the term in a news article. The definition of an "e-gameshow" is no more obvious than the definition of "e-mail". If someone is asking themselves "what is an e-gameshow" and they search on Wikipedia and can't find an answer, isn't that basically censorship and data-flow constriction? More effort should be put into improving the entry, but deleting it would be a pointless gesture. 11:40, 25 August 2005 <small>(Unsigned from 68.126.252.150 which is the IP address of the author of the article in question.)</small></s></li>

<li>The difference is that in your comment, you were suggesting that people, instead of VfDing small bands, move the topic to List of small bands (which is a bad idea for the reason given by Mgm above); while Uncle G was letting us know that you had moved Machines of Desire, an article currently undergoing VfD, to List of small bands. Moving VfD articles is explicitly prohibited in the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_deletion_e10e.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion">Guide to VfD page</a> and even on the template. You were endorsing this action, Uncle G was not. Uncle G was just saying that this had happened, which is important because if this article is deleted it affects Machines of Desire. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackcap.html" title="Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 20:14, August 24, 2005 (UTC)

<p>This is actually funny. I just received an email to check this out. I am the founder of JMR Band. We ARE a real band. We have been playing a long time. We have played with some notable groups, but WE have never had a national hit record. Of course, that has never been our purpose. We have always been and always will be an indie group. We received some significant regional radio airplay on one of our songs, but that's about it. I hope this clears up the matter. [Joe / jmrband@hotmail.com]</p>

<li>Welcome to Wikipedia, 62.0.117.10. Our articles are written from the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a>. This means that they don't have first-person statements telling the reader what "my opinion is", or referring to things "as I state above", or saying what "young children should be" doing. Our articles are also <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>, which means that, for just one example, where they state that the Surgeon General has warned about something, they should <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> so that the reader can confirm that the Surgeon General has indeed given such a warning. Most importantly, as far as the nomination here is concerned, they must <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">not be original research</a>. Any article that states outright that "The process of introducing young children to computers is little understood and researched." and then goes on to expound upon the subject at length is, by its own admission, new research in the field. Wikipedia is not the place for publishing new research. Please do that in peer-reviewed journals, or somewhere else where peer review will be performed. Please come to Wikipedia with stuff that has been researched, published, peer-reviewed, and accepted into the general corpus of human knowledge <i>already</i>. Finally, our article titles conform to our <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">naming conventions</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:21:17, 2005-08-24 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think being known locally for annoying ads rises to the level of being encyclopedic. Comparisons are odious... but... we recently <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Boch_e389.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Boch">deleted</a> an article on the late Ernie Boch, his sons, car dealership empire, philanthropies, etc. He had regional notability. In fact when I recently bought my car from Boch Toyota (2nd largest Toyota in the world), someone was there who had driven <i>200 miles from New Jersey</i> because Boch had the car he wanted in stock and his local Toyota dealer was estimating a <i>one year</i> wait. Boch's ads in which he smashed car windows with sledgehammers screaming "Nobody smashes prices like Boch" and his catchphrase "Come on down!" were famous throughout the Boston area. He was of significant local economic importance, building a coalition of auto dealers in the Norwood area into a loose coalition and promoting the "Automile" as a car-shopping mecca. I live near the Automile and am a happy customer. I thought the article should be deleted, and that was the consensus. I really think the degree of notability between Boch and Parker is very comparable... and both fall short. Both individuals deserve brief mention as local notables in the articles on the cities where they did business, and that's all. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:41, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>His real name seems to be Tommy Filipowicz and he appears to have become an established (mostly commercial) artist and art director.

Not sure if he is notable enough, though. The <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graffiti.html" title="Graffiti">graffiti</a> scene is obviously somewhat of an an underground thing, and his reputation in that world dates to before the breakthrough of the Internet, so it probably requires someone familiar with that to write a proper article. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 14:24, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Im all in favor of moving the article, if the masses think its noteable to Tommy Filipowicz. I don't think Dwane is an appropriate title, and right now as the article stands it just seems silly with no indication of who he really is or refrences, and was waiting for a VFD. Grafiti Artists where I live are a dime a dozen, and a scourge more then anything. I looked through the website and anyone who creates advertising for the Red Cross or <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Beckam_6b25.html" title="David Beckam">David Beckam</a> seems worthy of a page.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Many people claim to have been "one of the first graffiti artists". In some cases it might be true but it’s really hard to verify. Shortly after the genesis of 'Swedish graffiti' thousands of kids were out painting the walls. In <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_hip_hop.html" title="Swedish hip hop">Swedish hip hop</a> I listed Dissey, who (together with Ziggy) is credited as being 'the first' to spraypaint walls with the colors &amp; motifs that are characteristic of graffiti. These people were arrested on occasions and could consequently prove their claim to fame by showing their arrest sheets. They have also appeared in anthologies, newspaper articles, etc. I listed Mac One because he was a member of the somewhat successful group Treble n' Bass, and has talked about his graffiti days in interviews. Merley were well known within graffiti circles and to the police, he has also talked in interviews and has become infamous under his real name Liam Norberg; for movies and the biggest (?) heist in Swedish history. Later on, galleries for graffiti art were established. Some people were selling their (legal) art work, and hiding their identities became somewhat counterproductive. (<a href="http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_8930794.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_8930794.asp" rel="nofollow">decent article, in Swedish</a>) I personally don't know that much about graffiti artists of Sweden. However, regarding Dwane, I think if he (Tommy Filipowicz) graduated elementary school in 1989 he seems a bit too young to have been seriously involved in the graffiti scene in 1983. --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETsaddik_Dervish_c96b.html" title="User:Tsaddik Dervish">Tsaddik Dervish</a> 15:06, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I can't recall the man trying to sell the recordings of the "wereo." He just proclaims that he has them. The above message is an example of the types that would have it deleted for no good reason.<small><i>(Unsigned edit by 68.222.33.165)</i></small></p>

<p>If the text of the entry is the problem, please someone edit that text. I am no expert on encyclopedic authoring. The most important facts are these: "The Wereo" is referenced over 23,800 times on usenet. "The Wereo" is not just a slang term but is itself an actual movement on usenet by several hundred people. "The Wereo" is more popular than many subjects that have listings on Wikipedia. Squidhammer<small><i>(Unsigned edit by User:209.205.191.147')'</i></small></p>
<p>This is blatantly incorrect. Those "several hundred people" are one prolific troll and a small group of hangers-on who follow him around. A simple google search will verify that. This same troll like to use the word "awl" instead of "all" (along with many other such baby-talk spellings). Do you therefore suggest "awl" deserves a wiki page just because one man has used it 100,000 times in usenet posts? Ludicrous.<small><i>(Unsigned edit by User:80.229.30.88')'</i></small></p>

<li>Is your reason to keep this article that you're not a sockpuppet? That's not a very good reason, I'm afraid. Beacause of the rampant sockpuppet problem, users with 0 edits or very few edits or who haven't contributed anything of value to Wikipedia are generally ignored.

<p>Here is my view on Wikipedia from the group im in here on reform of Wiki: "I too shall be glad to assist in helping to develop a standard of thoughful concensus building which shall not impose new censorship standards on the Wikipedia, save those self imposed ones that lay within ourselves. While the concept of "decency" may be POV on its face still, there should be some basic standard of decency that a community should strive to abide by, lest we suffer that result, which would undoubtedly be ...total anarchy." from:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Wikipedians_for_encyclopedic_merit" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Wikipedians_for_encyclopedic_merit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Wikipedians_for_encyclopedic_merit</a></p>

<li>Cathy is not a troll, and edits in good faith. This should, however, be in her user space. BJAODN stands for "Bad Jokes And Other Deleted Nonsense," which is where a lot of examples of what not to do end up -- in other words, Cathy, I'm afraid someone has beat you to setting this sort of page up. If, however, you would like to keep a log of pages that serve as examples of what not to do, I'd again suggest setting that up connected to your user page.

<li>I say delete. Hey, Cathy, what you are writing is not an article. This is not a bunch of community pages; this is an encyclopædia. Much as I like personal camaraderie, I cannot really define that as belonging to an encyclopædia. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">IINAG</a> 23:47, 24th August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Arrrgh, let's not drag this thru VfD. It's clearly not suitable for the article namespace.

<li>I do not see why there should be a 'Wikipedia Hall of shame,' either in an article form, or as part of the communal community pages. Such a thing would be completely subjective, and would be both a cause of more friction than harmony, and, in a twisted way, a recognition of spammers' potency. Surely, we should not dedicate our space to those who try to bring this encyclopaedia down. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">IINAG</a> 00:12, 25th August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article, it seems, was written by Kourosh ziabari. There are a few hundred instances of him on the net; the 6 pages of his from the UK are basically him writing on blogs, though, and they don't particularly make sense. I skimmed over some of the Farsi links too, (although my grip on that language is not strong, to put it lightly,) and it seems that, on most of them, he is just bigging himself up. I highlight this for a votes for deletion because I am not sure whether his age and his 'acceptance' classified him as notable. If so, this article needs some deal of rewriting. If not, like I expect, then so be it. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">IINAG</a> 23:43, 24th August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Kourosh, you should not remove votes from VfD discussions. It constitutes vandalism. And the criticism is legit - you flat-out stole that article from the health guide website.

<li>An observation: There is a book by Elizabeth Laird titled "The House on the Hill," and I don't doubt it is a perfectly lovely book. However, acording to Amazon, it is aimed at children age 4 to 6. According to my local library catalog, it is 31 pages long, illustrated, and is intended as textbook for foreign speakers of English (part of MacMillan press' Heinemann system of guided readers). So I question its status as a "novel" as described on the page in question. It leads one to question the probable amount of exaggeration elsewhere in the page. <b>Userfy.</b> (On the other hand, Elizabeth Laird is a prolific author of children's books and probably deserves a Wiki page.) <small>(Unsigned vote by <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> (<a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECrypticfirefly_b19d.html" title="User talk:Crypticfirefly">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crypticfirefly_e504.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crypticfirefly">contribs</a>))</small></li>
<li>Just I was wondering how a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0435271733/459/202-8092711-1885407" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0435271733/459/202-8092711-1885407" rel="nofollow">31 page Beginner Level story in a series</a> could be called a novel. On the other hand, <a href="http://hemid.com/october-04/8x.html" class="external text" title="http://hemid.com/october-04/8x.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> is his translation of that 31 page. (At least, this was accessible through the internet). His translation is about 4000 words; therefore, I believe that Kourosh has just translated a part of that book , maybe one title and then has called it a novel. Am I right? Kourosh, don’t you think that you exaggerate everything (a little bit)? <small>(64.229.132.61 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.229.132.61_af19.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.229.132.61">contribs</a>))</small>
<ul>
<li>It could be a severely abridged version. Does someone actually understand Farsi, and can explain further about the translation?

<dd>Kourosh, your weblog is just two months old. How have you been writing in your weblog since 2002? How come?</dd>
<dd>Moreover, your claim to be "one of the most active persian Bloggers" makes no sense when you have posted only 13 entries so far.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>In the sentence "he is one of the most active Persian bloggers", there are a couple of words missing: "spammers", and "among". So, we should have: "he is one of the most active spammers among Persian bloggers".</li>
<li>Warning! Do not let Kourosh Ziabari use Wikipedia for self advertising. This man is a very well known spammer (<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog_spam.html" title="Blog spam">weblogs spam</a>) among Persian bloggers. There is no need to even know Farsi; just try this <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%D8%A8%D8%A7+%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AF...+%D8%A7%D8%B2+%D8%A2%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%8A+%D9%83%D9%87+%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%85+%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B2+%D9%8A%D9%83+%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A7%DA%AF%D9%86%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%85&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;filter=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%D8%A8%D8%A7+%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AF...+%D8%A7%D8%B2+%D8%A2%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%8A+%D9%83%D9%87+%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%85+%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B2+%D9%8A%D9%83+%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A7%DA%AF%D9%86%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%85&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">google link</a>, and see how he has posted same comments for different weblogs, same text full of self advertising and vanity.

<dd>Kourosh, the problem is not that people don't believe you are the youngest journalist. The problem is that Wikipedia has a rule against writing an article about yourself. However, you can put what you wrote on your user page. -- Reinyday</dd>

<li>Hello again, Kourosh. Excuse me if I am curt, but I would not classify writing some web-logs as qualifying you as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prodigy.html" title="Prodigy">prodigy</a>. It is great to start typing something of value, but thousands upon thousands of people do it. Perhaps if you truly had written columns for the New York Times and the Washington Post, as you claimed elsewhere, you would have had our attention, already. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">IINAG</a> 13:24, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
