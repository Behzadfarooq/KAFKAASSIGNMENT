<li><b>Keep</b> All of this can be sourced through in-game dialogue and other in-game elements and strategy guides (quite possibly Brady's, in particular); the gangs can also be considered, albeit in a somewhat warped sense, major characters through <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>: most of these gangs play major roles through <i>all</i> of the games starting from GTA III. You just can't add them into their respective articles, or any other article, of that matter, due to the large amount of information, which, I will say again, <i>can</i> be sufficiently sourced. I also feel a AfD nomination is <i>way</i> too extreme; I think a simple OR or "unreferenced" tag could have sufficed, in this matter. As for the title, I think we could simply discuss a simple solution for this matter, even though I do feel the title is sufficient: gangs have played a <i>major</i> part in all of the GTA games, from GTA 1 to VCS, so I don't see why a "list of gangs" page is so strange. ♣ <a href="../../../k/l/p/User%7EKlptyzm_14bd.html" title="User:Klptyzm"><font color="blue"><b>Klptyzm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/l/p/User_talk%7EKlptyzm_0579.html" title="User talk:Klptyzm"><font color="#FF0000">Chat wit' me</font></a> <b>§</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Klptyzm_dc1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Klptyzm"><font color="#FF1234">Contributions</font></a></sup> ♣ 03:59, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The information is very encyclopediac. And the comment about this is not a gaming wiki, is very stupid. Its almost as if the person read the name of the article, and didn't read the article, and maliciously tagged it for deletion. This person should have be penalized so he will discontinue this act. I suggest throwing some sources in there, to provide some back-up. But this should have been expressed to the article writer, instead of maliciously putting the article for deletion.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Does not fail <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as game content is inherently verifiable. Entirely appropriate as a list. It is a sub-article of the GTA series and as such, is entirely appropriate and not "unencyclopedic". Article itself is obviously long enough that it was split off from the main article. As for lacking secondary sources, that is only useful in a deletion discussion in establishing notability. Since that is obviously not the case here (as it is a sub-article of a very notable game series), lacking secondary sources only merits "sources needed" tags and not deletion. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 08:29, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The present focus is emphasizing only gangs that are significant in the development of the games' storyline, and not gameplay-specific content (which are obviously game cruft). I have also asserted that the article's content is supported to an extent under <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">WP:FICT</a>, under the pretext that the gangs constitute as characters, because the character lists are patchy in covering gangs that lack notable figureheads.

<dd>I do see your point, but in my case I have no edit history on this article or its talk page. I was just an editor who happened to leave an unrelated comment on one of the article editors <a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECraxy_1292.html" title="User talk:Craxy">User talk:Craxy</a> user talk pages, and it seemed to me that the user who was <i>canvassing</i> just used names randomly, as he or she found them (like all editors who left any message on another users talk page) I supposed the reasoning was 'this user talked with someone I agree with, so they might vote my way'. (or the opposite of this logic). I can see this was not very <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> of me, but I honestly could not see why I would have been contacted about this article, as I have not taken any action to demonstrate that I would have any interest in it.

<li><b>Keep</b> Pretty obvious.

<li><b>No vote</b>. Generally I dislike this sort of specialized article (i.e. List of X in Game Y), and this one relies very heavily on primary sources, so I don't want to endorse keeping it. That said, it the article itself isn't all that bad, and it seems to have avoided many of the "game-guide" pitfalls that plague other game-specific articles, so I don't think it really needs to be deleted either. I suppose maybe I'd be happier if the title of the article were more inclusive; "list of gangs" sounds very narrow.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 18:52, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Merge</b> Too much WP:ILIKEIT in the arguments for Keep for my taste. Notable gangs can be merged into the main article and if they can't then they weren't significant to the plot to begin with. The GTA series specializes in sandbox games but it's not in WP's goals to list all the people/gangs you can interact with while you play. The major gangs can be merged and the minor ones can be deleted. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChevinki_c5c7.html" title="User:Chevinki">Chevinki</a> 09:37, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
