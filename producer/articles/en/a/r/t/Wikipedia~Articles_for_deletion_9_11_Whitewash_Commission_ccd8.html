<li>To my way of thinking, this is absolutely not a POV fork; people are playing fast and loose with that term. A <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_fork_623c.html" title="POV fork">POV fork</a> occurs when someone can't get their edits accepted on a page so they create another one for those edits - say, their belief that John Kerry is a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martian.html" title="Martian">Martian</a> keep getting reverted on <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a>, so they create the article Viewpoint that John Kerry is a Martian. <b>That's</b> a POV fork. This article doesn't exist to sneak information on the 9/11 commission through the back door that way; this article exists to point out the fact that some people are calling it a Whitewash Commission. Which is a perfectly legitimate thing to point out, just not something that necessitates an entire article. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 17:23, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>If an article was created that said "<b>Tricky Dick</b> is a nickname for Richard Nixon," that would not constitute a POV fork.

<li><i>And, as you can see, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tricky_Dick_8ae6.html" title="Tricky Dick">Tricky Dick</a> is a redirect to a page that informs you that the term is a nickname for Richard Nixon.</i> Lovely bit of misdirection there: it was ORIGINALLY a page that informed you that the term is a nickname for Richard Nixon, but was quickly (and rightly) changed to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Presidential_nicknames_6c38.html" title="List of United States Presidential nicknames">List of United States Presidential nicknames</a> -- as was <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slick_Willy_0a74.html" title="Slick Willy">Slick Willy</a>, which WAS originallty a redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>: that's precisely the point. The article in question is precisely NOT doing anything resembling redirecting, and, per your analog with Nixon, is precisely a new article with new content about the 9/11 Commission, so by your own definition, a POV fork. And as for redirecting, <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slick_Willy_0a74.html" title="Slick Willy">Slick Willy</a> doesn't redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chimpy_McFlightsuit_eb2f.html" title="Chimpy McFlightsuit">Chimpy McFlightsuit</a> doesn't redirect to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.

<li>The reason that the original <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tricky_Dick_8ae6.html" title="Tricky Dick">Tricky Dick</a> article was changed to a redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Presidential_nicknames_6c38.html" title="List of United States Presidential nicknames">List of United States Presidential nicknames</a> is exactly the same reason that I'm suggesting that this one line "article" on the "9/11 Whitewash Commission" be merged into <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Commission_on_Terrorist_Attacks_Upon_the_United_States_d70a.html" title="National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States">National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States</a> - there's not enough content in pointing out that X is a nickname for Y to justify an entire article. POV doesn't even enter into the equation; there's no POV difference between informing you that X is a nickname for Y and redirecting you somewhere where you are informed that X is a nickname for Y. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 18:34, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The sarcasm is because I can't convincingly roll my eyes in cyberspace -- and given the general tenor of your comments, they'd be apt to roll all the way into the next city, anyways, So, a general accusation of single-source news consumption is a form of personal attack? Somehow, I don't think that was the thought that prompted your original comment. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 14:23, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, making an unfounded accusation that someone's personal beliefs are the result of a limited exposure to news is a form of personal attack - and totally unnecessary on an afd page.
