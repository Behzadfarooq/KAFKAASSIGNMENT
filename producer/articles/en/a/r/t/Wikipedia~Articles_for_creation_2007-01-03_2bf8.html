<p>stuffi was born in papenburg a beautiful, tiny actually pretty boring town in the far north of germany in 1981. After finishing school stefan moved to hmburg to experience the so called big-city live. After a awesome year in hamburgoved on and stefan decided to head for the south of germany and stucked already after a few kilometres in dortmund also known as "the beauty of the ruhr valley". But after a few weeks time stuffi found that the ruhr valley is not really a good place to be and tried his luck further south in vienna. After 2 month in vienna he was thinking - ahh - maybe the ruhr valley is not too bad. So he left vienna behind and went back to dortmund where he continued his study (whatever this strange study was supposed to be). However, he lived one year in dortmund pretty much without any plan. He worked here and there and tried his best to live as laidback as possible. But again, as time past by he was a bit pissed of because his english skills were rather good. So it came that he decided to go somewhere to lern this world language. Today stuffi has been studying abroad for 1 year. His english is still not good but it it is not too bad either. Istead of staying abroad to lern it perfectly he does not care because he would like to go back to the lovely ruhr valley where all his mates are!</p>
<p>I met this guy called stefan while I was travelling and after a few drinks we were kidding about how fuckin stupid it would be to write an artical about random people you have met during your travelling. So here we go - I present stuffi</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-01-03_2bf8.html" title="Edit section: Todd Holland">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Todd Holland</span></h2>
<p>By the time Todd Holland began attending Cocoa Beach High School, he was the biggest Pro surfing prospect to come out of Florida at the time. I personally remember challenging him to push-up contests in gym class, and friend and competitor Sean Slater remembers Todd holding the school record for the most consecutive push-ups during that time. As competitors always trying to one-up each other, Sean remembers Todd “beating me ASAP each time I bettered him.”</p>
<p>As a surfer for Natural Art Surfboards and OP swimwear during this time, Todd was picked for the NSSA National team five times. Natural Art founder Pete Dooley remembers him as a “fierce competitor and always ready to go.” If the waves were too small or uncontestable, Todd would still go out and surf 100 mph around contestants and force contest directors to reconsider previous cancellation plans. Dooley claims that if Todd had paid a bit more attention to his board designs, “he would’ve probably been a world champ.”</p>
<p>In 1984, Todd won 3rd place in the World Amateur Contest and by 1987, he became “Rookie of the Year” on the ASP World Tour. After studying techniques from guys like Shaun Thompson, Tom Carroll, and Tom Curren, Todd’s surfing career peaked in 1991 when he won the “OP Pro” contest in Huntington Beach, CA, beating then-World Champion Martin Potter and points leader Curren, while also taking down Carrol at Pipeline. Todd was beating everyone in all types of surf. Reflecting on similar triumphs, Todd claims that success comes with “surfing smart and paying attention to what others are doing individually in each contest.” He added that one “should focus on what you have to do to win. Only you can beat yourself.”</p>
<p>By this time, Todd was on top of his game. He’d earned a sponsorship with Ron Jon Surf Shop riding Gary Linden’s boards, but after a heavily-publicized and controversial interference row during a Brazilian contest, he had to be escorted to the airport. During the event, he tried to beat an overly aggressive Brazilian at his own game of intimidation, and incurred the wrath of a local commentator - and a horde of local spectators. The legendary incident essentially - and unfairly - crippled his future surfing career.</p>
<p>Todd’s since traded in his board for a mud-loving Chevy side-step named “Deja Vu” and works for Sea Ray. He enjoys spending time with his wife Cheryl, daughter Chalee, and son Calvin. Most of his days off are spent with the “6th Street Fish and Surf Club,” and apart from old friend Sean Slater’s updates, he doesn’t really follow news of the Pro Tours. “I want to see Kelly (Slater) beat everyone,” Todd says. “I root for the old guys. When they took ‘style’ out of the criteria, it gave spazzes who do a lot of ugly turns a chance at winning contests.”</p>
<p>Calvin Holland’s huge potential is evident from watching him recently out at 6th Street. With his father willing to coach and do whatever he can to further his interest in the sport, and the Slaters living on the same block, he’s sure to succeed. Todd only wishes that there was “another Islander Hut to grow up at.”</p>

<pre>
<b>Introduction</b>:
</pre>
<p>Borrowing experiences from European countries, Taiwan introduced the substitute military services in 2000 to shift part of the civilian servicemen to social services. The move was the first ever among Asian countries. Not only has it maintained the fairness of military services, it has also helped to improve the quality of services offered by the government.</p>
<p><b>Background</b> To upgrade daily living services for foreigners in Taiwan, foreign language substitute military services offer (1) assistance in accessing government services, (2) English translation, (3) guided tours and narratives, (4) promotions of government services, (5) English interpretation, (6) receiving foreign guests, (7) communications and reporting, (8) English Web page management, (9) compilation of English translation materials, and (10) marketing of local cultures and specialties to other countries. In 2005, with the Executive Yuan’s approval, the practice of Substitute Civilian Servicemen for foreign language affairs was launched to recruit conscripts to perform the aforementioned duties. Every year, two to three batches of conscripts are recruited to serve as Substitute Civilian Servicemen for foreign language affairs. So far, more than two hundred of them are involved in government’s push for Taiwan to connect to the global village.</p>
<p><b>Who are eligible?</b> Draftees who meet any of the following requirements are eligible to apply for substitute military services: First priority (Applicants will be selected from the top of the following list.):</p>
<p>1. Those who have been approved by the Conscription Agency of the Ministry of the Interior to serve substitute military services, 2. Those who have received degrees from colleges or universities in English-speaking countries, 3. Those who have received degrees of Foreign Language (English preferred) or Literature majors from colleges or universities in Taiwan, 4. Those who have passed the high-intermediate level of General English Proficiency Test (GEPT) or its equivalent English language tests accredited by Taiwan government, or 5. Those who have passed the intermediate level of General English Proficiency Test (GEPT) or its equivalent English language tests accredited by Taiwan government.</p>

<p><b>Since we both parted</b></p>
<p>A song written by: Anonymous</p>
<p><br />
How far will I have to go to get you back</p>
<p>Cause without you by my side I lack</p>
<p>The happiness and love to go on</p>
<p>And I've been devastated since you've been gone</p>
<p><br />
And now I'm afraid that my heart</p>
<p>Will forever be torn apart</p>
<p>You gotta come back or I'm afraid</p>
<p>That my love for you will begin to fade</p>
<p><br />
Chorus:</p>
<p>My life has come to an end</p>
<p>My heart will never be able to mend</p>
<p>Since we both parted so long ago</p>
<p>My tears of grief still flow</p>
<p>I'm incapable to let go and forget</p>
<p>All the things we've done since we met</p>
<p>And worst of all I can still recall</p>
<p>The day you left me without warning me at all</p>
<p><br />
All those years I thought you would always</p>
<p>Stay by my side till the end of my days</p>
<p>But things didn't turn out quite as I'd planned</p>
<p>And now I must live on alone in this wretched land</p>
<p>And now I'm afraid that my heart</p>
<p>Will forever be torn apart</p>
<p>You gotta come back or I'm afraid</p>
<p>That my love for you will begin to fade</p>
<p><br />
Chorus:</p>
<p>How much more suffering are you gonna make me endure</p>
<p>If I'll be able to take it any longer I'm not quite sure</p>
<p>This agony is killing me inside and out</p>
<p>And eventually I'll crash I have no doubt</p>
<p>Chorus:</p>
<p>The day you left me without warning me at all</p>

Marco Ent. is a replica props dealer in Anaheim, CA. Rumor has it that he was shut down by Lucasfilm in the 1980's, but now he is back. I purchased several small costume items from him and was pleased with the quality and the two week turn around time on my order. He also sells vintage Star Wars toys and I was pleased with the quality of the old lunch box and AT-ST that I bought. He has a very large selection of Star Wars replicas in his catalog, as well as Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Aliens, and more.</p>
<p>The disadvantages were that he only accepts money orders and he has no on-line ordering and not even a website! I would recommend this dealer and would probably order from him again. Matt Pinick</p>
<p>I used to own nearly all of Marco's Star Wars props before he was shut down. His work, for the price, couldn't be beat. He had one of the best sets of armor, excellent weapons, great helmets, and incredible lesser known movie props (like Blade Runner, Logan's Run, Galactica (those helmets were fantastic!)) out there at the time. While not always perfect and showing "battle damage" (as he said in his catalog) these were just minor flaws that came in the molds and were barely noticeable. Especially for the prices they couldn't be beat! As one of the first SW prop makers he did an excellent job and I was sorry to see him go. Mike Jackiw</p>

<p>Clyde Takeguchi is an Aikido instructor with the rank of shichidan, or 7th degree black belt, and the title shihan – “model teacher” -- in the United States Aikido Federation. He is the founder and director of Capital Aikikai, a dojo in Silver Spring, Md., which he established in 1973.</p>
<p>He began studying the Japanese martial art of Aikido in 1958 as a teenager in his native Hawaii. He started the practicing because he said he was attracted to Aikido’s philosophy as a benevolent martial art which can be applied to hand-to-hand combat as well as everyday life.</p>
<p>While he continues to teach at Capital Aikikai, he stepped down as the chief instructor to spend more time conducting Aikido seminars across the United States.</p>
<p>In addition to forming Capital Aikikai, he set up Aikido clubs in Madison, Wis., and Charleston, S.C., and has taught the martial art at the police departments in Honolulu and Madison, as well as at the U.S. Customs Academy in Washington, D.C. He is a member of the U.S. Aikido Federation's Teaching Committee and its Board of Governors.</p>

<p>Kris Williams is a British singer-songwriter-multi instrumentalist, born in Wales (March 8th, 1977). His childhood involved no heavy upheavals, but frequent holidays abroad. Numerous times in interviews he has discussed a close family upbringing based around devoted parents: a scientific father and a religious mother. He often speaks-out that his music is just trying to make sense of religion, philosophy and science.</p>
<p>After starting college @ University College London in 1997, he started playing under the name Eso Burst in a band 'The Fantastic Super Foofs'with old school friends Nav Verghese and Baz Hall ironically at this time they opened and shared musical bills with fellow college mates 'My Vitriol','Keane' and 'Coldplay' The Fantastic Super Foofs released 3 independent, 3-track singles in 2001 on Floating Toast Records / Fuzzbox Records and toured with good friends 'Mclusky who they shared the same 'Zincsplash' management with. 'The Fantastic Super Foofs' became just 'The Foofs' after the name came under management scrutiny. On an ill-fated, cold winter night in Camden, London 'The Foofs' played to half the A&amp;R department of the UK. It was during this time the band had a meltdown, they disappeared after this.</p>
<p>Shortly following, the plan was to give up on music; but after listening to 'In Utero' and 'Surfer Rosa' in Chicago Williams came back with a new band name 'Kaptainblack' (homage to Frank Black) but kept the same band members. They recorded the album in 3 weeks in december 03 and named it 'In Fertility' The songs were (in his own words) 'a new movement tagged - Blunktry - a homage to low-budget, punk ethos recordings derived from the origins of punk, blues and country'</p>
<p>'In fertility' wasn't released until April 2005 on the 'Mighty Atom' independent label to mixed reviews .... much to the disappointment of Williams</p>
<p>Williams started making more popular, mainstream music with an up and coming band 'Dirty Perfect' at this time. He wrote and performed under the name 'Kip Armstrong' allegedly an narcoleptic-insomniac. They released a 4-track EP called 'Dirty Perfect' and a 2-track 7' single called 'Quaterback Hairdo'and signed to Sony ATV publishing in November 2005.</p>
<p>2006 should of been a fruitful year, but Williams became further and further detatched from the band and the 'pop-approach song formula, singing about secrets in boxes in high-school environment codsap'; he become partially addicted to alcohol and pain-killers but also became addicted to experimenting with types of music he had always been fond of&#160;: folk, electronica and country.</p>
<p>It was here Eugene Francis Jnr was born.</p>
<p>Eugene Francis Jnr's first album 'The Golden Beatle' is due for release sometime later in 2007. His first single 'My Own Pollution' is due for release in March 2007</p>
<p>Williams has admitted to a strong bi-polar disorder where 'things are either sky-high good' or 'bangkok-trench bad' He is either overly confident or a recluse.</p>
<p>'Eugene Francis Jnr is the person I always wanted to be, playing all the instruments that people considered to be strange like mandolins and organs but I was too afraid to step out from the guitar-based band tag and do something heartfelt and non-jock-macho. Finally I think I have become myself. Poetry was always my first love over music and Eugene Francis Jnr embraces this. I want to ultimateley report and sing about things with depth and purpose but to always provide an avenue of hope for the listener.'</p>

Capulette is a Hardcore/Screamo band from Davao City, Philippines that started around mid-2006 playing covers of emo band, Indian Summer in hopes of shedding light on the 1990s Emo and Screamo scene.</p>
<p>They are known to be violent onstage, featuring a spastic lead singer and on-the-spot lyrics for the sake of the feeling urgency crucial to the band's sound which musically, is comparable to emo and screamo bands like 1905, Mesa Verde, Saetia, and Joshua Fit For Battle.</p>
<p>to date, they only have one release on the Puro Ka indie! Collective consisting of rough drafts and demo versions of songs soon to be rerecorded in the first quarter of 2007;</p>
