<li><b>Weak delete</b>. This sounds like a coherent (albeit offbeat) concept, and it wouldn't matter that the label is being retrospectively attached to people and movements who hadn't coined the pharse. However, google seems to throw up very little substantive on the concept, so I vote at delete as a probable neologism, without any sources. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 09:02, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>; although there are a several Google results, they don't seem to match each other or the article, and would generally seem to support the idea that this is just a term a lot of people have come up with seperately because it sounded so silly.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> - I linked to the Wayne John Sturgeon article, but I can't find any further references to this term, so the article currently fails <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. On the same grounds (one article from a journalist for <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_Green_5587.html" title="Alternative Green">Alternative Green</a>) it fails <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I was one of the people who originally suggested the article be deleted, because at the time I assumed the article creator had taken the term from my own, joking, off-the-cuff use in the anarchism template talk pages. However, after digging around a bit, it looks like similar terms have been used in print at least twice. I suspect that it’s such a temptingly paradoxical concept that people keep coining it over and over again. I listed the five usages I’ve found in my comment below. Three of them appear to be independent coinages. I should also note, however, that it does <i>not</i> appear to bear any relationship with <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> proper. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 13:29, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> <b>Apparently serious usage:</b> (1) Postmodernist writer <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakim_Bey_818f.html" title="Hakim Bey">Hakim Bey</a> uses the term in a poetic essay titled <i>Black Crown &amp; Black Rose: Anarcho-Monarchism &amp; Anarcho-Mysticism</i>. Here, it is a retrospective label for the presumed phenomenon of <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsarist.html" title="Tsarist">Tsarist</a> Narodnik anarchists among Russian peasantry of the 1850s-60s. He does not back up the claim, but reading the article on <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narodniks.html" title="Narodniks">Narodniks</a>, it seems like a reasonable proposition.

Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur: A Monarcho-Anarchist in Revolutionary America</i> in the book <u>Readings at the Edge of Literature</u>. The book is described as being about “the central paradoxes of the American project”.

Tolkien’s apparently inarticulate political views, conflating them with the political situation described in the Middle Earth books. (<a href="http://www.thirdway.org/files/articles/anarchomon.html" class="external free" title="http://www.thirdway.org/files/articles/anarchomon.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirdway.org/files/articles/anarchomon.html</a>) <b>Humorous usage:</b> (4) Ken Brown’s link list describes Sturgeon himself as “non-violent-nationalist-British-Israelite-anti-racist-Christian-occult-anarchist-monarchism”.

<li>Some people have used the term in the past, yes; but the problem is, almost all of them seem to think that they invented it, and none of them seem to have been using it to say quite the same thing. We could have an article here, I guess, but its content would amount to "a handful of people have used the term <b>anarcho-monarchism</b>, either in a humorous fashion or as a neologism to describe the views of a single person. The majority of people using the term seem to have no knowledge that it has ever been used by anyone else, and none have provided a concrete definition. Below is a quick listing of all the usages of 'anarcho-monarchism' we could turn up on Google." Ok, so we wouldn't actually <i>say</i> the last sentence, but you get the idea. I don't see how we could make an encyclopedic article out of that. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 01:54, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. One cannot maintain a belief in anarchism and simultaneously support a monarch. PERIOD. It seems like either a sarcastic joke article or the ramblings of a single, confused adherent. A poem that utilized the term (as described above) is not scholarly or academic in nature but is rather art while a few comments (which have suffered no peer-reveiw) are simply conjecture and I don't think either provide adequete source material for an article on a political philosophy. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">Blockader</a> 15:20, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, it shouldn't be listed <i>as a political philosophy</i>. That's certain. It's a (deliberately) paradoxical or nonsensical notion. However, it's been used several times either by or in reference to notable figures, and as such, it should have an article (cf <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grue_%28color%29.html" title="Grue (color)">Grue</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grue_%28color%29.html" title="Grue (color)">Bleen</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a>). --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 15:48, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> I guess the difference between "grue and bleen" and anarcho-monarchism is that the former is rather inconsequential while the latter could confuse or misinform people who are trying to find information on actual schools of anarchism. Anarcho-monarchism, while obviously paradoxical to us, may create uncertainty or bias among the uniniated. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockader_5d3e.html" title="User:Blockader">Blockader</a> 16:06, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> I agree that it might create confusion...but only if it were linked from or associated with the Anarchism article. Likewise, grue and bleen would create confusion if they were linked to the articles on printing or the electromagnetic spectrum. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 17:17, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> I assumed that it would be linked from the anarchism article. Before this discussion it appeared in the "traditions" table to the right of the intro.

<li><b>Reply</b> No, it makes no sense to link it to Anarchism. I'd say anarcho-capitalism also should not be linked to Anarchism proper. I'm discovering that there are a whole slew of alterna-anarchisms or pseudo-anarchisms that don't come out of traditional anarchism...for example <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-nationalism.html" title="Anarcho-nationalism">anarcho-nationalism</a> and anarcho-mysticism. These are ideas alien to Anarchism. They have a place on Wikipedia in their own right, but it would be misleading to imply association with Anarchism proper. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 20:02, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article cann not be deletes an in referencing the emotions of Blockader, it is more than possible to support a voluntary patriach... just as in Medieval Iceland, or in the spirit of German Kings. Anarchism calls for the destruction of coercive, involuntary rule and authority... just as Anarchists agree that people can come together to create voluntary communes, come together to forge third-party arbitration, so can they come together to form voluntary groups of people led by a patriach, who serves nominally as a leader and advisor. To delete this article would simply be giving in to pressure and supporting censorship... just as some anarchists view anarcho-capitalism as not anarchism.. it must be agreed that such theories must remain to be accessed... by the simply use of "anarcho-" or "anarcha-" we are agreeing that there are varying forms of the political theory known as "anarchism".

<dd><b>This discussion should be taken elsewhere.</b> However...see my comments above. A "theory" doesn't qualify as part of the Anarchist movement just because it uses "anarch-" in its name. Anarchism is a <i>movement</i>, and it has a history. Anarcho-capitalism, anarcho-monarchism, anarcho-nationalism, anarcho-mysticism, panarchism, and perhaps anarcho-primitivism do not share any history within Anarchism proper, and from a traditional Anarchist point of view, they are mis-uses of the term anarchism. All of these alterna-anarchisms, pseudo-anarchisms, para-anarchisms, are separate theories and/or philosophies and/or movements. They have every right to exist and they have every right to have Wikipedia articles. But putting them within Anarchism proper is just facutally incorrect. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 20:08, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- and I regret voting this way, because I love paradox. I'd like to be shown that such a movement exists and has something interesting to say in defense of the thought-halting terminology. Even a small movement with a mostly academic demographic (like <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>) might be of interest -- if the people using the term know one another, build on each other's works, etc. But all I've seen are a handful of references made for disparate purposes.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Though some of the ideas of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">Capitalism</a> are in agreement with <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a>, since both movements can trace the root of their respective ideologies to the Englightment, and Man as a Free Being with a Free will, the notion of Anarcho-monarchism is completely absurd, since one of the basic principles of anarchism is not to lead and not to be leaded. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProject2501a_7385.html" title="User:Project2501a">Project2501a</a> 14:12, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
