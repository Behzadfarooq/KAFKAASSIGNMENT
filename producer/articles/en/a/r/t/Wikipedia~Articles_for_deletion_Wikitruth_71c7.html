<p>This page has already been speedy deleted twice; however, I'm listing it here because, since it is a site critical of Wikipedia, we should be seen to be transparent in our processes, rather than running the risk of being seen as deleting criticism for it's own sake. Because of the reason for listing here, I'm not expressing an opinion as to whether this should be kept or deleted. By the way: <a href="../../../h/t/u/User%7EHturtikiw_f4d3.html" title="User:Hturtikiw">User:Hturtikiw</a>'s name is "wikitruth" spelled backwards, and this is their only edit. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 12:44, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a>, for the time being at least. The site deserves a sentence or two at that page, and an external link, as criticism by admins should be covered on that page. I notice that even external link adding has been reverted. Now its ok to do that for Wikipedia Review which has the occasional really unpleasant "commentary", but the criticism on Wikitruth is legitimate (even if I don't necessarily agree with all of it). The redirect strikes the appropriate balance between notability and transparency. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 13:34, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

If that's all it takes to establish notability these days then the floodgates will open. Never mind that the claims made about the website have not been verified. Never mind that the website is a forum for gossip and innuendo (like many websites). Never mind that, as this debate goes on, the website is down because of a slashdotting. Not that such an act establishes notability–Slashdot links all kinds of things from the main page. If Wikitruth actually grows into a serious critique of Wikipedia, it may deserve an article. But we're not a crystal ball. Anyone can setup a wiki with eight to ten users and post salacious gossip. I'm in a position to do so myself. Morevoer, given the repeated allegations of sloppy journalism which have followed <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Orlowski_20f6.html" title="Andrew Orlowski">Andrew Orlowski</a> for years, I could probably drop him a line and get him to mention it in his next rant against Wikipedia.

<dt>"If we delete it, we really are censoring them!"</dt>
<dd>The problem with this argument is that it assumes we are already allowing that article to express a point of view. Remember, we are neutral when it comes to prose in the main namespace. That article, <i>if well-written</i>, will not express any point of view whatsoever. If the site's authors want a spot on Wikipedia itself where they can bitch and moan about our faults, they can do it in the <i>Talk:</i>, <i>User:</i>, <i>User talk:</i>, or <i>Wikipedia talk:</i> namespaces.</dd>
<dt>"The site's notable 'cause it's been linked from Slashdot and the <i>Register</i>!"</dt>
<dd>The site itself is a non-notable website. Being linked to from Slashdot is not notable. Being linked to from the <i>Register</i> is not notable. The Wikipedia Review, a similarly sized site with similar credentials, has no article, and this site shouldn't have one either.</dd>
<dt>"It's bad PR for us to delete it!"</dt>
<dd>Anybody who doesn't like us will bitch and moan about us no matter what. They will complain about deletions, admins, images, and pretty much anything else they want. This article is not a pivotal stronghold in the war against bad PR. More importantly, we aren't even attempting at the moment to create good PR. Wikipedia doesn't make press releases, right? The only one of us who's gone onto traditional media to defend us is Jimbo, who will defend the encyclopedia no matter what from here 'til the end of time. Let him, the man who actually speaks up, be the one to defend the project. As for this article, let's not throw away our policies just to cater to one small minority group. - <strong><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#0033CC">Corbin</font></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_7ee9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics"><font color="red">?</font></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_in_eight_words_51f8.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia in eight words"><font color="orange">1</font></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Missing_encyclopedic_articles_25fe.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Missing encyclopedic articles"><font color="gold">?</font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="lime">p</font></a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpanish_Translation_of_the_Week_e00d.html" title="Wikipedia:Spanish Translation of the Week"><font color="blue">s</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CorbinSimpson_9722.html" title="Special:Contributions/CorbinSimpson"><font color="indigo">?</font></a> <font color="violet">?</font></strong> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson">Rock on, dude!</a></sup> 14:33, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> -Fellow wikipedians, there is a paradox in the making here. A real trap, so to speak. If we delete this article we make the site more noteworthy, lend them more credibility, and make them more deserving of an article. If we delete the article now, we'll simply have to re-create it later, as "suppressed" and "censored" things always generate more interest than they would if freely available. Even something like merging or redirecting will simply give them ammunition. If the wikitruth site dies down and ceases to update, then we can consider deleting it. For now, it would be heavy-handed and counter-productive to get rid of it.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The article is one of the very few that concern the abuse of power by Administrators.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Tiny little website with an Alexa ranking that hasn't broken into the top 5,000 during a moment of prominence which will probably be brief. And almost all the hits are probably from Wikipedians.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Whether or not your two speculative <i>probably</i> comments are true doesn't matter; the article satisfies the criteria laid out in the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">notability of a website guidelines</a>. Simple. If your Britannica analogy included a website that resulted from the employee argument which was subsequently published in a non-trivial manner by several other notable publications then your analogy, also, would satisfy notability criteria. Guidelines are not hard policy, but you're not suggesting an overriding principle which would compel us to disregard the guidelines. --<a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDs13_da5c.html" title="User:Ds13">Ds13</a> 17:36, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Strong Keep:</b> Completely bloody ridiculous. Exactly WHAT policy is this page infringing? Non-notability is out of the question! The site has been visited by people in excess of 100,000, has been Slashdotted, and covered in several other media outlets. Its obviously notable, its obviously verifiable, and I cant see any reason for deleting it other than what they say is true: we can't take the criticism!

<p>Here are the notability guidelines for website inclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong Keep -- First, I find the arguments for notability very persuasive. Second, PR is certainly a consideration here. Third, I don't know all the details, but speedy is to be used only for the most obvious cases. This doesn't even meet the criteria for proposed deletion, as it's obviously generated substantial discussion. I'm not saying we should keep all unencyclopedic articles just because there are previous questions as to process, but from a PR and community transparency perspective, it needs to be considered. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 19:05, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Criteria for web content</b></p>
<p>Web specific-content<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> is notable if it meets <i>any one</i> of the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.
<ul>
<li>This criterion excludes:
<ul>
<li>Media re-prints of press releases and advertising for the content or site.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
<li>Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or content descriptions in internet directories or <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_commerce.html" title="Electronic commerce">online stores</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This criterion includes <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></li>
<li>The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>The article itself <b>must</b> provide proof that its subject meets one of these criteria via inlined links or a "Reference" or "External link" section.</p>
<p>As can be seen, Wikitruth clearly qualifies for notability, and notice that it qualifies if it meets any one of the following criteria. Any other conclusion would clearly be censorship. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Dillinger_2c06.html" title="User:Nick Dillinger">Nick Dillinger</a> 18:43, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Good comment. Its a lucky thing that this site became notable in time for the AFD. Or else it might have been protected from recreation like another notable critic site that we all know and love, Wikipedia Review.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Alexa rankings are, to be honest, complete and total bullshit when it comes to rating the popularity of a site. However, this does not change the fact that they are still citable in an AfD. More importantly, they have been removed entirely from WP:WEB, so don't worry either way about them. If I were one of the people trying to save this article, I would be <i><b>MUCH</b></i> more worried about demonstrating that the mentions of Wikitruth in these two articles, <a href="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1752257,00.html" class="external text" title="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1752257,00.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/04/18/wales_sanger_interviews/print.html" class="external text" title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/04/18/wales_sanger_interviews/print.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, are actually notable mentions. I quote from WP:WEB, criterion 1: "<i>Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or content descriptions in internet directories or <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_commerce.html" title="Electronic commerce">online stores</a>.</i>" How strange, then, that the first article only mentions Wikitruth in two different sentences. The first sentence gives us "www.wikitruth.info." The second sentence is just a passing mention. The second article is even worse — all it says is that the first article has information! Seriously, this is just ridiculous. The irrefutable truth of the matter is that this site has been set up do nothing more than inflame and polarize the community (and at that, it's doing a fucking brilliant job, as the comments on this page have shown)... I have nothing more to add. If I have not managed to convince you yet, then I doubt much more can change your minds. - <strong><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#0033CC">Corbin</font></a> <a href="../../../w/p/m/WP%7EWPM_9a68.html" title="WP:WPM"><font color="red">∫</font></a> <a href="../../../8/w/_/WP%7E8W_03c1.html" title="WP:8W"><font color="orange">1</font></a> <a href="../../../m/e/a/WP%7EMEA_d033.html" title="WP:MEA"><font color="gold">ɱ</font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="lime">p</font></a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPATRA_5b5c.html" title="WP:SPATRA"><font color="blue">s</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CorbinSimpson_9722.html" title="Special:Contributions/CorbinSimpson"><font color="indigo">ɔ</font></a> <a href="../../../w/p/m/WP%7EWPMU_ef61.html" title="WP:WPMU"><font color="violet">♫</font></a></strong> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson">Rock on, dude!</a></sup> 20:09, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Has to be a keep</b> I didn't actually see the link on slashdot but I think that just adds fuel to the fire, and further backs up an argument to keep the article.

I think a lot of smart wikipedians read a site like that and learn from it. Any good site learns from criticism and doesn't just blow it off --the latter is the "internet" thing to do, which usually equates to being foolish and pig-headed. As per the above comment, deleting it seems to fall into their plans: "OMG, we're what Jimbo Wales/Wikipedia <i>doesn't</i> want you to see!"

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's notable, it's current, and it's going to blow up in WP's face if it goes - especially right now, when the subject is hot. Is that pandering to public opinion? I don't think so. Like it or not, the project will not survive only on the strength of our good intentions. It has to prove itself as a reliable, objective entity that can take criticism in a mature, adult manner. I think that deleting (and ESPECIALLY using a "speedy delete") to remove a page about an organization that is critical of Wikipedia will look really, really bad. Instead, why not show the world what Wikipedia is all about, and write the best damn article we can about this site. Crisp, concise text. Solid references. Both sides of the debate, presented in a neutral manner. Someone wants to learn what all the fuss is about? Hey, read it in Wikipedia. My advice? Step back from this one, take a breather, and let the editors go at it. If the deletionists still feel strongly about it in a few months. revisit the issue. I, for one, will still say keep - there's a LOT of other articles that need our time and energy... --<a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a> 08:48, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
