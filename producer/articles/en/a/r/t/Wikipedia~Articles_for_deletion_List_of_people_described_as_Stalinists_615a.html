<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If sourcing is the only issue, it could be easily added. I should also note that we have a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Fascists_1eb2.html" title="List of Fascists">List of Fascists</a> (not sourced on the page and including a category of “Possible Successors”) and List of people described as neoconservatives (a list that handily survived its VFD) and absolutely no one self identifies as a necon, but many of the individuals in the list did indeed describe themselves as Stalinists at one point in their lives. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 19:19, Apr 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Fascists_1eb2.html" title="List of Fascists">List of Fascists</a> specifically states: "This is a list of persons who self-identify as Fascists or a variant". <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_described_as_Stalinists_cd4d.html" title="List of people described as Stalinists">List of people described as Stalinists</a> is different because it includes people who never called themselves Stalinists, but to whom the term was applied as a slur. I don't feel that this is appropriate for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 19:49, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Many of the people on the list, like Pablo Neruda, Michael Redgrave, and Kim Jong Il are/were self described Stalinists. Just because there are no polemics in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nation_3a20.html" title="The Nation">The Nation</a>, the <a href="../../../u/t/n/UTNE_Reader_3508.html" title="UTNE Reader">UTNE Reader</a>, or <a href="../../../a/d/b/Adbusters.html" title="Adbusters">Adbusters</a> decrying this (like the neocons) does not make it any less verifiable. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 20:11, Apr 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>If that list were nominated, I would vote to delete it too, unless sourcing was provided for the entries. I also think that the "Possible successors" section should be removed from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Fascists_1eb2.html" title="List of Fascists">List of Fascists</a>, and that the entries on that list should be sourced to indicate where the individuals described themselves as Fascists. I would not have an objection to a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Stalinists_1bc6.html" title="List of Stalinists">List of Stalinists</a> if it only included people who actually self-identified as such and sourcing was provided for this. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 19:55, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have included a comment on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Fascists_51d5.html" title="Talk:List of Fascists">Talk:List of Fascists</a> indicating that the Possible Successors section should be removed for the reasons stated above. If no one wants to defend that section's inclusion, then I will remove the section as unsourced POV.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> for reasons stated by Firebug. These individuals may have supported the USSR in the 1930s, 1940s -- not so unusual at the time -- but that does not mean they are "stalinists" and I strongly doubt they would have self-identified as such. -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 21:42, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I don't believe Stalin ever considered himself a leader of a distinct intellectual or political movement, so the list ends up being people who, at some time in their lives, spoke of Stalin in a somewhat approving way. Approval is not allegiance. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 00:42, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b>. This has, I think, the makings of two or more good pages, but mixed together like this it ends up being a polemic. There are avowed Stalinists: <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._Bruce_Franklin_274e.html" title="H. Bruce Franklin">H. Bruce Franklin</a>, under whom I studied, <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Jong-Il_3f16.html" title="Kim Jong-Il">Kim Jong-Il</a>, and (missing from the list) <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Avakian_a4a2.html" title="Bob Avakian">Bob Avakian</a>. There are politically-oriented entertainers who happen to have supported the Soviet Union in one respect or another during the Stalin era, many of them identified with <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_Front_3447.html" title="Popular Front">Popular Front</a> politics that were not narrowly Stalinist: <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Robeson_b580.html" title="Paul Robeson">Paul Robeson</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Chaplin_90da.html" title="Charles Chaplin">Charles Chaplin</a>, and (missing from the list) <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Seeger_18a1.html" title="Pete Seeger">Pete Seeger</a>. There are some <i>very</i> odd inclusions: <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frida_Kahlo_11d6.html" title="Frida Kahlo">Frida Kahlo</a> was a close associate, and almost certainly a lover, of <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Trotsky_11f4.html" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>. Yes, she followed Trotsky's doctrine of giving qualified support to the "deformed Workers' State" that was the Soviet Union, but are we saying that Trotsky was a Stalinist? There are some whose inclusion in the list borders on slander: <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Wallace_dda8.html" title="Henry Wallace">Henry Wallace</a> accepted the political support of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_USA_850c.html" title="Communist Party USA">Communist Party USA</a>, but he never endorsed them in return. Et cetera. As a hodgepodge of these things, the list is useless and borders on slanderous, given the degree to which Stalinism these days is an epithet. This would be like a list of Fascists that included <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Edgar_Hoover_ecb6.html" title="J. Edgar Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Ford_8fe5.html" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a>. In short, I don't think an encyclopedic list can be constructed under this particular title, but this could be the seed for several useful pages. <b>I'd suggest moving this to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Stalinists_1bc6.html" title="List of Stalinists">List of Stalinists</a>, editing out those who are not self-described as such</b>, and starting several separate lists: List of Popular Front cultural figures, for example. In each case, though, given the controversy attending this, I'd like to see clear criteria for inclusion. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:44, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename and edit for accuracy</b>. "People described as" is passive voice and too subjective. Who's doing the describing??? The list is prone to major inaccuracies, for example, it currently inclues <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frida_Kahlo_11d6.html" title="Frida Kahlo">Frida Kahlo</a>, who dated Stalin's arch nemisis <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotsky.html" title="Trotsky">Trotsky</a>.

<li>A pretty obvious <b>keep</b>. If some listings are original research, they should be removed, leaving the persons verifiably described as being Stalinist (shouldn't be too hard to do). Further, I'm not sure how 'being a POV magnet' means the page can be deleted under the terms of the Deletion policy, or are we all ignoring that now? Perhaps it's time we actually started enforcing that agreed, accepted policy to prevent spurious page listings such as this one. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan100_0edd.html" title="User:Dan100">Dan100</a> 20:51, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. These "list of" articles are only marginally helpful to readers. Ones which are likely to attract vandalism and controversy are not worth the trouble.

<li><b>Delete</b>. No agreed definition of Stalinist means no way to verify and guarranteed constant disputes. No sources given. Not a helpful list for researchers.

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Stalinist", like "Fascist", has become meaningless over time.

<ul>
<li>1. <i>No agreed definition of a Stalinist</i>, absurd, we have an article <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinist.html" title="Stalinist">Stalinist</a>, that is pretty clear about the definition of what a Stalinist is.</li>
<li>2. <i>original research</i>, once again, absolutely not. Although the potential for OR is certainly here, it is here in all articles. Many people throughout the 20th century have either called themselves, or have been called by others with cause, Stalinists.</li>
<li>3. <i>POV magnet</i>, does that mean we deleted every article involving the Israeli Palestinian conflicts?</li>

<dd>I would also like to stress my original point that every single reason for a <b>delete</b> could be applied to any number of articles in Wikipedia, and most appropriately List of people described as neoconservatives, but that article was kept during a recent VFD. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 19:35, Apr 30, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>All that considered, I would say that if someone's Stalinist position can't be demonstrated plainly enough for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Stalinists_1bc6.html" title="List of Stalinists">List of Stalinists</a> then they shouldn't be on such a list at all. List of people described as neoconservatives exists because, regardless of NC's status as a political movement, labelling people as NCs is a widespread journalism phenomenon. I don't believe the same could have been said for the "Stalinist" label. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 22:21, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Re. 1. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinist.html" title="Stalinist">Stalinist</a> is a redirect to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a>. Stalinism is somewhat well defined, but Stalinist isn't. This is something of a paradox, but it is reality since Stalinist is a loaded, generally POV term almost always intended as a powerful slur in the U.S. This has been true in the U.S. for about 80 years, so it isn't a recent development. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 22:37, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
