<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't see the need to separate out the articles into executive and Royal Family, so the title Air transports of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom would be too narrow.

<li>What's the problem with a redirect? It may be an unacceptable title for Wikipedia but it's a very commonly used term (BBC, <i>Guardian, Times, Independent</i>).

<li><b>Keep</b> There's been a decent sized debate about this in the UK. I remember a lead editorial in the Telegraph about it, and the Guardian and BBC have, as stated above, covered it and used this title. I think this will be a useful resource when the debate comes up again in 2008, when the plane actually gets delivered. I'm not opposed to renaming and redirecting Blair Force One to a more encylcopedic title, but I do think at least having the redirect from Blair Force One is important. The article itself seems well written, encyclopedic, and likely to grow. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVickser_b9a2.html" title="User:Vickser">Vickser</a> 00:26, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> complete text and <b>redirect</b>. If the phrase is so widely used in the British media, I see no problem with a redirect to a subsection in <a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._32_%28The_Royal%29_Squadron_RAF_9339.html" title="No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron RAF">No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron RAF</a>, but a new page seems like a stretch right now. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 00:36, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

It has considerable usage in major media outlets, eg <a href="http://search.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?scope=all&amp;edition=d&amp;q=blair+force+one&amp;go.x=18&amp;go.y=12&amp;go=go" class="external text" title="http://search.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?scope=all&amp;edition=d&amp;q=blair+force+one&amp;go.x=18&amp;go.y=12&amp;go=go" rel="nofollow">the BBC</a>, <a href="http://sitesearch.timesonline.co.uk/sitesearch/jsp/Search/Search.jsp" class="external text" title="http://sitesearch.timesonline.co.uk/sitesearch/jsp/Search/Search.jsp" rel="nofollow">The Times</a> (might have to searhc for Blair Force One), and even on Google, with inverted commas around it, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22blair+force+one%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22blair+force+one%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">it returns thousands of entries</a>. It is a major topic of UK political discussion. In terms of the name, "POV" but popular names, as long as they are explaine properly, are acceptable; see, for example, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_of_Discontent_27b7.html" title="Winter of Discontent">Winter of Discontent</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatmanand_ca9c.html" title="User talk:Batmanand">Talk</a> 11:59, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd><b>Comment/clarify</b>: Citing Google always really concerns me. The "thousands of entries" include an awful lot of duplicates, blogs (not acceptable under WP guidelines for external links, which puts them on dubious ground as references), and rebranded copies of Wikipedia itself. As for the ocurrences on reputable sources like the BBC, that's a fair point and indicates a reasonable level of public familiarity can be presumed. However, that does nothing to move us away from the problem that as an article title, it's too narrow, and lets down Wikipedia because it tries to be clever rather than trying to be informative. The discussion of politics (as opposed to concrete fact) is perfectly valid, but that's not the point here. The politics are not an article in themselves. I'd like to clarify my vote, since it's possibly lost since I nominated the deletion; in the light of this discussion it's a <b>strong rename</b> but not precluding a <b>merge</b> with the other relevant articles, such as that about the now defunct <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Flight_26fa.html" title="Queen's Flight">Queen's Flight</a>.

<dd>I understand the concern with the Google test (it is a legitimate concern), but just glancing down the top twenty or thirty entires, only a few are blogs, and most are commerical UK newspapers.

<dd><b>Comment</b> This "Blair Force One" will be not be operational until after Blair has ceased to be PM (assuming statements are correct), so the name is unlikely to survive. If the aircraft are used for shuttle diplomacy we'll also have to list, perhaps (and tongue-in-cheek), "Brown Farce One" or "Cameron Island Airways." Then it is periously close to having a category "Nicknames appended to governmental flights" It's not about should it be here, it's about how it should be here! --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichhoncho_144b.html" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> 09:33, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
