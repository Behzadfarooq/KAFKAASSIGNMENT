<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't think it's vanity. The author clearly states that he followed a red link about himself and that it is self authored. He may well be notable enough if somebody else wrote the article; I haven't checked that. I really feel we need to improve the message that appears when a user is invited to start a new page. Wikipedia encourages new users to get stuck in and then puts them through the AFD grinder - I know, it happened to me (<a href="../../../t/r/e/Tredington_Community_Primary_School_36ef.html" title="Tredington Community Primary School">Tredington Community Primary School</a>). What I'm saying is that it would appear the editor was acting in good faith, but the article must go as it stands. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 01:46, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello dear admins! English is not my native language, but I hope we will understand each other well enough =)</p>
<p>That was certainly my fault to write down here just a couple of words instead of a full project description. I will try to make up for it in 3-5 days.</p>
<p>2Mike I'll not go into detail here &amp; now — I think I'd better just put our timeline in the article. But I should mention, that we work on this project as a team since February 2004. I will put links to our docs as soon as they get translated in English — and as you understand in a case of 120+ pages design document it's not always as easy task as one can imagine. Besides, we all work in our free time from direct labor and docs translation right now is not a high priority task. _However_ we are in a constant need of new developers, and that's especially relevant now, when the work on game code has started. I'm pretty sure two C++ coders will surpass any language barrier problems fast enough =)</p>
<p>2Nateji77 This is a non-commercial project. Our documentation is released under GNU FDL, game code is released through several other open source licences. Is this article considered to be an ad under such circumstances?</p>
<dl>
<dd>when i read it i think it's an ad. maybe because it's a stub abut a product (free or for sale) that won't be around for another 2-3 years (early to late 2008). if the progamming is communal or transparent writing more about the development process might help clarify. but it also might seem a solicitation for programmers, which would also be ad. i don't speak russian so it's difficult for me to know based solely on the site. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateji77_10a2.html" title="User:Nateji77">Nateji77</a> 05:04, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2Jwestbrook Actually, I'm just a game designer. Our project leader is much more sceptical about the dates.</p>

<li>As for publishing, there are only vague claims of publishing in the article. Let's see some article titles and page numbers.

<li><b>Comment</b> given that the concept is a relatively recent development (earliest comment <i>permitting</i> the idea appeared in 2001—5 years ago at most), and by comparison to <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstructionist_Judaism_c62c.html" title="Reconstructionist Judaism">Reconstructionist Judaism</a> a "branch of Judaism" which apparently consists of a marginally more notable approximately 110 congregations<a href="http://www2.jrf.org/cong/directory-all.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2.jrf.org/cong/directory-all.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (began as a concept as far back as the 1920s, split formally from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative Judaism</a> in 1968—38 years ago), I think a bit of leniency is in order. That said, this long article doesn't belong (at least not at that length) in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">minyan</a>, nor am I convinced that the sum total of the content belongs <i>anywhere</i> on WP just yet, not because the phenomenon of women's participation in orthodox prayer services is unnoteworthy, but because the name for the article amounts to an endorsement by WP of a specific expression thereof. The number of groups actually following the philosophy addressed by the article is much higher than 20 (and the assertion that it's fewer is spurious at best), but unlike the one relevant hit in JFW's google search, they are not organized to the level where they're all out publishing websites. A cursory glance through <a href="http://www.jofa.org/social.php/orthodoxy" class="external text" title="http://www.jofa.org/social.php/orthodoxy" rel="nofollow">this page</a> indicates that the concept extends far beyond a simple one-hit result on Google.

The article has merit, it just needs to be renamed and have a <i>lot</i> of work put into encyclopædizing it.

<li><b>Delete</b>, it's almost all <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> original research meant to turn the left-wing segment of Orthodox Judaism into just another "branch" of Conservative Judaism -- which is just plain dumb and dishonest, like the Conservative's pretending to go by Halakha when in fact they just want to dump as much of it as they can.

<li><b>Comment</b> I acknowledge Tomer has a point. While the phenomenon is indeed significantly broader than its web presence suggests, because of its novelty and relative informality, there is indeed not necessarily universal agreement on what to call it, so for WP to pick what may at this point be a mere candidate name may indeed be leading rather than following what it is trying to describe. Although others will need to judge the underlying merits. I acknowledge that the subject-matter is controversial. I would only hope that any disagreement regarding its merits, as a matter of personal religious philosophy, would not be confused with the issue of the phenomenom's notability, or interest to researchers and to the public, for purposes of making an editorial decision. It might be useful to do a Google search under "Shira Hadasha". Indeed, Shira Hadasha may well be sufficiently noteworthy on the web at this point to deserve its own article based on such a Google search alone, if so perhaps the content could be put there with a sentence or two and a link in articles like <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">Minyan</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role_of_women_in_Judaism_2edd.html" title="Role of women in Judaism">Role of women in Judaism</a>, etc. --Anystat 15:21, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>You are new here, so let me point out a few things that you hopefully won't take as condescension. First, this is an encyclopedia, not an indescriminate collection of information. Please review <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Second, wikipedia has a policy prohibiting <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> (read the guideline, it probably means something other than what you perceive). Third, WP has a policy requiring that information be presented from a neutral perspective. Much of the information in the article is presented as unabashèd advocacy. Any advocacy is fine, as long as the [substantial] opposition is also presented. Please review <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Finally, in either <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">Minyan</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role_of_women_in_Judaism_2edd.html" title="Role of women in Judaism">Role of women in Judaism</a>, the information presented in the edits you propose give undue weight to what is, at least at this early stage, a new and [relatively, in the grand scheme things, at least presently] insignificant phenomenon. Including information in the depth this addition attempts to gives undue weight to what thus far is not proven to be anything more than a bit of fuzz on a radar screen. Copy this stuff to User:Anystat/Minyan Shivyoni Hilchati if you like and if it becomes more relevant to the Jewish world as a whole in the next 2-5 years, bring it back (to <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role_of_women_in_Judaism_2edd.html" title="Role of women in Judaism">Role of women in Judaism</a> tho, not to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">Minyan</a>). <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 17:28, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Three points. First, there is evidence of an actual, reasonably coherent phenomenon here. The sources verify that services, when described, are conducted in a similar manner, with women being allowed to do similar things and not allowed to do other similar things, and similar reasons being cited for why and why not. This consistency simply wouldn't happen in some general effort to synthesize Orthodoxy and Feminism or to explore women's roles in Judaism. It indicates a coherent, clarified phenomenon that can legitimately be treated as a distinct subject. Second, the phenomenon, while novel and hardly major, is not of merely isolated interest. Third, the neutrality of the article has been enhanced since it was first introduced. --Anystat 04:16, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Keep - because people looking for the newly coined term need an encyclopedia article telling them the meaning of the term. Wikipedia, as a comprehensive encyclopedia, has articles on extreme left and right topics as long as the entry is written from a neutral POV. This is a notable phenomena even if one disagrress with it. The article needs to be fleshed out and not just a list of places.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>&#160;: Given that the demographic center of Judaism is roughly the left wing of Conservativism, this viewpoint is merely a little to the right of center. What's all this about it being 'extreme'? On the other hand, seems to me that statements like "the Conservative's pretending to go by Halakha when in fact they just want to dump as much of it as they can.", or "It ain't happenin' babe, a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">minyan</a> is a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">minyan</a> and will always be a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minyan.html" title="Minyan">minyan</a> ... of Jewish <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man.html" title="Man">MEN</a>" are pretty durn good examples of what WP DOESN'T want in its editorial judgments.

<li><b>Keep*</b>, with the star being that of course I appreciate it if I am wrong as I am still learning the wikipedia ins and outs. I please hope you don't delete the mathie userbox {{user mathie}} as it took me two hours to make it. Yes, that is long, yes i am a newbie. As to the term mathie itself, I fully support the wikipedia process. I did a search in google using "math mathie". Here's webpages I got. I'll try and wikify this if i have time. Please check some of them, and if we agree it's not wiki-appropriate, that's cool, but please reconsider. And spare the userbox if possible because i am proud of it.

<li>There, I tried to fix the links as best I could. Does dictdef mean dictionary definition? When deciding whether or not to make this page, I looked at "junkie".

<dd>Please consider writing more well-rounded nominations. Simply saying "non-notable" (or worse, "NN") tells us nothing more than "I would like this article deleted". Instead, try explaining <i>why</i> the subject of the article is non-notable.

<li>Please do give examples so that I may at once merge them into their parent article where they belong.

<li>Still not impressed, all academics publish something.

<li>Actually Farrell has nearly twice as many Google Scholar hits as Martindale, and "Henry Farrell" gets 93000 Google hits, of which most front page items refer to the political scientist. "Mark Martindale" gets 380 hits, only a minority for the scientist.
<ul>
<li>Well, Henry Farrell is a <i>much</i> more common name, and don't you think that a few hits might be this <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Farrell_2952.html" title="Henry Farrell">Henry Farrell</a> (or one of thousands of others)? Maybe some of the google scholar hits too, I'm not sure.) In any case, small academic papers are not widely read, if he's had articles in major magazines, or any written books, we'd be on the right track. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:45, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As noted in the entry under dispute, he has an article in <i>Foreign Affairs</i> which is a <i>very</i> influential magazine, and this article was quoted in an editorial in the <i>Washington Times</i> among other media. On your point about other Farrells, please reread my comment. I checked the first 100 entries to verify that most referred to the Farrell in question, and not the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Farrell_2952.html" title="Henry Farrell">Henry Farrell</a> whose notability is undisputed.

Given about 220 MB of transfer a month, i'm figuring they get about 650 downloads a month; this suggests a much larger number of users than 2000, but also counts people who download just to evaluate it (without using) and fails to count a potentially significant group of users who download from a third party (like a package available from an OS vendor as a RPM), which the GPL permits, instead of directly through Sourceforge. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> (<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysidia_50b2.html" title="User talk:Mysidia">talk</a>) 08:08, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - As of this moment, there is no verifiable information in this article. Therefore it must be deleted, pending a substantial rewrite with sources.

But some of us have been willing to compromise, and accept mergers of substubs (partly in a pursuit of peace).

<li>The problem with a merge is that this *was* a school. We don't know precisely what happened to it (we know the remnants of the building were dumped somewhere improperly, so that confirms its demolished). Where do we merge a closed school to? Do you list it in <a href="../../../m/o/e/Moe%2C_Victoria_fb38.html" title="Moe, Victoria">Moe, Victoria</a>, possibly next to currently open school(s)? Maybe make a new article on a school district (if one is applicable), and make a closed school as its first, and initially only entry? I submit that often *more* information is needed to do a merge, than to have a stand alone article. For instance, when merging, you need to know what if any district is relevant, and any/all communities served by a school. We don't know that. Currently, we can probably be confident that <a href="../../../m/o/e/Moe%2C_Victoria_fb38.html" title="Moe, Victoria">Moe, Victoria</a> is 100% correct. Why would we wish to spoil that. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:17, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable fetish community term, no hits on Lexisnexis, no hits on American Psychological Association articles search. No sources for it, so it is unverifiable. There is one article in Google scholar that says it means the same as kleptomania and is not a widely used term. So mainly it fails wikipedia's verifiability guideline. Google search for Kleptophilia and paraphilia get 403 hits, which is kind of notable, but remember my charge of verifiability. Pretty low notability for a fetish term in google, and yeah, I turned off my safe search. One stray article mentioning it meaning kleptomania isn't enough to justify it being a redirect, I think. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 05:20, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Looks like an autobiographical page. Non-notable. Could it be notable for the soybean car part?

<li>I have read about him in local papers around bridgewater, new jersey. he seems to be a multifaceted young student who is drawing some attention from both students and the public alike. Aside from being an outstanding student, his soybean car project is quite interesting. I have seen this car on the road and it is destinctly different from any other out there. It is the youth like this today that are outstanding models for other teens. Cnragnips 06:40, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, news mentions doesn't automatically mean that a subject should be in an encyclopedia, though it can be used as an indicator. This is a news story that will be forgotten in time. A Wikipedia article should be relevant for a much longer period of time than a newspaper or magazine article. I'm sure there have been similar situations a decade or two ago that no one remembers. If it is kept for reasons specific to Wikipedia (showing its benefits and such), it should not be in the article namespace because such a rationale indicates that it is not encyclopedic, but <b>advertising</b>.

Its fairly obvious the person is now notable. Also, it seems the noms principal reason, is they their sympathy for Gardner. Apparently he has some problem with "<i>an arbitrary age milestone</i>" in laws regarding consent for sex, which is a POV the nom is entitled to, but shouldn't be used to justify the deletion of an article. We do properly have articles on people who have criminal convictions for things that some of their supporters don't think should be labelled as criminal. Finally, it's not our role to decide which persons, and which events should be deemed notable. Rather, we are to find what has deemed notable. That's a key distinction. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 20:38, 21 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that notability may be a standard, and in that regard, it may be better that we simply have an article which actually explains both sides of the issue. Still, it seems that deferring to either a local label or to mere news notablity is huge problem, when those labels can be so variable, when news notability can be so baseless. Putting the both of them together doesnt make it any moreso 'notable' nor encyclopedic. (There's Wikinews though, too.) For example, the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Smart_kidnapping_5fe8.html" title="Elizabeth Smart kidnapping">Elizabeth Smart kidnapping</a> was once named Elizabeth Smart (kidnapping victim). The issue then was to disambiguate from an author (IIRC) and that Smart (then only 13) wasnt herself 'notable', and only the kidnapping was. I objected strongly because it seemed ridiculous to make an article about a person and then prejudice it of a sorts with a label of 'kidnap victim'. The person is a <i>person</i>, and though they may be notable for being a 'kidnap victim', thats not in fact what they <i>are</i> —especially someone only 13 who's got a whole life ahead of her. The same thing goes for someone only 22, who has carried the label of being a 'sex offender' since he himself was only a teenager. Minnesota AOC is apparently only 16 years, which makes the label even weaker. Even though its not in the article <i>title</i>, the very existence of the article seems to be more dependent on the label of 'sex offender' than the actual offense. The damn thing (as its written) doesnt even phrase it according to NPOV ("according to the state of Minnesota, Gardner..."), or to even mention that the AOC is only 16. Amateur writing at best. I suppose it <i>could</i> be a good thing to keep it, as a good example of a ridiculous abuse of justice. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 16:45, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Combining this fact with the fact that many responses are simply claiming that <i>if its on the news, its encyclopedic</i>, I'm not sure if high school kids are really capable of understanding the difference between what local news outlets consider news (i.e. a chimpmunk waterskiing) and what's actually encyclopedic. While notablity is a genuine factor, 'he made the Today Show' is not. Wondering who here is unclear on the difference. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 16:45, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No offense, but I don't think it is appropriate. As per my comments above, it is advertising in the main namespace under the guise of an encyclopedia article, if the reason the article is kept is because it involves Wikipedia, especially how Wikipedia "helps". The article should be kept or deleted on its merits alone, not its association with Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 03:43, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No way. How the heck did this help the world? They guy wasn't comitting a crime, just violating his probation. I think the whole thing is a black eye for everybody. Just because some Junior Spies used Wikipedia to finger some poor schmuck doesn't mean we should crow about it. On the contrary it makes a point for <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>'s contention that Wikipedia is a way to air out anyone's dirty laundry on a very high-traffic site. Criminal or no, this guy is not a public figure, and the idea that citizens can have low-profile lives, make low-profile mistakes, and have low-profile private sorrows is not something that I would throw away. No, this is something that Wikipedia should hope best forgotten. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:05, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article was written admittedly in the playful spirit of the group, but the information was culled from genuine journalistic sources. The fact that those sources remain underground, and the bands musical popularity is of an underground nature doesnt impinge on there notability. I have not met the band personaly, but have attended many of there gigs, and being a determined member of Dublins thriving underground scene, I can testify to there influence and popularity. I will look over the article, but I ask for a short time to make ammendents to bring the article with-in Wikipedias criteria.

<p>I disagree, this is widely seen as one of the nights at the pinnacle of the norths current music scene. i live in manchester and there is nothing here to rival it. bands such as arctic monkeys and babyshambles played here before anyone else latched onto them. clubs like the hacienda and cbgbs would no doubt of got a similar response early in their careers by people not clued up on the current scenes. i do think the article should maybe be edited slightly though.

<li>I wrote the article. I do a lot of research on music in the North West of England. If you wish me to provide you with press clippings and testimonials of the club then I am more than willing, just ask. If you think the article comes across as trying to promote the club or whatever then I am more than willing to change it. Please let me know your thoughts. Mex79 17:14, 20 January 2006</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>:I feel oddly compelled to chime in with my 2 cents.</p>
<p>Andylkl: The notability page you refer to is for websites, and yet it has been shown that this is NOT an article referencing a website, or a comic who's primary means of distribution is a website. This is a popular (although I'm not usre why) comic strip published in an established, credible University Newspaper.</p>
<p>Pitrat: You have a long way to go before you should feel compelled to compare yourself to half of the comics listed on the page you have referenced.</p>
<p>I don't believe web hits should be the sole source to determine validity or notability of a subject, the world does not revolve around the internet after all...at least not yet. This is a popular comic in Winnipeg, Manitoba with little to no web-pressence...it should not be punished for that. Maybe it should be applauded. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 198.103.172.9 (<a href="../../../1/9/8/User_talk%7E198.103.172.9.html" title="User talk:198.103.172.9">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_198.103.172.9_e9ff.html" title="Special:Contributions/198.103.172.9">contribs</a>).</small></p>

The correct one should be <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, please take a look at it. My point is, for the moment the article topic does not seem notable enough for inclusion on Wikipedia. This isn't a punishment or anything, seriously. If you or anyone else can back up claims that the comic strip is popular in Winnipeg (and not just the university grounds) through the comic being mentioned in local television stations, any number of websites, radio stations, local daily newspaper articles, any one of those mentioned with verified sources, and I'll willingly withdraw the nomination for the article's deletion. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_090d.html" title="User:Andylkl">Andylkl</a> <sup>[ <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndylkl_776e.html" title="User talk:Andylkl">talk!</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Andylkl_d01c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Andylkl">c</a> ]</sup> 21:51, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

This article has already survived an afd and proved it's notability <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_ThereIsNoRadio_95e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/ThereIsNoRadio">here</a>. Maybe you should read it. Here are some quotes from Alexa's that you should pay close attention to:</p>
<pre>
"The traffic data are based on the set of Alexa users, which may not be a representative 
sample of the global Internet population. Known biases include (but are likely not limited 
to) the following:   
The Alexa Toolbar works only with the Internet Explorer browser. Sites frequented mainly by 
users of other browsers will be undercounted. For example, the AOL/Netscape browser is not 
supported, which means that Alexa collects little data from AOL users, and our traffic to 
aol.com is likely lower than it would be for a more representative sample. 
The Alexa Toolbar works only on Windows operating systems. Although a large majority of the 
Internet population currently used Windows, traffic to any sites which are disproportionately 
visited by users of other operating systems will be undercounted."
</pre>
<p>I'm the main editor on the article? So what? There's lots of articles on wikipedia that are only edited by one or two people. Everybody that is knowledgable on a subject doesn't edit articles on wikipedia either. I don't really see much point in dignifying your afd with a vote. I will again point you in the direction of the original afd at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_ThereIsNoRadio_95e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/ThereIsNoRadio">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/ThereIsNoRadio</a>. The arrogance of the "I haven't heard of it so it must not be important" afd's is rediculous and I'm getting tired of defending articles I've worked hard on for these reasons. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomgenius_aa15.html" title="User:Randomgenius">Randomgenius</a> 21:11, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am a listener of this radio station and wanted to know more about it. I came here and read about it. It's not an article about a website, as Freakofnurture has pointed out. It's about an internet radio station. A station with a history, on air talent, and ties to both commercial and satellite radio. Also, I didn't find out about this station from WIKIPEDIA OR MYSPACE. I've seen this site linked on ronfez.net, wackbag.com, talkradiofans.com, silentspic.com, and I even heard Ron and Fez talk about it several times on XM 202.</p>

I'm Badmonkey, the owner of ThereIsNoRadio, and I find it interesting that this and related wikipedia entries are considered "vanity" and "non notable". I'm not sure exactly what makes these entries "vanity" as there are much nicer looking websites than wikipedia for each of them. Getting a listing somewhere is easy as most just have simple forms and I've submitted the station on several of them.</p>
<p>Since there has been no evidence presented other than one person's opinion to support the vanity charge I will move on to the notability issue and present some evidence that I think supports our notability.</p>
<p>The station started in mid October of 2005 when RadioBBQ, the original station housing most of the DJs, closed its doors. TINR and it's DJs have been discussed many times on <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_and_Fez_bce9.html" title="Ron and Fez">Ron and Fez</a> on <a href="../../../x/m/_/XM_Radio_b45f.html" title="XM Radio">XM Radio</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hideout_3443.html" title="The Hideout">The Hideout</a> on <a href="../../../w/t/k/WTKS-FM_a0de.html" title="WTKS-FM">WTKS-FM</a> in Orlando, Florida. Before Ron and Fez moved to XM, we were discussed many times on their show on <a href="../../../w/j/f/WJFK-FM_79dc.html" title="WJFK-FM">WJFK-FM</a> in D.C. Some of our DJs are regulars on Ron and Fez as well as <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opie_and_Anthony_2c23.html" title="Opie and Anthony">Opie and Anthony</a>, such as DJNewStyle who is well-known for his O&amp;A parody song submissions. I worked on the air with The Hideout and in the background with Ron and Fez during their time at WJFK-FM.</p>
<p>We are currently linked to by <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishbone.html" title="Fishbone">Fishbone</a> with an unpaid banner on their official website. We are the only internet radio station or other non-fishbone related advertisement they run at www.fishbone.net. We are also linked to by Ron and Fez's website www.ronfez.net, another place our banners are run without any type of reciprocal payment.</p>
<p>In under three months, we have become the #13 ranked talk station and #6 in reality on Live365. The above mention of the 13 people that have supposedly "listened to" our station since October is a misleading number, if not an outright distortion of the facts. That is simply how many people have <b>ranked</b> the station during their time listening. Since mid October, we have accumulated almost 5,000 TLH, over 100 Live365 listener presets, and over 140 registered members on our website.</p>
<p>We may not have a high alexa rating, but as stated above Alexa only works with internet explorer. Most of our listeners use Firefox. Most of our listeners are pretty internet savvy and do not like their privacy invaded. Read your <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa_internet.html" title="Alexa internet">Alexa internet</a> and you'll see that it has a bad reputation as spyware. That alone would keep them from using the alexa toolbar.</p>
<p>Everybody that listens doesn't rank the station. Everybody that listens doesn't register for the website. Everybody that registers for the website does not necessarily post on the forums or enter the chatroom. Nobody is required to actually visit the site to listen to us as we broadcast through Live365 and our stream is launched from our station page at Live365.com.</p>
<p>Reading the original afd, it appears that the primary reason for deletion was due to TiNR being an internet radio station. You've got long lists of internet radio stations that I've never heard of while neglecting stations like Soundbreak.com, one of the biggest and most written about internet radio stations of the last 10 years. Soundbreak was a project by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Goodman_81a9.html" title="Mark Goodman">Mark Goodman</a>, former <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a> <a href="../../../v/j/_/VJ_9ea0.html" title="VJ">VJ</a>, and is the station that inspired me to start ThereIsNoRadio, years before I was on RadioBBQ. It appears to me that there are very few, if any, "wikipedians" here qualified to judge the notability of internet radio, internet radio dj's, internet radio shows, or internet radio stations. The entries I looked at today about internet radio seemed bare and uninformative as if written by people that only had a vague idea what they were talking about. We are not a website. We are an internet radio station. If the only way to show notability on wikipedia is by getting people that use the alexa toolbar to visit our website, then chances are we will never be notable in your eyes.</p>
<p>If you need outside sources, then start with <a href="http://www.thereisnoradio.com" class="external text" title="http://www.thereisnoradio.com" rel="nofollow">Thereisnoradio.com</a>, <a href="http://www.fishbone.net" class="external text" title="http://www.fishbone.net" rel="nofollow">Fishbone.net</a>, <a href="http://www.ronfez.net" class="external text" title="http://www.ronfez.net" rel="nofollow">RonFez.net</a>, <a href="http://hideout.wtks.com" class="external text" title="http://hideout.wtks.com" rel="nofollow">The Hideout on WTKS</a>, <a href="http://www.wackbag.com" class="external text" title="http://www.wackbag.com" rel="nofollow">wackbag.com</a>.</p>
<p>We may not be XM Radio or Sirius, but I would hardly call us cruft. Hopefully you all read that and now have some idea of what we are, although reading the entry would have given you plenty of information. Although, I guess if you were going to bother reading past the nomination you might have voted keep already, or at least written something more than "non notable".</p>
<p>My vote may not count here as I have just registered, but I vote keep because of what we have achieved in such a short time and my personal belief that the articles are informative and fairly well written. There's nothing in them that couldn't be fixed and I see nothing in the deletion policy mentioning a low alexa rating alone as a good reason to delete an article. Maybe if I'd written the article all this information would have been in it, but then it would probably meet the definition of vanity?</p>

<li><strike><b>Delete</b></strike> Although Badmonkey raises some good points about how we assess the notabity of internet radio stations, how else can we do it? We simply can't just take your word for it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'll admit I don't follow the internet radio scene, but we need to be able to verify the station's notabity. If 5,000 people have listened to your show since October, link the evidence. If Ron and Fez talk about it, link an archived show to prove it. From the small amount of research (checking the outside sources you listed) I have done I have found little to support keeping this article.</dd>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>The second one has no links to your station that I can find, and a search on their forum brings up nothing. Ron and Fez's site has a link to RadioBBQ, which I understand was the previous incarnation of ThereIsNoRadio but there is no link to TISR and no mention of it that I can find on the main site.</li>

<li>I didn't write the article. We are not a website. Looking at the history of the articles proves that the guy that wrote the article has been working on their expansion. I simply gave information that wasn't already in the article that I felt was relevant to the discussion. I guess it's better to be a delete sheep that just post their delete vote and disappear without ever reading or contributing to the discussion? As stated above, I own the <b>radio station</b>. I don't know much about wikipedia and I'm not really sure how our inclusion in an amateur internet encyclopedia helps promote the station. If our article stays, great. If it does not stay, then I just think it sucks that the time and energy other people put into it was wasted. DiabolicalBadmonkey 22:44, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At this point, it looks like the argument against this article remaining is that internet radio stations aren't notable. I'd have to disagree with that. For the most part, terrestrial radio stations are allowed; of them, I have edited several articles. I don't see why internet radio stations (and show pages) with some notability wouldn't be allowed. I'm not saying <i>all</i> stations are notable. I also realize that internet radio is yet to become as popular in the mainstream, atleast in American culture, as terrestrial radio or satellite radio. But, I think the community should re-consider its stance on internet radio stations. --<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatCam_b535.html" title="User:SatCam">Kevin McManus</a> 00:42, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<pre>
"The traffic data are based on the set of Alexa users, which may not be a representative 
sample of the global Internet population. Known biases include (but are likely not limited 
to) the following:   
The Alexa Toolbar works only with the Internet Explorer browser. Sites frequented mainly by 
users of other browsers will be undercounted. For example, the AOL/Netscape browser is not 
supported, which means that Alexa collects little data from AOL users, and our traffic to 
aol.com is likely lower than it would be for a more representative sample. 
The Alexa Toolbar works only on Windows operating systems. Although a large majority of the 
Internet population currently used Windows, traffic to any sites which are disproportionately 
visited by users of other operating systems will be undercounted."

<p>I'm the main editor on the article? So what? There's lots of articles on wikipedia that are only edited by one or two people. Everybody that is knowledgable on a subject doesn't edit articles on wikipedia either. I don't really see much point in dignifying your afd with a vote.

<p>Who exactly do you think I am? I've just been following the shows, and stations since soon after they started. I thought wiki was for people to write about things they know. I've contributed to other articles outside of these, but I've been working pretty hard to add information and make them more encyclopedic. I've been told that some of the references I've added in dicussions here should be put in the article. If it survives afd, I will do that but I don't see any reason to continue effort on something that will just be deleted because a specific cross section of the world hasn't heard of it and calls it non-noteable. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomgenius_aa15.html" title="User:Randomgenius">Randomgenius</a> 00:20, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> DJNewStyle submits material for the Opie and Anthony show, Ron and Fez, and has been on several internet radio stations. He also has a podcast, which is listed on several sites/services - including iTunes. Also, what does Alexa have to do with notability? He has been mentioned and played on XM Satellite radio - as recent as yesterday and friday. Surely you'd hold actual radio exposure higher than results from a malware ridden toolbar.

<dd>I've just spent 30 minutes trawling through DCRTV news archives, which you mention in your article to have talked about you and I was unable to find any reference to the station. I'm not saying it isn't there (it is a terribly designed site so I might of missed it) but I couldn't find it. If ron and fez talk about your show provide a link to the archived show if you can. I'm afraid we just can't take your word for it. If you can cite your sources to back up your claims, I would be happy to support keeping this article.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> As I have stated many times before, my involvement has been limited to ensuring accuracy of the content, with much repair that still remains to be done on the page. A pee-reviewed publication is upcoming, although there have been other reputable professional publications as well. The fact that the work is NOTABLE according to Wiki standards is beyond question... It is a sad day for Wikipedia when a spiteful non-entity with no understanding of physics (e.g. see <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211080" class="external autonumber" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211080" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>) can ask for deletion of an experiment that's the center of much current debate in the academia. Danko Georgieve's complete lack of knowledge on the subject matter is known (and has been publicly stated) by many physicists including Unruh, Drezet, Kastner, Motl, and some wikipedians who've had the chance to engage him in conversation. Many experts who would wish to keep this article are not Wikipedians and are too busy to get into arguments with somebody who's not "even wrong." If such individuals as the nominator of this 2nd deletion request are to constantly interfere and destabilize the article, then I may join the ranks of Wiki critics who have little if any faith in its reliability.

<dd>I beg to differ. Nominating an article for deletion one month after its previous nomination concluded with an overwelming consensus to keep the article without giving any new facts is not going to achieve something. It does not help to build the encyclopaedia. Hence it is against policy.</dd>

<dd>I have made no personal attacks on Georgieve who has been fully rebuffed by other physicists as well as myself in my weblog and elsewhere.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. There seems to have BIG DIFFERENCE with the last time. Now it seems that the number of DELETE votes has increased. If the work of Afshar was true it would have tendency to corroborate in time, yet this does not happen. The page is almost fully serving the purpose of Afshar AS IS NOW, so it must start with a lot of other basic principles on complementarity. By the way, my entry on complementarity was VANDALIZED by Afshar, and this is evidence that he and his friends control all relevant pages that have something to do with complementarity. THIS IS VIOLATION OF WIKI politics, VANDALISM is not acceptable, and IF Afshar wants to delete an entry he must at least suggest it for voting before deletion. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 04:21, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> The Afshar page doesnt contribute to physics but only to disinformation. There is no thing of founded in this experiment untill the result will be published in a peer reviewed journal and discussed by professional on the same criteria. If WP policies don't correct this kind of thing it is all the pertinence of the WP project which seems for me senseless. Naturally the fact that many good works were controversial before to be accepted could look as a counter example. However this works were at least discussed by physicist and not in the public place. It is only science which can define science and discussion like that show there is a problem here. My conclusion since Afsahr work has not been aproved or disaproved by science you should not keep the page .In other case this is more like superstitions and is pseudo-science.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Dear Aureline, this experiment has put an abrupt end to 8 decades of bullying by the orthodoxy, and sadly for your side, the cat is out of the bag and there is no going back. I wonder what other means of stifling dissent you guys would come up with when the paper gets published in a peer-reviewed journal. As for the technical rebuttal, (although this is hardly the place for it) I have responded to your criticisms without receiving a response. As I have asked before, one simple question: what process other than interference can account for the lack of flux on the wires? Please respond using QM formalism.

<li><b>Comment</b> Dear Afshar, there is NO WHICH WAY information in your experiment and the photon is holographically at both detectors. And YES, in order to have holographic image YOU NEED INTERFERENCE, but there is NO WHICH WAY info. See the recent posts of my 4 slit experiment with two different density matrices, and see also the CARL LOOPER's entry suggesting a holographic experiment with "virtual pinhole". Yes, I agree that Aurelien et al., suggest wrong physics and no interference, but others (including me) have explained your experiment with rigorous math and with holography [no which way]. Once you see that this is the loophole in your interpretation, you will be glad that actually you have not yet published the article. The difference between me and you will be that I have withdrawn a preprint [at ArXiv] but I have NEVER withdrawn peer-reviewed paper(!), while you will have withdraw a published one. <b>I am almost sure that you will find some low quality journal without impact factor, and you will publish your work, but my friendly advise is "Do NOT do that", you will score an auto-goal.</b> <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 04:10, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> To Afshar: The problem here is not if my argumentation (or one other ) is good or not (but of course my argumentation is the correct one&#160;:)). The problem concern the objectivity of the WP concerning your work. This page doesnt fulfill the basic rule of a scientific&#160;: don't amalgamate the agreement of the large public with the one of professional. for this reason and many others this page should desapear from WP.

I do not enjoy doing this, but for the interest of historic record, I will not hesitate to reveal to newcomers the various kinds of opposition I am facing. Enough said! P.S.

<li><b>Comment</b> Every controversial new result produces visceral reactions, involving "strong personalities." Controversy in itself does not qualify an article for deletion according to Wiki rules. That said, however, we may have an amicable solution at hand. I would like to act upon a suggestion made by Prof. Hewitt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Autobiography" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Autobiography" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>: I will write a version of the page that I believe accurately reflects the facts of the experiment, its implication, a brief discussion of the controversy with references, and post it on my Userpage. Other experts will then be invited to edit and correct the text to ensure its objectivity. Upon consensus on the quality of the material, one of the experts will replace the current article with the "good" version. Of course, as new information (pro/con) becomes available the page can be updated in a similar fashion.

<p>Dear mr. Afshar, you may write new QM textbook if you want. You at various places say that your EPIC article is the TRIUMPH of the last 70-80 years of QM experiments, and this is nothing but parody and unrespect to science. <b>Are you seriously expecting a Nobel Prize, you once said that Einstein's Nobel prize should be taken back BECAUSE OF YOUR EXPERIMENT???</b> To all others - why you still haven't voted for deletion of this non-sense entry? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 16:25, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Dear Danko, I will not engage in a conversation with you, as you have severly failed all the necessary criteria in my book. I fully understand your current bid for deletion of this page is your reaction to the lack of interest in your baseless arguments by every physicist that wasted his/her time listening to you. As to the "epic" nature of my work, only time can tell. For now real analysis and debate is needed, not juvenile antics. As for Einstein's Nobel prize, you have <b>misquoted</b> me. I said: <i><b>"In order to declare Einstein the winner of the Bohr-Einstein debate, we would have to take back his Nobel prize."</b></i> Of course all physicists believe that Einstein should have won his Nobel for Relativity Theories, and I personally revere Einstein. BUT, Einstein was awarded his Nobel prize for the concept of photons (thinking of them like "rain drops" with definite trajectories.) That idea of the photon (with bullet-like trajectories) is certainly wrong as my experiment clearly shows. The above statement was made to signify the seriousness of the problem the experiment attempts to address, and should not be taken out of its context. It took me 18 years of focused research and hard work to come up with this seemingly simple experiment, and I will not allow an inept person like you to halt its discussion. I repeat my advice (which is the advice of all other experts previously given to you): learn the basics and then talk about the bigger issue. <b>It is an absolute embarrassment to say that the image is a hologram...</b> Do not further harm your reputation, and good luck with your studies in Pharmacology. -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 17:52, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Clearly, there is no agreement in the science community that Afshar's experiment refutes quantum mechanics. I'd even say that there is a consensus that Afshar's interpretation of the results is wrong (at least, the physicists in my department are not panicking). However, there are some things that people agree on: that Afstar did an experiment, the setting and the results of this experiment, that Afshar claims it refutes the current theory of QM, and that this claim generated some interest in the popular press. It is obvious to me that this yields enough material for a Wikipedia article. I'm sure the article can be improved but I see no reason to delete it. Since you seem to be new here, it might be a good idea to read our <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion policy</a> to get a feeling for when we do delete articles. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 12:15, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Perhaps the best choice will to create a WP section for controversial idea (perhaps it exists i dont know). However if one of your student comes on WP and collects the information on the Afshar experiment would you say that he or she learned science&#160;? I will be please to know your point of view.

<li>Dear Hans, I agree that not all topics covered in Wikipedia need scientific publication before coverage. Examples are literature, movies, e-games, some popular topics. But when it comes to mathematics and science you cannot publish yellow press. Afshar is offending Einstein, takes back with easy hand Nobel Prizes as IF he is in the Nobel Cometee, and possibly himself expects a Nobel Prize for his parody of science. Everyone who understand matrix algebra and what is called density matrix of quantum state will immediately SEE that in order to have violation of complementarity you need to have 2 different density matrices in the same time! This is absurd, and as I suggested Afshar may write down new QM textbook if he wants, but it will be science fiction, not science. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 07:01, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

I proposed now to prof. afshar to write down a theoretical section to replace the present one (he seems to accept). This new section should says at the beginnig this is the interpretation of afshar. The rest will stay objective since the introduction is already fine and the list of reference is I guess correct. I will add a link to the page concerning complementarity which needs to be modify too. Concerning the work of DG I have no idea what to do with thaT since the physics is too badly presented to give even a unity or a impression (perhaps there is something behind but i dont know what). If he wants he can let a link to his work on my user page (talk) i will tra to read it and give honestly my impression. I will work on this topic at the beginning of february not before because i have too many things to finish right now . regards to all <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrezet_d217.html" title="User:Drezet">Drezet</a> (24/1/06)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a very difficult situation. All other things being equal, I think the experiment is well enough known to merit a page. However Afshar's behavior on Wikipedia has been absolutely despicable. Regardless of the merits of his work, his actions have been those of a crackpot. As long as he remains on Wikipedia, the article will never be reliable as a source of information, and so I can't see the point of retaining it. I don't think it's fair to the readers of Wikipedia to continue to serve this article as though it were the result of a cooperative community process. -- BenRG 19:48, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As it stands, the bulk of the article has been written by others, not me. So I don't see your point regarding the article not being a "community process." There are errors precisely because I was not allowed to clarify the motivation behind the experiment and the main line of logic. As discussed above, I have agreed to work with the credible Wiki editors who have a solid physics/mathematics background like Prof. Carl Hewitt, <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">Linas</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrezet_d217.html" title="User:Drezet">Drezet</a> and others to ensure the accuracy and objectivity of the article.

<p>This is a badly done stub which doesn't add anything to the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorraine.html" title="Lorraine">Lorraine</a> entry. It is part of an attempt to create ethnic groups everywhere, even where nobody would dream of one... Lorraine certainly has a troubled history, passing from Germany to France and back &amp; forth.

But we also have a page for <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texans.html" title="Texans">Texans</a>, even though Texans are very much not an ethnicity, because Texas had a history as an independent nation and because its residents in certain contexts will identify more strongly with Texas than with the USA.

<li><b>weak keep</b> or merge into <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorraine.html" title="Lorraine">Lorraine</a>. As of the start of World War one, Lorraine had a separate culture, and a regional, almost national, identity. (see various histories including Tuchman's <i>The Guns of August</i> on that point.) Wether they are truly an ethnicity, I couldn't say. But they had at one time a sufficently separate identity to be worth a mention. Howver, this need to be significantly celaned up and expanded -- if it isn't the issue should be dealt with in the main <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorraine.html" title="Lorraine">Lorraine</a> article until and unless there is enough separate verifiable content to justify article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">Mareino</a>, above, makes some good points. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:24, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>In the prior deletion discussion, it was mentioned that there was an on-line "dictionary of profanity" that listed this word with a wholly different definition to the one being deleted. This is that definition. Since this isn't re-creation of deleted content, here we are again. The on-line dictionary (linked to by the article) is currently lacking in content.

<li><b>Delete.</b>This is a song by band <a href="../../../1/2/_/12_Stones_4cbb.html" title="12 Stones">12 Stones</a>; the page contains no new information about the song, so there's nothing to merge with the <a href="../../../1/2/_/12_Stones_4cbb.html" title="12 Stones">12 Stones</a> article. Therefore I'm putting it up for deletion. The separate pages for their two albums (<i><a href="../../../1/2/_/12_Stones_%28album%29_bb25.html" title="12 Stones (album)">12 Stones (album)</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../p/o/t/Potter%27s_Field_%28album%29_8f65.html" title="Potter's Field (album)">Potter's Field (album)</a></i>) might also be merged and considered for deletion. — <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimpatico_4705.html" title="User:Simpatico"><font face="georgia" size="3">simpatico</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimpatico_a0b6.html" title="User talk:Simpatico">hi</a></sup> 18:27, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> if there were more than a half-sentence already covered on band page, I'd say merge, but as nom states, nothing <i>to</i> merge. <b>Merge</b> other articles as well. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 21:33, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this article. However, I see absolutely <i>no reason</i> to delete the album articles and unless someone can convince me otherwise would strongly oppose such a move. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 20:45, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>If their content was merged into the main 12 Stones article there would be no need for them. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimpatico_4705.html" title="User:Simpatico"><font face="georgia" size="3">simpatico</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimpatico_a0b6.html" title="User talk:Simpatico">hi</a></sup> 05:15, 22 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Convention here seems to be that if a band is notable enough for an article they're notable enough for their albums to have articles too. I accept that the 2 articles in question are not of a high standard at this time, but they may improve. Please, by all means list them for deletion if you think that's the right thing to do (or go ahead and merge them) - I may be a lone voice, who knows. I just think we have enough to do deleting the vanity, spam and cruft and I personally am not interested in deleting articles for the sake of it. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:16, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I should let you note that this player had just TWO Serie A appearances in his whole life before to leave professional football forever. If you think they could be enough, well, you must know that I am a (very) amateur football coach and, in my own past, I even led a couple of players with some experience in some Serie A youth teams, thus I could even feel myself authorized to make articles about these two guys. It is not enough to have played just a few minutes in a top team, according to me: even this guy, Gianluca Palmiteri, has played one match for Palermo (Serie A team), but I will never make an article about him, even if I am a big (and Sicilian) fan of Palermo.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). Vote count puts me at 6 delete/3 keep. Main reason I am not calling this a "delete" is that the reasons given do not go past an <i>assertion</i> of non-notability backed up by having only a few Google hits (countered by pointing out that the title should have been "Rif Raf" with a space). I am not comfortable calling a "delete" decision on that basis and will therefore decline to delete this without prejudice against a future AFD. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:44, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>But this term is definitely already in use and deserves an entry. I can see why, as there is a need for a word for this, anyway, and this one doesn't sound bad.</p>

<li><b>Keep it</b> — A Google <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=Netrepreneur" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=Netrepreneur" rel="nofollow">search</a> gives that this name is used quite a bit. — <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonkoldyk_16c0.html" title="User:Simonkoldyk">SimonKoldyk</a></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep it</b> — There is no reason for deletion, the term is well-known on the internet, the writer of this piece just has a starting forum about it, that can't be a reason for deletion.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> Wikipedia, along with being a constantly updated source for information, also serves as a guide to pop culture. The truth is that now, "Hogging", the word and the action, is an inherent part of our culture, regardless of how long it's been around and whatnot. Being redirected here from collegehumor just increases its establishment and thus credibility among college aged people. To remove this entry is a disservice to the goal and effectiveness of wikipedia as a well-reputed source of information for practically anything and everything. If deleted, I do not doubt that someone will come along and make a new entry for Hogging in several weeks. As for the argument that this promotes misogyny, so do many things, and the fact that these things exist does not preclude them from being included in an encyclopedia dedicated to the proliferation of knowledge.</li>

<p>I don't care whether it's deleted or not. I do know that a "Hog Log" was kept in Bancroft Hall of the US Navel Academy in the late eighties. This isn't a new fad or aborration...it's been around for a while. Anyone who attended there in the early Ninety's will know why "Naval" above is mis-spelled.</p>

<li>No, this article should stay intact. It's a real pracitce, not something someone just made up recently, but a timed practice. I've actually read an article where someone researched the topic and discussed it with males many years older than myself. -J. Sims</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> This is not a new term, it being used on college humor does not constitute any notion that it they who conceived it. And even if it were, is it not the goal of wikipedia to function as a freely flowing font of human knowledge? Let us leave it to the people at Encarta to provide us with a rigid, fixed, and thereby extremely limited view of cultural development. Wikipedia is man's crowning achievement. It is an unbiased, unlimited, and uniform free exchange of information. If this article truly rocks you to the core, then yes, delete it, but as a contributor to humanity's never ending pool of creation, I urge you move it, or add this summary to your already extensive list of slang terms.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.I find it very worrying that wiki administrators suck as "drini" apprently do not even perform cursory background-fact checks on the internet before entering his personal and completely unfounded misconceptions as "resons to delete" in this discussion. The term "guido" and all that it entails is a known term with a long history and it is widely used. And it's all verifiable by spending about 60 seconds with google, etc. Very bad research, drini. Shame on you. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 85.157.99.205 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_85.157.99.205_f0d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/85.157.99.205">contribs</a>) 08:38, January 24, 2006.</small></li>
