<p>Delete per no notability. An unaccredited "college" that offers "degrees" in subjects like "Secretarial Studies". I can't find a figure on how many people attended, but I assume its small since the church, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Longview_Baptist_Temple_4a8a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Longview Baptist Temple">Longview Baptist Temple</a> that operates it claims that the church has 3,000 members. Moreover, looking at their website the Bob Gray, "founder" of the college, is constantly referred to as "Dr." without mentioning his doctorate is honorary and from <a href="../../../h/y/l/Hyles_Anderson_College_dd4e.html" title="Hyles Anderson College">Hyles Anderson College</a> (an unaccredited institution.) This is telling of some problems of WP:V on its website. I get 3,000 yahoo hits for "Texas Baptist College" which included this article and places not related to this subject. Could be a <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mill.html" title="Diploma mill">diploma mill</a> or could be a great school either way it lacks <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 01:02, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>, though I honestly could not care less about this school one way or the other, I would point out that though it is unaccredited it still has had students, at the same time it has controversy and respect as well. The fact is some people may wonder about this school that want an unbiased opinion, I would never have known it existed until I saw it on wikipedia, plain and simple that is one of the great things about wikipedia, there are millions of things listed in standard encyclopedias I may never read but at the same time there may be somebody who needs to, by chance, no something, I do not find it notable, but it may be useful to someone else. The school's site is biased, wikipedia, is supposed to be an unbiased rescource for those searching, also there are many schools on here that are unaccredited, though I do think that <b>this</b> article should be kept I do not feel that the church article should be I feel that if anything the church article should be a section of the College article. --<a href="../../../m/j/h/User%7EMJHankel_57a6.html" title="User:MJHankel">MJHankel</a> 02:03, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Regarding your claim that it "has students", does it? Please provided <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> of how many students it has. If it has a lot that might establish notability.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Frankly I do not know but there has been a book written about it, from one of its alumni, beyond that I do not know, Like I said I never had heard of it before but it just seems as though there are other Unaccredited colleges listed and it just did not seem that there was any real reason to not list this one. I am just trying to expand and keep info on all subjects, frankly either way it does not much matter to me personally. I am just trying to make an appeal for this article. --<a href="../../../m/j/h/User%7EMJHankel_57a6.html" title="User:MJHankel">MJHankel</a> 05:37, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> As I said there was a book written about it called <i>The Texas Baptist Crucible</i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Texas-Baptist-Crucible-Tales-Temple/dp/1413796680" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Texas-Baptist-Crucible-Tales-Temple/dp/1413796680" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> so in that sense it is notable other than that I do not care plain and simple I honestly do not like in anyway Independent Baptist Fundamentalists look under controversies on <a href="../../../h/y/l/Hyles_Anderson_College_dd4e.html" title="Hyles Anderson College">Hyles Anderson College</a>, William Andy Beith was my principal, I was at that school when it all went down,.. so basically this is not a biased argument I am simply stating that it is somewhat notable for its controversy which I am positive is more than this especially sense the founder/chancellor of this school "Bob Gray" was also the founder of another highly controversial school in florida <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_Baptist_College_dd70.html" title="Trinity Baptist College">Trinity Baptist College</a>, either way I fill that if for no other reason than controversy this article may be important.--<a href="../../../m/j/h/User%7EMJHankel_57a6.html" title="User:MJHankel">MJHankel</a> 05:35, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't know that that is a confusion. The comments on Amazon and on various blogs and forum posts (yes, I know, not WP:V — just listen a sec) seem to indicate that the book discusses both, possibly because they are so intertwined. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 09:15, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Don't Delete:</b> Those suggesting this outfit is trivial clearly don't live in East Texas. This is a sizeable (if a bit odd) organization that is one of the major religious and social institutions in East Texas. I don't know the numbers, but they fill busload after busload of congregants every Sunday from as far away as Dallas (130 miles). No, it isn't world-famous; but anyone who lives in Longview or any of the surrounding towns is well aware of it, has likely had dealings with it in some way, and understands that it is quite influential in the region. Its accreditation or lack thereof really doesn't have much to do with it's overall influence. This is a substantial, locally influential, controversial institution - if that doesn't make it worthy of an entry, then I just don't understand the criteria very well I guess.Ritwingr 05:13, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> this is Ritwingr's first ever edit. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 17:43, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> At first, I had trouble understanding the problem, too, but let me see if I can explain it. All of this controversy is potentially VERY notable ... but we don't have sufficiently solid sources to demonstrate that controversy yet. (The Spurgeon book doesn't yet count because none of us seem to be able to address whether it talks about TBC or only about the church.) If you look at the Hyles-Anderson College article mentioned above, you see that newspapers have written about problems there (just one example). If you live in East Texas, you may be able to find verifiable sources that those of us using online searches can't find; for example, have the Longview News-Journal or the Tyler Morning Telegraph published stories? I also wonder whether any specifically Baptist papers or papers of other Baptist colleges have written about it; I know that when the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Churches_of_Christ_4f57.html" title="International Churches of Christ">International Churches of Christ</a> were getting started, a paper called <i>The Christian Chronicle</i> was writing about the movement long before major newspapers and TV stations or networks started covering the topic. Consider whether you or someone you know has access to such sources, and if so, post here any information you find. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 09:15, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A student number would be important here.
