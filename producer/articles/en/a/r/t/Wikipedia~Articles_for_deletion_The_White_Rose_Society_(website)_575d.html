<p><b>Keep</b> For those who think Alexis.com is the best place to really evaluate websites. Trust me, it's not. Alexis requires spyware toolbar to be installed. Most of the informed people don't even use it at all. White Rose Society is a fair and balanced archives for left-talk shows and as if we have too many syndicated right-wing hatefests all over the United States that wants to suppress dissenting voices. So, I view this a seperate entity from Ben Burch, and does a incredible job with limited resources! - Dustpuppy303 <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Dustpuppy303 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dustpuppy303_a87b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dustpuppy303">contribs</a>) 19:28, 11 January 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b> 82,789 registered users at DemocraticUnderground.com would find this a meaningful description. I think the way to get out of the political quagmire is not to determine which side is right, but to rise above the issue. I applaud Wikipedia's attempt to civilize this discussion. Good luck with that. The White Rose Society is a part of the fabric of today's world. To choose not to like it is fine. To censor it, proves many of the points made by those the website features. --Tigress DEM 04:37, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For the conspiracy theorists out there. I'm not a sock puppet. Had to look that up. And I made a novice mistake. I copied a previous post because all the html formatting made me think I had to have a text descriptor. I thought 'nondomesticspying' was 'nondomestictyping' and needed to complete a format loop. When I realized it was someone's login name I took it off. --Tigress DEM 05:54, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><s>*<b>Delete</b> . I don't think this article has useful purpose. Wikipedia should strive to remain an encyclopedia on par with other well-known references. Putting up an entry to serve as a portal amounts to turning Wikipedia into a directed google search. I would be inclined to keep this article if there were some educational merit to the content, but currently it reads as an advertisement for another website. What's next, an article for cheaptickets.com extolling it as place for bargain airline fares? While I'm sure The White Rose Society website serves a large user base that enjoys what is has to offer, I don't think that neccesitates a need for an entry. Wikipedia is not a place to advertise your favorite website. Also, currently <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=364x98575" class="external text" title="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=364x98575" rel="nofollow">DU</a> has been called on to "DU" this site so expect to be flooded with keeps.

<dd>I agree it's a marginal case for retention, but I think the thing that swings it into the "keep" column is the fact that it is an archive, a resource, rather than simply a soapbox that endlessly editorialises.

<dd>Well, I agree the White Rose Society Website might be useful to people interested in politics. But there are plenty of useful resources out there on the web -- does Wiki really need to link them all? I mean, could you explain why the Wiki entry is useful, as it merely links the site? I look at it like this: anyone interested in The White Rose Society website already knows it exists and can easily find it. If someone were to search Wiki for it "The White Rose Society Website" they'd come up with an article that links to thate site. So who exactly is that article for? -m00</dd>

<dd>The poor quality of the wiki entry is an argument for improving the wiki entry, not deleting it. I think that this entry, Ben Burch's own entry, and several other entries in the same "genre" such as those for DU, CU and William Rivers Pitt, are very inadequate, probably as a result of coordinated edit campaigns by both sides.

<dd>Well, then write some useful content! As it stands, the entry is totally useless, and adds absolutely zero to Wikipedia. It's just a link. If someone wants to add content where I could see a case that the article might possibly be of use to someone, I'll change my vote. And you are correct these topics end up being biased due to edit wars. Maybe we need to merge CU, DU, Will Pitt, and everything that's basically two warring Internet factions into a single article called "political activism on the Internet." I'd be for that, since I agree this is getting out of hand! -m00</dd>

How many other articles are fleshed out in so little time? And honestly, you can keep or delete this entry without that mattering to me or my website one iota, but this whole discussion reflects badly on the neutrality of Wikipedia, and I have had a teacher email to me say "see, this is why I will not allow students to use Wikipedia as a source!"

<p><b>Keep</b>. As I said earlier (before I was signed in) personal disputes and tantrums have no place making Wikipedia decisions. The request for deletion obviously stems from personal and political differences, and should be struck down on that alone. Wikipedia is not a battleground. Furthermore, the article doesn't contain anything which I can see that violates the rules. It's NPOV-safe, and is notable for the large archives involved. Political hissy fits aside, there's no reason to delete it. ADB</p>

If a user hear would like to hear more from such personalities as Randi Rhodes, Mike Malloy, and others, they can go to the website.

Frankly, I enjoy coming to this site because it leads to websites AND information I had previously been unfamiliar with. One such website that I found via Wikipedia is the White Rose Society.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I do find it disappointing that some of the decisions here are being made due to personal political affiliations and motivations, and what really should be under observation is the article's merit as an encyclopedic entry. It is my impression that this website is an archive of other radio shows, so does that in itself make it noteworthy enough for an article in the Wikipedia? I, personally, think not. While many of the original radio programs were created by notable people, and featured on notable radio stations, I do not think an archive of those radio shows in itself makes a website notable. Regarding "website notability guidelines", yes, they are "just guidelines", but many Wikipedia users consider these guidelines useful for personally determining the notability of a website. Alexa gives the site a ranking of 181,810 <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.whiterosesociety.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.whiterosesociety.org/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Now, if articles were created for all of the websites that have higher rankings that the whiterosesociety.org, assuming they have not yet been created and using the article count as of now from the English Wikipedia (912,698), websites would take up nearly 20% of the Wikipedia. It should be noted that "the Wikipedia is not infinite", nor is it an Internet directory. Personally, I do not like how Alexa works, but for lack of a better ranking system, it is what we tend to use. Another way of establishing notability (at least for forum websites), is to check the number of forum users. Currently, the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Underground_d747.html" title="Democratic Underground">Democratic Underground</a> has 82,820 registered users, which does make it notable in my eyes, and deserves its Wikipedia entry. (While not an entirely fair assessment since WRS is not primarily a forum community) the WRS society forum has 510 registered users (short of a generally accepted guideline of 5000 registered users). Please remember: deletion of the article does not mean the end of "the White Rose Society (website)". If the article is deleted, there is always the possibility that in the future the WRS will do something notable enough to warrant re-creation of the article and expansion. Now, if this website has made any other notable contributions to society, acheivements, or accomplishments, please say so and post related evidence, since everyone here still reserves the right to change their personal decsions at any time. Thanks for reading.&#160;— <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKMan_941b.html" title="User:TheKMan"><b><font color="#0000FF">The</font><font color="#FF0000">KMan</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKMan_98f4.html" title="User talk:TheKMan"><font color="#000000"><sup><u>talk</u></sup></font></a> 21:27, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>KMan... My argument against Alexa is that is basically CANNOT measure a site such as White Rose. It can only measure a site that people visit to read the pages. Since White Rose has become primarily a podcasting site, and Alexa misses ALL of that traffic, it doesn't bear any resemblance to the traffic to the site at all! And trust me, I have looked at this before while attempting to work on the visibility of the site, and decided it was close to worthless. Basically, if a totally unscientific measurement is good enough for you, that is up to you, but expect much more difficulty with such things in the future if you continue to use the work of a spyware vendor as a means of assessing the importance of a multimedia web entity. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 21:41, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Correct, Alexa measures website traffic. Now, it is my understanding that the podcasting content that is archived on your website does not require a user to visit to your website, but this content was not actually created by the WRS. I am examining the notability of The White Rose Society (website), the website, not the notable content of others that it archives. Does the website make any notable contributions of its own?&#160;— <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKMan_941b.html" title="User:TheKMan"><b><font color="#0000FF">The</font><font color="#FF0000">KMan</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKMan_98f4.html" title="User talk:TheKMan"><font color="#000000"><sup><u>talk</u></sup></font></a> 21:54, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, created? Yes, some of the material was created by broadcasters who were given program development grants by WRS, and all of it was recorded, compressed, and archived by WRS. This involves four dedicated recording machines, not an insignificant task. (You try to do it.) And obtaining the rights to provide this material to the Internet public was a major effort in some cases. Also, in the case of the Thom Hartmann program, I pay big bucks in royalty payments for sole Internet archiving rights to the material. Basically, is the publisher who publishes Steven King's novels notable?

<li>Comment - Honestly, though I believe this is an appropriate Wikipedia entry, I didn't create it, and I don't care what gets done with this; I think it is nice to be in Wiki and all, but I wouldn't have even questioned this except for the fact that the motivation of so many seems to be political, and that offends me. But, as others have pointed out, having a White Rose external link on the page for each of the show hosts would be the only advertising that would make any difference, anyway! Nobody is going to come here and type in White Rose Society (website) who did not already know that it existed!
