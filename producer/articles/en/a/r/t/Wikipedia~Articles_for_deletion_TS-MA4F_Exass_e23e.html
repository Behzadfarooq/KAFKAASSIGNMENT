<p>More Gundamcruft. Indiscriminate collection of information, unencyclopedic, appeals to a niche audience, original research. Please keep the personal comments out of this discussion.

<li><b>Transwiki</b> Seriously, I haven't heard a reasonable argument to keep these articles on Wikipedia. They're on the Gundam Wiki. What's the point? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 01:50, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>By that logic, we don't need to have <b>any</b> Gundam content at all. Or Star Wars or Star Trek, for that matter, since they've got Wikis too. For that matter, nearly everything on Wikipedia can be found somewhere else on the Internet (though not necessarily on a Wiki). If information being available somewhere else is in and of itself a reason for deletion, then Wikipedia serves no purpose. Also, the fact that people went to the trouble of creating a Wiki solely to contain these articles certainly can't make them <b>less</b> notable. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 09:48, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If anything, you're being too specific with your delete requests... By that logic, you'd have to delete every Gundam article on Wikipedia, along with most other Anime articles - in fact, there are several more obscure series that should have been targeted first. And I'm not in favor of that - I enjoy having the information on this and other series all available in one place. Furthermore, varying amounts of data on the subject (Gundam) are found on the Japanese, French, Spanish, Italian, and German Wikipedias shows, in my opinion, that at least the general subject deserves coverage here.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As outlined already, I object to the creation of multiple AfDs for small groups of articles without outlining the criteria by which they are divided. It only serves to complicate the debating process and comes accross as obnoxiousness rather than a legitimate concearn regarding the articles in question. Argument about the subject matter should be postponed untill all these AfDs are concatinated approrpriately. --KefkaTheClown 18:29, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep it</b> these articles violate none of wikipedia's article rules, there is no reason why they should be deleted. Fact that someone can argue that Star Wars is different is completely selfish, you may not like the subject of the article, but that gives someone no right to delete it because of that fact. Star Wars and Star Treck should both be on the choping block to if these articles are. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 208.210.148.160 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_208.210.148.160_52ab.html" title="Special:Contributions/208.210.148.160">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> as other users above have explained. Lone Jobber 06:37, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - for the reasons described above, as well as the fact that Wikipedia is a vertiable Hitchiker's Guide to Earth - 'Cruft' or no, Wikipedia is to inform. Just because it's not important to you does not automatically make it useless. For example, in the early Middle Ages, no one in Western Europe could read, save those outside monestaries... and even then, reading was still a rarity. Said monestaries were full of old parchments and books - some dating back to when Aristotle and Socrates were philosophising about reality. The church could easily have tossed it all out - because all they needed was the Bible, and the rest was basically 'cruft' to them. Yet they kept the knowledge, because they knew it'd be important to someone some day. What is being done here may just be with pop culture - but it is still information to be noted, logged and provided for everyone in this Hitchiker's Guide to Earth. Aside from all this, the only reason the Gundamwiki exists is to hold these articles that are being nominated for deletion (in such a way that abuses Wikipedia's regulations, might I add) in case they actually are deleted - not because someone made their own Wiki.

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, the church did have a reason to keep all the old stuff around: Classical education was important for the churchmen, who had to know the historical context of the scriptures they were reading, even if the historical context was seen in a light that glorified the Christian church above competing schools of thought. 'Bible only' is a relatively modern invention in the history of Christianity. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 12:57, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
