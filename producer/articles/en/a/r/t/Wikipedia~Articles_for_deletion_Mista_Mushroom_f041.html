<li><b>Comment</b> Since nobody bothered to contact the creator during PROD or AfD to explain to them why this article is not suitable or which guidelines it doesn't meet, I withhold my opinion at this time.

<li>The section you quote says nothing about <i>contacting</i> the creator. I did <b>share my concerns</b> with the creator by posting <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> in the PROD. Anyway, I routinely contact the creator in cases where I think that the article can be saved; in fact, I created one of the templates used to facilitate that process. I refuse to do it in situations where I can tell myself that there is no hope of saving the article and where the creator is aware that the article is up for deletion. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMareino_a751.html" title="User talk:Mareino"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">r</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mareino_35ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mareino"><font color="orange">ē</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">ino</a> 19:34, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>sharing your concerns with a new editor by referencing a wiki guideline shortcut like WP:BAND doesn't really meet the spirit of the text in my opinion. Think about this... If you were a new user and created a new article, then someone tagged it for PROD with a reason WP:BAND, would you have the faintest idea what they were talking about? It's obscure and doesn't really tell someone who is not familiar with the arcana of Wikipedia anything at all. I'm not trying to pick on you specifically Mareino, because this is a fairly widespread problem with AfD and PROD nominations.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:46, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - unless they can expand on the references to the popularity of their live shows and demonstate that they are a regular national <i>touring</i> act. If they can do that, they would be a keepie. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 18:15, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm the creater of the mista mushroom page. Mista Mushroom are unsigned. Thus, if the necessary criteria for a band to be on this website is to be signed then they must sadly be removed. However, if this is not so clearly defined then I would like to argue for its presence to remain. Firstly, the Bestival is not such a small festival as mentioned by someone: Broadcasted on Radio1, voted second best music festival by the guardian last summer, and with names such as fatboy slim, basement jaxx and lee scratch perry. The band toured last Summer accross the South West and the Midlands. They've had airplay on the Radio1 twice and are preparing a tour for this summer. As I said above they aren't signed so this post might be pointless, but given the difficulty it is to be a 'successful band' without being signed, I think that the festival playing alone is a factor that sets them apart from most other bands. I don't really know how a band can be 'successful' before being signed with achievements such as this band already have. What do you think?</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - as I stated above, we need <i>evidence</i> that they are a regular national touring act; just saying that they are is no use when it's the only part of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> that appears to be passed. Playing a festival doesn't entail immediately notability - it's just one gig, regardless of the numbers involved - that said, if you can show that the BBC broadcast included the band's set then you might be onto something. There are artists on Wiki who have never been "signed" in the ordinary sense, working with various lables or even exclusively their own so it's not an immediate bar to an entry.<a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 17:35, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I also want to add that, unlike with most other articles, being deleted is not the end of the world for a band. A band that is non-notable today could secure a couple of reviews in newspapers and magazines or land a major-label record deal, and suddenly they would qualify for an article. In the interim, you may copy the contents of the page over to your user page. User pages are a good place to store material that you hope to spin into an article, because bascially the only things that can ever be deleted from user pages are things that break the law, like threats and copyright violations. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMareino_a751.html" title="User talk:Mareino"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">r</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mareino_35ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mareino"><font color="orange">ē</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">ino</a> 19:35, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I am the author of this page. Having just discovered the criteria for putting a band onto this website I would like to dispute the deletion of this band due to the following criteria: "A musician or ensemble...is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria...Has won or placed in a major music competition". The Bestival auditions clearly qualify as a major music competition - for the reasons noted above - and they won this. Therefore as only one criteria needs to be satisfied I see no reason for deleting this and will remove the 'to be deleted' headnote. --tolfree 11:42, 20 May 2006</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - "Bestival Auditions" brings up a grand total of 4 Google hits, one of which is this page. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 10:47, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Are you sure you didn't make a typo? I just ran a search for it and it came up with a lot more. Secondly, how can an audition for a festival that triggures 362,000 results in google, and which has such major names as mentioned above, not be considered a major music competition? And if this is the case, what sort of music competitions that cater for this genre are any bigger? This is to my knowledge the biggest British music festival that holds auditions - Glastonbury, Leeds &amp; Reading and global gathering don't! --tolfree 11:42, 20 May 2006</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - finally, I've been searching for other bands that are unsigned to see what credentials they hold. One example, [InVersion], is a band that has had airplay on phoenix fm (unknown to me) and the only credible competition they have won is a battle of the bands. Incidentally, Mista Mushroom have won two separate botb competitions: Isle of Wight and Central South England. Why therefore has this band been allowed to remain with apparently smaller achievements than mista mushroom? I guess if you go on your 'google hits' criteria then they win, but that's because they name has other meanings, unlike mista mushroom. It just seems rather unfair that's all.--tolfree 11:42, 20 May 2006</li>
