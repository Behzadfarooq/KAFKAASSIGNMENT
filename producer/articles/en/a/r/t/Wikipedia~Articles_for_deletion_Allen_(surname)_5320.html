</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The reference to <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSDAB_2469.html" title="WP:MOSDAB">WP:MOSDAB</a> is thoroughly misleading. If the manual page, which is at most a guideline to how to write generic dab pages, is worded so as to permit valuable lists by surname to be deleted, then the wording is wrong and needs to be changed. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_name.html" title="List of people by name">List of people by name</a> is an inflexible structure that has done good work in the past, but is not adapted to the WP of today where the number of pages by personal name is in the hundreds of thousands. <i>No one is likely to enter "Allen" in the search box to find "Tim Allen"</i> is a comment with no merit at all (who is in a position to claim anything of the sort?) . This was brought here as the 'upgrade' of a prod suggestion: see <a href="../../../a/l/l/Talk%7EAllen_%28surname%29_fcb3.html" title="Talk:Allen (surname)">Talk:Allen (surname)</a>. See the same user's prod at <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_%28surname%29.html" title="Albert (surname)">Albert (surname)</a>, big undiscussed cuts from <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adams.html" title="Adams">Adams</a>.

<ul>
<li>Of course it was brought as an upgrade; that's the procedure. I thought no one might object to the prod; when someone did, I moved here to discuss it. I am relying on the manual page, you're right, but I think treating <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_%28surname%29.html" title="Allen (surname)">Allen (surname)</a> as List of people with the surname Allen and duplicating the effort of <a href="../../../a/l/l/List_of_people_by_name%7E_All_b972.html#People_named_Allen" title="List of people by name: All">List of people by name: All#People named Allen</a> is the wrong approach, encyclopedicly. I'll hold off on asking for an AfD on <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_%28surname%29.html" title="Albert (surname)">Albert (surname)</a> until this one is decided. -- <a href="../../../j/h/u/User%7EJHunterJ_08ee.html" title="User:JHunterJ">JHunterJ</a> 17:12, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>From <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>: <i>Proposed deletion is a process for deleting articles that are uncontroversial deletion candidates</i>.

<li>Absolutely right. -- <a href="../../../j/h/u/User%7EJHunterJ_08ee.html" title="User:JHunterJ">JHunterJ</a> 12:48, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>_ _ Charles is IMO wrong in suggesting <a href="../../../l/o/p/LoPbN_8d81.html" title="LoPbN">LoPbN</a>'s "good work in the past" rested on its being essentially complete. Almost three years ago (and 1 or 2 editor-years of my effort on it), it had neither an entry for <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thabo_Mbeki_9e48.html" title="Thabo Mbeki">Thabo Mbeki</a>, nor even a page where it could properly be placed; i can't count the number of <i>obviously</i> needed people that i've personally added, just because i chanced to notice a name missing.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Digression: The <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byron_Janis_7272.html" title="Byron Janis">Byron Janis</a> entry, and the <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byron_Janus_3c52.html" title="Byron Janus">Byron Janus</a> rdr to it, may be in my last half dozen -- hmm, a month ago, un-breaking after 27 months the rd lk entry that i created under the Janus misspelling. Hmm, the bio article was created 9 months after my rdlk, but in the absence of a rdr from my misspelling, not accessible from LoPbN for another 18. Oh, wow, 6 hours after the bio's creation, Charles did the lead sent &amp; Cat'd it; small world.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>My belief is that it has always been one of our most long-term seriously in-progress features. There have lately been demonstrations, IMO successful, of a bot that can make practical the addition of most of the missing bios, and there's been an upsurge of, AFAIK, <i>manual</i> mass insertions from Cat lists; IMO the {{persondata}} tag also offers powerful new practices, which i will discuss elsewhere. IMO something that <i>looks to the user</i> approximately like LoPbN should be a permanent feature, even tho i'd like to see more machine-assisted mechanisms to support

<dd>LoPbN,</dd>
<dd>"full"-name Dabs like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Smith_3332.html" title="John Smith">John Smith</a>, and</dd>
<dd>lists/dabs devoted each to one surname,</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>hopefully dramatically reducing the fraction of bios unlisted by them.</dd>
<dd>_ _ As i was writing, Charles responded to my earlier comments to the extent of mentioning his WikiMedia Board plank for "support for surnames", a pregnant and probably brilliant concept that i'll study soon. He, i, or someone should lk here to a page where these matters are fully on topic!<br />

<li><b>Keep</b>. This page was apparently created to remove the personal names from the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen.html" title="Allen">Allen</a> disambiguation page in order to keep the size of that page manageable. The statement that no page links to <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_%28surname%29.html" title="Allen (surname)">Allen (surname)</a> is incorrect. <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen.html" title="Allen">Allen</a> does, and so do the others listed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Allen_%28surname%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Allen_%28surname%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Allen_%28surname%29</a> . In terms of surname disambiguation pages in general, it often happens that people are referred to by their surname only, so that one needs a disambiguation page to resolve them: <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hansen%27s_disease.html" title="Hansen's disease">Hansen's disease</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger_syndrome.html" title="Asperger syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_vs._Wade_a3e3.html" title="Roe vs. Wade">Roe vs. Wade</a>.

<li>All those besides <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen.html" title="Allen">Allen</a> linked to it after the deletion discussion started. Yes, surname disambiguation in general is useful for people who are very frequently referred to simply by one name, such as those you listed. Not the case with the Allens listed. -- <a href="../../../j/h/u/User%7EJHunterJ_08ee.html" title="User:JHunterJ">JHunterJ</a> 17:34, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>False statements should be retracted with an apology, I think. And the rest is nonsense. As I've pointed out, you may perfectly well have only initial and surname, in which case such a page is good. What is more, if you happen only to <i>know</i> that someone is a baseball player, and a surname, you can search on that basis. That 'useful' only for some preconception of how the site is used is an extremely weak argument, considering that you are asking the whole page to be deleted. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 17:53, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am sorry I overlooked <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen.html" title="Allen">Allen</a> -- I confused it with the name of the page I was checking for links to. Mea culpa. Please be civil and stop tossing around "nonsense", "pedantry", and "no merit at all". -- <a href="../../../j/h/u/User%7EJHunterJ_08ee.html" title="User:JHunterJ">JHunterJ</a> 17:59, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>'Pedantry' you seem to be citing from an email I sent round the wikien list, alerting people (without naming names) to the damage inherent in the approach adopted not by you alone (I'm thinking of <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbigDexter_00c9.html" title="User:AmbigDexter">User:AmbigDexter</a> too). But you are wrong to say these are incivil terms. <i>No merit</i> is incivil?

<li>The assertion that nothing does nor <i>should</i> lk to it is irrelevant, if it is treated as a Dab page (to which, by def'n, nothing should lk). IMO it is, like most lists, clearly a nav'n page, and IMO the distinctions among the various forms of Nav page (well, other than Rdrs) are fuzzy enuf that the presumption should be "there's nothing wrong with a Nav page that nothing lks to" and the burden of proof to the contrary should lie with those seeing a problem.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> - to begin with, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_name.html" title="List of people by name">List of people by name</a> is a useless mess that's difficult to edit and difficult to use.

<li><b>Keep and expand</b> An extension of a disambig page, it could do with the addition of some referenced material about the history of the surname, however. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 02:36, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, nice and clean page.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It has a valuable function (almost entirely of a Dab'n nature); this function is distinct from those that are better served by <a href="../../../a/l/l/List_of_people_by_name%7E_All_b972.html#People_named_Allen" title="List of people by name: All">List of people by name: All#People named Allen</a> (nav when dead certain of surname spelling but, re given name, under various degrees of (A) spelling uncertainty and/or (B) typing fatigue). (I believe that <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_%28surname%29.html" title="Allen (surname)">Allen (surname)</a> and Allen (given name) would be the titles that Allen (name) would be divided into, if it is one of the rare cases where the name-derivation topic is large enough and overlap is low enough. Thus i'm not sure the title shouldn't be Allen (person) instead; but that is not an AfD issue.)<br />
