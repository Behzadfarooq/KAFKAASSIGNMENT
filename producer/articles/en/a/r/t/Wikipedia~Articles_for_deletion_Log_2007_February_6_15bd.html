<li>IMO, the Linux list is too detailed to be merged in the main article. One can argue about WP not being an indiscriminate collection of information (e.g. list, trivia), and one way to avoid deletion is to take the comparisons out of the table format and write it just like an ordinary encyclopedia article. However, I think this would be a problem since there are many Linux distributions, and there can also be as many points of comparison; IMO, a table does the job better. This current list, however, is small enough to be included in the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_application_framework.html" title="Web application framework">Web application framework</a> article. Unless, of course, it can be either expanded or merged. --- <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitopao_212a.html" title="User:Titopao">Tito Pao</a> 05:14, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. While the general decision to split up stereotyping content into various "Stereotypes of..." articles may or may not have been a good one, once the general decision was made, lots of individual "Stereotypes of..." articles follow, and it makes no sense to try to rehash the general decision by picking a few off individually and leaving the rest. The article could stand improvement, but the existence of stereotypes is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> from common knowledge. That said, it's questionable whether "Arabs and Muslims" should be combined, since the latter is a much larger group than the former. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 01:44, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and Rename</b> This article can be saved, but first it has to be seperated. As Shirahadasha points out, it makes no sense to combine "Arabs" and "Muslims" as not all Arabs are Muslim (Druze, Christian, Athiests, Agnostics, etc) and non-Arab Muslims probably outnumber Arab Muslims. Ironicly, the title of the article reflects a stereotype.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">William Thweatt</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamThweatt_8c60.html" title="User talk:WilliamThweatt">Talk</a></sup> | <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WilliamThweatt_f34f.html" title="Special:Contributions/WilliamThweatt">Contribs</a></sup> 03:21, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Although true that "not all Arabs are Muslim" or vice versa, the common stereotype (at least in the United States) is that they are. Although I am not opposed to seeing the separated, I don't think either one could be mentioned without noting the other. As the article currently stands, it is in fact more about stereotypes against Arabs than Muslims, so perhaps "and Muslims" should be dropped from the title. Also, I think "in the American media", "in Western popular culture" or something similar should be added to the title of this (and the other similar articles) as this is the actual focus of the article (the article does not, for instance, include stereotypes of Arabs among Israelis, among Africans, etc.).

<li><b>Comment</b> - The grouping of peoples &amp; their stereotypes is very complex, and I see no obvious best way to organize these articles. I just wanted to mention that the possibly related page <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotypes_of_South_Asians_0ae5.html" title="Stereotypes of South Asians">Stereotypes of South Asians</a> also exists, split off from the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotypes_of_Asians_417e.html" title="Stereotypes of Asians">Stereotypes of Asians</a> page. The current article used to be called <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotypes_of_Near_Easterners_Arabs_9db0.html" title="Stereotypes of Near Easterners/Arabs">Stereotypes of Near Easterners/Arabs</a> because that's what the mother page's heading was called, but was renamed to the current title as per its <a href="../../../s/t/e/Talk%7EStereotypes_of_Arabs_and_Muslims_bfb8.html" title="Talk:Stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims">discussion page</a>. Stereotyping is a complex issue first because there are so many layers of identity with regards to nationality and religion which each have their own stereotypes that may or may not overlap, and second because stereotypes are often created &amp; perpetuated by ignorant people who mistakenly lump different identities together or substitute one for another. I agree that a discussion regarding how best to organize these articles is definitely in order, although my first priority is to save this article from deletion. --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 04:00, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> As this is a violation of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>: <i>Synthesis of published material serving to advance a position</i>. It is possible to make a similar article for every ethnic or religious group because for every group one will find something that will support their position. This article seems to select a few authors and films to make a statement. This càomment may be striked when it can be proven that there exist a substantial academic literature about this subject, rather than selecting a few authors to advance an opinion. Also it seems to be a good idea to differ between Muslims and Arabs, and between American and Western European societies. As many muslims and Arabs live in Western Europe, it is possible that e.g. films show a less stereotypical image, see for instance <a href="../../../g/e/g/Gegen_die_Wand_b86a.html" title="Gegen die Wand">Gegen die Wand</a>, which can hardly be claimed to be stereotypical. <a href="../../../s/i/j/User%7ESijo_Ripa_7655.html" title="User:Sijo Ripa">Sijo Ripa</a> 13:28, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I believe that you misunderstand the article; it isn't saying that all Muslims <i>are</i> terrorists etc. It's saying that the above <i>misconception</i> &amp; related confusion of identities exists in the form of stereotypes. However, I agree that the organization of the article is messy now; I think if clearer headings are used (we can give stereotypes of Muslims and stereotypes of Arabs separate subheadings &amp; define each identity) and a paragraph explicitly explaining how the stereotypes of each group are associated or how identities are mistaken by those stereotyping, the points made above about Arab vs. Muslim identity can be successfully addressed. --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 04:40, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Rather, the aim of the article is to document the stereotypes, and provide a balanced view of them. I'd like to eliminate the smell of OR from the article, and it will of course need to be monitored carefully for balance and to ensure an NPOV tone, but that should not be beyond our collective wit.

<p>The result was <b>Keep</b>. In the end, not even the nominator was arguing for deleting this article. The only remaining point of contention was whether or not there should be an article on Ebonics distinct from the article on African American Vernacular English. There was not absolute consensus on this point, but a number of commentators presented strong arguments that the two subjects are distinct, and many other participants seem to be agreeing, so this deletion discussion is closed without any AFD-mandated merging of the two articles. I encourage interested participants to discuss what content belongs at what article on the respective talk pages, outside the context of a deletion discussion. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 17:42, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Much of the original meaning of "Ebonics" isn't covered by "AAVE" (and it is based on linguistic premisses that for now I'll describe as idiosyncratic), thus the additional short article on the term "Ebonics".

<li><b>Keep</b> for now, and allow people who are willing to read and think to consider redirecting it after an intelligent discussion.

No it doesn't, and if the AAVE article says that it does, this needs rewriting.

<li><b>Keep</b> this article. And, as Hoary rightly says, read the AAVE article and the discussion on its talk page before rushing to merge two articles that do not actually mean the same thing.

<dd>Let's hear it one more time. "African American vernacular English" is the linguistics term. "Ebonics" is not. It's a poltically-charged (i.e. non-neutral, non-scientific) term that is used by some for AAVE, but that has other overtones as well. "Ebonics" resides in a political and cultural context, "AAVE" in a linguistics context.

Further: <i>The combination of the media spotlight, race, language, education and politically correct dogma soon leapt beyond the political realm and became fodder for comedians, pundits, and editorial cartoonists (see chapter 8), and "-bonics" soon became a productive suffix as off-color Ebonics jokes began to flourish.

I'll create a page like this later this year when my WP backlog is done with, but right now this page should go. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 08:12, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete pending better sources and cleanup</b> The article provides no independent references outside the game rules. As per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INFO</a>, plot summary articles for fiction should include references and text containing a real world context or analysis, and should not consist of simply listing plot elements. If the article can be expanded to include sourced text explaining something about these armies outside of just the game rules, then I'd reconsider. As noted above, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warhammer_40K_8b02.html" title="Warhammer 40K">Warhammer 40K</a> is itself a notable game, but that doesn't exclude subarticles about the game from needing independent referencing in their own right. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:43, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Actually, this article has almost nothing to do with the plot or fiction of the Warhammer universe whatsoever. I would say absolutely nothing, but I suppose listing the armies by faction almost qualfies. Still, I'd say your objection is not applicable to this article. If anything, the talk page seems to indicate an intent to make the article about the game, rather than the story of the game. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:32, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am not 100% sure but this appears to be a hoax. The non functional in line citations are links to pages that do not back up that facts asserted. For instance, the article claims that this person is worth 120 million but the link is to Bill Gates' net worth. The obvious hoax portion was removed after it was tagged as such and the creator removed a prod, so I thought this might be the best way to go about it for now. <b>No Opinion</b> at this point. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<li>The album has a release date, but the data is confusing. One should be redirected depending on the truth, and I'm concerned here because Get Bucked seems to be a lot of unsourced OR. Either redirect to <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buck_The_World_dd35.html" title="Buck The World">Buck The World</a> (which seems to be the correct path), or if indeed the article is to be named Get Bucked, transplant the contents from BTW into Get Bucked and redirect that.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Maybe somebody can bother to check the website for the label? The label seems pretty notable, just starting, is part of Universal, and is operated by 50 Cent. I'm not all that big (read: not at all) on hip hop, but last I heard, 50 cent is pretty danged notable, so if he's signed on that label, I'd guess that the label has at least some info. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 00:30, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually, just for clarification, polymelia applies to all animals (including humans) as far as I can tell (although you are right that the article is presently focused more on humans). In addition, it currently containts the whole of the Henrietta article. If there is a unique article for non-human animal mutation, then it should definitely go there.

<li>This is somewhat misleading. For example, some of the references deal with the New York crime that involved the website. Of course these articles do not have the website as their <i>main</i> topic. An article that is about crystal meth use that refers numerous times to the website is still <i>about</i> crystal meth, not adam4adam, but nonetheless it is a valid source. The WP:WEB criteria are meant to help establish the notability of a site in lieu of other, obvious criteria. The fact that this site has been verifiably involved in several off-line news stories and that there is a steady accretion of relatively minor mentions of it seems to me to counterbalance the fact that we can't point to a single newspaper article that's <i>about</i> the site. -<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 05:13, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I had no idea Adam4Adam was the #2 gay site (as your figures above indicate). I added material from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Advocate_6682.html" title="The Advocate">The Advocate</a></i> after seeing your mention. When I was done, I took a look at the article. Now I sort of <i>hope</i> the article gets deleted. Because it's free, Adam4Adam is used by many people without much money, and its also used by lots of non-White people. It has no cultural prestige and it seems to only get mentioned as part of blaming it for some ill or horrendous incident. <b><a href="../../../k/a/t/Katie_Couric_f7e1.html" title="Katie Couric">Katie Fucking Couric</a></b> isn't going to do a cute human interest story about how two boys met on Adam4Adam and are now dating steady. The owner(s) of Adam4Adam won't appear on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_View_4421.html" title="The View">The View</a></i>. Right now the article looks like a litany of crime, disease and other troubles. People use it for dating as well as sex. Using it is not a character flaw. As is, the article looks like exactly what a hate groups needs to say "gay people are scum...this encyclopedia article even says so". <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 03:28, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment</b> The <i>content</i> of this site isn't too different than that of its competitors (I assume). The content <i>isn't</i> what's notable. Per <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP%7EWP_9509.html" title="WP:WP">WP:WP</a>:</p>

<p>It then says, "This page gives some rough guidelines which most Wikipedia editors use..." It doesn't demand that sources focus on the content.

While the fact that <a href="../../../a/b/o/About.com.html" title="About.com">About.com</a> has a review about Adam4Adam at all all seems to add notability, I excluded that review on this basis.

<li><b>Question</b> - <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiable</a> sources list Adam4Adam as the #2 gay dating site in the world (or at least the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English-speaking_world.html" title="English-speaking world">English-speaking world</a>) in Sept 2005 and as the #3 such site in December 2006. Is there no guideline anywhere that suggests a website, book, company, toy, device, whatever that appears on published lists as one of the most-used in the world has <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>?--<a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 01:02, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Answer</b> - I got impatient and found an answer to my own query. A website is also a business and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations_and_companies%29_2788.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)">Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)</a> says the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An organization is automatically notable if it meets <i>any</i> of the following criteria: (1) The commercial organization is listed on ranking indices of important companies produced by well-known and independent publications...The broader or the more specialized the index, the less notability it establishes for the company.</p>
</blockquote>
These guidelines explicitly allow for indices more specialized than mega-lists like the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_500.html" title="Fortune 500">Fortune 500</a>. Adam4Adam appears as one of the top ten dating sites (gay, straight or otherwise) in the United States (although not in the world as I stated previously). On Wikipedia we do not distinguish between a company and its services (look at <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a>, <a href="../../../h/%26/r/H%26R_Block_8c85.html" title="H&amp;R Block">H&amp;R Block</a> or anything you can think of). Therefore, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations_and_companies%29_2788.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)">Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)</a>, Adam4Adam is <b>"automatically notable"</b> and it would be so even if we didn't have over a dozen newspapers references. --<a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 11:25, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> A list of "top 10 dating sites" is hardly a "company ranking index", by any stretch of the imagination. Furthermore the "broader or the more specialized" comment <i>specifically</i> refers to stock market indices, not lists of dating sites. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 11:48, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - A list of "top five online florists" is a ranking index. A list of "top twenty pizzerias in New York" is a ranking index. <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_market_index.html" title="Stock market index">Stock market index</a> is a narrowly defined term. "Company ranking index" is not. As was predicted above, we're Wikilawyering.

<p>Let me explain the background of the situation. Initially, there was <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crash_%28novel%29.html" title="Crash (novel)">Crash (novel)</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crash_%281996_novel%29.html" title="Crash (1996 novel)">Crash (1996 novel)</a>. For the sake of uniformity, I moved "Crash (novel)" to <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crash_%281973_novel%29.html" title="Crash (1973 novel)">Crash (1973 novel)</a>, and then corrected the inbound links to point to the correct article. In the meantime, I have made "Crash (novel)" into a disambiguation page, however it's not likely to be an accidental link and only disambiguates two articles, which is unneeded. I've created this AFD so I can get help in determining whether to delete this page, to redirect it back to <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crash.html" title="Crash">Crash</a>, or whatever. In the meantime, I am voting <b>neutral</b>. <span style="font-size:95%">—<a href="../../../m/e/s/User_talk%7EMessedrocker_915e.html" title="User talk:Messedrocker">Signed</a>, your friendly neighborhood <b><a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker">MessedRocker</a></b>.</span> 03:35, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> First, its not people important to Old and New Testament. It's people important to Messianic Judaism found in the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> and the <a href="../../../b/27/r/B%27rit_Chadasha_bc2a.html" title="B'rit Chadasha">B'rit Chadasha</a>. Second, just because the heavy hand of Jewish editors has discouraged the participation of Messianic editors in Wikipedia, I don't think is grounds to simply delete an article based off the idea <i>"nominating for AfD. I said back in November that I'd nom this if concerns weren't dealt with. no attempt has been made to deal with them, so off to AfD we go"</i> - your concerns are your own. You could have worked on the article first to actually improve it yourself, without deleting it - you had a good suggestion, so why didn't you follow through with it? As such, you've done nothing to the article to help it since November, and now all of a sudden because you participate in other Messianic VfDs, you're somehow reminded how you can attack other MJ articles, you're probably going to bandwagon the rest of the Jewish editing gang to delete this one too. You know what, the article is relevant to list important figures in Messianic Judaism. The reasons cited is quite obvious from the title headings "Figures from the Tanakh" and "Figures from the B'rit Chadasha" - and since Messianic Judaism is NOT Christianity, a separate page listing important figures to Messianic Judaism is just as necessary as Mormons listing important figures to their religion apart from Christianity. Shall I guess that there will be 40+ delete per nom, or "confusing" or "not needed" votes from blatantly obvious Jewish editors whereas the rest of us consensus-building non rabbinic Jewish wikipedians vote to keep? The only issue here is that you don't believe that Messianic Judaism is separate from Christianity; and that is the ONLY reason you have to delete this article; and to be honest, this article is not the place to inform the public of this. <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messianic_Judaism_97b5.html" title="Messianic Judaism">Messianic Judaism</a> instead exists to do just that. This isn't a content issue you have. It's a religious definition one, and I wish you rabbinics would quit VfDing valid MJ articles and templates that you only have POV reasons to delete. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 04:24, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Let me say that you are correct in one minor detail- the TfD reminded me to look into this article's situation and see how if anything had changed since November. That said, I'm not sure I can find an otherwise remotely true statement in the remainder of the above. First, before AfDing this, I looked for sources to see if I could find anything like "X is an important figure in Messianic Judaism." I found none. Second, whether Messianic Judaism is or is not Christianity is irrelevant to why I AfDed this- a list of important people in the OT and the NT doesn't make anything unique to MJism when those people are only important by virtue of being important in those two texts. To be the stereotypical "rabbinic" Jew you think I am, there is no <i>chiddish</i> in this list. Third, I don't intend to "bandwagon" anyone and I would disagree with anyone who argued that this list should be deleted based on confusion concerns (such concerns may be legitimate in other cases, but they don't exist here). Fourth, for the vast majority of Wikipedians, the OT is nearly identical to Tanach and the "Brit Chadashah" is the NT (heck, the term even means "New Covenant)- I'm not going to use terms from other languages simply to obscure matters. Finally, I cannot emphasize enough that my personal opinion about the nature of Messianic Judaism had nothing to do with this deletion- the lack of sourcing and the inherent triviality of the list was the basis. If I thought that this was being used to push some sort of Messianism-is-Judaism I would have said so in my nomination. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:37, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Final Comment</b>In <a href="../../../j/u/d/Template%7EJudaism_a495.html" title="Template:Judaism">Template:Judaism</a>, a list of important figures is included. To prevent bloating <a href="../../../m/e/s/Template%7EMessianic_Judaism_b2fa.html" title="Template:Messianic Judaism">Template:Messianic Judaism</a>, this article currently lists figures important to Messianic Judaism, just as the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Template%7EJudaism_a495.html" title="Template:Judaism">Template:Judaism</a> template lists figures important to Judaism. No other inclusion criteria is needed. At this point I would say that the current list and this article simply provides a means to prevent bloating the current Messianic Judaism template with the same names. Furthermore, Hebraic names are used for these important figures; a source of which is quite easily found in the Orthodox Jewish Bible at <a href="http://www.afii.org/ojbible.html" class="external free" title="http://www.afii.org/ojbible.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.afii.org/ojbible.html</a> - one of many sources that use these names and others to the extreme, and is proof that these names are in use, notable, and useful for inclusion in Wikipedia as a list of important figures to Messianic Judaism. This is my final response. As the last regular Messianic editor on Wiki, I'm saying that these VfDs are consuming so much of my time that I have not contributed anything to any articles in months; and would feel that if I did, it would probably be VfDed ultimately anyways so as to render my contributions useless - and without other Messianic editors to help, well, I guess Wikipedia just won't be the place to find out about them. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 05:11, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> OR. In my experience, there are two requirements for an encyclopedic list of "important" or "notable" things related to a topic. First, there has to be a (sourced) criteria that defines what notable means and second there has to be a source that has decided that the things listed are notable, unless it is blindingly obvious from the criteria. In this case, neither of these are present. The list is defined as: "A comprehensive list of historical and important figures in Messianic Judaism and the apologetics of its followers." Does that mean that anyone who a Messianic Jewish theologian thought was notable must be included? What happens when two apologetics disagree about an individual's notability? Unless the list is overhauled to address these problems, it is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 04:47, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

This list SHOULD have people important to the rise of Messianism in modern culture; not Adam or Enoch.

The author stated above that the reference was The Bible, but the Bible does not state that these people are important to messianic judaism.

<p>I propose that this article is unsalvageable original research. It begins with a shaky premise (namely, failing to define "flop" or to defend use of the word from accusations of original research and opinion) and has since become a dumping ground for everybody to add what they <i>think</i> is a "flop", regardless of a) whether it actually was, b) if there's a source to confirm it, or c) if it's status as a "flop" meaningfully contributes to its notability. The article is written and indeed structured in an unencyclopedic gossipy tone with innapropriate editorial comments after nearly EVERY entry. There is no attempt at providing references. Furthermore, adding a reference to each entry (which I don't believe will ever happen) will merely make this a list of "things that one source or another has referred to as a flop," which is in indiscriminate-list territory. Please don't be swayed by the fact that a lot of people have spent a lot of time turning this into a humungous list. It is fundamentally flawed and at the very least should be blanked and started from scratch with specific criteria and citations for every entry. <a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 04:42, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> to Mr.Dolomite — Unfortunately, there might be a variety of definitions for flop, none of them crystal clear. The intro had stated it alright, IMO — "(shows or other entertainment forms) that had high expectations, large amounts of money or widespread publicity, but fell far short of success." That might be the crux of the problem — what one constitutes a "flop" might be a "success" to another, hence the disagreement spoken of. Believe it or not, there may be people out there that thought the Edsel (the poster child for "flop") was a complete success; there's probably some people who think that the non-NFL leagues (i.e., XFL) were successes, although I think that one could easily be verifiable. I think that there are some entries that are verifiable (e.g., newspaper stories detailing a highly anticipated show's sudden cancellation), but the list just seemed to multiply on its own with entries that may or may not actually have been flops. After all, some shows were simply "failures" (e.g., a show that probably was not critically expected to succeed in the first place and didn't), and not all TV shows or other entertainment programs are expected to succeed. That's where the problem with this article lies; this article contains both flops and failures. If this article is re-created, then the article needs to contain only flops and <i>perhaps</i> the spectacular failure (e.g., those shows that were cancelled after one broadcast, such as "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You%27re_in_the_Picture_06c2.html" title="You're in the Picture">You're in the Picture</a>," which is verifiable), but definitely not general failures. The inclusion of general failures made this article a flop, IMO!&#160;;-) [[<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriguy52748_613a.html" title="User:Briguy52748">Briguy52748</a> 14:01, 9 February 2007 (UTC)]] (P.S., sorry for the rant, but had to explain everything).</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The nominator misunderstood the purpose of the list. It was not to list everyone who has 3 names. The persons are those who almost always are referred to by all three names, such that if you omitted the middle name most people would have no idea who you were referring to. Martin King? George Carver? John Booth? Robert Stevenson? William Bryan? Who? The list is a maintainable and defined one.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Dmz5. The two cases he cites there are great examples of people who are certainly "known by three names", but not necessarily "most commonly known by three names" (outside of the States, Thomas Edison's middle name isn't overly well-known). Additionally, mention should be made of the fact that the list doesn't - at least not in its current form - distinguish between those who are known by three names because that's the way they insist(ed) on being called and those who are known by three names because that was inflicted upon them (Lee Harvey Oswald is one example, I believe). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 06:03, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Even if you assume the information is potentially interesting or useful, the list suffers from problems of verification and subjectivity. It is likely a subjective call and original research deciding whether a person is known by three names or two. How do you handle people that have been called both with three names and two names by different sources? There are also probably no reliable sources you can reference that say "so and so is known by most people by three names". Thus even if the information has potential to be useful somehow, it still needs to be deleted due to verification and subjectivity. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:02, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is simply a fun list of famous people commonly (not statistically) called by three names. Many of these people would seem unfamiliar without their middle name included. Obviously there will be disagreement, but this list seems valid enough to stay --Skullknick069 00:29, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Being "fun" isn't a means of making something encyclopedic. Additionally, there's a serious risk of bias (in that, as I've previously indicated, Edison's middle name is only really used in some parts of the world). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 04:09, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the criterion as stated isn't helpful, because what is obvious to one person isn't clear to another. To me, two of the initial examples are as identifiable with or without.

<li><b>Comment</b> This article might have been hastily prepared. The evolution of the Brantford music scene in the "Punk Rock" genre is a progressive one that starts at 1980 and slowly cumulated into people starting an arts venue much later (2002), now known as The Ford Plant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ford_plant" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ford_plant" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> which has gained Canadian national recognition in the "indie rock" genre. Sources on validity of this are limited. The majority of the links are located on one Geocities site, the validity of the author of the site seems researched with printed local sources but much seems to be first hand experience. The individual bands might be notable. The call on "hint at spam" might not be true. Brantford is a town of 90000. This might be the only online source of information on this subject. The article might develop into something more substantial. A title change might be appropriate, "Brantford Punk Music Scene" *<b>Delete</b> if the phenomenon has existed since 1980 and is notable, there would be references. 26 years is long enough time for references to accrue.-<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMsHyde_99ac.html" title="User:MsHyde">MsHyde</a> 18:30, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Wow, what's the deal around here? We have sources, we have newspaper articles, we have enough to make this an interesting article (we will gather and contribute them). Did "Dhartung" follow any of those links to investigate the material on the sites before he dismissed them based on the domain that hosts them (geocities, myspace)? I would be surprised if they did. How can you practice this dismissiveness inside wikipedia, when wikipedia itself suffers such snobbery in virtually every academic and information institution in the world? What's the point of rushing to delete it? It is an article about a community, we'd like the chance to let the community members build it up. Is there no room for a gestation period on wikipedia? Why is there such a rush to kill this article? It is obviously not a prank, it is not offensive, it is not plagerized, it is clearly an earnest effort to tell a story. It is a legitimate subject, it is an article made for wikipedia, in that the subject exists in the memories of a disparate bunch who left the economically depressed city. If this original article doesn't stand, then what is the benefit to (or for that matter of) wikipedia? If you're in such a hurry to kill the story of kids who tried to make some art in the midst of a bleak situation (a situation that still stands, and new groups of kids still are fighting the fight) then who's stories should be told? Stories well documented, stories better and more legitamately documented in actual academic/journalistic sources? Wiki will never be 'legitimate' to those people, so why not allow it to fill the void they leave? 27 years is a long time, and a lot of people to gather and a lot of stories to tell. It isn't a well-told narrative we are copying and pasting like so much on wikipedia, it is an original story being compiled and told here for the first time. It isn't so easy to create a Historical narrative from primary sources as it is for you people (would-be gatekeepers) to kill it. Also, what is wrong with "first hand experiences"? In History such things are Primary Sources and are considered almost sacred (wiki "Primary Sources" or Leopold von Ranke for an education). For you to dismiss them, wikimandate or not, undermines wikipedia's potential and (wikimandate or not) purpose as a democratic source of information open to all perspectives and voices regardless of traditional 'standards'. It is easy to dismiss a budding article like this, why not let it grow? That is the point of wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> This article should be kept. There is valid research going on with the subject. There is a large amount of valid documentation on it outside the Internet. The Brant Museum and Archives does have a holding of part of this information on the Punk Rock scene. The sign of "Second Wave" is currently stored in their collection, and is an excellent example of a business that tried to survive in a cities economic depression during the mid 1990's. The Brant Museum and Archives is a valid museum that has been gathering the culture of the community of Brant County since 1908, in all its forms. All this information can be verified by museum staff, and is currently being researched by museum staff. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.93.199.164_ba10.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.93.199.164">65.93.199.164</a> (talk) 17:31, 7 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>One very important thing to consider before I give the links: this is not a vote, this is an attempt to build consensus. Now then, what you might refer to is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">this link</a> for verifiability guidelines, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">this link</a> for notability guidelines, and go <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">here</a> for good guidelines on what are considered reliable sources. In the case of punk music scenery... I'd <i>almost</i> be inclined to pull out <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> from my hat for a reference. Now that aside, if you're working on your masters, I'd suggest this: take the content, put it in your userpage somewhere (you do have an account, don't you?). Being you have that degree coming up, I don't know what time constraints you have - but currently, the way this stands, unless we can't build a concensus, it has roughly three days. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 06:35, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not always, but in the case of the local publications...well, frankly, I for one am not going to travel to Brantford, ON, Canada to verify the information - so yes, it does need to be on the 'net in one form or another.

<p>Ok, this is obviously a fake Pokémon, but that's not the main reason I'm putting this up for deletion - a fake Pokémon could in theory, be notable. The reason is that it fails <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>: <b>"Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day"</b>. After searching Google for a bit, it became clear that "Hifishi" is one of the fakes from the "PokéGods" craze a few years back (remember "MewThree"?) - a craze that consisted entirely of...kids making things up in school one day, and telling their gullible friends in order to trick them into glitching up their games. "Hifishi" wasn't even that notable as far as these fakes went, and to top it all off, the page treats "Hifishi" not as a fake, but as an "unused Pokémon" (although it does say that the most common code is fake).

<p>Wholly unsuited to Wikipedia: While I suppose that the bare listing of facts and laying them side-by-side is not in itself "<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original reseach</a>" it certainly feels that way. No <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> are cited "comparing" these IRC entities. the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">"Not a weblist"</a> mantra appears to be egregiously violated by the massive number of external links to other-wise unnotable IRC entities. The use of tables, while lovely and indicative of someone slaving over this, also means that it's completely n00b-a-phobic as well. This may be good information, and may belong somewhere, but I'm unconvinced it belongs here.

<li><b>Keep.</b> This article was started due to the deficit of reliable <i>unbiased</i> sources comparing IRCds unaffiliated with individual products or projects. Sources are provided in the form of external links to those IRC entities homepages - admittedly it may be more blunt to link directly to source repositories or file downloads. I am confused as to how this article could be described as a weblist with the bulk of it being devoted to "laying facts side-by-side".<br />
Original research, as I understand in Wikipedia, does not include gathering information provided by product websites, independent reviews, usage of services utilising the software or examining publicly available source code and documentation. It especially does not cover criteria considered important to developers and users familiar with a subject that can and will be added to and adjusted over time - if you consider yourself to be an expert on the subject why not try adding important criteria? Should <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_wiki_software.html" title="Comparison of wiki software">Comparison of wiki software</a> likewise be deleted because it contains a huge amount of external links, a set of criteria that may not be obviously important to one not familiar with the subject and may attract links and spam? As for unverifiable: one need only connect to an IRC network utilising the software, or better yet: download/purchase a copy of the software to install and try, or read through the source code (if available), that is assuming you are unhappy with project/product website feature lists or questioning the authors - this applies to any article about a piece of software. -- Southen 18:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_wiki_software.html" title="Comparison of wiki software">Comparison of wiki software</a> is an interesting example, because each entry is clearly notable (at least until consensus says otherwise) by virtue of the fact that it has an article. If you were to apply the same logic to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_IRCds_0e45.html" title="Comparison of IRCds">Comparison of IRCds</a> you'd be left comparing not very much to not very much. Perhaps some of the IRCDs there don't have articles but should, or perhaps they do and I can't find them (they're not wikilinked, so I assume not anyway), but either way, I still don't see how the majority of those are notable in any way. Regarding the original research point, the information gathered may well come from elsewhere (although I doubt if anywhere but <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">primary sources</a>, because the entries are mostly non-notable), but I maintain that the way it is compiled and gathered (e.g. the choice of what features to list) constitutes original research. <a href="../../../c/i/a/User%7ECiaranG_a34c.html" title="User:CiaranG">CiaranG</a> 21:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The phrase "deficit of reliable [...] sources" when used as the justification for creating an article really should be setting off some mental alarm bells, shouldn't it? - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> 02:42, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, it would set off mental alarm bells, when taken out of context, but as southen has stated it is not a deficit of reliable sources of information regarding any of the specific entries, its a deficit of reliable comparisons. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielharmsworth_e043.html" title="User:Danielharmsworth">Danielharmsworth</a> 04:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I hate to labour an obvious point, in particular since I say it in the nomination, but this article is <i><b>Comparison</b> of IRCds</i>. If there ae not reliable sources on comparisons, than this article can't exist. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> 01:12, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Reliable sources on comparisons? lets have a look at what is is for a moment, a presentation of facts about each individual entry laid out in a manner as to allow a reader to quickly see what features are available on each IRCd and which features are not as compared to other IRCd's, now given this, what need is there to have other reliable comparisons when there are no new facts introduced or any determinations made by arranging the information into this specific structure. Now i do agree that the features compared should be determined through consensus to avoid any bias. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielharmsworth_e043.html" title="User:Danielharmsworth">Danielharmsworth</a> 02:33, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't believe we need reliable sources that actually compare these subjects in order to retain this article. A (comprehensive) listing of details like this is appropriate as long as the presentation does not implicitly or explicitly show an unsourced relationship between the subjects. This is fundamentally different than something like Dead Playboy Playmates, as that article is 1) not comprehensive of all the comparable details of Playboy Playmates, 2) presents a significant amount of speculative and unsourced information, and 3) implies there is some sort of relationship between the deaths of Playboy Playmates. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 03:01, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Curious about Chantelle Paige? From this article you will learn that "the makeup she use" is Chanel. Her favorite facial feature is her eyelashes. Her name "literally means song" and "Her first love has always been music." Her high school GPA was 4.1. Fluff resume piece for a subject who may faintly meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, but there are absolutely zero third-party sources. The entire article ("Chantelle enjoys helping people") is sourced by her two myspace.com pages, her official website, and her profile at a site called "CHERRY TAP." I had placed the "likeresume" tag on this article, but it was removed by an IP editor whose only edits were to this article, claiming that the article was "fully and well written." <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 06:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is a mess, reads like a drug-abusers' manual, and in my opinion has no place in Wikipedia. The entire article is basically a reworded copy of the DXM Faq available at the "Vaults of Erowid" website, <a href="http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_faq.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_faq.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_faq.shtml</a>.

In 2004, the article apparently <a href="../../../n/o/n/Talk%7ENon-medical_use_of_dextromethorphan_ae62.html#Cleanup." title="Talk:Non-medical use of dextromethorphan">had an alarmist tone</a>, which appears to have been corrected. The pendulum apparently has now swung the other way. However, I don't see inherent problems with the topic itself at all, balance in the article can be brought with some cleanup effort. There seems to be plenty of valuable information on this page still, and since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>, anti-social topics should not be banned as long as the big three content policies (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>) are followed.

<dd>Though some parts are well written, this article reads much more like a "how to" guide for abuse than an encyclopedia article on the history of a specific substance non-medical usage.

<dd><b>Now from me</b>: Almost the entire article is originally sourced or sourced from the DXM Faq at Erowid, which although it is widely used due to the lack of reputable information elsewhere on the topic, is still arguably not a reputable source in itself. Should the article be kept I would continue to help clean it up as I've already started doing, however I still question its merit as a standalone article. The actual reputable information that doesn't consist of original slang can be sufficiently represented in the "Recreational use" subsection of the <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html" title="Dextromethorphan">Dextromethorphan</a> main article. Since the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-medical_use_of_dextromethorphan.html" title="Non-medical use of dextromethorphan">Non-medical use of dextromethorphan</a> article is basically just a rehash of the DXM Faq at Erowid, an external link to that site would be a better conformance to Wikipedia's "no original research" policy and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style" rel="nofollow">quality standards</a>, while still providing that external information to those who would like to judge its reputability for themselves. The content's merit as "encyclopedic content" is very questionable. Equazcion 16:45, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>The reasons for deleting the article exceed the simple low quality of its content</b>, although I haven't properly stated that. Cleaning up the article will only produce a copy of the <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html" title="Dextromethorphan">Dextromethorphan</a> recreational use section. It simply isn't warranted to have two articles that describe a single drug. Although the LSD article may contain similar information on abuse (a point stated above), there is still only one article, rather than one describing the medical use and one describing the recreational use. If the non-medical article were stripped down to only valid, verifiable data, and rewritten so as not to be a "how-to" on abuse, what's left would be information that is already contained in the existing "Recreational use" section of the main <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html" title="Dextromethorphan">Dextromethorphan</a> article. Even the recreational information in the <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html" title="Dextromethorphan">Dextromethorphan</a> article is largely unsourced, although I feel much of it is worthy of being left in since it is largely common knowledge, and its lack of reliable sources is only due to its lack of proper public studies. In other words, clean up the non-medical use article, and you'll be left with the dextromethorphan article's "recreational use" section. A separate article for that purpose is simply redundant, and does nothing more than create a dumping ground for tips on abuse and more unverified information.

<li>My earlier OR claim was unfounded; the article carries numerous links to apparently-reliable sources. Erowid, though far from ideal, could be thought of as a reliable source for reasons that are out of scope for this discussion. "Bad writing" ranges from inappropriate use of SI abbreviations ("mgs") to comparisons with other illegal drugs that are probably outside of the average reader's sphere of knowledge. I have some free time tomorrow to change this article's tone a bit, assuming someone else doesn't beat me to it. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlakeloaf_bedc.html" title="User:Flakeloaf">Flakeloaf</a> 23:31, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've added a few 'Citation Needed' tags and will continue to do so. Take a look through the article to find them as those are examples of specific complaints. In response to Erowid being a reliable source, Erowid itself is a collection of articles written by the community and sometimes cited with reliable sources. However the specific article we're talking about is not Erowid but the DXM Faq written by William White, which originally had nothing to do with Erowid; it is just featured there now, among other places on the web. Much of White's research, while it may make sense, is based largely on original experiences reported in by people who emailed him their stories or posted on forum message boards. No one even knows who William White is, what his credentials are (if any), or even if that is his real name. I admit the lack of genuine legitimate studies in this field makes the task of separating reliable from unreliable information very ambiguous. However without reliable sources, the encyclopedic content drawn from the DXM Faq should be very limited, and again, I think what's in the main <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html" title="Dextromethorphan">dextromethorphan</a> article does that job already. I've been reading through the non-medical use article, and fixing it would mean rewriting it to basically look like the dextromethorphan article. The history section is perhaps the only significant thing this article adds, so maybe if everything else were eliminated we could re-title the article "History of recreational DXM use" and save it for that sole purpose.

There is a total of ONE citation in the entire <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html#Recreational_use" title="Dextromethorphan">Recreational use section of the Dextromethorphan article</a>, so it seems to qualify as OR, whereas this cite is very well referenced. <a href="../../../j/o/l/User%7EJolb_9efd.html" title="User:Jolb">Jolb</a> 01:19, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>I've removed the cleanup tag</b> as the article's quality has seen a vast improvement in the past couple of days. If the prospect of having the article deleted served as motivation for its improvement then it has served its purpose. I admit I'm not sure where that leaves us. I still feel merging is an option, as is making the article purely for the purpose of the history of recreational use, since the non-medical use's history section is still the main significant contribution that article serves. However as I see it, leaving the main DXM article as is, while simultaneously keeping the non-medical use article as a source of expanded recreational information, would be fine at this point. Please take a look through the 'newly renovated' <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-medical_use_of_dextromethorphan.html" title="Non-medical use of dextromethorphan">Non-medical use of dextromethorphan</a> and post your opinions on what should be done.

<li><b>Merge and Redirect</b> It <i>is</i> well-referenced but the article, at it's essence, is about the drug (without the drug, there could be no non-medical use). The info regarding use of the drug, regardless of prescription, should properly be on the page of said drug.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">William Thweatt</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamThweatt_8c60.html" title="User talk:WilliamThweatt">Talk</a></sup> | <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WilliamThweatt_f34f.html" title="Special:Contributions/WilliamThweatt">Contribs</a></sup> 01:24, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>The argument against merging</b> is that it would make the main DXM article too long. As it stands now, if the non-medical article were merged into the medical article, it would make the medical article contain more recreational content than medical content. However, after the redundant information between the two articles is eliminated, there wouldn't be much left to merge aside from that History section; hence my suggestion to make the Non-medical article for historical info only, changing its name to "History of recreational DXM use," and leave the other scientific recreational info in the main DXM article.

<li>My argument is that because the <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html#Recreational_use" title="Dextromethorphan">Recreational Use</a> section of <i>Dextromethorphan</i> is so poorly written and poorly referenced, that section should be cut down. People will then click the "main article" link in that section and be directed to <i>Non-medical use of dextromethorphan</i>, which is more thorough, referenced more thoroughly (and therefore less OR), and more NPOV. <a href="../../../j/o/l/User%7EJolb_9efd.html" title="User:Jolb">Jolb</a> 03:14, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The question of which to keep shouldn't regard the content itself but instead the merit of having two separate articles in the first place. Recreational use of a drug traditionally falls under the main article for that drug and not to a separate article. The history here may merit a separate article, but otherwise, there is no reason to have a separate article just to describe recreational use. Furthermore I don't think the <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html#Recreational_use" title="Dextromethorphan">Recreational Use</a> section of <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dextromethorphan.html" title="Dextromethorphan">Dextromethorphan</a> is poorly written or poorly referenced. Even if both were true, it would be in the same state as the Non-medical article was just a couple of days ago, and similar corrections could be made there as they were here (and as far as references I've already done much of that). If it still needs additional references then please add appropriate cn tags, as was done for the Non-medical article before. The argument for keeping the Non-medical article was that a lack of references and poor writing is no reason for deleting an article, and the same holds true with the recreational section of the DXM article. Given the choice between fixing the recreational portion of the DXM article or simply eliminating it in favor of an outside article in order to correct the problem of it being poorly written/referenced, it makes much more sense to simply correct the recreational use section of the DXM article. There just isn't a need for an entire separate article about something that would normally be a section of another article.Equazcion 03:33, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Although, again, no merge at all would also be fine. Both could be kept, with the Non-medical use article as a source of expanded information on recreational use, for those who are interested, as it basically is currently. Now that the article has been fixed up I think that would be a legitimate option. Equazcion 03:48, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Point.</b> In order to point out how wrongheaded articles such as the "Mel Gibson DUI incident" and the "Michael Richards Laugh Factory incident" are, consider whether there should now be a Wikipedia article on the "<a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Nowak_b29a.html" title="Lisa Nowak">Lisa Nowak</a> attempted kidnapping incident." Of course there should <b>not</b> be any such article. But her incident is receiving a lot of news coverage.

She too has celebrity status. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 16:34, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, there <b>should</b> be such an article on the Nowak incident.

The reason he is notable enough to be in Wikipedia in the first place is that he has accomplished a lot and, of course, those accomplishments are well documented in verifiable, responsibly published material. You point out the quantity of material in this article -- but that is a big part of the problem. Wikipedia's guidelines for biographies of living people clearly say that we don't go overboard heaping negative implications on the subject of an article. This is a thoroughly negative article. It is about drunk driving and antisemitism. This can and probably should be noted in a general article about <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_7385.html" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>. But it is entirely improper (according to Wikipedia guidelines on biographies of living people) to focus on negativity to the exclusion of all other ingredients of a positive nature in a person's life.

<li><b>Delete</b> "Well-sourced" (or "well-referenced") is not an argument to keep this article; it can and should be just as well-sourced in one article under Mel Gibson. "Too much" information is too much information whether in this article or in the Mel Gibson article; judicious trimming back would serve either article well. Mel Gibson was driving drunk. Mel Gibson muttered antisemitic statements. That is not the subject for a stand alone encyclopedia article. The correct perspective is to see the "Mel Gibson DUI incident" in the context of the life of Mel Gibson.

<li>Mel Gibson has hidden his true nature from the public his whole life. This incident fundamentally alters how the public views him. It changes the context of what is really known about his life.

<li><b>Point.</b> In point of fact Mel Gibson has long been considered by some to have antisemitic tendencies. But even if that were not so, I don't think biographies of living people should receive branch articles when some editors feel the subject of the article has reached a significantly different stage of life. I think we still have to respect the biological integrity of one person's life. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 17:06, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Point.</b> I think the primary questions involve context and perspective. Those are the things that shift whether the article receives it's own heading or whether the article is seen under the heading of an article on Mel Gibson. The incident written in this article does not stand alone, apart from Mel Gibson. It is firmly attached to the life of Mel Gibson. That is the proper heading. We should see this incident from the perspective of the life of Mel Gibson. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 21:27, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mel Gibson is the central character in the event, but that does <i>not</i> mean that the event isn't notable enough on its own to warrant its own article. As an analogy, the article <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_755d.html" title="John F. Kennedy assassination">John F. Kennedy assassination</a> is clearly an article that is squarely centered on John F. Kennedy (or, if you prefer, Lee Harvey Oswald). However clearly that doesn't necessarilly imply that the article about the <i>event</i> needs to be merged with the articles about the people associated with the event. I doubt anyone is seriously looking to merge that article into the JFK main article, for example.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As another example, consider this from a reader's perspective. It certainly seems possible, I think, that a reader will be interested in searching for information about this incident without having much interest in reading about Mel Gibson himself or even caring much about Mel Gibson's career or biography. Since the amount of information about this <i>event</i> is large enough that it can fill its own article page, by splitting it off into a subarticle you are allowing readers to focus on reading about <i>just</i> the event without having to sift through everything else associated with Mel Gibson in his main article.</dd>
<dd>Thus I disagree with the assertion that an otherwise well sourced and sufficiently large article about an event that received extended international media coverage needs to be deleted, nor do I find any part of policy or in the guidelines that suggests it. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:23, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Point.</b> Dugwiki -- The reader would not have to "sift through everything else" to find information about the DUI incident in the main article because it would all be found in one area. For what reason would the facts of that incident not be in contiguous paragraphs within the main article on Mel Gibson? The assassination of John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald does not compare with Mel Gibson's drunken driving incident, even with the utterances of antisemitic sentiments. It is an incident of a totally different order. One is the president of the United States. The other is not. One is still alive. The other's life is not over. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 00:12, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Counterpoint</b> Bus Stop - I was not implying DUI = Assassination. I was saying that by your prior reasoning we shouldn't have the JFK assassination article either. I see no problem, though, either in policy or guidelines, with seperating a large verified section regarding a notable event of a main article into a subarticle when the subarticle contains sufficient verifiable references. In the case when there is enough seperate published verifiable information about an event that it can fill its own article in length, and the incident appears to have received multiple notable coverage, then it makes sense to split that incident off as a subarticle from the person's main article. So unless you're claiming that this article would comfortably fit in the Mel Gibson article, I remain unconvinced there is a non-<a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a> reason to delete. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:03, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> specifically discourages the creation of articles on current events which may eventually become obsolete. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a supplement to the National Enquirer. Thousands of people are arrested for DUI every year, and I would suspect that many of them get upset and say inappropriate things to the arresting officers. There is nothing NOTABLE about this type of incident. The only thing which is notable in this event is <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_7385.html" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>. By giving this incident its own seperate article, Wikipedia is giving an undue amount of WEIGHT to a negative incident in this living person's life, which runs contrary to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Unlike other celebrity bios on Wikipedia which frequently contain ONE "Controversy" section; Gibson's bio is over run with sections which seem to push the POV that he is a homophobe, a racist, anti-semetic,a drug addict and an alcoholic. As IF that isn't bad enough - there is ALSO this free-standing article, which has provided an additional platform for editors to label him an anti-semite. The excessive amount of space that Wikipedia has dedicated to this type of material about this LIVING PERSON constitutes attempted defamation of character in my opinion. Clearly, more than 75% of Wikipedia's editorial "space" dedicated to Mel Gibson paints him in a very negative light and, therefore, cannot be considered NUETRAL and OBJECTIVE.

<li>To reply, WP:NOT only talks about not writing <i>opinions</i> on current affiars that might quickly become obsolete. The policy, however, does <i>not</i> talk about the actual information and facts of a news event becoming obsolete. So while you shouldn't write an opinion piece about whether or not Mel Gibson behaved badly, for example, you <i>can</i> write an article about a news event involving Mel Gibson provided it has sufficient sourcing and is large enough and has enough detail to warrant being split from the main article. I also do not agree with the assertion that the article's existence in principle somehow "gives undue weight" to a possible negative aspect of Mel Gibson's character. So long as the article refers to the actual facts of the event, as reported by verifiable published sources, and doesn't delve into personal editorial opinion, there is no issue here in regards to undue negative impact. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:15, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you are missing my point. The article should not have been created in the first place and it has become a platform for opinions, including those of a blogger for goodness sake! Of course, the article is detailed and well-sourced, I'm sure there has been considerable edit warring in its creation. I think Wikipedia should be steering clear of this type of article in general. It is not encyclopedic material. Thousands of people are arrested for DUI each year, why not write articles about them? Surely, there are reliable sources to be found in local newspapers. Just because there are sources to be found, it doesn't make the incident worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia. Is this <i>current event</i> continuing to receive media attention? No, it isn't, because it doesn't have lasting significance. Why doesn't Wikipedia have a Zsa Zsa Gabor slap incident article? Or a Brandy car accident incident? By singling out this one celebrity in particular Wikipedia is demonstrating an editorial BIAS against him. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 23:07, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Point.</b> I think that just judging by two articles of this sort, namely the Michael Richards article and the Mel Gibson article, it seems to me that the reason for both of those articles as separate, "breakaway" articles, to focus on one negative incident, is to heap a special dose of shame on these people. I feel that articles of this sort are motivated, perhaps unconsciously, by deeply held sentiments concerning what is right and what is wrong. I can't prove that. But I am cynical of alternate explanations. Many people are outraged by the things said by Michael Richards and Mel Gibson about certain groups within the larger society. It is not too far fetched a hypothesis that people are motivated to set things right by highlighting such shameful speech in a separate article. But Wikipedia should resist this. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 00:35, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

To answer this question is to be completely honest about what motivated the creation of this stand alone article in the first place. My question hits at the very core of this matter. The article is not <i>about</i> someone being arrested for DUI, it is an excuse for editors to elaborate on the theme that Gibson is a racist. By giving undue weight to such material, Wikipedia is not only defaming Gibson's character but aggrevating race relations by serving as a forum for debate among editors whereby individuals can be labelled racists. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 02:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

No, the content of his remarks is not significant. It's the fact that it gathered so much news coverage (multiple, non-trivial, over an extended period of time)! It doesn't matter if he called for the destruction of the UN or expressed a desire to be sent into space upon his death.

We should not be setting up billboards of shame. In most instances, what happens in a person's life should be seen in the context of that person's life, in my opinion. The assassination of John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald is an example of an <i>exception</i> to this. The difference (among others) is that John F. Kennedy is a figure of far greater prominence than Mel Gibson. We don't set up freestanding articles to showcase an incident despite the fact that we feel that the behavior depicted is deserving of condemnation. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 16:42, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you for your reasoned and specific arguments (I am a bit frustrated over the many "delete - awful article" and "keep - perfect article" comments that should up on AfD). In response to your comment: this is a billboard of shame <i>only</i> if it is NPOV (making claims without sourcing or making unbalanced claims). You are making a value-judgment (which I share) that anti-Semitism is a bad thing, but such value-judgments are not relevant to whether content is encyclopedic (which means passing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>). Although I agree that JFK is a more prominent figure than Gibson, that is still a value-judgment which others may or may not share. I personally like Mel Gibson as an actor and director (I can't say as a person, because I don't know him as a person). You say that "we feel that the behavior depicted is deserving of condemnation", but it is quite likely that someone who is an anti-Semite contributed to this article and/or thinks it should be kept. It shouldn't matter what we feel (although I'm realist enough to admit that it does) as long as the subject passes <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>.

However, that doesn't mean it's just being used to call him a racist. People find the incident notable because they connect it to racism. But that's their business; Wikipedia only has the article because people find the incident notable, and should not say "some people find this article notable for an unacceptable reason".

<li><b>Point.</b> <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> It is not just <i>"their business."</i> Wikipedia is highlighting a "racist" incident. It is Wikipedia's responsibility to be balanced in reporting this. Having an unnecessary article to highlight this is tantamount to erecting a billboard for this purpose. It's purpose is to heap more shame on the individual than the single article could accomplish. The reasoning that there is too much material on the DUI incident to fit into the main article is roundabout thinking. Such reasoning justifies not only putting unnecessary information into an article but also providing that unnecessary material with a special showcase in the form of a freestanding article about one unfortunate and shameful incident. That is vindictive. In my opinion it is a test of whether such material is worthy of inclusion on Wikipedia if it can fit logically into a general biography. Exceptions can be found for reasons such as prominence. But Mel Gibson is not as prominent as I would feel a person would need to be to warrant an article solely about a drunk driving incident. Indeed the editors should be wrestling with how to include this DUI incident into a generalized Mel Gibson article. They should not be affording themselves the luxury of going on endlessly, as they are prone to do in an article such as this one. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 13:31, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

As <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> states "...the primary notability criterion is a way to determine whether 'the world' has judged a topic to be notable." When there are multiple published works primarily about a topic, "the world" deemed that topic notable whether we think its sad or not.

<li><b>Counterpoint</b> I am going to disagree and say that this is not a deliberate attempt at shaming. It is, rather, a deliberate attempt to organize a large amount of information about a noteworthy event into a single article. The article's purpose is not to defame or shame Mel Gibson, but to report the facts of the event in an encyclopedic form.

<li>GassyGuy is correct. You are confusing news worthiness with notability. This event has no lasting significance. Although there will be more biographies published about Gibson, I sincerely doubt that any books will be written on the DUI incident. Regardless, no author would dedicate 75% of a biography on Gibson to the incident. Why should Wikipedia? The incident has no lasting notability or impact on anyone other than Gibson, possibly, and does not belong as a seperate article in any legitimate encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 07:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you're really reaching. If I were to follow your logic, we should create a seperate article on the Paris Exposed.com story or any other news item that receives global news coverage, based upon your interpretation of notability. I appreciate your honesty in saying that you see it as a case of modern anti-semitism. I think, however, that you defeat your own argument with your candor. Wikipedia reports facts. It is not a repository for cataloging the racial opinions of the well known. It is a misuse of Wikipedia, for ethnic groups to use it as a tool to label and catalogue racists and anti- semites. Potential damage and defamation to the character of living people outweighs any legitimate "need" for this sort of article. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 08:32, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not sure what sort of "damage" you're talking about here. If the article is objectively stating the verifiable published facts, then it is not a tool for slander or libel. <i>If</i> there is a specific part of the article that you feel is original research or original editorial opinion, then feel free to dispute or remove that part of the article.

When an article is very well sourced following strict <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> guidelines such as this one is, there is nothing slanderous.

This incident is very important in the life of Mel Gibson, and perhaps in the life of people especially liking or resenting him. As for the world at large, it is just one of millions of similar accidents happening every day, affecting just the life of the people involved.

This would be plain wrong, of course. I am just saying that by some kind of optical illusion due to living here and now we might tend to consider as notable events which are not, and in my opinion this is the case for the DUI incident. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 10:27, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

But Mel Gibson already has a page devoted to his life. He is not so prominent, nor is this incident so prominent, to warrant a separate article devoted to it. <b>His DUI incident is properly seen in the context of his life, where his accomplishments can balance his missteps.</b> That, in my opinion, is consistent with our intention of maintaining a neutral point of view -- not by providing a less than flattering incident with it's own freestanding article. Editors need to debate what is worthy of inclusion and what should be discarded, on the page that is the article about Mel Gibson. In my opinion this freestanding article gives editors the green light to include too much. Wikipedia editors should be disciplined enough to write a concise article about Mel Gibson that covers the DUI incident with the inclusion of appropriate information. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 17:25, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To say that "the current proposal is intended to specifically address unencyclopedic news items such as this one" seems like trying to create a guideline based on a prior personal (subjective) conception of what is and is not "encyclopedic". <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> already establish which articles are and are not encyclopedic, allowing <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EConsensus_8a50.html" title="WP:Consensus">WP:Consensus</a> to make a final decision in controversial cases. If this article is "<i>not</i> covered by <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>", as you note, then that means it <i>is</i> by default encyclopedic. I support the idea of creating a specific notability guideline for news items, but I do not favor one that automatically assumes exclusion to be the default--I think this is an elitist notion that goes against the principles on which WP operates (my suggestion for an additional criterion is in the "Please consider the following (changes)" section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28news%29_c1de.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (news)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (news)</a>--if you are willing to read it, as it is a bit lengthy, I would appreciate your comments). If an article passes the 5 policies and guidelines listed above, the burden of proof is on those who want to eliminate the article. If it does not, the burden of proof is on those who wish to keep the article. Noting that, a merger is still an acceptable solution for me as long as significant (in quality, not quantity) is not lost--of course, in this case I think it would be prudent to discuss it on the talk page. Also, a merger does not have to be full-content, it can be selective (if a full-content merge was performed, the DUI incident would overwhelm Gibson's biography).

<li><b>Point.</b> It is improper to lift one incident from Mel Gibson's life and display it for the world to see. This is an abuse of Wikipedia. The facts in the "Mel Gibson DUI incident" article may be notable, but the article is not notable. It is not the province of Wikipedia to hold people up for special shame; that is the opposite of neutral point of view, and it is an abuse of the power vested in the hands of the editors of Wikipedia. The incident is far too inconsequential to deserve an article of it's own. If the editors lack the discipline to hack the facts down to a form that reflects the DUI incident's proportional relationship to the entire lifetime of Mel Gibson, that is a separate and different problem. But the article is primarily improper. The Mel Gibson article already covers the DUI incident. Therefore this article is redundant, and should be deleted. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 08:56, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Counter-Point</b>. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a>, the media lifted this "one incident from Mel Gibson's life and display[ed] it for the world to see" before this article was created at WP. This article is simply a response to the great volume of media coverage. You say that "It is not the province of Wikipedia to hold people up for special shame", yet you are making a prior subjective judgment that what he did was shameful (I agree, but that is irrelevant). The article does not condemn Gibson--it only notes the facts as they occurred. If you wish to see a merger of this article into <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_7385.html" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>, then by all means go ahead and propose it with {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergeto_cea0.html" title="Template:Mergeto">mergeto</a>}}.

They are fully frowned upon by most people. With qualifications, these behaviors are unlawful. You say that the article "does not condemn Gibson." But that is not necessary, since the focus of the article is 1) drunk driving and 2) antisemitism. Those behaviors, in and of themselves, are normally associated with condemnation. The DUI incident was already covered in the Mel Gibson article before this article was created. This article was created by a cut and paste from the Mel Gibson article. There are presently four paragraphs on the DUI incident in the Mel Gibson article. No article on Wikipedia is ever "finished." Whether this article is deleted or not the editors of the Mel Gibson article will continue modifying that article, including their coverage of the DUI incident. I see little reason to propose a merger of this article to the Mel Gibson article. I find this article offensive and I'm not inclined to start a process that will take longer than the delete process that is presently underway. The end result is the same, anyway. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 19:54, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b>. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a>, actually, any judgment that something is or is not shameful <i>is</i> subjective (even if most people consider them as such). Legality has no bearing on the shamefulness of an act (remember, slavery, apartheid, witch trials were all legal at some time in some place). You write that it is not necessary for the article to explicitly condemn Gibson as drunk driving and anti-Semitism are already condemnable. Notwithstanding my point above, I believe the murder of over 800,000 persons is a condemnable act, but <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwandan_Genocide_7e36.html" title="Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a> is and should be a separate article from <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Rwanda_b944.html" title="History of Rwanda">History of Rwanda</a>.

The fact that there was so much media coverage means this passes <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>--and thus, so long as the information is reported in an NOR and NPOV manner, it is encyclopedic.

A neo-Nazi might find the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> article offensive, but that is no reason to delete (and please don't interpret this as me accusing you of neo-Nazism).

As for the question you pose, I will answer somewhat long-windedly. The DWI incident certainly <i>can</i> be a separate article as it passes <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>. Whether it <i>ought to be</i> a separate article is a different judgment and involves personal preferences on style. If you do not think it ought to be a separate article (as you clearly do not), propose that it be merged to <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_7385.html" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>. I might support a merge if valid reasons (including stylistic ones such as user-friendliness, compactness, etc.) were given on the article's talk page. However, even if the article were to be turned into a redirect, AfD is not the appropriate venue for accomplishing this. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:24, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> - It does serve a purpose, but that is not to disparage Gibson. Rather, it is to document an incident which has generated a great amount of media coverage. The reason why I think the DWI incident article can stand on its own is this: the <i>incident</i> has received extended non-trivial coverage from multiple reliable sources. The news reports sourced in the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_DWI_incident_151f.html" title="Mel Gibson DWI incident">Mel Gibson DWI incident</a> article are primarily about the incident itself and not Mel Gibson himself (i.e., his life, family, history, etc.). Thus, the incident is by itself the <i>primary subject</i> of the news coverage. If Gibson was not a celebrity, then of course this would not have gotten this much coverage. That, however, is irrelevant as Gibson <i>is</i> a celebrity and the incident <i>has</i> received a great amount of news coverage. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:55, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

That is unremarkable. I don't think that supports a rationale for the existence of a separate article for a DWI incident. What you are describing is simply the normal way in which news reporting agencies cover news events. They do not write entire biographies.

What matters, as you have been pointing out, is notability. Notability qualifies the material to be on Wikipedia. It would be acceptable to extract certain facets of Mel Gibson's life for separate articles, but such extraction can not be indiscriminate. The discrimination called for, I think, concerns whether or not we find wider influence. The question one has to ask oneself is: Does this aspect of Mel Gibson's life have influence beyond his life? Mel Gibson's movies take on a life of their own. His acting role in a movie can be propounded upon because it takes on a life of it's own. It becomes a part of the popular culture. But drunk driving and the particular form of antisemitism displayed by Mel Gibson in the July 2006 incident, are core issues in his life. When one expounds upon those issues one runs the risk of distorting Mel Gibson's life. This is because these issues do not have wider influence beyond the core identity of Mel Gibson. And what I am of course further saying is that a separate article devoted to issues that do not have influence extending beyond the person's life certainly would have the tendency to place undue emphasis on those issues. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 20:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

As you have noted, one criterion (and in my opinion the superior criterion) is whether an event has influence beyond that person's life. Another criterion (inferior to the first but still valid) is whether it receives non-trivial coverage from multiple sources over an extended period of time, where such coverage discusses the individual primarily <i>in context of the event</i> (as opposed to in context of the person's life overall). As I have noted previously, I am not opposed to a selective merge if someone is willing to do it (whether through consensus or by being <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a>--although, in the latter case, I suspect the merge might be quickly reverted).

<li><b>Reply</b> Bus stop - I'm going to partially agree with you and say that, yes, the treatment of news event related articles is one of those "up for debate" areas that hasn't yet received strong consensus one way or another. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTNEWS_ff3e.html" title="WP:NOTNEWS">WP:NOTNEWS</a>, for example, is a current attempt at a proposed guideline to help editors deal with exactly this sort of debate on a broader level. Unfortunately, in the meantime, that still means we can't simply refer to WP:NOT#IINFO and say "well, I think it <i>should</i> apply to news events too, so it does." That's not how the policies work. The policy says "here are the areas where we have strong consensus", and intentionally leave open the question of whether other things should be added down the road. Perhaps this type of article should be discriminated against? Maybe, maybe not, but at the moment WP:NOT doesn't handle it. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:11, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

There already exists the Mel Gibson article. The question is not whether the material is sufficiently notable to deserve an article of it's own. The question is whether there should be an additional article covering similar material, but with a different emphasis. I say there is not. I find that the July 28, 2006 DWI incident, and the antisemitic comments, are all a part of Mel Gibson's life. To separate out that negative incident is to highlight it. The more recent article provides a showcase for that one incident. My argument is that it fits in with the entire life of Mel Gibson. To set up an article to focus on a negative incident is to give undue emphasis. I find that the recent DWI incident, including the utterances of antisemitic comments, has no further implications beyond those things which pertain only to Mel Gibson's life. Therefore I see no reason to project that incident out into the additional literary space of a separate article. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 18:18, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks, I know that bit, as everyone here. But of course it would have not been the subject etc. etc. if a notable person were not involved. On the other hand, and more to the point, every marriage, childbirth, injury etc. involving famous people is object yaddah yaddah: every newspaper, magazine and tv channel in the world covers it.

If the decision here is to keep, one must assume that anyone who has an article on this wiki and gets arrested for a similar charge should also get their own article. This is simply not someplace we want to go. If the article needs to be split, then a whole section. or two, should be split out and not just one incident. In the end, we really need to look at this from the position of editors writing an encyclopedia. Does an article of this size, or detailed coverage of a single incident really need to be here? I think not. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 03:12, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Please forgive me, because I know it's not the forum, but this is one thing that really irks me about Wikipedia - when people say to do something and don't actually do it. I'm guilty of that too, but seriously, if you contest a speedy deletion, be bold, put it on Afd yourself and don't wait for some depressed university student who can't fall asleep at 3:30 AM to do it for you five months later. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 08:24, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> First of all, he's a faculty member in computer graphics education, and this it is perfectly reasonable that he has his PhD in education. Second, he has written quite a number of articles in the standard professional computer science journals, and the article says so and names the journals. third , he has written 21 textbooks in his subject, and that is way more than the average by any standard. WP:PROF is just a guideline under development, but one of its standards --and any one is enough-- is that the professor has written two or book textbooks in the subject that have been adopted by two or more universities. When I saw the nature of his books, I knew checking them would be fun, and so it is. He's written what seem to be the standard books on Flash and related subjects, and I put into the article a few of the many places that have adopted them.</li>

<dd>As arguments go, "Who?" is presumably a shorthand for I_NEVERHEARDOFHIM, which is a confession of ignorance, not an argument. I wikified the article, too, and removed some of the many relatively minor awards--wikification was the only real problem.

<p>notability questioned; article a stub; to promote discussion <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 08:30, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To explain further, I came across this page on my ramblings, and noted that a previous editor recorded that they had cut the page down to a bare stub. I suspect that this means that, formerly, there was substantive text here, and while I could go for a revert, I would be unable to source myself. In the circumstances, I have brought it here, so that those who want the page <b>kept</b> can sort out what it needs to have on it, beyond the present somewhat "conspiracy theory" text there. <b>No Vote</b> -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 08:33, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep and close discussion.</b> For everyone involved, let me explain what's going on. On Feb. 2, 2007, the article under discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_E._Sabow&amp;oldid=105093930" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_E._Sabow&amp;oldid=105093930" rel="nofollow">was created as a stub</a> for a US marine who died in 1991. Fair enough. Then the original creator decided to add a whole essay about causes of his death, which you can read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_E._Sabow&amp;oldid=105838859" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_E._Sabow&amp;oldid=105838859" rel="nofollow">here</a>. An alert user tags the expanded article as POV, and another user reverts it back to a one-line stub. Then the original author added some new content again, and Simoncursitor nominated it for deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, let's all take a deep breath. It could be that this person fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and should be deleted; I have no evidence of that, so I'm not expressing an opinion. However, the nominator did not ask for the article to be deleted. He asked for a <i>discussion</i>. Afd is generally the wrong forum for discussions of this kind - that's what the article's talk page is for. If discussions on the talk page lead nowhere, go find an admin and leave a message asking for help. I can see from the nominator's edit history that he's fairly inexperienced, and most of his work is in the deletion sector. So he naturally assumed that this is where discussions take place. The fact is that discussion take place on many different pages in Wikipedia. I extend an offer to the nominator to discuss this further on my talk page if it might be helpful. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 08:56, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> — Notable television series, episode is inheritly notable. Consensus is episode articles are perfectly legitimate, nominator has been disruptive with canvassing, etc. I'd like to point out the discussion page the nominator quotes also states "Generally, articles on episodes of television should not be listed for AfD (unless they are completely unverifiable, original research, etc.)" – nor does it appear to be (completely) non-sourced, an episode articles <i>is</i> the source, the <i>primary source</i>, although yes, it does require secondary sources, that is, of course, not a valid criterion for deletion. Addendum: nominator states "Several supporters of these article have argued that these guidelines don't apply" - this is actually an <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argument_ad_ignorantium.html" title="Argument ad ignorantium">argument ad ignorantium</a>, no one has suggested they do not apply, just that you are not <i>totally</i> interpreting them correctly. <span style="font-style: Tahoma; font-size: 84%;"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></span> 16:09, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - this is an article on a TV series episode and it has already been estatblished that individual episodes of notable TV series are admissable. Any content issues can be resolved without deleting the whole article (i.e. if there are too many quotes or copyvio material, then delete <i>this material</i> and replace it with new, original text). The nominator will find that there are far more than 85 articles -- not to mention a Wikiproject -- that would have to be nominated for deletion of one feels episode articles are improper for Wikipedia. In which case, a better plan would be to lobby for a policy change, though I think <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> would apply. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:26, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> — It's a TV episode like many others. The "List of..." article couldn't have more than a short paragraph on each without being absurdly long. What's the original research involved?

WP has always accepted memberships in the 3 major national societies as intrinsically conferring notability,and for good reason.

<li>I am reposting my response here as it applies: Hi DGG: While "Wikipedia" may not have the "capability" to judge -- yet <b>knowledgeable editors</b> about the subject of rabbis, Jews and Judaism, do have this capabilty. If someone were to say that <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">the Earth is flat</a> or that there is <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_on_Mars_a50d.html" title="Life on Mars">life on Mars</a>, would you then say "oh well, Wikipedia does <i>not</i> have the capabilty to judge if the Earth is flat or round or oblong, or that there is or is not life on Mars"? Obvioulsy not! It would be the editors and writers, most known to their peers on Wikipedia, as having reliable knowledge about the subject at hand to venture and give forth either credibility or plausibity about that subject. If one were to follow the logic of your argument to its ultimate conclusion then NO article would <i>ever</i> be deleted from Wikipedia because, after all (using your argument) "Wikipedia does not have the capability of judging, or the ethical merit" of the subject/s -- which would then in effect mean that once editors write <i>anything</i> it cannot be nominated for deletion, 'cause after-all who are we mere mortals to judge articles on Wikipedia about anything. Finally may I say, the biggest rebuttal to your argument here is that Wikipedia assumes the exact opposite of what you argue, because in cases of doubt, there are in fact templates like {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert_3e75.html" title="Template:Expert">Expert</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert-subject_82ba.html" title="Template:Expert-subject">Expert-subject</a>}} that opnely request and admit: "This article or section is in need of attention from an <b>expert on the subject</b>...

<li>Shira: That is a very shallow and "based on technicalities" type of perspective. So any guy with a beard who looks like a Hasid and gathers around him a few dumb suckers can get to call himself a "Rebbe" (and to the world-at-large <i>all</i> the Hasidim look like "rabbis") and if that "Hasid/rabbi/Rebbe" was reported for crimes they are worthy of articles on Wikipedia on such ridiculously based arguments that his actions were reported over and over again in the media? So then, do we go and look up all the police <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blotter.html" title="Blotter">blotters</a> and the daily crimes section in local papers and if it involves someone who looks Hasidic, he thus <i>ergo</i> is turned into a "notable" and "verifiable" "rabbi" on Wikipedia 'cause Wikipedia has "magical rules" (like <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magical_thinking.html" title="Magical thinking">magical thinking</a>???) that can make "something out [a] nothing" (somewhat in a self-presumed God-like fashion, no?) I do wish we could all keep perspective in cases like this and not simply revert to spouting "the rules" when some good common sense should come first. Many people from all walks of life have verifiable information from multiple sources available yet they do not merit article/s on Wikipedia, just see the daily toll on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> to prove it.

<li>He is a notable and verifiable individual, nothing more. The article should definitely reflect that his claim to be a legitimate rabbi, run a legitimate Hassidic sect, etc. are disputed if this can be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliably sourced</a>) as well as other <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliably sourced</a> criticism of his activities. If the dispute is extensive, I would certainly agree the intro should be reworked and should not present him as being a rabbi etc. without referring to a dispute. But all this is about the content, not about whether the topic is encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 17:00, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Shira: He is only notable because the media latched onto him. There is nothing notable about him <i>per se</i> -- not as a "rabbi" not as a leader of Jews, not as anything, just a scumbag. There are literally thousands of legitimate and notable <a href="../../../s/h/t/Shtiebel.html" title="Shtiebel">shtiebel</a> <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebbe.html" title="Rebbe">Rebbes</a> with hundreds of congregants each yet there are no articles about them, nor should there be. Simply because someone has been written up in the papers for accused misdeeds does not make that person notable. Not every petty thief and pickpocket deserves articles merely because it's gotten into the papers and is available online in multiple articles and links. Wikipedia should not reflect a false sense of reality by misapplication of the "rules" Shira. Wikipedia should have article about a subject if and when that subject is truly notable in and of their fields. Helbrans is neither a "rebbe" nor is he anything. At most he maybe gets to be on something like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish-American_mobsters_f711.html" title="List of Jewish-American mobsters">List of Jewish-American mobsters</a>, and I don't think that Helbrans makes the cut for that either since he is small fry, and if that's your cup of tea, then it's a sad day for Wikipedia and lovers of knowldege. Finally, <b>Helbrans fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> since no-one writes "biographies" about nobodies</b>. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 12:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>While I couldn't agree with you more that "He is only notable because the media latched on to him." But unfortunately, that's the definition of notability Wikipedia has. Wikipedia's decision to use news media coverage as a criterion for notability produces just this result: A person or a band or a video game or a brand of chewing gum is notable because the media latches on, regardless of any intrinsic merit or value (or lack thereof) it may have. This may be unfortunate, but Wikipedia has thousands of articles on people and topics that are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiably</a> notable for what might seem to me to be no good reason. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 19:18, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't think WP has the capability of judging among the various Hasidic sects, or the ethical merit of their Rabbis. . <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:38, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hi DGG: While "Wikipedia" may not have the "capability" to judge -- yet <b>knowledgeable editors</b> about the subject of rabbis, Jews and Judaism, do have this capabilty. If someone were to say that <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">the Earth is flat</a> or that there is <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_on_Mars_a50d.html" title="Life on Mars">life on Mars</a>, would you then say "oh well, Wikipedia does <i>not</i> have the capabilty to judge if the Earth is flat or round or oblong, or that there is or is not life on Mars"? Obvioulsy not! It would be the editors and writers, most known to their peers on Wikipedia, as having reliable knowledge about the subject at hand to venture and give forth either credibility or plausibity about that subject. If one were to follow the logic of your argument to its ultimate conclusion then NO article would <i>ever</i> be deleted from Wikipedia because, after all (using your argument) "Wikipedia does not have the capability of judging, or the ethical merit" of the subject/s -- which would then in effect mean that once editors write <i>anything</i> it cannot be nominated for deletion, 'cause after-all who are we mere mortals to judge articles on Wikipedia about anything. Finally may I say, the biggest rebuttal to your argument here is that Wikipedia assumes the exact opposite of what you argue, because in cases of doubt, there are in fact templates like {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert_3e75.html" title="Template:Expert">Expert</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert-subject_82ba.html" title="Template:Expert-subject">Expert-subject</a>}} that opnely request and admit: "This article or section is in need of attention from an <b>expert on the subject</b>...

<li><b>Comment</b>. As a rule, a bus terminal is a pretty big building and far more fixed than a regular bus stop. I would place the notability of such subjects on par with that of a train station.

I cannot see that it is that easy to find sources either. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:18, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually, this is a very small shed/end-point for just two bus services. Also, as mentioned, it's hard to verify a 17-year defunct bus 'terminus'. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">mandel</a> 15:30, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Well, I'll admit that I know of only a few bus terminals, and they are major transportation hubs with as many passengers as a large railway station. (For the record, I am thinking about the central bus terminals in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bergen%2C_Norway_96c7.html" title="Bergen, Norway">Bergen, Norway</a> and <a href="../../../o/s/l/Oslo.html" title="Oslo">Oslo</a>) I am not too disturbed about things being "defunct", because that does not change the notability. A person notable enough for a biography does not become less notable after his/her death, and by the same token a bus terminal does not become less notable after its closure either.

<p>Olbermann's comments were originally included in both the <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Olbermann_9105.html" title="Keith Olbermann">Keith Olbermann</a> and <i><a href="../../../2/4/_/24_%28TV_series%29_afb7.html" title="24 (TV series)">24 (TV series)</a></i> articles and were almost immediately deleted after discussion on both articles' talk pages confirmed the comments were not notable enough to include. Since the comments aren't notable enough to include on the subjects' main pages, I believe they certainly aren't notable enough for a separate article. Even the title is ridiculous, as no attempt in the article is made to demonstrate that an actual "controversy" resulted from Olbermann's criticisms.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 15:00, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>* Portal Boy, there are several standards for determining notability in Wikipedia. Being a controversial user on web forums is not part of the notability criterion. The most general standard is "Are there reliable third party sources talking about this subject?" There's nothing about Languatron other than a bunch of web forum hits. <b><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V."><span style="color:purple">.</span><span style="color:green">V</span><span style="color:purple">.</span></a></b> <sub>[</sub><sub><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User_talk%7E.V._d46b.html" title="User talk:.V.">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_.V._ddc5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/.V.">Email</a>]</sub> 16:32, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello V, as I mentioned before, this article is no different than than the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supershadow.html" title="Supershadow">Supershadow</a> article. It's currently at it's stub stages and I can't finish it if the user Languatron continues to vandalizeit. Languatron's antics goes beyond <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar_Galactica_a415.html" title="Battlestar Galactica">Battlestar Galactica</a> related discussion forums. Other forms non Battlestar Galactica forms of media took noticed of Languatron's contoversial actions such as scifi.com and filmjerk.com . Even actor Aaron Douglas has gotten into a war of words with Languatron at the Ragnor Achorage website. Like <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supershadow.html" title="Supershadow">Supershadow</a> , Languatron has done serious harm towards Galactica fandom as did Supershadow has done to Star Wars fandom. Languatron is not just merely a troll on an internet discussion forum but rather a negative entity that has done serious harm. I hope this article can be both an insightful and a non biased informative to help reverse the tarnished reputation of Battlestar Galactica fandom. Thank you --Portal Boy 17:16, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per JROBBO. Note this deletion does not really come under any particular deletion policy, except maybe duplication. Also I'd note that such a list exists for every Australian city (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_places_in_Australia_62c0.html" title="Category:Lists of places in Australia">Category:Lists of places in Australia</a> for examples). Brisbane has the unique feature that over half of its suburbs fall under one <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Government_Areas_in_Australia_72da.html" title="Local Government Areas in Australia">local government authority</a>, which skews the debate in that city - there are suburbs beyond it (Pine Rivers, Redland, Logan etc) which in any other city, and certainly according to the ABS, would be included in such a list, but are not included by Brisbane editors. By deviating from the Australian consensus on lists of suburbs for cities, in such a way that one city does it one way and the rest all do it another way (while recognising that this is a consensus amongst Brisbane editors), it seems to go the opposite route from forming standards for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australian_places_223a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australian places">Wikipedia:WikiProject Australian places</a> to begin with. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 09:44, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No idea why it says that, but the wording should be changed to reflect the <i>greater</i> Brisbane area, not the Brisbane metropolitan area (which is the Suburbs within the BCC). As the metropolitan Brisbane area does not include Logan City suburbs, Redlands Shire (eg Capalaba, Cleveland), Beaudessert, Caboolture (more closer to Sunshine Coast than Brisbane, but is inbetween those areas). --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnzy_60da.html" title="User:Arnzy">Arnzy</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/n/User_talk%7EArnzy_d126.html" title="User talk:Arnzy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arnzy_0c85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arnzy">contribs</a>) 01:00, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm looking at all the other 4 major cities and several minor ones, and seeing a very different definition of metropolitan. If it's based on city council boundaries, Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide would be tiny areas with populations in the 4 and 5 digits. Yet they count areas more than 60km from their CBD (32 in Adelaide's case, as a smaller centre). Some parts of Pine Rivers and Redlands in particular aren't even 15km from Brisbane, a city of comparable size to Perth. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 11:57, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It has been stated before, the suburbs you refer to that belong to Logan City and other areas are not considered to be part of brisbane by anyone who actually lives here. Unlike the 4 cities you mention where the other areas are considered to be part of the main city. Ask a resident of pine rivers shire 'where do I live', and they will not reply 'brisbane'. <a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimmeraj_5b0a.html" title="User:Rimmeraj">Rimmeraj</a> 12:20, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'll keep it short (as we are well and truly off-topic), but just to say I do know people in both Redlands and Logan who describe themselves as Brisbane residents, the ABS does not differentiate between Brisbane and other cities, and that forms the basis of my belief that the situation isn't so different that it requires a radical departure from Australian norms. This discussion, however, should as cj said continue elsewhere. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 05:25, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Except that Brisbane is a special case, they control the largest area by LGA, and thus the Brisbane suburbs are by the ones within the BCC area. As suburbs in Logan City, Redlands, Caboolture (Caboolture is considered Sunshine Coast sometimes) are not considered as part of metropolitan Brisbane, but rather <i>greater</i> Brisbane. As rimmeraj said, ask anyone from the outer LGAs where they live and they will <i>NOT</i> reply Brisbane, but the appropriate area (eg Logan, Pine Rivers, etc). --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnzy_60da.html" title="User:Arnzy">Arnzy</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/n/User_talk%7EArnzy_d126.html" title="User talk:Arnzy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arnzy_0c85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arnzy">contribs</a>) 01:11, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

I examined the all of the relevant policies at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. I went through and tried to measure the various arguments against these policies. In short, I gave it my best effort to find a consensus supported by policy and am left to close this as no consensus.</p>
<p>However, I will note the following from my review:</p>
<ol>
<li>Contrary to some of the arguments here, I did not find a consensus in the talk page and talk page archives supporting the basis for this article. What consensus I did find from the talk page discussions was that <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">undue weight</a> was given to this subject in the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Baden-Powell%2C_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell_15ed.html" title="Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell">Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell</a> article and therefore the bulk of the content in this article does not belong in <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Baden-Powell%2C_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell_15ed.html" title="Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell">Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Baden-Powell%27s_sexual_orientation_2518.html" title="Robert Baden-Powell's sexual orientation">Robert Baden-Powell's sexual orientation</a> article needs some work—enough that it made this a close call between <b>no consensus</b> and <b>delete</b>. The article needs to <b>describe</b> the theories of Baden-Powell's sexual identity instead of <b>presenting</b> the theories. Quite possibly the article needs to be moved to Theories on Robert Baden-Powell's sexual orientation in order to maintain a neutral point of view. Reporting on the theories requires reliable sources that have examined the theories, which the article does include in the intro and briefly references in the first paragraph under the "On his interest in males" section. The theories themselves are a primary source, and per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, the article should be reporting the analysis of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> secondary sources that have reported on these theories. Most of the rest of the article past the third paragraph becomes a presentation of a single work and needs to be rewritten.</li>
<li>The article slips from describing the theories to adopting them and needs the language cleaned up. The following examples either need to be recast or sourced to primary facts, not secondary theories by the Jeal: "There is no reason to suspect that either Tod or Powell's relations were anything but chaste", "Despite his appreciation for the beauty of boys", "From the physical view he regarded the body as the best example of the beauty of nature, and with that of God, the creator", "Their relationship held hints of masculine attraction as well"</li>
</ol>
<p>This closing of no consensus is without prejudice for any future AfD. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 09:59, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>Let's see if we can pry this one loose. Reasons for deletion include:</p>
<ol>
<li>We don't have articles on "Hillary Clinton's sexual orientation" or "Condolezza Rice's sexual orientation" even though you hear plenty speculation about <i>them</i>. (In fact, as far as I know we don't have <i>any</i> articles on "_______'s sexual orientation" except this one.</li>
<li>We don't have articles <i>speculating</i> on the inner life of historical personages. We don't have articles on "What _______ secretly thought about _______".</li>
<li>In particular, we don't have articles speculating on, specifically, the <i>sexual</i> persona of people whose sexuality is not germane to their notability. For <a href="../../../t/2E/a/T.A.T.u._40c9.html" title="T.A.T.u.">t.A.T.u.</a> or <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a>, fine; for Baden-Powell, no thanks.</li>
<li>This is way too detailed a level of information for an encyclopedia article.</li>
<li>Reality check: this whole article is an exercise in making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Anyone surprised? Does anyone think that the editors responsible for this article were casting about a way to <i>improve the encyclopedia</i> by adding additional material on Baden-Powell, mooted a treatise on his tactics at the siege of Mafeking, but decided on this article instead? 'Nuf said. The article was created by <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">User:Haiduc</a>, who is a fine editor and very erudite in his field (pederasty) but is also the Energizer bunny of pederasty-normalizaton here. The Wikipedia is not for hijacking to lend authority to anyone's personal agenda.</li>
<li>Finally, and for what it's worth, and recognizing that this is not really a deletion criteria: the entire thrust of the article is not only incorrect but also insulting to the human spirit and socially toxic. I resent the implication that, because one can (for instance) appreciate the coiled muscular power and grace of <i>The Discus Thrower</i>, or has close male friends, or enjoys mentoring youth, etc. one is perforce gay, and I think the people who make this connection are psychologically retarded at best.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is all. Ride forth, and fear no evil. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 18:36, 5 February 2007 (UTC) N.B.: the previous AfD for this article was closed as No Consensus, discussion <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Robert_Baden-Powell%27s_sexual_orientation_69a6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Robert Baden-Powell's sexual orientation">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, looking at the article purely on its own merits, without attempting to analyze the motives of its author, certainly it fails to meet Wikipedia's stated policy: "Wikipedia articles are supposed to represent all views, instead of supporting one over another...".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This article quotes only two sources to advance the hypothesis that Baden-Powell's sexual orientation was deviant, whilst ignoring the many other published credible sources which consistently portray him as a paragon of virtue. It also fails to mention that his writings, in the context of Edwardian times, are not at all unusual or evidence of prurient interest. How, then, can this article be said to be truly "representing all views"?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As an encyclopedia article, it should endeavour to compare and contrast the divergent interpretations of past events in the context of the times. Instead, all we have here is simply a glorified book report which leads the reader to the conclusion that the Article is POV, not history.</dd>

Not through any form of titilation, but I remember considerable debate and controversy in the UK about 20 years ago (maybe more). In short as a hum drum reader of the encyclopedia if I am interested and also <i>disinterested</i> it stands to reason that others will be too.

<li>First of all, we keep hearing that this article has already survived and AfD. But the AfD was closed as No Consensus, and that was a year ago. So that is a very weak argument indeed, and yes, we can review articles periodically until we get a consensus. And yes I understand that there are a few editors at Baden-Powell's talk page who are eager for this article to survive, but that does not really bear on <i>this</i> discussion. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 17:06, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed, but perhaps you would do me the courtesy of reading beyond the opening lines of my support. As I am <i>disinterested</i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/disinterested" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/disinterested" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>the value of the article is that there has been debate in the wider world beyond wikipedia. Therefore it is encyclopedic to include articles about such debate. Indeed if we have issues about a "smear" then I will happily re-write the article to include the historical context as this is noticeably lacking.

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> I will not repeat ad infinitum arguments made before, I will simply mention that the reason I seem to be hitting people over the head right and left with pederasty is simply because most other editors have a distaste of the subject, and I am left working at it largely alone. But, if I may point out a minor matter, the permanence of the large majority of my contributions <b>despite the controversial nature of the material</b> is at least suggestive of their validity. And don't for a second imagine that I have been free to impose on the Wikipedia some personal agenda. Other editors have been watching like hawks to make sure that I do not turn the documentation of relations between men and boys into a boy love polemic. Which is as it should be. Pederasty has much to be blamed for. But to jump from that to presumptious arguments that to mention a notable personage's attraction to boys is an "attack" is the very essence of imposing an agenda. I would like to leave you with a quote from a recent work on Uranian poetry by Michael Kaylor: "[C]urrent scholarship employs four strategies that blatantly attempt to quell any meaningful consideration of ‘the paederastic’, strategies that attempt to forestall a ‘Uranian approach’: scholarship engages in absolute avoidance of this form of love, intimacy, and/or eroticism; claims its anachronism; heightens its ‘homosocial’ aspects; or disguises it as ‘homosexual’." (<i>Secreted Desires,</i> 2006; p.xxvi) We do not have to fall into any of those pitfalls, not with Baden-Powell nor with any other topic. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 00:13, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(N.B.: The above comment is by the creator of the article.) Haiduc, I already conceded in the nomination that you are a good and erudite editor. However, <i>in this case</i> you're way overreaching. Also, it'd be disingenuous of you to claim that you don't have an agenda: the peppering of the encyclopedia with material tending to glorify and normalize pederasty. I know that <i>you don't see it as an attack</i> to claim the Baden-Powell was a closet pederast. However, most people <i>do</i> see it as an attack - Baden-Powell certainly would have, and I daresay his sucessors in scouting would also - and also a direct attack on scouting itself. If Baden-Powell was alive, this article would be deleted under <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> in a heartbeat. Haiduc, the quote you included in your comment is painfully opaque, but serves to make this point: <i>this is an encyclopedia</i> and as such is, ultimately, a <i>general</i> work designed to be accesable to a <i>general</i> readership. It is not possible to understand that quotation without a extensive background in whatever the hell he's saying, therefore it is not possible to refute his argument without possessing a greater depth of knowledge that the typical user has or can reasonably be expected to easily attain. You follow me? The Wikipedia is not a scholarly academic journal and there's a limit to how deep we can go. And it's all very well for a couple of academics to say well such-and-such and isn't that rather fascinating to speculate on, but here in the real world there's no way that calling Baden-Powell a closeted pederast - and on "evidence" such that he was friends with a younger man and so forth - isn't a scurrilous attack. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a></li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Herostratus, the danger of calling another's work "agenda driven" is that one is exposed to the selfsame criticism. Often such accusations are also inadvertently humorous, since the person doing the attacking appears convinced of his or her neutrality, a neutrality less than apparent to other observers. A close reading of the article that the Scout portal editors and I developed with no small expense of effort will make it amply clear that B-P was a deeply ethical man who deeply loved boys. I do not know what sort of individual condemns and fears an ethical and loving lifestyle but I certainly do not think we should cater to that mentality.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Finally, I take exception to your suggestion that Kaylor's words, which I quoted above are opaque. For anyone unfamiliar with Uranian poetry a small side trip to that article would have resolved any questions. The opacity, if any, lies not in the quote, or in the articles I write but in the reader. And if there is anything I reject more forcefully than attempts to censor discussions of pederasty, it is attempts to dumb down experience any further. I am sure I do not have to explain - just look around at the world we live in.</li>

<ul>
<li>In closing, however, I do want to give credit where credit is due. You are right, I do have an agenda. It is to approach the subject of pederasty in a scrupulously neutral fashion, documenting its negative, neutral and positive aspects with an even hand. And if I might refrain from poking fun at you for a moment, I understand completely your objections. This kind of an activity, from the perspective of a culture which has evolved into a position where pederasty is seen as universally negative, must seem peculiar, slanted and suspicious. That is why we are here now, having this debate. Let's hope it will serve a useful purpose.

<li><b>Keep</b> AFD's such as this one proliferate themselves <i>ad maximum nausium</i>. There are quite a few things going on in this one, though. One is a general dislike for the subject or a desire to wear blinders while confronted with it. This is, of course, not a reason for deletion. Some assert that the article is not NPOV. Whether or not this is true, it is not a reason for deletion. (You do not delete articles you feel are POV, you edit them to make them NPOV). If they take the time to consider the context, nobody can assert that the topic is not notable. (There is strong evidence that the founder of the largest and possibly the most influential boy's youth organization in the world, which currently proselytizes against same sex attraction, might have had pederastic attractions...and we can assert non-notability HOW?). There are several <i>ad hominum</i> attacks that claim that Haiduc is somehow trying to usurp article space in wikipedia in order to advance his agenda of brainwashing all those who so much as LOOK at one of his articles into being pederasts (insert evil laugh here?). Thrown in here is also a condemnation of academic language (by the nominator, no less) and with it academic notability and expertise (because wikipedia should be accessible to a 'general' audience, which means we should talk down to those humble little peons who will just never understand our academic 'lingo'. Sources in an article, after all, are only there to give some sort of arbitrary idol of 'proof' to its content, not to actually provide a pathway to research and, oh i dunno, <b>learning</b> something). And while I jest a good amount here, I think it's pretty clear that the inclusion of articles like this are crucial to the wiki project, and that most of those poo-pooing it have a historical vested interest in its deletion. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a><sup><a href="../../../c/a/v/User_talk%7ECaveatLector_5e43.html" title="User talk:CaveatLector">Talk</a></sup> 06:17, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

It does not appear to be realised that these two books are the only two biographies of Baden-Powell that get close to what we call NPOV. They do indeed look at all sides of the man. The earlier biograpies were written by people strongly associated with Scouting to praise the founder of Scouting after his death. They allow no criticism, while Jeal and Rosenthal have written well researched notable biographies. The topic is important because it often appears in criticism of Scouting. The section in the main article on Baden-Powell was getting too large so it was agreed to spin off an article for this topic. I personally think that more material from these two books needs to be added to WP articles on Baden-Powell, but the sections refered to in this article are notable and important in understanding the man. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 07:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree with most of this, but the conclusion where I differ is that spinning this off and giving it a full article was the proper move.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Further up you ask "So, where are the sources claiming that Baden-Powell wasn't a pederast?". Well, actually, Jeal, as well as zillions of scouting sources. Jeal's views are more nuanced about his sexuality. Other points:- It has been pared down for the main article on BP, but there is, as folks just above say, more to talk about. Also, someone above says about Scouting "which currently proselytizes against same sex attraction". Only the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) do. The Scout Association (UK), Scouts Canada, Scouts Australia, most Scout organisations in Europe, and many others do not.

It's a fine distinction, but this article is not so much about <i>him</i> but about the research movement regarding this topic. So, the research and writing itself is a separate topic. One could imagine an article "Examining the Monica Lewinsky affair" that should be separate from and article on Monica Lewinsky. If anything, this article needs to focus more on the <i>controversy</i> or the <i>research</i> but not be merged. --<a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 15:43, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The subject is notable, and because of his interest in boys leading to the founding of scouts, his reported sexual interest in men and boys is a fair subject for an article. The article is not original research or a synthesis. It is not trying to telepathically look at his inner thoughts, but it does look at his words and actions. It presents several reliable sources which have substantial coverage of the topic of his sexual orientation, possible pederasty, and interest in nude photos of boys taken by his lifelong friend, who was nicknamed "boy." Completely appropriate, and the objections seem to be of the "IDONTLIKEIT" variety.

<li>Hoo boy. OK, going from the top: There's a place for a well-sourced and neutral article on this topic, given the controversy surrounding Scouting's policies regarding homosexuality, as explicated at <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting_controversy_and_conflict.html#Exclusion_of_individuals_from_membership" title="Scouting controversy and conflict">Scouting_controversy_and_conflict#Exclusion_of_individuals_from_membership</a>. However, this article has serious problems, as much of the material is poorly sourced and the presentation doesn't adhere to a neutral point of view. As such, I'd be inclined to basically burn this article to the ground and re-create a version that's a more even treatment of the subject, in the manner in which some BLP violations have been handled in recent days.

<dd>Forgive me, but I'm having trouble understanding why you think most of the article isn't sourced. Most of the article seems to be based on Jeal's biography. The article shifts from footnotes to parenthetical references after the fourth paragraph; paragraphs 5-8 are based on Jeal, to judge from the parenthetical notes at the end of paragraphs 5, 7, and 8; after that, the article isn't referenced. But it seems to me that most of the article indicates its source. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 22:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are parenthetical citations to some portions, but it seems that many potentially controversial statements are currently unsourced. For example, consider the following passage near the beginning: "The most intense relationship of Baden-Powell's life is widely believed to have been with a younger man, Kenneth McLaren, a boyish looking British Army officer whom Baden-Powell had grown fond of when they first served together in India. Baden-Powell nicknamed McLaren affectionately "The Boy," and remained close to him throughout his life, until his friend chose to marry — against Baden-Powell's advice — a woman below his station. Their friendship was the cause of intense jealousy on the part of Baden-Powell's wife." The phrase "is widely believed to have been" contains so-called weasel words, which compromise the integrity of the passage. If something really IS widely believed, multiple sources should be relatively easy to find. The potentially controversial allegation that McLaren's wife was below his station is unsourced, and the source attached to the claimed jealousy of Baden-Powell's wife does not match the passage, rendering that section unsourced as well. It's also questionable to use a summary from a book review as source material, rather than the source itself. For an example of the type of sourcing that is needed for potentially controversial material of this nature, please see the article on <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Jeremy_5f73.html" title="Ron Jeremy">Ron Jeremy</a>. At a casual count, I found 30 citations from 23 different sources for an article with a length of 28 sentences. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 22:30, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for that detailed reply. In general, I agree with your analysis of this paragraph, but these seem like problems that call for a rewrite, not a deletion.

<dd>My objection to the usage of the book review within that context is that it's not the best available source at hand for the material.

<dd>I think your percentage is on the pessimistic side, but I agree that further improvements can be made. (Someone just removed some of the material with "fact" tags, so that helps also.) I'm not going to tinker with the article very much until the AfD closes, because I'd rather not spend too much of my time on work that might get deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b> As usual the attack on this article comes from people pushing the POV notion that it is "defamatory." But that only reveals the bias of those observers, who are attempting to impose their view of what is or is not defamatory on the rest of us. So far <b>no one</b> has been able to point to any crime committed by B-P, nor to any indecent sexual activity, or anything that caused harm to a boy in any way whatsoever. What are we left with? On one hand, an attempt by the squeamish to objectify their biases. On the other, a rationalization that an article which does not have footnotes at every sentence should be thrown into the garbage, even though the material clearly has been sourced to a given work. As for the notion that all sources should be given equal weight, presumably we should apply that approach to cosmology as well, and give Copernicus equal weight to that given to Einstein, so as not to appear "POV." History, even as science, moves on, and some sources are more authoritative than others. To be neutral does not mean to be morons. People feeling that other points of view need to be represented are free to add them, as they have been all along, but not to abuse their editorial powers by using the alleged dearth of opposing viewpoints as a cloak for their puritanical sensibilities. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 01:02, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Don't be ridiculous, this is not a "Flat Earth" issue. No matter what level of sophistry, bomb-throwing, or obfuscation you care to inject here, Robert Baden-Powell's sexual orientation is obviously a <i>controversial</i> subject. As such WP:NPOV <i>requires</i> that, "the article should fairly represent all significant viewpoints that have been published by a verifiable source, and should do so in proportion to the prominence of each." You have chosen only a source supporting your POV, and not cited or mentioned in the Article the many other sources available which paint a different picture of Baden-Powell and present a view different than your own. Your are obliged by WP:NPOV to "present a neutral, balanced article by citing sources on both sides of a controversial issue, even when they differ with your own". Including in the article the published criticisms of Jeal's book, for example, is standard for Wikipedia, read <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">WP:NPOV</a> <a href="../../../j/g/h/User%7EJGHowes_89ea.html" title="User:JGHowes">JGHowes</a> 18:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am obliged to do no such thing. It is expected that an article should evolve to that ideal state, and I certainly do what I can to maintain an even keel. But I, unlike you, am not omniscient, and am unable to provide all points of view - that's what other editors are for, and there have been many who have worked on this article, including a whole bunch from the Scouting community, who presumably have an interest to present an accurate picture of their founder, an interest tempered only by their intellectual integrity - a quality that all of us here would find profitable to cultivate. Your novel doctrine presumes that each article should be born full-fledged from the editor's pen, which is patent nonsense, and part and parcel of the smokescreen of propaganda thrown up by those who prefer to destroy rather than to build. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 19:59, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Where does WP:NPOV say that the creator of an article on a controversial subject may contribute a POV article and just leave it up to others to provide balance? We are obliged to make a good faith effort to present both sides of a controversial issue in a neutral tone: if you disagree with that, then all I can say is your disagreement is with one of the Three Principals of Wikipedia stated at <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">WP:NPOV</a>.</dd>
<dd>Please refrain from mis-representing my position. Tim Jeal's exhaustive biography of Baden-Powell is certainly a scholarly work and well-researched for the most part. What I am saying, though, is that this Wiki article, by relying solely on Jeal and ignoring the rest, makes no attempt at NPOV and thus merits Deletion. A prime example is the complete omission of Hillcourt's opposing view biography, <i>Baden-Powell: The 2 Lives of a Hero</i>, written in collaboration with Olave, Baden-Powell's wife. <a href="../../../j/g/h/User%7EJGHowes_89ea.html" title="User:JGHowes">JGHowes</a> 01:37, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If I read you right, you have found an article which you deem incomplete, you appear to see a way towards completing it (this book which you suggest, which I am not at all familiar with) and your response instead of buckling down and doing some serious editing is to come here and blame me and the other editors for not doing what you seem to know needs doing. And in the mean time, your "solution" is to delete the part of the article which has already been built. Bravo. Two things I will say in response to your insinuation of irresponsibility on my part. In the first place, as I mentioned before, I was unfamiliar with other materials, and, frankly, unfamiliar with a lot about Wikipedia culture. I am a slow learner, and I am still learning. In the second place, a <b>lot</b> of other people had a great deal to do with this material, it was debated at length, and this is the best we were able to come up with. We put a lot of work into it, and it seemed to us to be a good piece, and one which had reached consensus between people with very different outlooks on life and on history. If that is not good faith, I do not know what is. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 03:22, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hillcourt's biography was published in 1965, Jeal's in 1989; they may differ in their views, but Hillcourt certainly didn't write in response to Jeal.

<li>I think that the article has serious issues with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">undue weight</a>, since the bulk of the text concerns speculation about Baden-Powell's alleged homosexual desires, even though he was outwardly a heterosexual who married a woman and had three children with her. Even if the article isn't intended to be a POV fork, the distribution of its focus certainly gives that impression. There's plenty of material available about his marriage and heterosexual relationships, which could be added to the article to address this concern. Also, as previously noted, there are numerous unsourced statements of a potentially controversial nature, both about Baden-Powell and the other people in his life. I think there's a way to deal with the material in a responsible fashion, but when you start throwing around words like pederasty, it pays to be extra-thorough on your sourcing. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 01:43, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

However, I think his argument is incorrect--most of the article is sourced to Jeal's biography. A quote from Jeal (p. 346) may help clarify things a bit: "In Chapter Three I examined in detail a wide variety of evidence suggesting that Baden-Powell found men physically attractive and was sexually indifferent to women. There is, however, nothing extraordinary about his desire to marry. Since contemporary medical opinion-in the wake of the Wilde trials-maintained that homosexuality was an illness bordering on insanity, most 'sufferers' inevitably fought their desires through sublimation or marriage." If the article "presumes" that B-P was a repressed homosexual based on his appreciation for the male body, it is because Jeal's biography, presumably a reliable source, makes that argument. (However, the paragraph that begins "However most of the arguments comes from Baden-Powell's admiration of the male body..." doesn't have a citation and doesn't appear to be closely based on Jeal. That paragraph may well be OR, and I'm placing a "fact" tag on it.) <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 04:11, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

Thinking about homosexuality and sexual attraction to children (and animals and images and shoes and ...) varies widely across cultures and generations and it is an original research problem to to take things from one culture or time period and present them as relevant. Something as simple as quoting a centuries past author as admitting to "intercourse" with a child is original research because "intercourse" did not come to be a euphamism for "sexual intercourse" (but instead could mean talking or commerce (intercourse between nations)) until it displaced the orininal sense of the word. This article has a lot of drawing conclusions by suggestion and association - wink - wink - about it that need to be specifically addressed by independent reliable modern sources for it to properly belong here. 4.250.132.20 19:23, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>WAS, thanks for the response, but I have to say I don't understand your argument. The main source for the article is Tim Jeal's biography of Baden-Powell, first published in 1989. I'd say this book is an independent reliable modern source. And really, almost the entire article reproduces arguments from Jeal's book--I could add footnotes citing Jeal to almost every single sentence, but I think that would be verging on <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.

WAS, while, you are certainly right in everything you say, none of it has any bearing on the article, since, as Akhilleus properly pointed out, these are not OUR arguments, these are JEAL'S arguments. Thus your debate is with Jeal, and while intellectually valid it is of no use here since it is precisely that which it denounces - <b>it is all a bunch of original research.</b> Are we expected to include it in the article?

<dd>The quality of the essay is irrelevant. There are plenty of essays and manifestos that aren't very good but certainly deserve Wikipedia articles because they're famous, oft-cited, influential, etc. This manifesto appears to be none of these. The article does not make any claim that any one of any importance has ever critiqued or even considered The Hedonistic Imperative. Most of the article violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> by drawing novel comparisons to other essays by other, more notable people that will need to be removed if the article survives deletion.

<dd>It's certainly not a blog post, because it was not published on a blog, but rather on his website. And there's no way it would be six pages long, unless you are misleadingly comparing a "page" on an internet site (which can be arbitrarily long, thanks to scrolling) with a printed page. Most New York Times articles are definitely much shorter than this, just do a word count...I put the complete text of the HI into a text program and got a word count of 54,183 words, by comparison the current NY Times top story, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/09/nyregion/09nuke.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/09/nyregion/09nuke.html" rel="nofollow">New York to Test Ways to Guard Against Nuclear Terror</a>, had a word count of 1,257 words, less than 1/40th the length. For a few other comparisons, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Communist_Manifesto_8d91.html" title="The Communist Manifesto">The Communist Manifesto</a> is 4,567 words (without the footnotes), <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Allen_Poe_0d13.html" title="Edgar Allen Poe">Edgar Allen Poe</a>'s short story <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pit_and_the_Pendulum_3606.html" title="The Pit and the Pendulum">The Pit and the Pendulum</a> is 6,186 words, and the <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._G._Wells_6b56.html" title="H. G. Wells">H. G. Wells</a>' novel <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Time_Machine_5e75.html" title="The Time Machine">The Time Machine</a> is 32,134 words--all significantly shorter than the Hedonistic Imperative. In any case, length is not relevant to notability, and the fact that it has been discussed in a number of published books and academic journals is sufficient to demonstrate its notability. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 19:15, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As you noted, it is 6 pages long, and it's 6 pages of the sort of drug-induced ravings that you will find in abundance at deoxy.org. We should be asking ourselves, should Wikipedia be endorsing drug use? The Hedonistic Imperative, besides being insignificant philosophically, endorses drug use, and is the result of drug use. You think this is significant? Hardly. Again, go to deoxy.org and you'll see the same type of crap there. It's not notable. It's commonplace. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 19:55, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>According to your strange criteria, H.G. Wells' book <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Time_Machine_5e75.html" title="The Time Machine">The Time Machine</a> is only 12 pages long, because when put online in HTML form each chapter is given a single scrollable page. In any case, both the length and the your personal assessment of the quality or moral value of the work are completely irrelevant to the question of its notability--you should not be using nominations for deletion as a way of expressing your personal qualitative judgments about a work, perhaps you should review the criteria for <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> again, particularly <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability is not subjective</a>. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 20:11, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The fact of the matter is that The Hedonistic Imperative has not been cited in any peer-reviewed journals (check Google Scholar) and it has only been cited in 3 non-notable books (check Google Book Search). This is not notable. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 20:25, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>One of the books, <i><a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Cyborg_8adf.html" title="Citizen Cyborg">Citizen Cyborg</a></i>, is notable enough to have its own wikipedia entry, and another, <i>Enough</i>, is by a notable author, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_McKibben_52b9.html" title="Bill McKibben">Bill McKibben</a>. In any case, the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> entry does not specify that the "published sources" must themselves be notable (although they should be <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia%7EIndependent_sources_664e.html" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources">independent of the subject itself</a>), the definition is fairly wide: <i>What constitutes "published works" is broad and encompasses published works in all forms, including but not limited to newspapers, books and e-books, magazines, television and radio documentaries, reports by government agencies, scientific journals, etc.</i> As for the google scholar results, are you certain that the journals <i>Australian Biologist</i> and <i>Northwestern University Law Review</i> are not peer-reviewed? <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 20:40, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your criteria validates blog posts and is hardly acceptable. Neither the Australian Biologist nor "Northwestern Univ Law Review" are internationally recognized journals. Show me a widely known news source that has cited the Hedonistic Imperative, or an author in an internationally recognized peer-reviewed journal that has cited it. There aren't any, and that is one of the things that makes it not notable. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 20:54, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(un-indenting) When you say "your criteria validates blog posts", what criteria are you referring to? If you're talking about the statement <i>What constitutes "published works" is broad and encompasses published works in all forms, including but not limited to newspapers, books and e-books, magazines, television and radio documentaries, reports by government agencies, scientific journals, etc.</i>, this is not my criteria, it is wikipedia's official policy as expressed in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> (and I don't see how it would validate blog posts). There is no requirement that the subject be mentioned in "a widely known news source" or "an internationally recognized peer-reviewed journal", I recommend that you review wikipedia's notability policy carefully and then explain why you think the published sources already given do not meet wikipedia's criteria. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 21:02, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have already explained why The Hedonistic Imperative does not meet notability guidelines ad infinitum. Your windbag approach to discussion is not convincing. Reread the guidelines yourself if you don't understand. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 21:17, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, you have not given any explanation that specifically refers to the notability criteria given on wikipedia, instead you have given a lot of your own personal criteria that have nothing to do with wikipedia's criteria, like that the journals must be "internationally recognized" or that "widely known news sources" be used or that the books used as sources themselves be "notable" or that the "page length" be above a certain number or that wikipedia should not include what you believe to be "drug-induced ravings". Can you quote a section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> that justifies any one of these? And can you quote a <i>specific</i> criteria for valid sources from <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> that the sources I mentioned fail to satisfy? If not, then you are using your own subjective notion of what it means to be "notable", not wikipedia's. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 21:45, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>From <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>: a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself. A passing reference to the Hedonistic Imperative in 3 non-notable books, and no references in notable peer-reviewed journals means that it is not notable. For some reason, you are setting the bar for notability far too low. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 22:46, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, I don't see where the criteria given on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> say anything about it being important whether the sources are notable or non-notable themselves (although if you think the book <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Cyborg_8adf.html" title="Citizen Cyborg">Citizen Cyborg</a> is non-notable, you should ask for references for its notability on its discussion page), nor does it say the sources must be "peer-reviewed journals", nor (as far as I can tell) do the sources have to discuss the subject in great detail, at least not when the subject is an idea or manifesto like "The Hedonistic Imperative" as opposed to a person. If you think any of these requirements are present in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, please provide a specific quote. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 23:12, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So having 2 or 3 citations from non-notable, possibly non-independent sources makes a subject notable? This does not meet encyclopedic standards. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 23:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Apart from the "possibly non-independent" part (and if you have evidence of that, please present it), then I'd say yes, 2 or 3 citations from non-notable but reliable sources is enough to make a subject notable according to wikipedia's policy. If you disagree, please quote from the policy to support your case. And incidentally, as I keep pointing out <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Cyborg_8adf.html" title="Citizen Cyborg">Citizen Cyborg</a> is in fact considered a notable source. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypnosifl_2f53.html" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 00:26, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So because it's mentioned in passing in <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Cyborg_8adf.html" title="Citizen Cyborg">Citizen Cyborg</a>, it's notable according to you. That's weak, and it seems few people agree with your opinion. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 00:56, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, you're mischaracterizing my argument, I've said that <i>I</i> don't think it matters whether a source is itself notable according to wikipedia's guidelines, but since you keep saying all the sources mentioning the HI are "non-notable" I just wanted to point out this was incorrect (and incidentally, although the three references in Citizen Cyborg are indeed fairly brief, on p. 270 Hughes does refer to the Hedonistic Imperative as 'the principle transhumanist thinkpiece on hedonic self-determination'). As I said before: <i>yes, 2 or 3 citations from non-notable but reliable sources is enough to make a subject notable according to wikipedia's policy.

<li><b>Delete</b> Neither passing trivial mention: "On Friday nights, traffic backs up on Route 22, the main north-south highway" in the newspaper articles nor appearing on a road map along with all the other roads satisfy the requirement for being "a primary subject." Also there is no policy that all secondary roads are notable absent having multiple sources where they are a primary subject. It is great that some Wikipedia editors are fans of roads, but others may be fans of city streets, television masts, or games show episodes, and they won't get articles for them either. Start a "Roadapedia" and put this material there. A road going through an historic town in no way makes the road notable. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:21, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Hiway fans keep claiming there is precedent that a numbered state hiway is inherently notable, but the precedent is lack of consensus and strong dispute that anything, least of all this 2.4 miles of pavement, is automatically notable. The only references anyone has found during this debate are a map and a printout of a bid list, both exceedingly trivial covreage. Lots of improvements costing $600,000 like the bid shown are also not notable, even if the government paid for them and they bear a number.

<li><b>Keep</b>, since (as least currently) the trend seems to be that state routes are notable. I suggest that the people involved in this debate over the notability of highways take it someplace else and discuss just what makes a notable highway <i>before</i> AfD is blasted with a bunch of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disruptive nominations</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> It is not disruptive to nominate an article for deletion when it does not satisfy the general criterion <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> even if several editors say "ILIKEIT." There is no policy or guideline which says that all numbered roads in the world are inherently notable. Please do no make unsupported accusations of disruptive editing, as that is incivil. AFD is the appropriate forum for deciding which articles should be kept, not "dispute resolution." <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 00:58, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I didn't say that <i>this</i> nomination was disruptive, but if all of a sudden people go on a tear of nominating road articles to prove a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>, that would be disruptive, and it seems some people have <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_California_State_Route_37_1df2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/California State Route 37">already taken the first step</a> down that road.

<dd>The state highway series of articles is a good example of the tyranny of the majority, even in a setting that strives for consensus. A large number of people simply believe that all state-designated roads are inherently notable, and so much "precedent" has built up that even in obviously deletable articles like this, keep will always be the default result. See also articles on the haigiography of science fiction and fantasy authors, and the infamous pages of pokemon characters. -<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 03:44, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The arguments for keeping articles on highways, (some articles are about "highways" as short as 0.3 miles} could be applied as well to mailboxes. Should we have articles on each of them? <i>"The mailbox was installed and marked by the U.S. Postal System, for the use of persons wishing to send mail. It is part of the U.S. Postal system, established in the 18th century. It is a part of the main skeleton system of the U.S. Postal Service and a valid enough topic in covering the mail system."</i> The same arguments could be applied to city streets, power pylons, bridges, drainage ditches, salt trucks, school buses, locomotives, railroad tracks, airport runways, undergound pipelines, television masts, fire engines, schools, libraries, dormitories, municipal wells, sewage plants, and all other infrastructure. They were installed by authorities to benefit the puiblic and given identifying names or numbers. Would you vote to keep all such articles absent independent reliable sources with substantial coverage? Or don't you LIKE them as much as roads? <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 15:33, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If there were a group of mailboxes so important that the state declared them "State mailboxes", numbered them, maintained them, and wrote them into law...then sure. The argument isn't for all roads, it's for a particularly important subset of roads. Regardless of whether or not they're notable enough to include in the encyclopedia, state highways certainly aren't trivial. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 16:13, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The "keep" side keeps using that argument. I do not think it means what you think it means. The argument isn't "there's no room for roads" or "roads aren't a suitable topic.".

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Looking at your laundry list, of those that are individually designated, I answer yes. Many schools/libraries have articles on WP. All runways are mentioned on their respective airports article. Dormitories are also mentioned on their respective universities article. Many of your examples such as power pylons and drainage ditches are not indiviudally identified so making an article. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolderca1_0bcb.html" title="User:Holderca1">Holderca1</a> 23:46, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment.</b> If there were hundreds of millions of these state routes that were very short like this one, then yes, your mailbox or drainage ditch analogy would prove apt. If Minnesota labeled every stretch of pavement as a state highway, then your comparison would prove apt. But there aren't, and Minnesota doesn't. We're talking about a part of limited, specific system, not every single foot of pavement. Here's a more valid comparison, look at the thousands of little podunk towns that have just one source, census data. Those have the same amount of outside coverage and locality as this route. Yet we have thousands of those articles! However, note that those incorporated towns that have articles are all a part of a subset of a much, much larger group of locales--they're incorporated towns, recognized by the state government. We don't have articles on every single crossroads, every single subdivision, every single spot in the state. In both cases, we're talking about a specific group of geographic entities (state highways and incorporated towns) that the state has recognized to be significant enough to place into a specific subset (by numbering or incorporation) out of a larger group (of all of the roads or all of the named locales, subdivisions, etc). --<b><font color="green">HowardSF</font></b>-<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardSF_69a4.html" title="User:HowardSF">U</a>­-<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowardSF_40bc.html" title="User talk:HowardSF">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HowardSF_aa28.html" title="Special:Contributions/HowardSF">C</a>- 16:54, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Most of these articles are sourced and referenced. There are WikiProjects for many states' highways. The Minnesota goverment decided long ago that highways were important enough to be laid out in the Constitution. If state highway articles did not belong here, the very first ones would have been deleted long ago. Why is this just now coming up? The "road is too short" argument is ridiculous. How long is long enough? How about we delete all municipality articles if their population isn't high enough? --<a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESable232_a828.html" title="User:Sable232">Sable232</a> 21:10, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> As stated by others above, numbered highways are notable. Are they any less notable than most of the articles on WP? See specific <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Simpsons_episodes_695c.html" title="List of The Simpsons episodes">episodes of the Simpsons</a>, or <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon_characters.html" title="Pokemon characters">Pokemon characters</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> notability of secondary highways is clear, in a well-sourced and referenced article. This is yet another case where <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> is being abused to mean "anything that I think doesn't deserve an article for which I cannot or will not provide an actual reason". <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 23:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non notable river, just a small brook that runs through a couple of towns. This was originally prodded, but the prod was removed. The author left a note explaining why on <a href="../../../t/u/r/Talk%7ETurkey_Brook_61b0.html" title="Talk:Turkey Brook">the talk page</a>, which I don't fully understand.

<p>It's six months later, and few of the critical issues raised in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Patriots_%28Metal_Gear%29_c8c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Patriots (Metal Gear)">the last AFD</a> have been resolved. This is still extremely detailed plot summary, with <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">no claim of real-world notability</a> whatsoever, organized entirely in an <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">in-universe</a> way. The bulk of the article is still <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, synthesizing details from the relevant video games into an essay. No article would benefit from a merge; several of the game articles are GAs or on their way to GA (with one FA), and none of them need this indigestible lump of plot summary plopped onto their plates. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 17:59, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, worst case, you can always put the article in your user space temporarilly and have some sources and context and I mentioned above.

<p>The result was <b>keep</b>. This definitely needs closing (relisted, and no one added any more comments!). I would like to point out a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alexa rankings, while a useful indication of the notablility of a site, are not necessarily formal nor binding in AfDs. We wish to point out lack of notability, but an Alexa ranking is probably not the way to go to achieve that goal (no offense intended toward MER-C, just a friendly pointer).</li>
<li>Universities link to the site: <a href="http://www.bluefield.wvnet.edu/Library/Pathfinders/Beckley%20User%20Guides/User%20Guide%20-%20Citation.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bluefield.wvnet.edu/Library/Pathfinders/Beckley%20User%20Guides/User%20Guide%20-%20Citation.htm" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, <a href="http://www.washlaw.edu/tools.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washlaw.edu/tools.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. This is, usually, a good indication of notability.</li>
<li>The article, however, does read as an advertisment. Therefore tagged as {{ad}}.</li>
</ul>

<li>IMO the current rating of 453,033 is irrelevant. The notability claim in the article is that it reached a much higher Alexa rating at the time of year that people frequently want to produce citations. I wasnt able to find a reliable source for the ranking of 166,653, however the traffic graph does indicate its ranking would have been much higher last October, and implies that it will be higher again when this seasonal service is needed. Even if it doesnt reach that height again, the notability claim still stands for once-famous subjects. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 00:50, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Also the Alexa test is misapplied in this case, since this is an educational resource, and MacOS is more common in education than in general, but Alexa is MS Windows specific. Aside from this, the Alexa ranking of a Web tool, where people visit for a specific need cannot be compared to a news or information web site. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 01:10, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>neutral</b> I had some involvement with this article, so Im not voting. I first saw this as an attempted external link in one of the search engine pages. These attract a good deal of spam, so before I'd edit out a new one, I'd try to see if it was for real. (One reason I go to that length is because it is an inarguable way of getting rid of the worst, and another is that I have a RW need to know about these things.) This one looked very simple--but it didn't function right, at least for me. So I deleted it and had some talk with the ed., who was I believe not the programmer but a friend. Sooner or later it worked, and I didn't delete it, on the basis it was useful even if little known. I advised against the creation of this article, for it really wasn't known at the time, about 4 months ago, but I said I wouldn't move to delete it because of my own COI. Many people have been writing simple devices with various combinations of features to search library catalogs, and its hard to say what's notable except by what people use. I haven't checked since. ( it does work now, and very fast--I haven't tried the features or the detailed accuracy )</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I do think that to judge the notability of programs and sites like this, or many blogs, etc. by the criteria we are using is not in my opinion always appropriate. By the nature of the things, they get widely seen and widely used long before there are reliable sources in the WP sense. The Web documents itself. The place where people look to find the earliest information is WP itself, because of our presumed special interest in web related matters. We can't help it, if we have become the opinion leader. The basic N provisions are 3 or 4 years old now. The part of the world we live in is changed a good deal. I'm not suggesting rewriting, for i wouldn't know what to rewrite them to, and using Alexa rank for special interest material is like using Amazon rank for special interest books or ghits for material in Hindi -- possibly relative use among similar products is a criterion. This of course gives us the responsibility to do a little OR in establishing N, but most of the lengthier N discussions are in effect OR. We've grown up. Until we come to terms with adulthood, the best way to go is to make reasonable exceptions.</dd>
<dd>What would help in this case is some evidence that 2 or more universities have linked to it from their library or research help site--the same sort of criterion we use for textbooks. That technically does meet the rules. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:37, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the helpful contextual comments. One correction: I was the original author, but I had no contact with the web site author prior to discovering this tool in my work on other Wikipedia article references, so the assumption that I am a friend, and this influenced the article content is incorrect. I did carefully consider your advice on not pursuing this article, but after further research decided that this was a new and useful tool, and other knowledgeable people said this on the record as well, and that should be enough to establish notability in this case. I agree that the <i>guidelines</i> at WP:WEB are overly restrictive and not suitable for special interest topics like web tools. So I tried to very carefully structure the article in accordance with the <i>policies</i> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<p>Very similar to the afd for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_cult_films_7ab5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of cult films">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of cult films</a>. This list is completely unreferenced and likely unverifiable, and it would be necessary to objectively verify that each of these individuals is generally considered a "Cult actor" or "Cult director" by the industry. Appears to be a subjective collection of opinions by individual editors on who is or isn't identified with cult films, which is itself a highly subjective term. Recommend deleting both List of cult film actors and List of cult film directors. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_cult_films_7ab5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of cult films">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of cult films</a> for similar discussion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:36, 6 February 2007 (UTC) I am also nominating the following related pages as indicated above:</p>

<p>Non-notable subject, silly given the stipulation of using "independent" evidence, and original research. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 20:22, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am puttin this article up for deletion for numerous reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is non-notable (see Wikipedia's definition of notability <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">here</a>). A quick internet search shows that all the topics related to this subject are about the "Apollo Moon landing hoax". The act of refuting these claims by using "Independent evidence for human and non-human Moon landings (that is, evidence not presented by NASA or its subcontractors)" is not one of the common ways to refute these hoax claims. Such arguments, if they exist, could easily be incorporated into a pre-existing article under the domain of wikipedia. Such evidence would probably be no more than 1 paragraph long, and would not be an undue burden on, say, <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations_8812.html" title="Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations">Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations</a>.</li>
<li>By "Apollo Moon landings" any reasonable person would infer that this refers to the Apollo program to put <i>humans</i> on the Moon, and not the possibility that Apollo might have landed on the Moon, but with no people inside the LEM. As the article states, the only proof that can be used to definitively show that humans walked on the Moon is to take pictures of "boot prints" from orbit (but only if these come from an non-US governmental agency spacecraft!). However, it is quite clear that such evidence does not exist now, nor will it for a long period of time. Thus, there is no possible proof that humans walked on the Moon (given the constraints of this article).</li>
<li>I know of no reputable publications that are primarily concerned with "Independent evidence for human and non-human Moon landings (that is, evidence not presented by NASA or its subcontractors)" Any attempt to make an article based on primary sources that are only tangentially related to this theme would constitute <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. In the words of Wikipedia policy, original research <b>includes unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories, or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position — or which, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales, would amount to a "novel narrative or historical interpretation."'</b></li>
<li>As has already become clear from the talk page, the definition of "independent" is sufficiently vague that almost anything, or nothing, could be placed under this article. For instance, would the results of a European scientist who analyzes "Moon rocks" supplied by NASA be considered independent? Would evidence from ESA be independent, even though they collaborate with NASA and rely on NASA to participate in the ISS?</li>
<li>Any independent evidence that might exist could easily be refuted by a skeptic. For instance, let's say that telemetry data was collected at an Australian station. How do we prove that this telemetry stream came from the Moon, and not from "over the hill", or from a tape recored souce that was plugged into this instrument?</li>
<li>Finally, this article is trying to make a point (see <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>), and the intended audience is not going to believe it!</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Bad faith nomination by a POV warrior who has tried systematically to disrupt the page. Evidence for the Moon landings is non-notable? I've never heard anything so stupid. Dividing up evidence from NASA and from others is useful, especially given the quantities involved. This article was started from a series of repeated discussions on the Apollo Hoax page, but is also a stand alone article not linked directly to the hoax accusations. A list of observations, tracking, testimonies etc that confirm the landings is appropriate and useful. Not one bit is original research. It is ALL well sourced, and published to death elsewhere. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 20:27, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> Assuming the information in this article is true. The <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations_8812.html" title="Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations">Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations</a> are certainly a noteworthy concept worthy of an article, and a rebuttal of them seems natural to me.

<dd>A merge would not be too bad, except that the evidence for it does not presume a hoax accusation. Listing the evidence is a useful tool for anyone, not just hoax enquirers.

<dl>
<dd>Then that is actually an omission because, otherwise, there really is no need for the article since all you need is to cite the New York Times or whatever's coverage of the applicable manned moon landings. The only reason why people feel the need to cite evidence is because of people citing evidence to the contrary, so this topic is better served as part of the hoax article. I'm actually tempted to change my vote to delete as unnecessary, however, I'm content to leave my vote as is having looked at the article again as requested. <b>Reconfirm merge</b>. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 21:17, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

My interpretation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> does not provide for making separate articles for cited POV's. If the information is notable, then it should be cited and reside right next to the contrary position's notable and cited content. By making separate articles each catering to a particular POV, you may avoid conflict between editors, but you do the reader a disservice. Some readers are likley to read just the one article, which devoid of a balanced NPOV, is unfair. If the article is too long, then consider trimming out the fat... if there is no fat to trim, then maybe it is ok to be long... or maybe the article needs to be split up, but not based on the POV of the content. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 02:04, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I disgree. If you want to neutral article, you should call it "Evidence for Apollo Moon Landings." Within such an article you could give the official NASA story, as well as the "independent" evidence. The two types of evidence could be clearly separated, and it could be mentioned that some people do not believe the official evidence because of conspiracy theory reasons. If such an article were to grow so large that it needed to be split in two, so be it. As is clear from the present state of this article, though, this will probably never happen. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 08:08, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For everyone saying 'merge', for one thing, the Hoax accusation page is flagged as 'too long', and the consensus is to create sub articles. In addition, this is NOT a sub article of the hoax page - it has nothing to do with the hoax.

<dd>Clearly, since you want to suppress factual, verified information. You are also convinced that the only reason someone would want factual information about Apollo is if they are hoax proponents.

<li><b>Reconfirm prior delete or merge salvageable info&#160;!vote</b> I was asked to reconsider the article in the light of further revisions. In my opinion, it still seems to be a POV fork. We shouldn't have competing separate "For" and "Against" articles on the same subject unless there are severe practical space issues (I don't see that here - the use of space and formatting could be far more economical especially with the pruning of unnecessary information). Furthermore even in the same one article the case for each side should be summarized but the article should not be turned into an evidence collection space for each side's cases.

<dd>Then start a NPOV page called Evidence for Apollo Moon landings, as I have suggested to you several times already. While such a new entry would not meet Wikipedia's notability requirements, and might be nominated for AfD, it would not suffer from the other points raised in my AfD nomination that you have so far failed to address despite your large number of posts to this debate. The title of the current page implies that NASA's evidence, as well as that of the thousands of people that were implicated in Apollo or the analysis of data afterwards, are not reliable for some unknown reason that is apparently not related to the Moon landing hoax. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 12:47, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Definite Keep</b> The Young Unionist Council has played a major role in Northern Ireland politics and history, both present day and throughout the course of the Troubles. This can be verified by the numerous references to them in historical sources such as Jonathan Bardon's "History of Ulster". Their role has been distinct to that of the Ulster Unionist Party, as on numerous occasions their policies and outlook have differed from that of the UUP. In the early days of the Troubles Young Unionists were to the forefront in bringing down the "Sunningdale Agreement", against the policy of the UUP. Similarly, after the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 Young Unionists played a highly prominent role, again acting against the UUP. They certainly deserve an article in their own right as their influence on Northern Ireland has been both significant and distinct. --Pondersomething 14:13, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>This depends on whether you consider the current organisation to be the same organisation as the one that was present at the time of Molyneaux. Personally I believe that the organisation which wound itself up 2-3 years ago was a seperate entity to the present organisation. As for Michael Shilliday's attendance at the St. Andrews talks what did he do apart from post a few blog comments, for that matter what did the UUP do at St. Andrews full stop, weren't they just invited out of politness??? <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarkstorm_9d41.html" title="User:Quarkstorm">Quarkstorm</a> 13:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - An article shouldn't be deleted just because it's unsourced -- that would take out 90% or more of wikipedia. It just means it needs to get references. Moreover, it's pretty obvious that this is pulled from a source, somewhere, so it probably wouldn't be too hard to find the source. Finally, there are certainly reliable sources on people by religious denomination, even much more specifically than Protestant; there's a lot of this kind of data. This sort of statistical abstract information is actually pretty useful &amp; helpful. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 03:57, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I understand your reasons, but at the moment this article has been created mainly as a place to remove excess content from the <i><a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_d8ea.html" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a></i> article, which was becoming a dumping ground for new information after each episode. Most of the Coronation Street articles are a work-in-progress, since a lot of useless information generally gets added after 'recent' events in each episode. I am moreorless solely trying to bring articles to a higher standard and to decide what's useful and what is not. I would instead suggest a <a href="../../../m/m/_/WP%7EMM_1706.html" title="WP:MM">merge</a> with <i><a href="../../../m/o/s/Most_controversial_storylines_of_Coronation_Street_4e5a.html" title="Most controversial storylines of Coronation Street">Most controversial storylines of Coronation Street</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_timeline_cbb6.html" title="Coronation Street timeline">Coronation Street timeline</a></i>. I also agree that definition of what is 'major' is very important, the lead of 'controversial stories' tries to define what is controversial. I don't think that deletion is the way to go, but surely you can understand the time implications which exist in doing such work? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc533_8151.html" title="User:Benc533">Ben</a> 18:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>a dumping ground for new information after each episode</i> — You are implying that editors are watching a soap opera and then writing never-before-published documentation of it in Wikipedia based upon no sources at all. That's counter to our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policies. Readers should be able to check everything in Wikipedia against sources outside of Wikipedia. How are you expecting readers to be able to check what happened in the storyline of this soap opera two months ago, let alone in 1983? <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Cite sources</a> to show that the storylines of this soap opera have been documented in books or in articles, and you'll have an ready-made answer as to what storylines are major: The soap opera historians who wrote the books and articles will already have decided this, in what they have chosen to document. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:27, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>UncleG I couldn't agree with you more but <i>surely</i> you realize that this is one of the biggest inconsistencies on wikipedia; if a television show (or series of fantasy novels, or comic book) has enough fans online, "dumping ground" articles appear by the hundreds and its virtually impossible to AfD them all.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 08:00, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>UncleG, I am implying that yes. All 'soap' related articles are popping up out of control, sometimes with new articles after each episode. Just look at <i><a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollyoaks.html" title="Hollyoaks">Hollyoaks</a></i> and see how much gets added after an episode. I am working singlehandedly (with bits of help here and there) in an attempt to bring <i>Coronation Street</i> articles up to Wikipedia standard. Please look at the <i>Coronation Street</i> main article before<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coronation_Street&amp;oldid=95963115" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coronation_Street&amp;oldid=95963115" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> I began editing and <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_d8ea.html" title="Coronation Street">after</a> I'd done some work. The article was transformed, with information properly sourced via print reference, video reference or the Internet (piror to that there were few citations). I follow <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> guidelines when I write, ensuring that anything written is based on the programme's achievements, impact and historical significance, <i>not</i> a summary of the plot. I have a wide collection of print &amp; video sources which I have used so far in the main <i>Coronation Street</i> article. I am strongly against masses of soap-based articles being created (especially character articles) and have already had some successful AfDs with a number of <i>Coronation Street</i> stubs being deleted. There seems to be a train of thought among some soap-editors that everything should have an article on Wikipedia regardless of its significance, and I must say that <i>Coronation Street</i>-based articles are not the worst contenders for AfD. I hope that you understand my perspective on this, and I'm sure that you also understand the time implications of such work. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc533_8151.html" title="User:Benc533">Ben</a> 11:41, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not sure whether to say <b>keep</b> or <b>merge</b> with another article, but I don't believe it should be deleted. (I'm sure I already made this comment a couple of days ago but it's not here for some reason). — <a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnemoneProjectors_565e.html" title="User:AnemoneProjectors">AnemoneProjectors</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnemoneProjectors_b870.html" title="User talk:AnemoneProjectors">talk</a>)</small> 22:02, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If the consensus is <b>delete</b> then I think it only fair that the majority of soap-based articles are nominated for deletion. As I stated earlier, there are many more articles which have less basis such as numerous EastEnders character stubs (some of whom only appeared in a single episode in a minor role), a similar '<a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_Storylines_of_Emmerdale_86ba.html" title="Major Storylines of Emmerdale">major storylines thread</a>' for Emmerdale and a wide collection of individual EastEnders storylines articles. The point I am making with this is that one article should not be singled out if many others exist for other serials. Delete them all or keep and improve them. It's only fair. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc533_8151.html" title="User:Benc533">Ben</a> 13:11, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If it has been created to take the weight of the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_d8ea.html" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a> article, presumably some editors have thought this through and may be prepared to clean it up further. I see no problem with keeping this type of material. If it was deleted, so should a lot of the encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../m/d/c/User%7EMdcollins1984_1ad6.html" title="User:Mdcollins1984">Mdcollins1984</a> 00:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> the argument of "if it was deleted, so should a lot of the encyclopaedia" is mentioned in the essay <a href="../../../a/a/d/WP%7EAADD_43fd.html" title="WP:AADD">WP:AADD</a>... <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 10:24, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a lot better than an article for each episode like some other series have. These do look like appropriate plot summaries, not drawn out fancruft considering how long the series is. They form "<a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">an aspect of a larger topic</a>". Note that the article had been merged into <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storylines_of_Coronation_Street_bbbb.html" title="Storylines of Coronation Street">Storylines of Coronation Street</a>, so the 'major' being subjective argument is void. Now this doesn't mean the article will contain every 'minor' storyline, because they're likely not notable for inclusion. <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 05:15, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Notability is a guideline, not a policy. I see that WP:MUSIC is disputed. The page referring to notability of albums is historic.

<dd>ReGen Magazine appears to be a little known blog run as a hobby by a handful of people who are employed fulltime elsewhere. As I said, I do not think blog mentions meet "multiple, non-trivial" sources.

<dd>I assume you are not disputing whether <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bella_Morte_c3c1.html" title="Bella Morte">Bella Morte</a> is a notable band. Including the album's information in the article would be messy and pointless - it's not as though there's a limit to the number of articles we can have. The information in the album article is verifiable and encyclopaedic. The current guideline for albums makes no mention of multiple non-trivial sources if the band is notable. I do not see a compelling reason for this album <i>not</i> to be separated from the article about the band. I suppose we'll just have to agree to disagree. --<a href="../../../y/u/m/User%7EYummifruitbat_2d22.html" title="User:Yummifruitbat">YFB</a> <a href="../../../y/u/m/User_talk%7EYummifruitbat_ee7d.html" title="User talk:Yummifruitbat"><font color="#33CC66">¿</font></a> 19:28, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Bernie's not as notable as John Carpenter, Kevin Olmstead, or Nancy Christy, but he is still more notable as a game show contestant than many of the other <i>Who Wants to be a Millionaire</i> winners (from the US or otherwise) for whom articles were made. <a href="../../../s/40/l/User%7ES%40lo_8072.html" title="User:S@lo">S@lo</a> 04:32, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If this article were to be deleted, then it would be logical for other "million winner" articles, with the exception of John Carpenter, Kevin Olmstead, Ed Toutant, and Nancy Christy (and other very notable winners from other countries) to be deleted (Also, this probably goes without saying, but the Million Winners section in the <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Wants_to_be_a_Millionaire_b0d5.html" title="Who Wants to be a Millionaire">Who Wants to be a Millionaire</a> article is notable within the subject of that show, so that section should certainly be kept). Note that million dollar wins are notable within the game show community, however (mostly because of their rarity), so I actually oppose such a mass deletion. As an analogy, consider perfect games in baseball. Some pitchers became notable because of that one feat alone, but articles are still made for each pitcher due to the event's rarity. <a href="../../../s/40/l/User%7ES%40lo_8072.html" title="User:S@lo">S@lo</a> 04:32, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. What makes Bernie different from any other person who won a game show, other than that the stakes were higher? I don't see him meeting any criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, specifically him being a subject of adequate media coverage. S@lo, I would argue that perfect game pitchers are an inaccurate analogy -- precedent and consensus shows that any player who has played in the Major Leagues meets notability guidelines for athletes, so <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Robertson_f135.html" title="Charlie Robertson">Charlie Robertson</a> and others would be worthy of an article whether or not they ever threw a perfect game. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">Slic</a><a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_Esperanza_84b5.html" title="User:SliceNYC/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">e</span></a><a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">NY</a><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SliceNYC_0634.html" title="Special:Contributions/SliceNYC">C</a></b> <a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESliceNYC_67e2.html" title="User talk:SliceNYC">(Talk)</a> 19:52, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even if the prime minister mentioned had been there, I don't buy the "famous alumnus" argument: everyone gets educated somewhere.

<p>Dicdef, I don't see much room for expansion. It's been here since March 2005 and there has been nothing added since. Contested prod. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESable232_a828.html" title="User:Sable232">Sable232</a> 16:06, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>. Nobody has said there's anything wrong with the information. Might or might deserve a separate article. I contested the deletion proposal, writing "This article is a valid stub. It can grow beyond a dictionary definition. The solution is to expand it, not to delete it." Wikipedia allows stubs (there are about a million) and has no deadline. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 02:12, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It is not clear that this term has *any* Google hits (as a fully quoted string of three words), except those derived from Wikipedia. Probably it's an obsolete terminology. No need for us to have an article on it; it could be misleading to our readers if we offer the term but can provide no context. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 20:49, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete or Merge</b>, but with what? The definition appears to be correct but without more of an article to clothe it with not much can be learned from it. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlakeloaf_bedc.html" title="User:Flakeloaf">Flakeloaf</a> 22:48, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Some of them are stubs with potential for expansion. The FS 1073C articles require a more discriminatory approach than that. <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Federal_Standard_1037C_clean_up_59ce.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Federal Standard 1037C clean up">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Federal Standard 1037C clean up</a> has been a slowly on-going project for over a year, now. I suggest that editors read read the prior discussion to familiarize themselves with the whole issue before commenting. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:45, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> is quite right that we don't delete stubs simply because they haven't been expanded yet. We only delete stubs if there is no possibility for expansion of the article beyond perpetual stub status. Furthermore, as stated, if editors want to deal with the FS 1073C articles, I suggest reading <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Federal_Standard_1037C_clean_up_59ce.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Federal Standard 1037C clean up">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Federal Standard 1037C clean up</a> <i>first</i>. Blanket mergers and blanket deletion nominations are not the best ways to proceed.
<p><i>However</i>, having said that, <i>this is not an FS 1073C article</i>. The article claims that it is sourced from FS 1073C. But I've just checked the two on-line versions linked to from <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Standard_1037C_b08c.html#External_links" title="Federal Standard 1037C">Federal Standard 1037C#External links</a>, and this concept is not listed. Several different searches lead me to no other sources.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that many of the the FS 1073C articles were created en bloc by 213.253.40.156 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.253.40.156_fca0.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.253.40.156">contribs</a>) in 2002. This article was created by Wanton creation (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wanton_creation_9805.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wanton creation">contribs</a>) in 2005, and is that person's sole contribution. It is possible that it is hoax.</p>
<p>Therefore: This is a stub that has no (valid) sources, and for which no sources can be found after a reasonable search. It cannot be expanded beyond perpetual stub status; the only sources that it cites prove to be false; and, looking, I can find no alternative sources to use. Therefore this is both an unexpandable stub and unverifiable, and per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> that means <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:45, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I would hardly call the Prime Minister of Australia a non-notable person, and the club that was responsible for his early political development surley is worth mentioning. Similarly, the club forms and essential part of the history of state leaders of the Liberal Party like Kerry Chikarovski &amp; John Brogden, as well as prominant Federal cabinet ministers like Malcom Turnbull, Joe Hockey &amp; Tony Abbott. There exist many other campus political clubs that have pages on Wiki, eg Melbourne University ALP Club, and the history of SULC surely ensure its place here is warrented LibStu 02:57, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Seems to get over the line, although it could use a cleanup. It's 77 years old, four of it's former members are in the current Federal Cabinet including the PM, as well as being the biggest component of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Liberal_Students%27_Federation_e0be.html" title="Australian Liberal Students' Federation">Australian Liberal Students' Federation</a>. --<a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERaiderAspect_b3e0.html" title="User:RaiderAspect">RaiderAspect</a> 04:25, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but with a request for a <b>Rewrite</b> to improve the painfully smug tone. We're an encyclopedia, not a recruitment brochure.

<li><b>Keep</b> irrespective of a rewrite -- we can tag it as requiring a rewrite and add it to the Australia WikiProject if it passes the Afd.

<p>The article is confusing. I know what it's about, but I can't figure out why it would belong in an <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">encyclopedia</a>. I assume the numbers in the article are long-dead (didn't try any of them; the article says they are), so it's not <a href="../../../a/d/s/WP%7EADS_2ee6.html" title="WP:ADS">WP:ADS</a>/{{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-spam_4537.html" title="Template:Db-spam">db-spam</a>}} stuff. It's not {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-web_d5db.html" title="Template:Db-web">db-web</a>}} because it's not a website, and I don't think {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-corp_9f48.html" title="Template:Db-corp">db-corp</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-group_fcf7.html" title="Template:Db-group">db-group</a>}} could be stretched to cover it.

That's a funny rule when the word "notable" is used in the definition of "notability." So he is halfway there by being in several notable films. Well how prominent does he have to be in the films? I think that is less clear. WP standards ask that a topic be noticed, not be important or famous. I'm basing my vote on playing a memborable/noticed charachter, Little John" in Robin Hood MIT, with the rest of his resume fleshing out the notablility. Now all we lack is verifiability.

<li>To me making the statement: "doesn't appear to pass..." is using a weasle term. It means you aren't sure so you'll throw it to AfD anyway. Were you too much in hurry to make the nomination, to do you due dillignece? I think that you owe the community the effort to look to see whether it does or doesn't pass BIO and have some certainty in your conviction before you spend our time. This is a very borderline case which should have been left alone. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 04:20, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh dear god, you're upset because I said "doesn't apeear to pass" instead of "doesn't pass"? I said "doesn't appear to" because I googled the man and checked several dozen of the results and none of them were beyond cast lists or his name in a review of a film. As sure as God made little green apples, if I'd said "does not pass" then someone would've been in here criticising me for that. I found the guy's article while cleaning out a category where he was listed but didn't belong. Looking at his unrefernced article I decided to see if there were any references that could be incorporated. Finding none, I put him up for AfD. Sorry if that offends you in some way, that I used AfD to try to remove an article that doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 13:22, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Otto, I'm not offended, but I'm increasingly concerned about poorly thought out AfD nominations. However, I'm impressed with the amount of thought that you put in here. Thanks. I still don't agree with your conclusion, but we are all entitled to variance in opinion. I know that it is extra work to explain the nomination, but it certainly helps those of us who are evaluating your choice when you tell us why. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 17:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would temper the use of throwing out "ILIKEIT" as a defence for an AfD, as I think that can be a bit condesending toward the reviewer's opinion, and far more applicable to a Brittany knock-off than a mature character actor with a diverse but not famous career.--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 17:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

As pointed out below by Mikka, it is hard to maintain multiple timelines without a good reason. Subsets of the big timeline can and are repeated in articles that deal with periods of Russian history such as <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_of_1917_c160.html" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>.

<li>In the case you don't know the history, the Fall cannot possibly last from 1825 to 1924. At best it was from 1905 to 1917. But for this time frame in would be something like Timeline of Russian Revolutions: a non-poetic (i.e. neutral) and meaningful title. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 05:23, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh, sorry. I admit I hadn't looked closely at the table. Yes, I agree that it's a little weird to argue that the "Fall of the Russian Empire" began in 1825 although one can see the seeds of change and revolution back that far.</dd>
<dd>However, I don't see how this is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">POV fork</a>. To be a POV fork, there would have to be a POV being pushed by the separate article. As you say, a more appropriate title and content would be Timeline of the Russian Revolution which redirects to this article. My suggestion would be to trim the content to 1905-1918 (or 1905-1924), delete Timeline of the Russian Revolution and then move this article to Timeline of the Russian Revolution. I have changed my vote above accordingly.</dd>

<dd>It is a POV fork exactly for the reason mentioned: why would fall start in 1825 or at any other days. As for "seeds", with some resourcefullness they may be traced to <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rurick.html" title="Rurick">Rurick</a> times. Fruthermore, it is a fork, because (a) <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_of_1917_c160.html" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> already has its chronology and (b) wikipedia already has its established periodization of Russian history based on tangible milestones, see {{<a href="../../../h/i/s/Template%7EHistory_of_Russia_a7a7.html" title="Template:History of Russia">History of Russia</a>}}. A minor stroke, it is "Russian Revolution<b>s</b>", not "Russian Revolution". Finally, this extensively commented "timeline" is in fact an <b>alternative version</b> of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_history.html" title="Russian history">Russian history</a>, with some dubious and outright false statements (starting from the very top: "decembrist revolt... against Imperial Russia"), i.e., a clean-cut fork: one may take, say <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_history%2C_1892-1917.html" title="Russian history, 1892-1917">Russian history, 1892-1917</a>, convert it into a tabulated format, ordered by dates and events, and you will get something like the discussed one, and not really much larger, by the way.</dd>
<dd>Concluding: this article is a fork, with all problems known for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">wikipedia:content forkings</a>: <b>verifiablity, maintainability, unnecessary duplication</b>. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 21:49, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>OK, I'm willing to believe that this article "might" be a POV fork. Let's leave out the question of starting in 1825 vs. 1905. Please provide some examples that show that this is an <b>alternative version</b> of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_history.html" title="Russian history">Russian history</a>. Without evidence to show this, then it is not obvious that this is a POV fork. For example, what is it about the "Decembrist revolt" entry that is a POV fork?
<dl>
<dd>I dont' want to be dragged into the <b>waste of time</b> related to the discussion of the actual content: this is exactly the '<b>harm of forks</b>: one has to waste time to keep things in sync. Out of personal courtesy, I will answer this one, but refuse to discuss other problems. "Decembrists" <b>did not</b> revolt against "Imperial Russia"; in fact they pledged their allegiance to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_of_Russia_bba0.html" title="Constantine of Russia">Constantine of Russia</a>. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 22:51, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Leaving out the specific content of the table for a moment, I think it is better to have a Timeline of the Russian Revolutions article than to have the timeline be in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_of_1917_c160.html" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> since it seems reasonable to have a timeline that extedns from 1905 to at least 1918 or 1924.</dd>
<dd>My recommendation remains as stated above with the proviso that any content that appears to be POV fork in nature should be reconciled with the other articles. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 22:09, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, respectfully disagree. A timeline is a timeline is a timeline. The discussed article, rich in text, is a tabulated version of a segment of the Russian history with a pretentious title. Of course "Fall of the Russian Empire" is a valid topic and a summary article which discusses <b>opinions of experts</b> what went wrong in Russia makes sense, but I am against splitting the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Russian_history_9de7.html" title="Timeline of Russian history">Timeline of Russian history</a> by "rises and falls". By the way, do we have any other "Fall" timeline in wikipedia? Look into <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_British_history_18a0.html" title="Timeline of British history">Timeline of British history</a> or into any from <a href="../../../n/a/t/Category%7ENation_timelines_097e.html" title="Category:Nation timelines">Category:Nation_timelines</a>. I understand, it makes sense to have, e.g., the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_microscope_technology.html" title="Timeline of microscope technology">Timeline of microscope technology</a>, which may be safely considered isolated from what else happens in the world. But a history of a country is one continuous flow and any "rises and falls" are necessarily post-factum POV. E.g., in opinions of many, the period of 1907-1913 is hardly a fall (sorry, no details), and no big wonder it is conveniently omitted from the discussed article. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 22:51, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>First off, please don't edit my or others' comments by inserting your editorializing in the midst of them to subvert their meaning. I have removed your inserted comment from mine. Secondly, "you're" is a contraction of "you are." The word you're feebly struggling for is "your." Third, if you have references for this unreferenced article, then add them to the article. Just saying "keep" in an AfD means nothing. Finally, stop being a <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">dick</a>.</li>

<li>Did you bother investigating? Salty Dogs Productions is not myself. Any why do you insist on getting 3rd party info when the only person that actually knows everything is me?

<li>What classes as a 3rd party source? As a lot of people could verify this information, i am a big fan and could be a 3rd party source, there is also 3 clans who could vouch for this, Zeuser is the creator and founder of DCX. DCX is mentioned on alot of sites. DCX has had over 100 unique players playing in the last week, this shows it is popular(source <a href="http://bftracks.net" class="external free" title="http://bftracks.net" rel="nofollow">http://bftracks.net</a> ) I feel that this article should be kept as it provides good informative information, from a reliable source.
