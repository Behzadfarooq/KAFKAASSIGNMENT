<p>Neologism.

<p>The word is used, and the context is clear by the usage. You should be able to confirm the definition solely by the usage. I'm not sure if you follow football or not...it's fairly well-known.

<dd>Sorry, I've never had to discuss anything here before so I wasn't sure of the format.

<dd>A fair point. However, I get a good bit of Madden and Scott both, and I've still not heard it.

<dd>Yes, but seeing as how other posters here have heard of it, without a definition on wikipedia, fewer people will know what it means. I thought that's why wikipedia had the slang that it does on here, in order to let people know when they hear it (including/especially NFL/ESPN fans) what exactly it entails.

<li><b>keep</b>. I'm not sure about this John Madden claim. And even if it is true, a lot of nonsense comes out of that man's mouth that doesn't necessarily deserve it's own entry. But "whoo-ride" is pretty widespread among internet sports discussion, and an entry explaining it seems logical and useful.

<li>KEEP I am new and I am really into correcting faceless people online because well, i really get off on it. I am also EXTREMELY into collecting stamps and am currently constructing the worlds largest ball of lint(eat my dust Raymond Henderson!) hopefully my mother will let me keep it in my room.

<li>KEEP Dawg, many internet dorks like myself have used this and continue to use this word. Just because some of you may have never heard of it does not mean it should not be included on Wik, I'm just being honest dawg. Dude, it is a term that started at one message board and has spread to others because most people correspond on more than on message board. Dawg, this is my first entry to Wik and it will not be my last. Randy_Jackson October 22, 2005</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: IMHO "whoo-ride" doesn't qualify as Internet slang; it may have its origins on the Internet, but it's a football term, not an Internet term. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-weight: bold; color: #33C;">howcheng</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howcheng_7e82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howcheng">contribs</a> • <a href="http://www.howcheng.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.howcheng.com/" rel="nofollow">web</a> ]</small> 16:14, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Reguardless of whether it gets washed with the reds or the blue, it's just as obscure (I'd argue less so) than anything in that Internet slang category. It should stay. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 17:04, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: If the entry about "the endless november" Usenet phenomenon gets to stay, then I'll be damned if I'm not going to vote a hearty KEEP for "whoo-ride". There exist many subjects on wikipedia that are esoteric, arcane, or seemingly silly. Having them in a collected place is valuable. Anyway, "whoo-ride" apparently isn't just a slang term, but a phenomenon similar to a Clutch Underdog Victory, and such and such. Jeff Reardon comes to mind, and that kicker for the new england Patriots. They both showed the "right stuff" at the right place at the right time when everyone dismissed them as having the "wrong stuff" at the wrong place at the wrong time. I rest my case. KEEP. (But I don't condone the name-fraud or whatever's been going on here.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.119.232.167 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.119.232.167_07ed.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.119.232.167">contribs</a>) 13:52, 25 October 2005 (UTC).</small></li>
