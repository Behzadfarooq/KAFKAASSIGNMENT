<li><b>Comment</b> It's often pointed out at these AfDs that "I like it" is no reason for a keep. Besides the fact that neither two <b>Keep</b> votes mentioned anything about personal tastes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia's non-censorship policy</a> implies that "I <i>don't</i> like it" is an even <i>worse</i> reason to recommend deletion. If you don't like it, don't read it. Within one minute any one of us can find a dozen biographies on Wikipedia that are clearly <i>far</i> less notable, and <i>far</i> less sourced. Just a couple clicks brings up the totally unsourced stub on the fictional character <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Shadwick_445d.html" title="Jason Shadwick">Jason Shadwick</a>, at which one of our <b>Delete</b>s has just edited. Clearly it is the <i>subject</i> that is the issue, not notability. This sort of POV bias has no place on Wikipedia. Over 100 films, multiple sourcing-- This subject is clearly notable, if the subject offends you, don't read it.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Your reasoning makes no sense. The article itself has four sources that are reliable. This number of sources is about par for the course for an article if this size, if a little above average. A significant number of relevant search results on Google would also partially speak to notability. I really have no personal opinion on this matter, but it seems to me that the subject of this article is notable enough to have a reasonably-sourced article.<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELaMenta3_3753.html" title="User:LaMenta3">LaMenta3</a> 03:53, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, should've clarified. From the sources presented, none of them are really <i>about</i> her, and only the interview is of a non-trivial length. If we were to use them, we would basically have a list of movies and some information backed up entirely by an interview about her, which is only a quasi-independent source. The award she won doesn't appear in <a href="../../../a/d/u/Category%7EAdult_movie_awards_92d2.html" title="Category:Adult movie awards">Category:Adult movie awards</a> (as required by WP:PORNBIO) either. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 04:02, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd like to clarify that WP:PORNBIO doesn't require that she has won an award, or that if she has won one, that it be listed in the category. However, if she had won one, it would have satisfied the notability requirement. —<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisavian_2333.html" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDisavian_f80f.html" title="User talk:Disavian"><sup>talk</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Disavian_e056.html" title="Special:Contributions/Disavian"><sub>contribs</sub></a>) 05:01, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> While it discourages against strict counting films and google hits, it has the policy "notable and prolific"-- but can you honestly think of a better meter of notability/prolifity than her large number of films or the 500,000+ google results? How many more films would she have to do before you considered her notable? Also remember that she was a finalist for a pornographic award. —<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisavian_2333.html" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDisavian_f80f.html" title="User talk:Disavian"><sup>talk</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Disavian_e056.html" title="Special:Contributions/Disavian"><sub>contribs</sub></a>) 05:01, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> There are basically three arguments going on here: 1) Whether she is notable; 2) Whether articles should be deleted merely for being poorly written or attributed; and 3) Whether pornography is a valid topic for Wikipedia. It's not an argument that has been specified until now, but it's in here. I agree that Gianna Michaels should be considered for an article based on the fact that she was nominated for the "Favorite Breasts" award (even if <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> requires a victory--I think that's a bit narrow in scope; Wikipedia doesn't drop non-pornographic actors for never having won awards). I am also concerned that a comment advocates non-consideration of the "keep" votes based on the commenter's gainsaying of the voters' comments without specific damning evidence. Additionally, it is very difficult to find real journalism about pornography because most major media seem to add a porn angle to a story if said angle is particularly lurid, the better to increase sales. As a result, it would seem that the central notability criterion is a bit circular in this case. As for the unspoken argument about pornography's place in Wikipedia: here is my evidence that the argument is taking place. We would not be having this discussion if the actress performed in some other genre than pornography. Consider that there are quite a few performers (most of them, admittedly, young actors, singers, and musicians) who have only come to prominence in the same three-plus year timespan as Gianna Michaels. My feeling is that pornography is a part of the human condition. As such, it deserves clear, unbiased reportage. I do not feel Wikipedia should be a directory of porn stars; performers come and go. It should, however, be a leader in such coverage, if only because nobody else seems to be showing up until there's a tabloid-quality headline and byline to be had. Gianna Michaels has had a great deal of success in a fairly short time in the industry, much like, say, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_Aiken_b79b.html" title="Clay Aiken">Clay Aiken</a> has had in music. (I dare say she has sold more media, in fact.) —<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoomshadow_80d4.html" title="User:Boomshadow">Boomshadow</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - On the basis that she just does sex scenes and doesn't "act" in features. Nothing is outstanding or groundbreaking about her. Her number of films and the amount of time she has been in the industry is relatively small. Doesn't meat any of the 6 valid criteria listed in WP:PORNBIO. Keep in mind people the amount of porn on the internet in general when you are talking about google hits in this subject. - <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArch_NME_45a5.html" title="User:Arch NME">Arch NME</a> 05:49, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

It doesn't really matter if other famous people are nominated and win it- I could make up the Waffy awards and hand them out to random people and pornstars too.

<dd>So, if I were to write a reasonably developed and referenced article about the FAME awards and categorized it under <a href="../../../a/d/u/Category%7EAdult_movie_awards_92d2.html" title="Category:Adult movie awards">Category:Adult movie awards</a>, Gianna Michaels and any other porn actor/actress who had won or been a finalist for one of their awards would suddenly be notable? Somehow I don't think <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> has thought its cunning plan all the way through... <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELaMenta3_3753.html" title="User:LaMenta3">LaMenta3</a> 03:20, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - other pornstars are on Wikipedia, and she appears to be on the rise. <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGuroadrunner_7eb9.html" title="User:Guroadrunner">Guroadrunner</a> 06:20, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I can understand people doubting her talent and morality but that has nothing to do with a person's notability. Pornstars are allowed on Wikipedia and she is one of the top ones. She is certainly one of the top ten large natural breast stars at the moment and anyone interested in that popular genre will know of her. The high awareness of her work therefore makes her notable. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 19:46, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Since the trend seems to be for doing away with <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a>'s "cunning plan" by merging it with <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>, let's check that guideline: "A topic is <b>notable</b> if it has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other." and further for Entertainers: "Multiple features in credible magazines and newspapers, A large fan base, fan listing, or "cult" following, A credible independent biography, Wide name recognition..." Ms. Michaels seems to pass every one of these criteria. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 02:23, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Referring to <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoomshadow_80d4.html" title="User:Boomshadow">Boomshadow</a>'s comment, I personally think that <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> in this case is slightly distorted as had Gianna been a model who primarily made her name in the video market rather than website scenes (hence the number of sites about her and her appearances <a href="http://www.giannamichaels.co.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.giannamichaels.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) to begin with she probably would have more notability to check against the lists. Judging by her <a href="http://www.overture.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.overture.com/" rel="nofollow">overture</a> search ranking per month which is approaching 50,000 unique searches (49281 for last month to be exact) I definitely think that she should be kept it. The wikipedia page for her is high in search engines such as <a href="http://www.google.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/" rel="nofollow">google</a> as well so if she was deleted people would continue to recreate this page until it was finally accepted she was notable (at some point in the future as she continues to grow). On this and a number of other factors, including her varied and high profile work according to the <a href="http://www.iafd.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.iafd.com/" rel="nofollow">iafd</a> and the pure number of fans and dedicated sites/pages about her I would say she is a definite keep, even if the article could do with a bit of expansion in some departments.</li>
