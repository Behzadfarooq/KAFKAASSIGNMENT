This so-called "theme" is not even discussed as such by the classic Jewish commentaries on the Bible. I also am baffled by the title, "A wife confused for a sister."

<li>Duffy's answers seem to indicate that the two cases are better linked under the <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abimelech.html" title="Abimelech">Abimelech</a> entry. I do not think that this discussion should be as wide as to address the entire documentary hypothesis, but rather the article we vote about. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 20:49, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Excepting the problem I have mentioned just below that there are other quite different Abimelech's also discussed there, i.e. <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abimelech.html" title="Abimelech">Abimelech</a> is better as a disambiguation page. And the other problem that the Pharaoh version (Genesis 12) involves Pharaoh not Abimelech. --<a href="../../../f/d/u/User_talk%7EFDuffy_2e93.html" title="User talk:FDuffy">User talk:FDuffy</a> 21:46, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems to me that [1] no proper article on the King of <s>Gat</s>Gerar exists and d "references" IMO don't include a single reliable source. Look at this: <i>The Unauthorized Version</i>[2] texts were deleted or moved. I may very well be mistaken. Perhaps others can look this up in the history of the article <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abimelech.html" title="Abimelech">Abimelech</a> and elsewhere. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 20:55, 2 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with discussing it under <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abimelech.html" title="Abimelech">Abimelech</a> is twofold. Firstly, there are other quite distinct biblical individuals named Abimelech. The second is that discussing it under Abimelech creates a problem with discussing the Genesis 12 version between Abraham and Pharaoh. B.t.w. what is Gat? Do you mean Gerar?
<ul>
<li>Is there a source that linked Sarah into the story. And yes, I did confuse between Gat and Gerar. Back to Sunday School&#160;:-) That leaves open the question of the texts that "disappeared". <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 21:18, 2 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes. It's called the Bible. Sarah is Abraham's wife. See Genesis 20-21 for the Abraham/Abimelech version of the story which explicitely mentions Sarah. --<a href="../../../f/d/u/User_talk%7EFDuffy_2e93.html" title="User talk:FDuffy">User talk:FDuffy</a> 21:45, 2 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am looking for sources that tie all three cases together (not only the later two which you keep returning to) under one clear theme, other than the article you created or the separate inclusions in Genesis. Until I receive such sources I consider this a case of original research. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 22:08, 2 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Try reading the Jewish encyclopedia article on Sarah - "...the incident with Pharaoh and a similar incident with Abimelech..." --<a href="../../../f/d/u/User_talk%7EFDuffy_2e93.html" title="User talk:FDuffy">User talk:FDuffy</a> 23:08, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Or how about the mediaeval Sefer HaYashar, chapter 20 (here is an online link to the chapter - <a href="http://www.ccel.org/a/anonymous/jasher/20.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccel.org/a/anonymous/jasher/20.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>)</li>
<li>Maybe more modern theological writings would satisfy you - <a href="http://www.bible.org/page.asp?page_id=1543" class="external text" title="http://www.bible.org/page.asp?page_id=1543" rel="nofollow">bible.org</a></li>
<li>Or a google search <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=abimelech+pharaoh&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=abimelech+pharaoh&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">the story for abimelech vs. that of pharaoh</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This article could be copyright infragment. Author is claiming what he is doing is under fair use, which isn't the case. Also author beleives the Jewish Enclylopedia is out of copyright, thought only very old editions arn't... <a href="../../../2/2/0/User%7E220.233.48.200.html" title="User:220.233.48.200">220.233.48.200</a> 20:43, 2 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not one piece of the text is a copyright infringement. Large chunks of the Jewish encyclopedia have been used. But of the 1911 public domain edition. "copyright infringement" is really quite a red herring attempt to destroy the article.
<ul>
<li>Well then you need to add the "from Jewish Enclylopedia" template, and others. But you have also ripped a whole parts from other sources which you claimed to be fair use... You really need to cite your sources in this cases. <a href="../../../2/2/0/User%7E220.233.48.200.html" title="User:220.233.48.200">220.233.48.200</a> 21:11, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Are you denying that the etymology of Beersheba is discussed at Genesis 21 and 26, is there directly connected to the treaty and Abimelech, and that archaeology has something to say about the potential value of some of the etymologies?</li>

<li><b>Keep with heavy modifications</b> I currently feel that the article is framed in a very POV manner. I nonetheless think it should exist, under this name or another. The common thread of the three stories is undeniable, and thus I am sure has responses in many fields; currently only the documentary hypothesis is present without any heading indicating that this interpretation is the one to be unfolded presently. I am sure you could find some sociological/anthropological understanding of the phenomenon of wives and sisters, or at least some understanding given by Rabbinic or Christian scholars. I don't believe the article as it is is original research but it is currently POV and also needs to cite sources for individual facts if it wants to retain integrity.<br />

<li>Find better name, if possible</li>

It should be deleted because like most arguments from such sources it employs fallacious reasoning and deceptive half-truths, what I call "dumb ass" and "smart ass" Bible criticism. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuratowski%27s_Ghost_768e.html" title="User:Kuratowski's Ghost">Kuratowski's Ghost</a> 00:38, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Those are major and well respected modern day scholars, one is even the professor of ancient history at Oxford. Claiming they are just people who produce "rehashed" arguments is like claiming Fundamentalist Christians and Jews are just rehashing centuries old outdated arguments for their faith. --<b>User talk:FDuffy</b> 14:04, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Which they are. All the arguments about whose biblical interpretations are correct were already argued and summarized far more succinctly by the Rabbis of the Talmud (see the <a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggadah.html" title="Aggadah">Aggadah</a> of Rabbi bar bar Chana) and by <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maimonides.html" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a> in his debates with the Church than they are today on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYoninah_ec9f.html" title="User:Yoninah">Yoninah</a> 16:15, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> but clean it up a little, as per jnothman, kwami, thomas ash, etc. The fact that it has generated so much controversy here just goes to show its notability. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 01:19, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> This example is classic documentary hypothesis stuff, as anyone in the field of Bible knows. One may agree with the analysis or not (the field of biblical poetics, for instance, shows that classic source criticism fails to account for many important aspects of Genesis, including in this example), but I fail to see why anyone calls it original research. It is standard stuff, and has been since the 19th century. I think some of the objectors would prefer not to see the basic articles on biblical topics cluttered or even overwhelmed with source-criticism, and on this I happen to agree with them. I don't think that would be appropriate at all. But the way to achieve that is not by deleting source-critical articles and removing real information from Wikipedia, but rather by expanding on source-critical aspects in articles devoted to them (like this one). The weaknesses of source-criticism and alternative approaches can be discussed in such articles as well. More broadly, if others would like to discuss this issue beyond its relevance to this article, I would be happy to so.<a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovi_943a.html" title="User:Dovi">Dovi</a> 07:07, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. FDuffy is right. The article may not be in a great state but a change of title and a little source citing could well turn it into something good. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Soo</a> 14:27, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>delete</b>. Original or not, it is still research, not an encyclopedic paper. Wikipedia may be easily packed (if wikipedia is "not paper" why then Jimmy Wales asks for all this money?) with such theries in all historical magazines full of "solid" references and crossreferences. I any case about 60% ("well" part, etimologies, etc.) of its content is either irrelevant here or must be addressed esewhere. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 03:45, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
