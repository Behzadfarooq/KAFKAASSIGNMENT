<p>Aristasia is a fictional world of all females, that is, if notable at all, notable as a BDSM role-playing setting, and is also an anti-feminist group. This article probably should have been deleted almost 2 years ago; See Talk:Aristasia for the VFD debate from September 2004; I count 6 delete vs. 3 cleanup. I did a thorough websearch on Aristasia and found only one thing that looks like a reliable reference: <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/religion/0195152972/acprof-0195152972-chapter-12.html" class="external text" title="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/religion/0195152972/acprof-0195152972-chapter-12.html" rel="nofollow">This book</a> apparently discusses Aristasia, but I couldn't determine, online, what it says about it. Otherwise this article cites very unreliable sources: the Aristasia web site and their source text, <i>The Feminine Universe</i>, which is web-published only as far as I can tell, and isn't even complete. The article has two citations that are broken, and the rest are forum postings. There are references to Aristasia in other articles, but they are mainly of a throw-away sort: appearing in a "see also" list, for instance; none have references outside of the Aristasia web site. I had never heard of this topic before I found it via that {{<a href="../../../h/o/a/Template%7EHoax_4655.html" title="Template:Hoax">hoax</a>}} tag, and I apologize if my ignorance offends anyone who does know about this topic... but this article really doesn't conform to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> at all. I'm an eventualist normally, but this article has been around since Sept. 2004; I think it's better if we <b>delete</b> this if it can't be improved now. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 17:04, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> As far as I can tell, this is nothing more than an internet community, consisting of a message board, and some sort of virtual reality chatroom. Based on the tiny number of messages on the message board, this community likely consists of one or two dozen people. The website has an alexa ranking of 1,845,845. On the other hand, there is a video link from some unspecified british tv show from 10 years ago about this, at <a href="http://aristasia.co.uk/MM1.htm" class="external free" title="http://aristasia.co.uk/MM1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://aristasia.co.uk/MM1.htm</a> if anyone wants to place some value on that. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 20:20, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I believe there is a misunderstanding of Aristasia. I too have done extensive research. Aristasia does not exist. The article need to be rewritten. It is actually a counter-femist concept which arose in pop culture. Urbandictionary and other websites, also acknowledges the existance of this society as a mythical fastasy of male submission. Its ideology is one that formed from modernization and is very real. Some information on that page is false and need to be edited not deleted. However this article has passed deletion once before and should not be targeted again.Killerhun00 06:47, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> A friend of mine got to actually meet these women who claim to live a "racinated" life. They claim there are several Aristasian households in England and Europe and that they don't allow anything made after 1960 into their house. It turns out there are about four of them, living in two houses, and while they do have a lot of antiques, they also have plenty of contemporary stuff in their houses. They come up with all kinds of excuses for why they make exceptions. Basically, this is their fantasy, not something they actually do. <s>Mrs Baggins</s> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.188.19.203 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.188.19.203_1a5a.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.188.19.203">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Keep (having problems highlighting with this keyboard) I recognise this may look hoaxy, but I assure you the movement does exist, and has received some significant media attention in Britain, and published not one but several books.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I really don't think we should take crosslinking into account here. If this article is on a topic Wikipedia can't realistically include, the crosslinking that does exist is likely the result of the Aristasia article being allowed to exist here for so long (as I pointed out above, it probably should have been deleted after its first VfD). Besides, most of the crosslinking is non-useful; inclusion in see also lists and such. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:09, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> the "delete" arguments seem woefully under-informed. The Feminine Universe has been available in book form for over ten years. Several other Aristasian books have been published over the years. Here is a list of three of them on Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/WJF1WXW8B9YG/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_full/103-4980857-1419041" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/WJF1WXW8B9YG/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_full/103-4980857-1419041" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> including <i>Children of the Void</i> - a full length novel about Aristasians in London which is said to be only slightly fictionalised. The list is not complete. It excldes, for example, <i>The Feminine Regime</i>. Britain's Channel 4 did a full-length documentary on Aristasia that made such an impact that there is a Yahoo group (not run by Aristasians) devoted solely to trvia about this one documentary <a href="http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/missmartindales/" class="external autonumber" title="http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/missmartindales/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. There were numerous other television apearances. Articles about Aristasia have appeared this year in the <i>Fortean Times</i> and <i>Bizarre Magazine</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Claims that Aristasians do not live according to their own priciples, aside from being irrelevant, are based on a misunderstanding of what those principles are. Aristasians have repeatedly stated that imitating the past is not their aim. Pre-21st-century existence of Aristasia is well documented and many Aristasians live in private households and are not online. The stress on discipline is much less among current Aristasians, though even the previous generation despised BDSM. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.153.88.14 (<a href="../../../8/1/2E/User_talk%7E81.153.88.14.html" title="User talk:81.153.88.14">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.153.88.14_4b6e.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.153.88.14">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> The books on Amazon are not actually available through Amazon, but rather are only available through affiliated resellers, which really doesn't mean much.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I believe the books may be out of print, like the Gor books. The point is that they do exist and have had influence. The prices that second-hand copies are going for indicates the strength of demand among a "cult" market. These books are mid-90s (for the time-sceptics) and earlier versions of two of them appeared in paperback editons during the late 80s. There have now been three "generations" of Aristasians. Admittedly the first is not very documented as they didn't publish books or give media interviews, but the second generation certainly seems already to have a history behind it. A number of different Aristasian sites have come and gone over the last ten years, with rather different styles, that certainly seem to have been run and habituated by different groups of people. In other words, a core set of ideas and philosophies has motivated a number of people over likely three decades (they claim four) in a variety of ways. Various spin-offs and quasi-Aristasian groups have sprung up over the years, but there has always been an accepted "official" Aristasian group. Aristasia has decidedly (and by choice) been fairly small and exclusive and existed outside the mainstream, but it does seem to be a distinct minor cultural phenomenon.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Re prehistory: in the early to mid 80s a series of stories about a character called Amelia Bingham appeared in the British lesbian magazine <i>Artemis</i>. These stories have decidedly proto-Aristasian characteristics and were written by one of the first-generation Aristasians. The series has recently been privately published as a "novel" and can be seen here <a href="http://www.lipsticktheatre.co.uk/blondie/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lipsticktheatre.co.uk/blondie/index.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. The introduction (apparently written in the late '80s for an abortive attempt at publication in book-form at that time) throws some light on proto-Aristasians at Oxford in the late '70s/early '80s.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> I first encountered Aristasia through an interview on the radio and have read several newspaper and magazine articles relating to it. It is counter-cultural, so you would not expect widespread coverage. It is unusual, well-thought-out and highly literate. <i>The Feminine Universe</i> certainly exists in published form. The Wikipedia article does not come across as particularly partisan.</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> Based on all debate so far, it's highly likely this article will be kept. The problem I have with this is that the article as it currently stands is entirely unsourced. That is, we have no reliable sources on this. Out of print books by the head of this Aristasia movement/whatever, an online book by the same person, and other text on the woman's website, none of these are reliable sources. I tried to find info online on the channel 4 program on Aristasia, and I did find this: <a href="http://members.aol.com/bonfessee/cinema.htm" class="external free" title="http://members.aol.com/bonfessee/cinema.htm" rel="nofollow">http://members.aol.com/bonfessee/cinema.htm</a> While this source may not be the best either, according to it the channel 4 program was not about Aristasian philosophy, but instead about spanking and other BDSM activities. We seem to have enough info to state that this woman is a dominatrix, I suppose. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 13:02, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
