<p>Although artists have been active in printing and book production for centuries, the artist's book is primarily a 20th century form.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Artists%27_Books_f60a.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Inexpensive artists' books were an important part of several <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avant-garde.html" title="Avant-garde">avant-garde</a> practices that attempted to democratize access to art. The <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dada.html" title="Dada">Dada</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">surrealist</a> movements in the early decades of the 20th century produced an explosion of experimental publications by artists, as did Futurism and Russian Constructivism. Examples include 3-dimensional book-objects by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Duchamp_9a05.html" title="Marcel Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collage_novels.html" title="Collage novels">collage novels</a> of <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Ernst_0eb8.html" title="Max Ernst">Max Ernst</a>, as well as typographical experiments by F.T. Marinetti. Books were produced by members of the loosely affiliated <a href="../../../f/l/u/Fluxus.html" title="Fluxus">Fluxus</a> group beginning in the early 1960s, including artists such as <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Maciunas_a723.html" title="George Maciunas">George Maciunas</a> and <a href="../../../y/o/k/Yoko_Ono_397a.html" title="Yoko Ono">Yoko Ono</a>, whose shared values included an emphasis on ephemeral forms. Artists associated with the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_Art_48ce.html" title="Pop Art">Pop Art</a> movement of the mid-1960s, such as <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Warhol_b973.html" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Ruscha_360c.html" title="Ed Ruscha">Ed Ruscha</a>, produced well-known artist's books. Seth Siegelaub single-handedly propelled conceptual art into the world of artists books in the late 60s, publishing artists works as books that were exhibited in place of artworks. These included artists such as <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sol_Lewitt_aed6.html" title="Sol Lewitt">Sol Lewitt</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Barry_5a39.html" title="Robert Barry">Robert Barry</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Huebler_3534.html" title="Douglas Huebler">Douglas Huebler</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Weiner_cd4e.html" title="Lawrence Weiner">Lawrence Weiner</a> and many more. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conceptual_Art_0495.html" title="Conceptual Art">Conceptual artists</a> in particular went on to make a small industry out of artists' books. Contemporary and post-conceptual artists also made artist's books an important aspect of their practice, notably <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Wegman_6d8e.html" title="William Wegman">William Wegman</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_%26_George_48fc.html" title="Gilbert &amp; George">Gilbert &amp; George</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Kippenberger_c5ef.html" title="Martin Kippenberger">Martin Kippenberger</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Pettibon_ca0b.html" title="Raymond Pettibon">Raymond Pettibon</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s the artist's book began to be recognized as a distinct genre, and with this recognition came the beginnings of critical appreciation of and debate on the subject. Institutions devoted to the study and teaching of the form were founded (The Center for Book Arts in New York, for example); library and art museum collections began to create new rubrics with which to classify and catalogue artists' books and also began to actively expand their fledgling collections; new collections were founded (such as Franklin Furnace in New York); and numerous group exhibitions of artist's books were organised in Europe and America (notably one at Moore College of Art in Philadelphia in 1973, the catalog of which, according to Stefan Klima's <i>Artists Books: A Critical Survey of the Literature</i>, is the first place the term "Artist's Book" was used). Bookstores specializing in artists' books were founded, usually by artists, including Ecart in 1968 (Geneva), Other Books and So in 1970 (Amsterdam), Art Metropole in 1974 (Toronto) and Printed Matter in New York (1976). All of these also had publishing programmes over the years, and the latter two are still active today.</p>
<p>In the 1980s this consolidation of the field intensified, with an increasing number of practitioners, greater commercialization, and also the appearance of a number of critical publications devoted to the form. In 1983, for example, Cathy Courtney began a regular column for the London-based <i>Art Monthly</i> (Courtney contributed articles for 17 years, and this feature continues today with different contributors). The Library of Congress adopted the term artists books in 1980 in its list of established subjects.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, BA, MA and MFA programs in Book Art were founded, some notable examples of which are the BA at <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mills_College_71bf.html" title="Mills College">Mills College</a> in California, the MFA at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, and the MA at Camberwell College of Art in London. The Journal of Artists' Books (JAB) was founded in 1994 to "raise the level of critical enquiry about artists' books."</p>

<p>A number of issues around the artist's book have been vigorously debated. Some of the major themes under examination have been:</p>
<p>1. Definition of the Artist's Book</p>
<p>2. Where the artist's book 'should' be situated in relation to Craft and Fine Art traditions.</p>

As well as featuring presentations by New Jersey artists, the NJBAS includes extended considerations of topics deemed of moment to students and practitioners of the book arts. The NJBAS goes beyond state borders and invites presenters from all parts of the world to speak when their expertise dovetails with that year's topic. The Symposium has posted numerous web pages including a photographic essay on a recent symposium on the <a href="http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rulib/spcol/bookarts/intro03.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rulib/spcol/bookarts/intro03.htm" rel="nofollow">relation of artists and collectors of artists' books</a>.</p>

<p>Women's Studio Workshop is a major center for artists' books residencies and distribution in upstate New York.</p>
<p>The Center for Book Arts in New York City was founded in 1974, and since that time it has mounted over 140 exhibitions of artists’ books. It runs an active lecture series, provides services to artists (including internships, residencies, and apprenticeship programs), and currently offers over 100 classes and workshops in bookbinding, letterpress printing, paper marbling, typography, and related fields. It is “dedicated to preserving the traditional crafts of book-making, as well as exploring and encouraging contemporary interpretations of the book as an art object.”</p>
<p>The Franklin Furnace and Printed Matter were both founded in 1976, originally as one organization which quickly splintered into two projects: the Franklin Furnace as a major collection of artists' books; Printed Matter as a publisher and distributor. The Franklin Furnace Collection is now held at the Library of the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Printed Matter continues to publish and distribute artists' books, but also mounts exhibitions of artists' books, hosts book launches, and acts as an advisory service to both artists and collecting institutions.</p>
<p>Booklyn was founded in 1999, Booklyn is an artist-run, nonprofit organization headquartered in Brooklyn, New York. Booklyn's mission is to promote artist books as an art form and educational resource; to provide educational institutions and the public with programming involving contemporary artist books; and to assist artists in exhibiting, distributing, and publishing innovative bookwork. One of the major contemporary book artists living in Brooklyn is Doug Beube.</p>
