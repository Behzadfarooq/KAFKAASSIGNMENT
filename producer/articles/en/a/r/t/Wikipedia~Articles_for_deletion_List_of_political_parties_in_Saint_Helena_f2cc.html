<p>This article claims there are no political parties, so why exactly do we have a list of things that do not exist? <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 20:18, Jan 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>This article is part of a series <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_parties.html" title="List of political parties">List of political parties</a> by country, which includes every sovereign state and their dependencies. Therefore Saint Helena has its own article, thoughj it has at the moment no parties. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilfried_Derksen_4ed6.html" title="User:Wilfried Derksen">Gangulf</a> 20:39, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. That's fine that it there is a page of political parties by country, but this does not mean that every country listed needs a link. When they get parties, make a page. Otherwise, it's deceiving to send someone to a page and then tell them "gotcha!". Not Wikipedia-like. Delete it. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> 21:24, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Why not create an article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_with_no_politcal_parties.html" title="List of countries with no politcal parties">List of countries with no politcal parties</a>, redirect every <b>List of political parties in xxx</b> of countries with no political parties to that page, and enter that country as a list entry?. 132.205.45.110 22:17, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a good idea. I support anon's suggestion. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:50, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. A good article, informative, encyclopedic, well presented, and part of an easily-navigated, well-designed series of such articles. Yes, it could become a redir to a list of countries with no political parties, discuss these details on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Talk%7EPolitical_parties_in_Saint_Helena_a527.html" title="Talk:Political parties in Saint Helena">Talk:Political parties in Saint Helena</a> rather than here. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 23:20, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> This is really dumb. De-link Saint Helena from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_parties.html" title="List of political parties">List of political parties</a>, asterisk it as having no such thing, and you're done. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 23:25, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As a dependency St Helena obviously does posess political parties - those of the UK. Whether they are "active" or not in the territory itself is beside the point.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 00:59, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Also, even if it doesn't... another article that is still there can serve as evidence for keeping this one: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_parties_in_Palau_df85.html" title="List of political parties in Palau">List of political parties in Palau</a>, since <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palau.html" title="Palau">Palau</a> is an independent country without political parties. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 06:06, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, maybe when they become more notable and have something substantial perhaps, but as it stands nope. If there are no political parties as such, it should be de-linked. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 02:16, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, agree with Centauri, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_with_no_political_parties.html" title="List of countries with no political parties">List of countries with no political parties</a> should be established asap as well, just like how there already are other lists on Wikipedia of, say, sparsely populated towns (I think in particular of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_places_with_fewer_than_ten_people.html" title="List of places with fewer than ten people">List of places with fewer than ten people</a>). Just because most countries have political parties and this one doesn't, does not make it irrelevant; in fact, I would argue that the opposite is true. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 04:24, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So let me get this straight, we should have lists on subjects stating that the thing in question does not exist in a particular place? If you were making list of active volcanoes by country (i.e. List of active volcanoes in the United States, List of active volcanoes in Indonesia), would you make lists for countries that do not have active volcanoes that just say there are none in that country? What about baseball players? Would you make a page called List of Major League Baseball players from Rwanda? How about List of towns with Roman ruins in Mexico? Just because several countries, or even most countries, have things worth of listing, do we automatically make lists for every country vis-Ã -vis that thing? I am most eager to see this explained. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 04:56, Jan 21, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, for one thing, you have it precisely backwards: the reason for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_with_no_political_parties.html" title="List of countries with no political parties">List of countries with no political parties</a> is not its commonplaceness (like all the silly examples you cited), but its <b>rarity</b>. A better example would be, say, <b>NHL Players Who are African-American</b> or <b>NBA Players Under 6 feet Tall</b>. This point strikes me as so obvious I have to wonder how you could possibly have missed it. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 06:17, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, countries without parties are fairly common. --<a href="../../../s/e/s/User%7ESesel_cc8a.html" title="User:Sesel">Sesel</a> 02:17, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am not objecting to the list you mention, but rather the list that is up for deletion on Saint Helena (which is as silly as my examples). The fact that this is what I was complaining about strikes me as so obvious I have to wonder how you could possibly have missed it. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 06:27, Jan 21, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It has already been pointed out that St Helena does have political parties.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 07:55, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, or redirect to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Saint_Helena_7dac.html" title="Politics of Saint Helena">Politics of Saint Helena</a>, but I see no harm in leaving this here if it's part of a complete series. <a href="../../../s/j/o/User%7ESjorford_d4b9.html" title="User:Sjorford">sjorford</a> 11:36, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That sounds dangerously close to a personal attack Mr. Perhaps you should read a few wikirules and improve your mind-reading abilities before you try to discern the motives of others. I think you will find that you would come off a bit more polite and a bit less dense. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 21:17, Jan 22, 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>The expansion is good and I now believe it can be kept. I was never objecting to lists of this type, just to the silliness of a list that has no entries. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 03:31, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
