<p><b>Suburb Streets</b></p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The main reason for adding street pages to my suburb article is to create community. I am publicly proposing that members of our local community participate in this Wiki project so they can add thier collective knowledge of the history of thier street.</p>
<p>From my experience, every street has it's history, as does every family and I think this project provides the mechanism for them to document that. This ranges from previous property owners to various events. I feel this can be helpful especially in researching family history.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think your point of view might be that it's important to conserve articles so that they can be managed properly. I agree, conserving space and promoting managability is important, however, the alternative might be to have a whole lot of sub-headings within the main article and make the article very long. This has an effect on the usability of an online document in my opinion.</p>
<p>I welcome your comments and look forward to your reply.</p>
<hr />
<p>While I admire his efforts towards creating community, I wonder if he will be better of using something like blogger. He could then set up blog accounts for every family in his neighborhood to put up photos and the whole nine yards.--<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff">Gaff</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="purple">talk</font></a></b></small></sup> 02:53, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> the lot of them. Wikipedia isn't a project to document the history of every small neighborhood out there, and while I can appreciate his attempts to build a local community, that isn't Wikipedia's goal either.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I think that the streets section of <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beacon_Hill%2C_New_South_Wales_0242.html" title="Beacon Hill, New South Wales">Beacon Hill, New South Wales</a> could just be expanded to hold this information. If these somehow survive the afd, the titles need to be re-ordered. (Street first, then city, etc). The way it is now is completely unintuitive. Beacon Hill, New South Wales, Reynolds Crescent; Beacon Hill, New South Wales, Christopher Close; Beacon Hill, New South Wales, Brooker Avenue; Beacon Hill, New South Wales, Boyer Road; Beacon Hill, New South Wales, Spilstead Place also fit the form (some are already listed for speedy). <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 03:12, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Pains me to say it but <b>Keep</b>, add {{advertisement}} tag and rewrite. "Bigblueball" gets 140k results on Google, 100,000+ posts on their forum from 1,000 active members. Just barely enough to be notable... based on that. Seems to be a somewhat computer-literate site so that can hurt an Alexa rank a tad... people are less likely to be using IE/Alexa.

<p><b>Comment</b> Gator: I see you listed Bagging the bunny for a speedy delete. I propose that both artilces be kept with redirects back to the list of sexual positions.

<li>BTW, Bagging the bunny was similarly created as an article from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sexual_positions.html" title="List of sexual positions">list of sexual positions</a>.

If we decide that Cleaning the spoon is a redirect back to the list, then Bagging the bunny probably needs to go the same.

<p>This game was announced in a single mass-e-mail by one guy who was high-up on the development ladder. But he has since been sacked. There has been no word from anyone regarding this title, not even EA. This leads me to the conclusion that it started development but was canned. I don't believe we will ever see this, nor will we see Tiberian Twlight or Renegade 2, but at least those games had some details and concept art. RA3 has had a few lines announced by someone who doesn't even work for EA anymore. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerretgames_bb58.html" title="User:Ferretgames">Ferret</a> 15:15, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> There is nothing in this article that isn't a fact.

<li><b>visitor</b> About the Polish crown jewels. The original Polish regalia- Crown of Boleslaus the Brave (corona originalis) in 1733 was hidden. But elected king Augustus III was fully prepared for such possibly. He had a new set of regalia made in Saxony for his Polish coronation. The regalia included: crown of Augustus III, crown of his consort Maria Josepha, 2 sceptres, 2 orbs and 3 swords. He and his wife were crowned with them in Cracow in 1734. The regalia of Augustus III and Maria Josepha displayed in Dresden until 1924. In 1925 Polish Government purchased Augustus III’s regalia in Vienna for $ 35,000. The regalia were exhibited in Warsaw at 1939. In 1940 were stolen by the Germans. The crowns were found by Soviet troops in Germany and then sent to the USSR where they remained until 1960. In 1960 the Soviets returned the regalia communist Poland (PRL). Today are deposit in Warsaw's National Museum (not in public display).</li>

<li>The above comment is in reference to AfD on Danny Aquino.

<li>Big deal? Lots of people do stupid stuff all the time. Some of them go to jail for the stupid things that they do. Sometimes they pay their debt to society, if you will, then go on to lead productive lives. There is nothing about the topic of this article that needs to be noted in an encyclopedia. I'm not saying that it can or even should be deleted from every web-page, just that it does need need to be in an encyclopedia. (Frankly, the story is pretty uninteresting--not even the Rob Lowe scandal held public interest for long).<em>—<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff"><font color="Indigo">Gaff</font></a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="MediumSlateBlue">ταλκ</font></a></b></small></sup></em> 00:43, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Doesn't Exist. (hoax?)</b></p>
<p>I can't find mention of the "Federal Zapatista state of Chiapas" anywhere except here in wikipedia, and in all the direct copies of wikipedia. It's my belief that the Zapatistas don't, in fact, claim such a state.</p>
<p>What they <i>do</i> claim is that there are 32 autonomous municipalities inside Chiapas, but this article cannot address that, and that would probably be best done as a list of the specific municipalities, or maybe a category, and then mention in each of the municipalities articles (if they have been created).</p>
<p>No fixups will make this article useful if there isn't actually such a thing in existance.</p>

<dd>1) Notability. Having been mentioned in the New York Times, singled out for special notice in Library Journal, cited in <b>Wired</b> for her anti-PATRIOT-act activities, and being among the first bloggers in history to be given press credentials raises her above the bar for notability. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:29, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>2) With respect to vanity: she did not create the article. To most intents and purposes, I did, pursuant to what I would call a "badly executed article request" by an anon. I had never heard of her before an anon dropped in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jessamyn_West_%28writer%29&amp;oldid=11819770" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jessamyn_West_%28writer%29&amp;oldid=11819770" rel="nofollow">one-line substub</a>, "Jessamyn West, AKA the Rarin Librarian. One of Library Journal's Mover &amp; Shakers, West is best known for her 'blog, librarian.net." I <b>strongly</b> doubt this anon was Jessamyn West, because a) she already had a Wikipedia profile and had done some minor work on some Vermont articles; b) all of her public writing, in Wikipedia and her blog and in emails to me, is very literate and different in style from the one-liner; c) in an email correspondence with me she displayed a familiarity with Wikipedia policy with regard to autobiography and expressed reluctance to make any direct edits to the article because of vanity/autobiography concerns. When the one-liner landed on VfD I was shocked that we did not have an article on the Indiana author of <i>The Friendly Persuasion;</i> in the process of working it up I concluded that the librarian/blogger should also have her own article. In emails to her I told her that I did not think minor edits would be taken amiss, and she has made a couple, but she has not done any substantial work on the article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:29, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>NOTE on third nomination. I'm not sure what's going on here; I'm not going to participate in the edit warring on the AfD notice, but will point out that the particular template used is invalid; if this is to be listed for deletion at all it should be listed as a third nomination. For the record, my opinion remains unchanged: the subject of the article is notable for the reasons I gave before, and the lopsided "keep" vote on the second renomination in which only the nominator favored deletion and there were seven "keep" votes tends to support Tony Sidaway's judgement. The nominator should not use the word "vanity" to describe the article, as Jessamyn West did not create it and has made no substantial edits to it. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:07, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As politely requested by JesusSaves, I have reread the article and admit that it is now in far, far better shape than before. That's good. However, I still don't see why John Larney is notable -- frankly, I don't think that scout leaders, even well-established and popular ones, are significant enough to merit articles on encyclopedias without some other accomplishments or, as the case might be, notoriety. I am not convinced by the two references we've been given, for reasons stated very well by <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> below -- I would like to add to that that I'm quite willing to believe that Mr. Larney served aboard the <i>USS Brush</i> during the early sixties, I just don't think that's particularly significant -- if he had he been the commander of the vessel, for example, that might be another thing. That's really my biggest problem here -- the lack of significance. I'm sure he's a nice guy and all, but I just don't see why he merits an entry in an encyclopedia. There are lots and lots of scout leaders out there, and the vast majority of them are not notable enough for inclusion. That's not a criticism on them, it's just that of the well over six billion people living on this planet, a very small minority make enough waves in one way or another to merit an article about themselves. Is this guy a really major mover and shaker in the scouts? If he is, providing some solid references regarding his position and authority shouldn't be that hard. I have yet to see any. My vote to delete stands. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:19, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>"An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is presently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article, for instance see WP:MUSIC). Lack of fame is not the same as vanity."</p>
<p>So, the sole fact that the search string "John Larney + boy scouts" only procures 21 hits on Google does not consitute a valid reason for the deletion of this article.12.76.164.157 03:01, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think we have already determined that vanity is not a reason for deletion. If you think we are trying to "earn a merit badge" we are all over 18 and therefore considered adult leaders. We do not qualify to earn badges. I suggest that you reread the "Civility" section on your talk page, Calton. You obviously haven't got the point even though many have brought it up. <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.159.182.47.html" title="User:207.159.182.47">207.159.182.47</a> 02:48, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agreed. I suggest Carlton read over the "Wikipedia: Vanity" article again, since he clearly doesn't understand its contents at this point in time. Vanity is an invalid reason for the deletion of this article, and I find the deprecation of theBill and myself by Carlton to be completely unacceptable.12.76.164.157 02:59, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am an Australian Rover Scout, and although I believe that certain members of the world scouting communities hold a level of notablilty within the organisation and their home communities, I also believe that articles on Wikipedia for these people are unnecessary, barring <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Baden-Powell%2C_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell_15ed.html" title="Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell">Baden-Powell</a> and possibly some senior members of the World Scouting Organisation.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> first off, i would like to make it completely clear that I am unfamiliar with the puppet lingo happening and am in no such form or fashion a puppet of any kind. and on the note of blaming <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheBill_4afe.html" title="User:TheBill">TheBill</a> for using these so called puppets, can you prove that the former comments were made by puppets? probably not, so if you can't prove it stop pointing the finger at others who are innocent until proven guilty. Now, to the point. Just because you have never heard of a certain person does not mean that they are not notable within their field. For example, my grandfather was the founder and president of one of the most succesful trade show companies in the U.S. and if you asked anyone in the field about him they would most likely know who he is. However, if you were to google his name there are very few hits, maybe a family tree and a bridge club. But this does not make him non-notable whatsoever.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Have a look at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for the criteria a band should meet to have a Wikipedia page. We delete probably hundreds of band "vanity" pages a month. No agreement has been reached on what the notability criteria are for modern-day biographies, so those are often decided on a more case-by-case basis. Now, personally, I don't think Mr. Larney is notable enough to merit a page in our encyclopedia. That's not an insult - I am not notable enough either, and neither is anybody I know. Others may disagree about notability here (there are some who think notability isn't a criteria at all), and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> can be a useful tool in deciding cases like this as well.

<li><b>Keep</b>. "Meteu from Team Red Fox" brings up a good point. While vanity has already been disimissed as a nonissue, I think that Mr. Larney is noteable enough to justify such a biographical article. Its true that the article needs to be cleaned up, and is still a stub at this point, but I see no good reason to delete it.

I agree that being an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Arrow_4491.html" title="Order of the Arrow">Order of the Arrow</a> award winner isn't enough to merit inclusion in this encyclopedia. If that were so I would have a page along with over 100,000 other people. He is a DSA recipient wich is a very rare occurance. This is the highest award given by the Order. Imagine the prestigious Eagle Scout. It is completely worthless compared to the DSA. It is like the Medal of Honor for the OA.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes there have been 500 DSAs awarded over the last 65 years. During the Second World War which started in 1941 (for the US)there were 485 MOH recipients. That was in 4 years, much less than 65. Yet many MOH recipients have pages. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to degrade the MOH or say that a BSA award is just as good.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This article was obviously started as a joke, when you look at the history that is clear to see. But it has been cleaned up to actual information. In the Order of the Arrow, which is the honor society for the boy scouts and is in all actuality is an organization of its own, John Larney is a significant man. If this article was in its original form I would say delete it. But now it is a real article, and John Larney does have significance. To those who point out that they have never heard of John Larney, Ask you average joe boy scout who the adult head of the National Order of the Arrow is, Ask them who the President of the Boy Scouts is, most won't know those names either. You don’t have to know who someone is, for them to affect policies that have an effect on your life. As for the list of names that you think we should compare the worthiness of John Larney, I have never heard of any of them, and these are the so called people you are ok with. Also, the two examples I made the heads of the organizations, who hopefully you would even concede as being significant aren't even on your list for comparison. John Larney is active in a local lodge yes, but he is also active on a National level. As for the posters who think the 500 DSAs means they must not be all that important, because there are 500 of them, I must correct you. This is 500 people since 1940. There have been tens of thousands of people who have been in the Order of the Arrow, and even more in the Boy Scouts it self that do not have the award. It is the least likely award in the Order of the Arrow that you will recieve as a member. Finaly before I am bashed for this being my first post, I might add that I do use Wiki I just never bothered to type in it before. <small>{unsigned vote by User:Oa164}</small></li>

Gee is it so hard to believe that the same people that know John Larney and the same people who know TheBill are going to overlap in some cases. Do I know TheBill, yes I know who he is. Did he put me up to this, no. Kind of proven by his wanting to know who I was. Someone told me that this page existed and I thought cool I look at it. That someone wasn't TheBill. I then saw it was marked for deletion. I read the comments, I checked out the history of the page. And yes all on my own. If you read my earlier statement I would have dropped the article in a second do to the fact that it had a lot of stuff in it that was pure nonsense, and insulting to John Larney, but not because John Larney doesn't deserve a real mention. What is there now is a real article. A stub, yes, that can easily be expanded on.<small>{unsigned comment by User:Oa164}</small></li>

<li>That is kinda creepy that you guys are watching my every move! I merely asked who he was because in the OA there is a sense of Brotherhood. In fact it is one of our three principles. Is it wrong to make new friends? Also, as you point out in the quote you took off the talk page, I am a lodge officer and have been active with the organization for years. I know a great many people. It could be someone I already knew. We have vast networks that allow arrowmen from across the country to meet but sometimes we get lost because there are thousands of miles between us. It could be a way to rekindle an old friendship. There are many arrowmen that I would not consider "friends". Get something better to do than yell "SOCK PUPPET" every time you find out I have a friend. Maybe some of you should invest in those. TheBill 16:30, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

This appears to be essentially a messageboard where anyone can add info that they, relatives or friends served on the USS Brush. From this, we learn Mr. Larney's email address and that he is "selling real estate". This page, apparently editable by all the world, is not a reliable source for establishing facts about Mr. Larney. Source Two is <a href="http://www.ne1b.org/aboutus.php" class="external free" title="http://www.ne1b.org/aboutus.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ne1b.org/aboutus.php</a>, a page about the Norheast region of the Order of the Arrow. It does establish that Mr. Larney was awarded a DSA, and that he has staffed Section NE-1B's National Leadership Seminar (NLS). So that's a step in the right direction, I have to agree. At this point, the legitimately sourced info in the article is the following: "John Larney is a leader in the Boy Scouts of America associated with Old Colony Council and in particular Tisquantum Lodge 164 (249). He has recieved the Distinguished Service Award, the highest and rarest award given in the Order of the Arrow. John Larney has staffed numerous Order of the Arrow training sessions, including Tisquantum Lodge's annual Lodge Leadership Development (LLD), and Section NE-1B's National Leadership Seminar (NLS)." Trimmed down to that little info, you have to admit that's a pretty small page for an Encyclopedia. And there's not much hope for expanding it, that I can tell. Still, good-faith efforts are being made, and if you want to trim this article down to such a level, I'll retract my Delete opinion.

<li>" Trimmed down to that little info, you have to admit that's a pretty small page for an Encyclopedia. And there's not much hope for expanding it, that I can tell." I'd like to point out the following article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh_90" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh_90" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh_90</a>. This is a VERY short article about an obscure villain from an animé series. I just recently edited the article; it was less than half that length. Furthermore, there is almost no hope for the article to become any longer. Anyway, my point is that there is no outcry for the deletion of this article, yet there seems to be massive opposition to the existance of this article. How much sense does it make? 12.76.163.144 02:42, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharaoh_90.html" title="Pharaoh 90">Pharaoh 90</a> should probably be merged into some other article, but that simply isn't the topic of discussion here. There isn't "massive opposition" and "outcry" here, we're just a handful of people trying to rationally discuss an article, and one — I would nicely remind you — that started out as an apparent joke. But since you've brought up <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharaoh_90.html" title="Pharaoh 90">Pharaoh 90</a>, let me ask you a question: How many people, worldwide, do you think have heard of Pharaoh 90? Now, how many people, worldwide, do you think have heard of John Larney? I'd guess fewer, by a factor of thousands. That tells me something. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 03:31, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The point is not whether you can find webpages that mention John Larney and identify him as a Boy Scout leader who used to be in the Navy. We could find webpages that identify me as a math teacher who used to live in Africa. That doesn't mean there should be a Wikipedia article about me. Even though, as a math teacher, I affect hundreds of people's lives, and have power over their education, grades, etc, that doesn't mean I get a Wikipedia article. None of that is the point. The point is this: AFTER other sources write about a topic, THEN Wikipedia gets to. That's the most succinct way I can think to say it. Wikipedia just isn't where the very first article written about someone should be. If some other news source does a story on John Larney and why he's interesting, then Wikipedia can cite that source, and he's in. Until then, no. The sources that have been provided (4 links so far) confirm that there is such a man, and that he is who you claim he is - great. They aren't pages <i>about</i> John Larney, nor are they evidence that some segment of the world considers him all that notable. I'm just as well documented online as John Larney is, (and much less so than <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharaoh_90.html" title="Pharaoh 90">Pharaoh 90</a>). It's nothing against the guy, he just isn't a suitable topic for a Wikipedia article.

<li>I'm gunna go out on a limb and say they'd about break even. I have certainly never heard of this Pharoah 90 fella before now. This would be an example of someone who is well know within thier own circut (anime watchers). To tell the truth I don't believe cartoon villans have a place in this encyclopedia as they affect absolutely nothing in the real world. That being said that is my personal opinion which I shall not try to oppose here because frankly I do not have the knowledge in this field to determine whether he is a major figure within that circut. I ask that those of you who have little to no knowledge of American Boy Scouting, or the Order of the Arrow specifically, to extend the same courtesy. The purpose of an encyclopedia is to inform people of topics that they have little previous knowledge. the inclusion of this article definatly fits that descrition as none of you have this knowledge and we shall inform you if it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheBill_4afe.html" title="User:TheBill">TheBill</a> 04:15, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>In response to Captain Distains's comment on how the vast majority of Scout Leaders are not notable enough to be included, I agree. That is why I only nominate John Larney. If I was trying to nominate leaders who were not noteable I would nominate myself and TheBill. Sorry TheBill but you are not half as noteable as Larney no matter how much you think so.

<p><i>Does lack of fame make a vanity article?</i> <b>An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous.</b> There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article, for instance see WP:MUSIC). <b>Lack of fame is not the same as vanity.</b></p>
<p><i>Effectiveness of vanity articles</i> Vanity posters may post with the motive of increasing their own personal fame, or recognition of some group they are a part of. For this purpose, vanity articles are relatively ineffective. Most vanity articles receive few hits per month until nominated for deletion, and are possibly only seen by the user who nominates one. A vanity poster could theoretically increase traffic to his or her page by adding more links to it, and this is sometimes done — but it may risk earlier deletion of the page.</p>

<p>Non-notable. Only 8 students, none (no less enough to make the school itself notable) are mentioned as having gone on do do anything particularly noteworthy, and none are noteworthy enough to even be mentioned by name. The method isn't particularly noteworthy, as it's mostly just <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accelerated_Christian_Education_3003.html" title="Accelerated Christian Education">A.C.E.</a>, which has its own article. If this school someday inspires many similar schools that are cumulatively different enough from other ACE schools and otherwise noteworthy, this one <i>might</i> then become notable as having been the first.

<li><strike><b>Keep</b> at all costs.</strike> This well-written article is a perfect example of the dangers of subjectivist notability demands from "those who routinely nominate and vote to delete school articles".

<p>It isn't that this list is unmaintainable. It is that it is completely pointless! For those of you who don't know, the Revolution will be fully backwards compatible from Day One. All Nintendo games from the NES, SNES, and N64 will be downloadable, while there will be a sperate slot for Gamecube discs. The Revolution article covers this, and there is no need to list it out. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESonic_Mew_47a9.html" title="User talk:Sonic Mew">talk to me</a> 13:43, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually, I was pretty certain that NOT all games from yesteryear will be downloadable, myself... in which case a list would be handy. I say we <b>move</b> it to List of Old Nintendo Games for Nintendo Revolution, or something to that effect, and expand with that list of 221 games that was in... was it <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famitsu.html" title="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>?

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> - The reliability of this article in the future is high enough to keep it going and it gives an idea of what games are probable for download on the Revolution. Postponing it or placing it aside for later use would be a good idea, seeing as time will come when an article like this will be needed for access by the general public. Though, the article title itself is pointless because "List of Nintendo Revolution backwards games" isn't descriptive enough of the subject, which is speaking of the games (at this moment, possible) for download. The correct title should be "List of Backwards Compatible titles for the Nintendo Revolution". In that sense, whomever should <b>delete</b> this article, but <b>reserve</b> the development of "List of Backwards Compatible titles for the Nintendo Revolution" until needed. I might not be someone who actively creates and corrects articles on this site, but I am wise enough to speak of and know that this is the best possible decision for this case, which has no future but will have a present. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetal_gameboy_df3c.html" title="User:Metal gameboy">Metal gameboy</a> 14:05, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

Then this is certainly speculation, and should be deleted. I'm sorry, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not the place for speculation</a>. (Even if it was, I don't see any clear criteria for this list; how is Nintendo going to publish games for which the license for the licensed property has expired, as with the Indiana Jones games and Goldeneye 007?) - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:20, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b>!!!! So technically, this could be considered speculation, however, not every last Nintendo game will be avaliable, <a href="http://www.dreamstation.cc/news/video_games/id7135/" class="external text" title="http://www.dreamstation.cc/news/video_games/id7135/" rel="nofollow">according to a list based on a message by a Nintendo staff member listing all the games that will be</a>; but from what I've seen, the list is almost exclusively first-party games. Furthermore, I know of multiple first-party games that I don't see on this list. Unless there is an article listing each and every game that was released directly by Nintendo, we need to label this as being about future products or maybe merge it in a way with the main Nintendo Revolution article. Plus, shouldn't we name the few third-party games avaliable for download? Furthermore, there is some concrete information in this article and it should not be thrown away without doing anything first. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT delete this until you can confirm that it serves no purpose whatsoever. <a href="../../../o/k/l/User%7EOklonia_6a7a.html" title="User:Oklonia">Oklonia</a> 04:12, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I discovered Mordecai through my own genealogical research. He was a leader of the Catholic community in frontier Kentucky. The fact that Lincoln grew up in this community appears to be virtually unknown to historians, and may bear on several aspects of Lincoln's career. I am working up to writing this obscure history.

<li><b>Undelete</b> I created this article after seeing the movie and talking to friends who had played it before the movie had come out. Since originally deleted I have put more research into the phenomenon and as long as the page survives I promise to keep improving it. The game was originally created in the military (which is extremely interesting considering the "don't as, don't tell" policy.) I agree that most pop-culture is unencyclopaedic, but when it becomes a widely recognized part of culture the threshold of notability is crossed. This game has many particpants and even more who know of it, but don't play. A simple google search will reveal as much. I know it is crude/nonsense/offensive, but none of these take away from the fact that it should be considered knowledge. Instead of thinking that something shouldn't be in an encyclopedia because you don't know it, think that it should be in so people like you can learn about it. The benefit to Wiki is that anyone can contribute and it is fluidly updated every second. This could take years to make it into print, but in the mean time people will get their information from here. This is not vandalism, it is education and free speech.

<li>Sorry, but the above comment is just rediculous. I'm not even sure if the above user read the article, because if he did he would see clearly that Crust Punk is a subgenre of Punk Metal and that Thrash and Grindcore are related, but not considered part of Punk Metal. The term Punk Metal is widely used in the USA today in place of the old term Crossover, which has no meaning to the genre anymore. To say otherwise would show a lack of understanding of the history and future of the Punk Metal genre. Rocknrollfanatic 01:08, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Allmusic is not always the most reliable or accurate. They label Led Zeppelin, Blue Oyster Cult, Def Leppard and Bon Jovi as heavy metal. Their music is not necessarily heavy metal but hard rock.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Jobe I think you're forgetting the old uses of HM. Go back to the sixties and seventies, and you'll find "punk" was used for Blondie, and HM for Led Zeppelin. Some even say LZ was the first metal band, although Steppenwolf introduced the term, and LZ, Cream and Hendrix all contributed. As for Def Leppard, and Bon Jovi. I wouldn't call BJ (!) HM, but Def Leppard would count as a sort of Pop Metal part of the <a href="../../../n/w/o/NWOBHM_8473.html" title="NWOBHM">NWOBHM</a>, with the right riffs, and also certain subject matter (one of the original definitions of HM) including sex, violence, and the Apocalypse.

<li>A band does not necesserily belong to only one genre. Your assertion that Corrosion of Conformity are hardcore punk may well be correct, but a case could also be made for them being Punk Metal.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I personally think the <b>Great Glass Elevator</b> is more notable than the chocolate room, because the sequel uses the Elevator profusely and even has it as the title. Regarding this room, it's one of <i>my</i> favorites, and so it's the one I remember, but I think another person could just as easily argue that the nut room, say, made a much bigger impression on him/her. And then where does it all end? Therefore... <b>move and condense this information</b> to List of rooms in Charlie's Chocolate Factory (or perhaps a better title than that, but you get the idea.

<p>AMG hasn't heard of these guys and Googling the band's name combined with the styles of music the play, the state, and their home city in various combinations didn't turn up any worthwhile hits that I could find. They've put out one EP, and appear to be strictly a local band. They're about to put out a CD, which is good for them, but they don't seem to be anywhere near meeting the guidelines set forth in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> yet. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 03:00, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The Converted have played in more locations than the local towns they are from, they have played and are somewhat known in Philadelphia. The reason they don't appear on Google is most likely because they haven't submitted their site to Google yet. I mean, they're a punk band that is starting out, they aren't going to be all over Google or have a .com site yet. -- Necron99</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Necron, Wikipedia likes their articles to be verifiable. So they may have played in a lot of places, but if no reliable sources documented this, we can't prove it which is a basic requirement especially when it comes to articles on people and bands. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:21, 16 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, just having played in a lot of places isn't enough, as the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> guidelines illustrate. I can think of plenty of situations where an article about a band might be entirely appropriate even if they don't meet that criteria, but I don't think this is one of those cases. (And Necron99, you don't actually have to submit anything to Google; if it's being talked about in the net, Google's pretty good at finding it. If The Converted don't show up on Google, it's pretty much a sure thing that they aren't getting a lot of attention on the net. That alone is not the deciding factor, but it's certainly an indication that they aren't exactly turning the Maryland music scene upside down.) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 20:50, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

No. There are things that exist in this crazy thing called 'Lyfe' that google has never heard of. Know why? 'Cause they just made thier leap to the interweb hoping to find a welcoming audience to increase thier fanbase on an interesting site known as 'wikipedia'. What do they find? Disbelief. Persecution. <i>Libel</i>, I might add. to quote the good cap'n: <b>"they don't seem to be anywhere near meeting the guidelines set forth in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> yet."</b> Well, this is simply not true. To quote the article he was so quick to name, but obviously hasn't read, rule number 6 reads thusly: <b>"Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop)..."</b> Well, I, as a resident of Chestertown, Maryland, I would like to say for all of us that The Converted is the most prominant representative of Ska/Punk/Crust Punk/Death Metal of Chestertown, Maryland. Thus, according to the rules of Wikipedia, laid down by the most venerable whoever, The Converted's page is in fact, allowable on this site. <b>--Converted Fan 198</b></li>

<li>I used to live in Chestertown and The Converted really are what some peoples lives revolve around. Whenever there is a show announced with The Converted the kids in the town have something to look forward to in life. Being that the town is full of rich, old conservatives who dont really allow the local bands to play, being them shutting down the local venues and replacing them with offices. Another reason that one might not find info on The Converted "turning the scene upsidedown" is because the local paper probably doesnt write shit on them, probably because its run by the same rich old people. And I agree with Converted Fan 198 in that Google really doesnt know all. Google can really only cover so much. -TheRussianZombie</li>

<li>Apparently there never was an AfD tag on the page, but since it's now up for a <b>speedy deletion</b> as nonsense, that's kind of moot. I'm still pointing it out here, because User:Lady_telle already removed the speedy tag from the article once... actually, now that I look at it, she linked that in from <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treasure_Hunt_6bcb.html" title="Treasure Hunt">Treasure Hunt</a>, apparently as an example of a first clue.

<dd>Verifibility is important to wikipedia articles.

<p>I can definitely say that I've heard of the game. I found two guys playing at a pub in Sydney and looked interesting. I went over to find out what was happening and they invited my to play - the three player version definitely exists as the article here states (though not using the 2 of diamonds as the dud). When I next spoke to my sister (who is studying in Melbourne), she said that she had also played with friends of hers. I can't explain why it does not come up on the internet, it must be something that passes by word of mouth. That said, I have definitely heard of it and do not think that it should be deleted.

</ul>
<p>To correct Jzeltzer, I am a semi-professional bridge player who is very familiar with card games. I recently competed in the 10th World Junior Bridge Championships held in Sydney. On the sidelines of this very important tournament, titbow was played as a social game to release the tension from the day's bridge. It is well known within bridge playing circles and amongst people who are experienced card players. This is no hoax. Daniel Krochmalik 211.30.0.195 01:45, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey i live in Sydney. I know alot of card games but have never heard of it. Dont really see the problem though. The game has clearly been played (by virtue of the rules themselves), it makes sense, and i cant really think of one like it. I think I'll even give it a go - looks classic. It is truly remarkable how many games can be played with a standard deck of 52 cards. It would be great if wikipedia could be a testament to this remarkability.

<li>Am not sure why this is being considered a hoax - it would seem like a lot of effort has been made just to make a false addition to the Wikipedia. If there are clear rules, and people admitting to playing, then surely the game exists and should be included. Or am I missing the point? If so, could the detractors please explain why it should not be included, rather than just calling it a hoax. For the record, I have played Titbow with Uni friends in Sydney and it is an awesome game. <b>Keep</b> --Yun thai wang 11:25, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey, I'm over at the uni of wollongong.

<li>This is the writer of the second part of the article. I suggest a compromise.Let us write a good article together in which all opinions are represented. You can add your ideas and I can mine. As I wrote to Brazzy, general deletion is not a typical way for scientific dispute. Other articles in the wikipedia show that a more conservative biological view and a more progressive sociological view can coexist in harmony (e.g.,wikipedia "race". Please take note of the fact that I got discontended when Brazzy deleted lengthy parts of the article without a serious discussion just as he cancelled Dr. Christoph Neumann's contribution concerning the sexuality of the Nadeshiko Yamato.But sexuality is an important aspect of the Japanese conservative female archetype. It is very easy to label someone a racist who strongly claims that he is none, e.g. all my statements about Blacks and Asians are positive ones: the high efficiency of Asian societies; the freedom of Chinese anthropology where b o t h the Boasian and the conservative view can be discussed; the "womanly" looks of Indonesians and Filipinas on average concerning anthropometrical measures no-one can seriously deny. My part of the article is descriptive and I never suggested any actions against any group of people I mentioned. I respect all the groups and authorities in the article.I never evaluated them ("good","bad" etc.) That some people consider some statements as not flattering does not mean that I did not like or respect any of the mentioned groups or authorities.I am a professor of anthropology and I my contribution to other anthropological articles in the English wikipedia were explicitly welcomed by others (e.g.concerning the direct involvement of the AAA in secret service activities). So let us together build a new article.

<li>Hi Haeleth, I will provide you with good references of course:</li>

<p>1.)Knußmann,Rainer, Handbuch der vergleichenden Anthropologie und Humangenetik,1996, 2.ed.; there are more male and more female-paedomorphous races; higher aggressiveness of bigger, heavier women;virago recent beauty ideal; viragines seek female men as mates 2.) Baker,John Randal, Race, Oxford University Press,1974;there are significant racial intelligence differences;some races are more female-paedomorphous than others; there is no orthogenesis towards civilization,phylogenesis is not identical with ontogenesis, only 4 Europid societies reached independently the stage of civilization, the Sinic is uncertain, the Mayas and Incas had a significantly lower culture not being civilizations 3.)Lynn,Richard,IQ and the wealth of nations,2002;African Blacks have an IQ of about 70 4.) MacDonald,Kevin B., A people that shall dwell alone, Separation and its discontents,The Culture of Critique, the hidden Jewish agenda behind Boasian anthropology and multiculturalism 5.) Langdon,Kevin passim for big differences of male and female IQ 6.)Bem;Sandra, inluential theory of androgynity (or better viraginity)promoting the interests of the viragines in the name of minimizing violence in society;doubtful because viragines are more aggressive than normal women 7.)Johnston, Caryl, American sociologist, making allegations of a primarily Jewish background of modern feminism on her website 8.) Lieberman et. al. studying the attitudes towards race and conservative biological explanations throughout the world. Please study these works and the website carefully as a basis for a serious discussion. An overwhelming amount of information is given supporting my view.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It's important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There is plenty of room for a good article on this sociosexual phenomenon, and I believe that the pre-truncated article was a good start. Clearly we are dealing with some racist overtones here - any mention of a "hidden Jewish agenda" rightfully deserves to be greeted with hoots of disdainful laughter, and is not appropriate in the context of this discussion even if it were legitimate. However, this is a legitimate topic and deserving of more than just a dicdef. I'm really choking over those "references" though - I can't believe that some of them represent anything like mainstream thought. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:02, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Let us take Boasianism.Boas invented Boasianism nearly alone, he had a strong Jewish identification, nearly all of his mainly Jewish students became deans and influential anthropologists at American universities, Boasianism first controlled the USA making mass immigration possible, after 1945 it controlled the world except China (s.Lieberman,Littlefield, Reynolds). There were no other important factors that facilitated mass immigration to the US. Boas and his students were the key factor with a 90% responsibility if someone would like to have a number. "Disdainfulful laughter" about the truth is I think inappropriate.If you can show that the above statements are wrong, then you might laugh. Have you examined all books in my bibliography carefully? I don't think so, so please do this first.You write that you are a "disciplined deletionist", maybe you become a "serious reader and scientist",too.E.g. John Randal Baker is dealt with in the wikipedia article "race", too,as an important contribution to anthropology, Littlefield, Lieberman and Reynold wrote primarily a documentation.</p>

<li>Takara is a big cheese in the world of Japanese toys, for example they sell the popular "Licca" doll.
