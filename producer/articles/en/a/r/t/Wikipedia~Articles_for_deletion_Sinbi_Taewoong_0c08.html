<dd><b>Comment</b> - Would you mind to check the gallery on his homepage, he is well known in Thailand under the fighter name of Thopadak. You can see his photo on 16 covers of Thailands Muay Thai magazine alone (see gallery). You can find nearly 100 articles in newspapers that are scanned and in the gallery showing his photo, interviews, etc unfortunately if you can not read Thai you can not understand the articles, but you can see the photos in the newspapers.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>He did fight K-1 only once so far (the loss against Kalakoda in K-1 was controversial, check the video and you see why), but he is a KOMA champion of 2005, photo on his homepage proving this (champion belt worn on photo) but in Japan for example someone who fought K-1 is a celebrity as it is, since there are not that many people who have fought K-1 events overall.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by G00dgirl (<a href="../../../g/0/0/User_talk%7EG00dgirl_d7e2.html" title="User talk:G00dgirl">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_G00dgirl_ee0d.html" title="Special:Contributions/G00dgirl">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Searching Google with the keyword "Thopadak" it lists 7 (!!) hits, from which 3 are fansites. If he's so popular why there aren't several Thai pages (.th) that says his name? Not even Thai Wiki mentions him. Maybe you can provide us his Thai name with Thai characters? <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi"><b><font color="#78866B">Lajbi</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/a/j/User_talk%7ELajbi_4318.html" title="User talk:Lajbi"><b><font color="#C3B091">Holla @ me</font></b></a></sup><small><a href="../../../s/n/o/Snoop_Dogg_0d8a.html" title="Snoop Dogg"><b><font color="#808000">Who's the boss?</font></b></a></small> 12:11, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Thai pages would not contain his name in transliteration but most likely in Thai language. You can find his name written in most of the newspaper articles that were scanned if you know what to look for, the name in Thai letters is spelled as follows: ต.ปฏัก. He has not been fighting under that fighters name since he fought in Bangkok. In Thailand fighters adopt the name of the gym they train at. He has been fighting as Sinbi Taewoong for Taewoong gym in Korea in the past few years, for example when he won the KOMA championship in 2005 and several other fights in Korea, but I have no idea about Korean language to know the name in Korean letters. He is going to fight K-1 again this year after going to hold seminars in South Africa.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by G00dgirl (<a href="../../../g/0/0/User_talk%7EG00dgirl_d7e2.html" title="User talk:G00dgirl">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_G00dgirl_ee0d.html" title="Special:Contributions/G00dgirl">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>Fine for me. But still cite that he's a champion in References section. I saw his video on k-1fans that was so low quality handycam-made one (thus unofficial) that you can't even recognize which one is him. But as it stands right now the page will survive the nomination. Don't forget to vote here also, because as a creator of the page you aren't restricted to do so (I don't knwo if you aware of this. And sign your posts with ~~~~ four tildes, instead of the <i>unsigned</i> formula. But keep expanding the article towards notablity in place of the over-detailed biography. Are you a childhood friend of Sinbi? You know how much he weighted at the age of 9 and claim that you made the photo of him...But still remain objective. Best wishes and good luck for editing. <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi"><b><font color="#78866B">Lajbi</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/a/j/User_talk%7ELajbi_4318.html" title="User talk:Lajbi"><b><font color="#C3B091">Holla @ me</font></b></a></sup><small><a href="../../../s/n/o/Snoop_Dogg_0d8a.html" title="Snoop Dogg"><b><font color="#808000">Who's the boss?</font></b></a></small> 13:50, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone in the k1-fans forum has also posted a link to that address before. I am a fan and friend of Sinbi and met him personally, yes.

<dd>Still I must say that notability and creditability of the artcile is questionable as "ต.ปฏัก" drop 5 hits on Google from which one is an XLS Excel document and the pages would need proper translation. The article doesn't have (and as I see can't have) references stated there. For example how can you justify the statement that he was 25 kg at the age of 9? Is it possible in any way to cite this? I don't think so... <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi"><b><font color="#78866B">Lajbi</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/a/j/User_talk%7ELajbi_4318.html" title="User talk:Lajbi"><b><font color="#C3B091">Holla @ me</font></b></a></sup><small><a href="../../../s/n/o/Snoop_Dogg_0d8a.html" title="Snoop Dogg"><b><font color="#808000">Who's the boss?</font></b></a></small> 14:05, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sinbi is shown on a photograph with the KOMA champions belt on his website (<a href="http://sinbi-taewoong.com/images/stories/sing_koma_champion.jpg" class="external free" title="http://sinbi-taewoong.com/images/stories/sing_koma_champion.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://sinbi-taewoong.com/images/stories/sing_koma_champion.jpg</a>). Someone who did not win the event does not get to pose with the champions belt on. The fighting record is so extensive, that even Sinbi himself did not keep accurate count of all the fights in his life, I did not want to put inaccurate figures into the box. The official K-1 page lists his K-1 fight on the following page, they spelled his name Shin Bi, see</dd>

<dd>Lajbi, I think you're relying too heavily on google results, here. Thailand is not as wealthy or internet-savvy as many countries in the Western world.

<dd>Ok, then books maybe? ISBN whatever. We need other sources than his own home page. Until then it has to be removed...And K-1 is heavily backed up with whatever info you want. It is highly popular in Germany and also has media coverage in the US. If he's a notable fighter (apart from that one loss) there must be some reference. If not nobody cares about him, that's because he is so non-notable. There are a bunch of people in boxing for example that can be hired to be beaten up.

<li><b>Neutral</b> for the information, his Thai name ต.ปฏัก ส.จุลเสน. His first name, ต.ปฏัก, is the homophone of the 15th Thai alphabet, (ฏ.ปฏัก).

<li><b>Weak keep</b> It's a close call, but I'm going for keep. Here's his homepage: <a href="http://sinbi-taewoong.com/" class="external free" title="http://sinbi-taewoong.com/" rel="nofollow">http://sinbi-taewoong.com/</a>. Apparently he has been in a couple of thai articles and on some frontpages. He's also a thaiboxer, does anyone know if he has done any fighting at the Rajadamnern stadium or the Lumphini stadium? He's noted on the K-1 site so I guess he qualifes the policy <i>"Sportspeople/athletes who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States. Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad are worthy of articles."</i>. I give it a weak keep as long there's some clean-up. Btw, Lajbi, he said on his web-page that he took his first fight at the age of nine. It's quite common in thailand to fight at an early age. I'm not logged in, but I'm the user NoNo. --84.217.155.207 17:42, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
