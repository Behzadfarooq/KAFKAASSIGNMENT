<p>At first, I thought this was a simple db-bio; the entry has a lot of POV, and reads more like a CV. The author then supplied this to the talk page:</p>
<p><i>Individual directly referrenced here: Disc jockey - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey</a> Individual founder of this program: Computerized Performance System Disc Jockey - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_Performance_System_Disc_Jockey" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_Performance_System_Disc_Jockey" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_Performance_System_Disc_Jockey</a></i> <i>This individual has been featured in all DJ related publications and has written for EQ magazine.

<p>so now it's not an obvious candidate for deletion, but still debatable.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Since the event with which he is associated in the two linked articles took place for the first tmie this year, that does not in itself denote notability. There is a fair bit of hyperbole around this, but it doesn't look to me as if this guy is actually all that notable once you clear away the smoke and mirrors.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Agreed article needs cleaned up. If you review the overall program it was established in Atlanta 2000 – In 2005 it held a major Summit in Tampa, Florida (3rd annual - 1st stand alone - not first ever) which deserves consideration historically and reflects longevity. This afternoon I tested the esteem issue and phoned the American Disc Jockey Association, National Association of Mobile Entertainers, Canadian Disc Jockey Association and both the Canadian and United States Online Disc Jockey Association – Professor Jam is not a member of these groups - yet all 3rd party referenced him as an industry pioneer in computer DJing with utmost respect – The referenced event is a result of dedicated industry development with years of foundation building. – As the worlds 1st professional endorsed computer DJ (mid-late 1990’s shared endorsement with Niles Rogers) you will find direct and in-direct participation with development of - PCDJ (industry mixing tool) Numark (hardware controller for software mixing) Peavey (hardware controller for software mixing) Denon (products in development) and other industry revolutionary tools– Once you clear away the smoke and mirrors you find an industry pioneer in computer DJing. - Good press kit agreed - but most entertainers have the same. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.144.102.176 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.144.102.176.html" title="User talk:24.144.102.176">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.144.102.176_637a.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.144.102.176">contribs</a>) 17:04, 9 November 2005.</small>

<li>Why not sign your passionate defense? Why not link to websites that support your claims? I found little information other than local gigs. What I did find was rather distasteful. He once posted a copyright notice to his personal website that attempted to charge $7000 for brief quotations or paraphrasing its content, payable immediately. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 19:30, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I find it rather distasteful to post something with no relevance to the issue to belittle an individual’s ethics and/or credibility. Are any of you involved in the Computer DJing industry? Just curious because I’ am.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I did a search on the Summit, Computer DJ Summit and Professor Jam (I personally attended the gathering in Kentucky in 2005 and the Summit this October in Tampa Florida but you seek online reference)… Was the true beginning of the now established CPSDJ Summit in 2001? Was and is Professor Jam relevant to the history of computer DJing? Here is a searched response from an industry networking forum: <a href="http://www.djchat.com/boards/showthread.php?t=15178" class="external free" title="http://www.djchat.com/boards/showthread.php?t=15178" rel="nofollow">http://www.djchat.com/boards/showthread.php?t=15178</a> It seems the discussion began in 08-16-2001, 11:28 PM for a 2001 event hosted by Professor Jam. Here is another link with reference to a 2002 event held in conjunction with the Mid-America DJ Convention. The Summit was hosted by Professor Jam <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/com3362/w02/archive/0114.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/com3362/w02/archive/0114.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/com3362/w02/archive/0114.html</a> At the original site I found a supportive archive conversation that includes the show promoter in the discussion started by Professor Jam dated 03-01-2002, 09:47 PM <a href="http://www.djchat.com/boards/showthread.php?t=22828" class="external free" title="http://www.djchat.com/boards/showthread.php?t=22828" rel="nofollow">http://www.djchat.com/boards/showthread.php?t=22828</a> This industry site: <a href="http://www.computerdjsoftware.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.computerdjsoftware.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.computerdjsoftware.com/</a> reference Professor Jam and says: “We're glad to see some long time professionals taking the lead in this area, and Professor Jam (whom most have heard his name), has had a big hand in moving this along.” -----By many of your posts you have never heard of him or question his credentials. Did I already ask how many of you are active in the Computer DJ industry and know who is who? <a href="http://forums.djcafe.com/odja.pl/noframes/read/393" class="external free" title="http://forums.djcafe.com/odja.pl/noframes/read/393" rel="nofollow">http://forums.djcafe.com/odja.pl/noframes/read/393</a> I phoned Professor Jams office at (727) 817-1671 and was told he in Orlando at the LDI convention then will be in Atlanta GA for the IAAPA convention till the 18th. Others have contacted them on the conversation here and elsewhere and as soon as I have a response I’ll post it here for review. Is Professor Jam one of the pioneers of computer DJing? Instead of taking the opinion of Goggle searchers like me - learn more about our industry and it's history - We're young but making a major impact and I sure would like to see it have more positive exposure without being looked upon as Napster illegal music downloader’s – JMHO "How do you self sign these posts"</p>

<p>So far, of the two 'keeps', one was written by the original author of the article and the second is unsigned (with no reason given).
