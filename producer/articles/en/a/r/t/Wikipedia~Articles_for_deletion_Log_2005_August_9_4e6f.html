<p>This page should not be deleted, though the person that the page is documenting is not at this point in time very important to American society his life is one of the average American story, which is timeless. The very thought that the people here at Wikipedia are so unpatriotic as to delete the very essence of the American story is quite disturbing at this time of national hard ships. I hope the people here at Wikipedia can realize the mistake they would be making and change their mind on the subject.</p>

<dd>I'm not familiar at all with the history of engineering but I'd wager that if such a man as Schluter had existed, led the way in some areas of engineering design, had helped design the Titanic and had been blamed in part for its sinking, then at least one webpage other than wikipedia would mention his name. I wish the nominator could provide more information and make things clearer (before nominating the article he/she blanked it and replaced it with a similar claim) as to how they came to realize who was behind this article. So based only on the virtually nonexistent google results in comparison to the hyperbolic language/claims made in the article I'll vote <b>delete</b>. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMidnighters_8ade.html" title="User:TheMidnighters">TheMidnighters</a> 23:10, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>comment</b> I'd like to apologize for the way I've been conducting this affair. I had wished to remain anonymous, but from the discussion and further reading of the wikipedia policies makes it clear that I shouldn't. I attempted to sign up, then realized I had already signed up a long time ago. Anyway, a 90% efficient heat engine is far beyond anything that has ever been created. Additionally, the creators of this article, who I know offline, were bragging about the realistic nature of their hoax, but I don't have a way of proving that to you.General Nuke Em</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. If what the article seems to be saying about them pioneering rock/ballads and appearing regularly on two channels is correct, then they're certainly notable. It would be nice, though, if we had someone familiar with the Peruvian music scene around to confirm/deny their notability. They only get 160 Google hits, but that doesn't necessarily mean very much when talking about a Peruvian band that was big thirty years ago... If it is kept then it will clearly need a great deal of cleanup and work, which is another problem given the difficulty of getting information about them. Still, even if it was almost exclusively in one country, a band that has had genuine influence and exposure does deserve to be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 11:16, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> How can you consider yourself Australian and not have known Chris Daley! Regular viewers of the local Channel Nine news in Perth will have most certainly noticed the often controversial "'Daley' Diatribe" segment of the news. He is a prominent figure throughout the Australian television industry (for his notable contributions) AND the Australian army (for his dedicated service). Whilst it may seem suspicious that I have signed up recently, after viewing the comments related to Chris Daley's reputation, I felt I had a duty as a patriotic Australian. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWW_Rusty_Gates_9ccf.html" title="User:WW Rusty Gates">WW Rusty Gates</a> 12:33, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks! I can assure you I'm not a sock puppet... whatever that is. I only dicscovered Wikipedia a few nights ago and while I was browsing around a Reserves advertisement came on TV. Out of curiousity I checked to see if he had an article, and was surprised to find that it was up for deletion. So I decided to join up to vote yes, and then figured, "Why not add to the encyclopaedia while I'm here?" I'll definitely be a regular contributor. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChozza_539e.html" title="User:Chozza">Chozza</a> 09:41, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Apart from Chris Daley, the only military articles I've edited involved the presence of the SAS in Perth. It obviously didn't belong in the "transport" section, and I couldn't figure out where else to put it, but it was still notable. So I created a "Military Presence" section and put some other things in there to fill it out a little.

<li><b>Keep</b> (well I may have an axe to grind as I worked on it, but...) It is of interest to a reasonable number of Singaporeans and other overseas Chinese. If she disappears we can always do a VfD later. In the meantime people who are interested can look her up on Wikipedia. As for the blood type, for some unknown reason blood types have become important in East Asia. It is thought to be a determiner of character. Some Japanese companies test applicants these days and it is important when it comes to dating and marriage. There is no good reason for it as far as I can see, but the sort of people interested in the article will be interested in the fact.

<p>A POV attempt to portray the European Union as a country with its own culture, geography, education system, sports, etc, in a similar way to the article Life in the United States.

<li><b>Keep</b>, there's no false or unverifiable information, the subject matter is certainly notable, and it doesn't say that the EU is a country of its own. Europe does have its own culture, geography etc, at least to a certain extent. And while the integration process continues, this becomes more and more of an issue (at least hopefully). - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 12:03, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Europe may have its own culture and geography, but the European Union doesn't.

<li>Of course it does. And the people in Sweden, Italy and Ireland all have the common denominator of being citizens of the EU (both officially and in practice), and everything that the article states applies to them. And you must see yourself how odd it sounds to claim that there's no life in the European Union. - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 12:21, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Nowhere in the article does it imply the EU is a country or a monolithic culture.

Merging with <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> (which deals primarily with its institutional and technical aspects) is not a good idea as that page is already too long. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 16:02, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I certainly don't think the EU has any monolithic identity beyond the overt structures, but I don't think this article contradicts that, and I don't really see it as POV.

We have portals, we have articles for the countries, regions, unions, etc., yet for some reason we need yet another article to explain this with far fuzzier terms.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - There is not such thing as "life in the European Union" in a way that there could be "life in Denmark" or "life in Ireland". "Life in the European Union" suggests that citizens of the different member states are part of a single community, the way that nations or towns are.

<p><b>Keep</b>. To put it bluntly: I don't see that we should have criteria for 'notability', period. Quality of material (as in accuracy, objectivism, etc), lack of advertisement, and keeping meta-articles clean, sure. But deleting something just 'cause it's not popular or it's currently too stubby? No. <a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaizai_eaca.html" title="User:Saizai">Saizai</a> 09:19, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Even if we ignore notability, it's not <b>verifiable</b> without some kind of original research; all the information available about it is from the language's creator. That's what my comments on my vote, above, were about. See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConlangs_Notability%2C_verifiability%2C_merit%2C_completeness_9263.html" title="Wikipedia:Conlangs/Notability, verifiability, merit, completeness">Wikipedia:Conlangs/Notability, verifiability, merit, completeness</a> for recent debate on this. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Henry_39b3.html" title="User:Jim Henry">Jim Henry</a> | <a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Henry_6fb9.html" title="User talk:Jim Henry">Talk</a> 11:21, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Indeed. Look, Saizai, there are thousands of constructed languages around, most of them are merely sketches that are abandoned by their creators after a short while. We surely don't want entries about all of them, so we have to draw the line somewhere. Now, I tend to be rather inclusive and tolerant, but still I think sóme significance is required. In the case of a conlang that could be: a certain number of users, a book that at least mentions it, some proof that it has evoked discussion in academic circles, or whathaveyou. This language simply doesn't meet any of those standards. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 06:57, 17 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, I see two points here. First off, I can understand the "verifiability" clause... for most other items on Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>HOWEVER, conlangs are in my opinion different in a way that makes this not just unnecessary, but exclusionary. Verifiability by definition is so that you know that the info is good, the thing being written about actually exists as described, etc. With a conlang or other work of art, it is 'self-defining'. If the author posts the conlang, ipso facto, it exists as described. Any talk of "verifying" it - e.g. by others talking about it, etc. - goes solely towards 'notability'.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So that bring up my second point. I don't see reason to exclude things from Wikipedia for notability. If it's small and not particularly interesting, then don't mention it in the main articles, or in the more exclusive "these conlangs are interesting/notable" lists. But there is no reason I can understand not to have an article about it for whatever it's worth, or to not include it on an all-inclusive list. So I only support "notability" for that 'alone': determining what to include in high-level / central articles. (And FWIW, I would support including as an article even sketch conlangs, if there's anything to say about them, so long as they don't cause namespace problems [e.g. colliding with something important] and aren't included on "notable conlangs" lists.) --<a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaizai_eaca.html" title="User:Saizai">Saizai</a> 15:28, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page essentially rehashes information available in lots of other articles to no apparent purpose. In particular, the purpose of this page is served by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United_States</a> article and the multiple subpages such as <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_the_United_States_a6a3.html" title="Culture of the United States">Culture_of_the_United_States</a>, etc. etc. linked from there. My concern here is that there is now yet another page that has to be updated; if someone modifies the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United_States</a> article's entry under the subheading "Culture", for example, she then has to go over to the Life in the United States article to update the equivalent section. The article has been around for nearly a year with almost no real edits, and it seems that most wikipedians have chosen to ignore it anyway. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 16:21, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Imagine an article about the founder of the largest textile, closing and knitwear company in Australia, Canada, the UK, or the US, one whose contribution to his or her country was great enough to be awarded a national honour, and to be honoured by one of the premier universities. That sounds like an article that would be worth keeping.

<p>To: Wikipedia</p>
<p>The article about Roy Neuberger should be deleted immediately for the following reasons: it contains a malicious, personal attack on Mr. Neuberger and his son, Roy S. Neuberger, and entirely falsifies their relationship - which is close and not at all estranged - and contains anti-Semitic overtones. Mere editing will be insufficient, because the earlier version would always be accessible. The article is causing family members great pain and must be deleted; it serves no good purpose to let it remain online. The attached article contains accurate information about Mr. Neuberger and should replace the deleted article.</p>
<p>Sincerely, James Kaufman Esq. Attorney for Roy R. Neuberger and Family 70.110.155.253 18:39, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Roy Neuberger</b> (born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_21.html" title="July 21">July 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a>) is an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financier.html" title="Financier">financier</a> who has contributed to the cause of public awareness and publicity of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_art.html" title="Modern art">modern art</a> through acquisition of painting and sculpture and donation of many pieces of art to educational institutions and museums. He is the founding partner and eponym of the investment firm <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuberger_%26_Berman_22f4.html" title="Neuberger &amp; Berman">Neuberger &amp; Berman</a>.</p>
<p>Neuberger was born in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgeport%2C_Connecticut_494c.html" title="Bridgeport, Connecticut">Bridgeport, Connecticut</a>, and spent his childhood in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>. He was orphaned at the age of 12. He describes himself as having been interested during high school in tennis and "the ladies". He matriculated at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_University_dca5.html" title="New York University">New York University</a>, originally to study journalism, but grew restless and dropped out without obtaining a degree.</p>
<p>His first job was working at B. Altman's, then the leading <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> department store. There he learned the ins and outs of business.</p>
<p>Leaving his job at Altman's, he sailed to Europe at age 20 on an inheritance from his parents and went to live in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>. He lived his <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian.html" title="Bohemian">bohemian</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roaring_Twenties_f9df.html" title="Roaring Twenties">Roaring Twenties</a> existence there, where he visited the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louvre.html" title="Louvre">Louvre</a> three times a week and met his lifelong friend <a href="../../../m/e/y/Meyer_Shapiro_267a.html" title="Meyer Shapiro">Meyer Shapiro</a>. He studied art in Paris and throughout Europe.</p>
<p>In 1928 he read Floret Fels' biography of <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Van_Gogh_ee92.html" title="Vincent Van Gogh">Vincent Van Gogh</a>. Neuberger was startled when he learned how Van Gogh had only sold one painting, and was heartstricken to learn that Van Gogh, like so many other artists, had lived in pain, poverty and misery. Thousands of excellent artists were suffering in obscurity and the world might never know what they had created. Neuberger wanted a way to give deserving but unknown artists a chance at fame, recognition and financial success.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, Neuberger decided to go "where the money is." He moved back to the United States and entered <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_9499.html" title="Wall Street">Wall Street</a> in 1929, seven months before <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Tuesday_4d0f.html" title="Black Tuesday">Black Tuesday</a>. He started out with the firm of Halle &amp; Steiglitz and sold RCA shares short, right through the stock market crash at the beginning of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. He founded Neuberger &amp; Berman in 1939 with Robert Berman. By then he was in a position to make his first major acquisition, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Hurd_0ef5.html" title="Peter Hurd">Peter Hurd</a>'s <i>Boy from the Plains</i>. He allowed <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Rockefeller_e416.html" title="Nelson Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a>, another avid art collector, to use <i>Boy from the Plains</i> in a travelling American art exhibition. Rockefeller's exhibition travelled to <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>.</p>
<p>Among the other major artists whose works Neuberger collected are <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_Pollock_e5b4.html" title="Jackson Pollock">Jackson Pollock</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Shahn_a351.html" title="Ben Shahn">Ben Shahn</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Baziotes_c594.html" title="William Baziotes">William Baziotes</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Calder_7e5d.html" title="Alexander Calder">Alexander Calder</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuart_Davis_1e09.html" title="Stuart Davis">Stuart Davis</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Eilshemius_e386.html" title="Louis Eilshemius">Louis Eilshemius</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Hopper_da4d.html" title="Edward Hopper">Edward Hopper</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Lawrence_30b9.html" title="Jacob Lawrence">Jacob Lawrence</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Levine_b10f.html" title="Jack Levine">Jack Levine</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Smith_dbf7.html" title="David Smith">David Smith</a> and especially <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Avery_23a4.html" title="Milton Avery">Milton Avery</a>. Neuberger purchased dozens of Averys, the first of which was <i>Gaspé Landscape</i>, which he bought during a snowstorm. The artist wrapped it carefully to protect the canvas in the way home. It still hangs in Neuberger's apartment to this day.</p>
<p>Neuberger also began donating works to institutions, among them the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_e36a.html" title="Metropolitan Museum of Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum_of_Modern_Art_08fc.html" title="Museum of Modern Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> and the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitney_Museum_1230.html" title="Whitney Museum">Whitney Museum</a> as well as many college and university museums.</p>
<p>Neuberger's friend and fellow collector Nelson Rockefeller, when he became governor of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> arranged for the donation of a substantial portion of Neuberger's collection to the state. To this end, he established a Neuberger Museum of Art as part of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_University_of_New_York_41c3.html" title="State University of New York">State University of New York</a>. Designed by architect <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Johnson_44b5.html" title="Philip Johnson">Philip Johnson</a>, the Neuberger Museum opened on the SUNY <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purchase_College_7286.html" title="Purchase College">Purchase College</a> campus and opened in 1974.</p>
<p>Neuberger was married for over 60 years to the late Marie Salant Neuberger, also a distinguished patron of the arts. Together they had three children and many grandchildren.</p>

<p>Page is allegedly about "an amazingly significant person who has contributed a lot to society and anti-chavness. However, in order to preserve an air of suspense, all other details about her are to remain enigmatic." After I speedied it with a nonsense tag, the following was added: "This page speaks the truth (although not very much of it), and not patent nonsense. Nor does it express vanity, as this article was written by another," and my speedy removed. Obviously entirely non-notable. <b>Strong delete</b>. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 19:41, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

If the author happens to read this, I'll point out that an assertation of notability must include what the notability in question is. It's not enough to just say "n is notable" and not say why or how.

Presenter of a local radio station in the UK (<a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_96.3.html" title="Coast 96.3">Coast 96.3</a>), and possibly a minor role in TV series <a href="../../../b/a/n/Band_of_Brothers_d495.html" title="Band of Brothers">Band of Brothers</a>. In addition, it should be noted (although it's not reason for deletion <i>per se</i>) that the article has been prone to vandalism by the page creator (an anonymous IP) since the outset. The current article contains large amounts of information which I believe to be totally make-belief. <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 19:55, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> "Unnotable person" is a little harsh, I think "not notable" is a bit better. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicahmn_743a.html" title="User:Micahmn">MicahMN</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMicahmn_1f20.html" title="User talk:Micahmn">Talk</a> 20:02, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I would agree with you there, it's just that I don't believe most of the material probably is true. If you note the edit history, it is almost entirely written by an anon IP, and statements seemed to be being changed in a contradictory manner. From Google (ignoring references to Wikipedia) I can only see that he's a presenter of Coast (and as such not notable imho). Could be wrong though... anyone got any sources of him having done anything more significant? If he did have a role in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Band_of_Brothers_d495.html" title="Band of Brothers">Band of Brothers</a> it would seem it was extremely minor... <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 21:25, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

As for this Ant chap I've found him discussed in several forums (mediauk) and the Daily Star archive seems to back up the Robbie Williams claim. As for Band of Brothers I have the DVD box set and searched through it last night - no sign of him there. Is it possible he has a stage name? richardIII 11:18, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> I never noticed the word 'notable' in the list I linked from, and would not have added the page there if I had. I mentioned Stonehenge as the nearest geographical point non-local people would recognize, not because it makes me significant. This was not an exercise in ego , just an experiment, one that taught me an awful lot about the people here. Get rid of it. Incidentally, Capall Bann might be a small publisher, but it is very highly regarded by the Pagan/Wiccan community both in the UK and the US, and they do list both books. They certainly don't deserve to be referred to as "these people". Peter Paddon, Aug 11, 2005

<li><b>Comment</b> writing a page on yourself is at the very least pretentious - thats what user pages are for, you are free to write whatever you like about yourself there. But apart from that, my main reason for nominating the article for deletion was the blatant advertizing and POV. Wikipedia is NOT a forum for free advertizing of your DVD products. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllegrorondo_9648.html" title="User:Allegrorondo">Allegrorondo</a> 19:15, 12 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> In case you hadn't noticed, I have also voted for its deletion - I'm new here and didn't know about user pages until recently, or I would have done one of those instead. I'm not arguing that the page violated policy - I'm just commenting on the uncivil manner in which people have responded, which is also in violation of the policies here. Believe it or not, I wasn't trying to advertise my DVDs.. I just found something new and fascinating, and played with it. I should have done that in the sandbox - I can say that with hindsight - and I would have deleted the page myself if this deletion process didn't prevent that (another thing I didn't know about). So I 've learnt a lot about this place, and I've also learnt that there are some who are quick to heap sarcasm and derision where a simple "this is not allowed" would have sufficed. Let's just say it has soured my desire to participate in this any more. I'm just checking in to see if the page had been deleted, and hopefully it will be soon. Peter Paddon, Aug 12, 2005</li>

<li>The two things are unequal. Anybody can watch schoolwatch,whether he intends to vote delete or keep. There is no electioneering. Here, on the other hand, as one of those solicited says herself, was a case where you went to a past delete voter and asked him if he'd vote delete. You only went to the people you thought would vote the way you wanted. Schoolwatch is public and doesn't go around people's talk pages soliciting votes. I don't think this article will be deleted, however, even with your vote packing. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 20:28, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Gateman and I have reached an agreement on this; we are both focussing our efforts on schoolwatch, which has been edited (and should continue to be edited) to remove anything that might be described as advocacy of either deletion or keeping of listed schools. The archive will continue to be updated but predictions will no longer be made. The parent page has had pro-keep wording removed. We both think this is better than each setting up competing pages that would duplicate effort. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:37, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>This is why we need an official guideline or policy established for schools. The two sides will never agree. We need Wikipedia as a whole to set the criteria one way or the other because there obviously is no true consensus right now as most school votes seem to be going 50-50 or close to it. While that may be enough to keep most articles, it's not consensus. <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 18:08, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If there is no agreement, how can we have a schools policy? In general I think it's fair to say that school discussions have been going more like 55/45 against delete for some time now (with particularly interesting articles getting 60/40 and more). I think it's quite possible that there could be substantial change in the long term future, and if this happens then we can talk about a schools policy. Meanwhile it's probably a bad idea to list schools articles for deletion; it's much, much easier to just clean them up. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:18, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Whilst I don't want to be spammed with a VfD reminder for every VfD I've ever voted on in the past, I wasn't <i>that</i> offended I received a solicitation, and viewed it more as a good faith human watchlist at work. If it become routine though, I'd probably leave in frustration&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> | <a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">Talk</a> 05:08, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And just when we thought we'd put the solicitation thing to rest above. Someone goes and steps over the line again. I propose this VfD be closed and it be relisted again as I believe that this VfD's vote is entirely tainted (due in part to me and now <a href="../../../y/u/c/User%7EYuckfoo_5ab6.html" title="User:Yuckfoo">Yuckfoo</a>). <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 06:00, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think this is bad for Wikipedia no matter who is doing it. <b>I've asked Yuckfoo to join our voluntary agreement not to engage in electioneering.</b></dd>
<dd>I propose that this VfD be left to run its course and the closing administrator (who of course will not be anyone who voted on it) will be perfectly capable of making his mind up whether it's better for Wikipedia to let it stand or relist it.</dd>
<dd>Personally I see nothing to be gained over relisting a single article, though I would not oppose an early relisting of this particular article <i>after this VfD is closed</i>, if it is kept in this particular situation. I would also support an appeal on <a href="../../../v/f/u/WP%7EVFU_e156.html" title="WP:VFU">WP:VFU</a> if it is deleted, though I would not make one in the light of recent events.</dd>
<dd>What we do next is about more than one single article, it's about the kind of Wikipedia we want to have. I don't want one in which open vote warfare becomes a commonplace. Whilst I am convinced that such techniques, if practised by both sides, would marginally benefit inclusionism, the effects of such warfare would be to damage Wikipedia and I would not condone that. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:58, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Delete: Any item in an encyclopedia should be referred to by a group outside of its own participants. If an item is referred to only by its own participants, then it is jargon or argot or slang or cruft. However, when a subject appears in <i>multiple referential contexts,</i> it will need discussion and explanation. Hence, fanfiction, fanmaps, etc. are not appropriate encyclopedic fare unless some context other than fans (e.g. getting on the 6 o'clock news for being scary), it is inappropriate content. On the other hand, there are specialist-oriented sites on the Internet that thrive on such material.

I had suggested maybe even moving something like this to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikisource.html" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a>, but his response was to create this page. I'm not suggesting bad faith necessarily, as I don't recognize this person and I think he's new -- but regardless of motivations, I think the page should not be retained on Wikipedia itself as the information, which is essentially raw data, is easily accessible through a link. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 22:56, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The first link suggested for the vote in the house is helpful. What it would be helpful would be some information on which states the Representatives are from. For example, how many voted for the bill (or against) from Texas? or California? The data is not very useful without some analysis. The link to the Senate does not work at all. I pointed this out to Katefan0 on the talk page for the main article. The page she is referring is also without analysis and it takes a while to discover the voting patterns of the senators. Wikisource does not seem to currently include records of votes on bills. Even so, without anaylsis, the data is unnecessarily time consuming for each individual to repeat analysis that one person can provide (and others can edit). The <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005_Vote_b348.html" title="Energy Policy Act of 2005 Vote">Energy Policy Act of 2005 Votearticle</a> is not complete as to the House would take more time to analyse. It does not include Senate Yes voters, because it is obvious that all those who did not vote in the minority voted in the majority. The purpose of this page is to reveal the whole truth regarding the senate vote, whether an individual is for the Act or opposed to it. I would like to hear Katefan0 explain the harm to the users of the wikipedia (or the wikipedia itself) caused by having additional information in this type of an addendum article. I personally do not understand her concern. In addition, since the original article is short, it seems like this information should be added back into the original article. I am not convinced that this <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005_dbcc.html" title="Energy Policy Act of 2005">Energy Policy Act of 2005</a> article will be a lengthy treatise anytime soon. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmericanus_21c9.html" title="User:Americanus">Americanus</a> 02:03, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If you would like to see the effect of DotA's popularity, try the Google search again. Defense of the Ancients wikipedia page shows up as number 7 for a search on "Defense of the Ancients". Mind that Google searches are based on the relevance of the page to the search input and also the popularity of the page, which is based off of the number of links to that page. I think this indicates that many people <i>do</i> in fact refer to the wikipedia page for information and I think this is exactly what an encyclopedia page is meant to do. If people consider the information on the page useful and reliable enough to link to it and visit it, I think that the page deserves to be kept. I urge the voters to read the policies and suggestions under Wikipedia general policy pages and find a compelling reason that this page should be deleted. Otherwise, no matter how stupid you think the topic is, enough people find it useful that this page does its job as an encyclopedic page, and that is our ultimate goal.Gatekreeper 03:28, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: this article might make do with a improvement/editing the point of view to exclude the technical details. However, do consider that Tides of Blood is less of a following than dota, and ToB has far less content than our current edition of the dota article.

<li><b><s>Strong Keep</s> Keep but Clean</b> The quality of DoTA or the intelligence of its players is irrelevant. Unlike what discombo claims, DoTA is significant enough in its own right. It occupys much of the custom game list, <a href="http://sg.worldcybergames.com/ocg_010.html" class="external text" title="http://sg.worldcybergames.com/ocg_010.html" rel="nofollow">has achieved WCG recognition</a> as almost a game in its own right, and is so very widely played I believe this article will even be useful to people outside the fan base. DoTA is still encyclopediac and not just a "fan map". To use an analogy, Counter-Strike is also a "fan map". But what is important is that gameplay is significantly different, and it has such phenomenal success that this article is relevant to players and non-players alike. I do agree the article has tended to go off tangent or have uneven focus though, needs less technical details.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Does it matter if it's a little esoteric? Wikipedia helps people learn about topics they've never heard of before. DotA is popular within a certain community and has its own share of fanatics; people will be curious about it and there's absolutely no reason for Wikipedia to be vacant of useful information. And Debrolgie was right: this is closer to a game in its own right (like a mod) than the conventional "map" where the same old rules apply to a different terrain. This page even informs DotA players about the game in general better than anywhere I've seen on the Internet. The Warcraft 3 mechanics info certainly does apply to the regular game and other custom maps; however, the information is particularly pertinent in DotA where micromanagement is the key, where a player can elsewhere succeed in ignorance of it.

<li><b>Comment</b> It's not used at the moment. At least two people have had the idea, AND have posted such an idea to Wikipedia. This means that somewhere else in the world, there are people like myself who not only realize that such a creature should exist, but also that it should gain attention. It has caught on in individual minds, and been repeatedly stomped out by the users of Wikipedia because the people attempting to present it, like myself, have no clue what Wiki is about, quite obviously. Wikipedia is not a place to share new ideas, but to share old ones. Halfbakery is a place to share new ideas that nobody plans on actually bringing into fruition. I'm imagining sourceforge is a sort of place to bring about programming ideas that people plan to do things with. And perhaps FreshMeat is the place to bring the completed projects to test their 'wilderness survival rating', and gain enough support so that they can gain recognition on Wikipedia. Forgive my impertinence at scrawling a witty footnote in your encyclopedia. I realize only now that one can't change history by editing the history books. Wasn't quite sure what this place was, I guess. Feel free to delete.

<li><b>Delete.</b> I would originally have felt inclined to mark it for copyediting, but a cursory Google search doesn't turn up any references for the subject. Sadly, I must vote delete; it is clear that said anon has obviously put a lot of effort into the article, and Google searching doesn't show it to be a copvio. Nonetheless, clearly original research, and thus must be deleted.</li>
<li><b>Establish source, or delete.</b> This looks to me like a paper someone wrote for another purpose and then pasted into Wikipedia. Now, if we can establish that (a) the content is sufficiently documented to be considered <i>not</i> original research, and (b) the author of the piece is willing to release content under the GFDL, I see no reason for a (considerably) revised version to appear here. -<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuapaquin_67bb.html" title="User:Joshuapaquin">Joshuapaquin</a> 00:32, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
