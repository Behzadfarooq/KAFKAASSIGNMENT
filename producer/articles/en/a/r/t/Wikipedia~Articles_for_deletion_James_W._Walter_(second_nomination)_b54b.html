<li><b>Delete</b> as previously, an ad campaign doesnt make someone notable, especially since its during the 9/11 rush where everything related to the twin towers had articles about them, including a pizzaria that appeared on channel 9 and the NYTimes. Being mentioned after 9/11 for anything should be weighed heavily, its one of the most publicized events in the US history and everyone down to janitors around the location were interviewed, starting an ad campaign asking for evidence obviously gets you in the news, however it does not make you notable. WP:BIO is a guideline and this person is obviously not notable. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 18:37, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Good, glad to see honest reconsideration of the article (even in the case if your vote did not change). However, even when the evidence is obvious for a keep, there are some who will still vote delete simply due to the topic. It's always the same editors, the same who bring forth what might be construed as bad faith AfD's. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead"><b><font color="green">*Sparkhead</font></b></a> 01:33, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Given that the article was substantially rewritten but the original AfD had passed the five-day threshold and could easily have been closed as delete, it was closed and relisted so the article could be considered on its revised merits. This nomination is entirely different to the first AfD, being made by myself as a neutral admin on a technical basis rather than by an editor who objected to the content of the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm changing my vote from the previous nomination because the rewrite has persuaded me that this is useful and notable information that can be presented with a NPOV. Per the argument that 9/11 nutcases are non-notable, I would respectfully note that the whole concept of 9/ll conspiracy theories is now notable. I would suggest an umbrella nomination for merging, or an acceptance that this article is effectively a spun-out part of the larger (and notable) topic of 9/11 conspiracy theorists. I ask myself: will people now and in the future want to read articles about the topic of 9/11 conspiracy theories? I can only answer 'yes' to that question, so the point here is to keep the material, but find the right home for it. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 22:42, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - technically this is not a second nomination. It is a re-listing of the first nomination. The page has already been created, but if this comes up again at some future point (if the article is kept), then that future case will be the second nomination. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 22:42, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Okay, let's see, three assertations of notability. 1) He's so-and-so's son. No, fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Next. 2) Bought an ad campaign (about as notable as buying a pack of gum) and was humiliated in passing on a single episode of <a href="../../../b/u/l/Penn_%26_Teller%7E_Bullshit%21_bd5b.html" title="Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!">Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!</a>. No, fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Next! 3) He was a founder of the Walden Three. Well, the Walden Three article was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Walden_Three_0595.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Walden Three">just deleted for being non-notable</a>, ergo his creation of it is non-notable.

<ul>
<li>The Bullshit! paragraph was added by someone voting Delete just above you, I agree with you it is trivial, and Walden Three and the "son of" are not notable in and of themselves. However, the assertion of notability is not any of those things, and not even the award or campaign itself, rather <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person." - separate articles for the ads, and the site, and the awards, by the New York Times, Der Spiegel, Reuters, and ABC. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 23:16, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I have to agree with the others about the issue of an ad campaign making someone notable. That was easy for Walter to do by the way – offer to reward someone for accomplishing the impossible. This like some common person offering a $100,000 reward for proof that man has not set foot on the moon. Any takers? If Charlie Sheen did this, big deal. He was notable before the reward offer, unlike this crackpot. Fails notoriety. Maybe if he did something really worthwhile he could have an article.

<dd>Really? Can you tell me about the 14th Earl of Someford, in England, who lived to the age of 30 in England and died circa 1520 AD, and did nothing notable in life, yet has a Wikipedia article that is uncontested? Because your statement is a hollow one. Notability is established in policy. Published or written about in multiple non-trivial works. This man qualifies. Any opposotion to our policy therefore, and all above deletion "votes", as that is all they are in truth, can be safely disregarded by the closing admin as politically motivated. Non-policy based reasons to delete should have no validity (and it is from following this all on multiple articles) past time that the AfD process by permanently in writing modified to reflect that. Note that this is not a lapse of AGF, but simple fact, based on observed AFD behaviors and pattens by certain Wikipedians. · <font color="#0518A7"><b>XP</b></font> · 18:46, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Replying to AnonEMouse: Isn't it lucky that some of the people voting delete changed their vote to keep.
