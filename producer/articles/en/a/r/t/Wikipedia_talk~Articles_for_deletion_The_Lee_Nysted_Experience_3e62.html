	    <p><b>Comment</b></p>
<p>With all due respect to Tony Fox, and the concept of "weak keep" <b>in re: The Orchard</b></p>
<p>To quote Wikipedia: "...A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, DJ, musical theatre group, etc.) is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable.1</li>
</ul>
<p>o This criterion includes published works in all forms,..."</p>
<p>Ergo,</p>
<ol>
<li>.) There are 15,000 (Google:Lee Nysted) such articles out there in Google about Lee Nysted and "The Lee Nysted Experience."</li>
<li>.) The rules and guidelines are quite clear. I believe the (who do we distribute) artist roster says enough about the issue at hand. "COLD PLAY" (The band) is on THE ORCHARD. Does Cold Play have a Wikipedia site? They (The Orchard) is/are the 5th largest label in the free world. To say they are not legitimate is like saying G.E. is not a corporation because they own 3000 companies. (Please look at the "digital partners." e.g., Starbucks, iTunes, Rhapsody, +14,000 more.)</li>
<li>.) The rules and guidelines and criteria for inclusion are very clear. There is no "weak" keep because it is one of the "any one" of the following. "Any One" is quite black and white. There are several, not just one.</li>
</ol>
<p>The criteria doesn't include an asterisk saying Lee must be signed to SONY.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and patience, Lee Nysted</p>

<dd>Yes, Orchard has a large list of bands they DISTRIBUTE. I personally think of a record LABEL as something that signs bands, works with them on record production, markets and distributes their work through record stores, etc. - <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_label.html#Relationship_with_artists" title="Record label">like so</a>. Orchard distributes things for other labels and indie artists. If people can pay them for distributing their stuff (and that's my interpretation, nobody else's), I don't know if I can call them a label in the vein of WP:MUSIC. Now. "Lee Nysted" with the quotes comes up with 5000 or so Google hits. that's not bad. Looking through the top 50, I don't see much in the way of non-trivial independent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>; I do see a lot of sites where information about musicians can be submitted, and a lot of copies of a press release. Can you point towards some non-trivial media coverage for us to peruse? My weak keep indicates that I feel your work with other established artists is just above the line under WP:MUSIC. Show me some media coverage, and I'm happy to reconsider. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 23:27, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>COMMENT:</b> NEW SITES UP FOR ALL TO SEE. As the original author of this article, and the subject of numerous false claims about my relationship to Lee Nysted and his company, I have asked CLEAR CHANNEL and NYSTED MUSIC to put up dozens of verifiable and reliable sources of "notability," for all to see. Further, I have asked that they add names and links for people that do not want to go to the net. Thank you for being objective in your search for the truth about a very fine artist. I am a fan of Lee's for many years. C.H. 1-20-07 <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntress829_1301.html" title="User:Huntress829">Huntress829</a> 02:19, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b></li>
</ul>
<p>There is no justification for the statement about "self published." See below. Not one of the two articles up for deletion was published by me, my family, or any employees of Nysted Music, LLC. My label, THE ORCHARD, and over 15,000 articles pertaining to the said band, speak for themselves. The idea that this "delete vote" stems from MySpace, is very troubling to me. I do not frequent MySpace, however, my employees do, and have had several threats from that site, about this very issue.

   Attn. Administrators:

<p><br />
I authored the original article "The Lee Nysted Experience"</p>
<p>I am no relation to Mr. Nysted and I do not work for him. I am not getting paid to do an article about him.</p>
<p>"Clear channel" intervened on Lee's behalf because, for whatever reason, someone is not following the guidelines and rules of Wikipedia, and they continue in their attempts to delete a legitimate musician, singer, songwriter, band, ensemble, etc.</p>
<p>I have no problem with the changes that Stephen Dewart did to this article. He seems reasonable.</p>
<p>The verification is, in fact, accurate as are the sources. (Add THE ORCHARD as a Wikipedia source.)</p>
<p>Repeat: Please note that THE ORCHARD, Lee's label, has a page here, in Wikipedia. (Use that as a verified reference, please.)</p>
<p>My sincere hope is this: Wikipedia cannot be manipulated by some "popularity contest" stemming from an avalanche of votes against inclusion. Can anyone vote? Help ! Administrators, and people in charge???</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p><b>Comment:</b> I think everyone can read the guidelines and see that your "only possible criterion" is simply not true. Please use Google and Google Lee Nysted.</p>
<p>If out of all the 17,000 items, you want Clear Channel to post a few of them here, that can be arranged, but probably isn't very wise. If all you want is "any one" item, you have plenty of choices. "Studio and touring drummers" is the correct answer. Walker is touring right now with Morrisey. See Wikipedia article. Todd Sucherman is touring with STYX.</p>
<p>Both drummers are touring drummers, however the guidelines and criteria do not say that if someone is noteworthy and they break a leg, they do not qualify. Not to be overly dramatic, but who is kidding who here? LOL.</p>
<p>Go by the rules or make up new rules? Hardly seems like this would be an end all fact source, if you and I could make up rules as we go along. Further, there is no question as to the "noteworthy" part, is there?</p>
<p>Lee will tour, and all players have expressed a desire to do same. In the bio addendum to the article, we will go into that. C. Hunter</p>

<dd>For the record, "Lee Nysted Experience" with the quotes gets 55 Google hits. Lee Nysted, with no quotes - which means you get hits for 'Lee', 'Nysted' and 'Lee Nysted' - gets 17,000. As I said before, the editors who are debating here would like to see some of the reliable sources that are available out of the Google hits to help determine notability. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 02:43, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comment: Google is not a reliable source, per Mr. Dhartung.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lee_Nysted</a> 15:15, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> Re: citicat and Tony Fox</p>
<p>Both of you are trying to write new rules for Wikipedia; it is not seemly.</p>
<p>1.) The original article that was the target of vandals was under Lee Nysted. That name is now frozen, here. He is the artist; leader of the ensemble. All artists participate in the ensemble. Obviously the preference would be to have the article under Lee Nysted. However, the ensemble fits and should be the ultimate recepticle site of the Lee Nysted name on this encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Lee Nysted gets Google adwords directed from all sources containing the name Nysted. They all go to Lee Nysted.</p>
<p>2.) To delete because of a one time "news archive" is not valid because of the "all types" part of the criteria as stated over and over above.</p>
<p>The criteria clearly states "all types" of published works" of media, including digital media. There are posted reviews on iTunes, Amazon, Rhapsody, e-music, Napster, and on thousands of sites. Sorry citicat, but google says it all.</p>
<p>If this site is looking for unbiased reviews, Clear will provide hundreds. Radio is also broadcasting. The point is, to meet the criteria additional excercises are not even necessary. Wikipedia is supposed to give users an information resource. Reliable and quick.</p>
<p>My question is: Could anyone open a Wiki account and speak about this issue? Would the opinions matter?</p>
<p>Who is the decision making body?</p>
<p>This is a great test for us.</p>

<dd>Uh... beg pardon? I'm looking directly at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. I (who I should again note opined weak KEEP back there someplace) still haven't seen a reliable source whatsoever about the artist, which I've asked for three times now. There's nothing in my comments that's trying to rewrite guidelines, nor Citicat's. As to your question about new users, yes, anyone can comment on an AfD discussion, but most of the time the opinions of established users are taken into consideration to a greater degree than those who may have registered specifically to comment on that particular topic. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 05:00, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Tony, forgive me for being short with you, or anyone here. Bless you for taking your time to do this; please do not think that your question is being ignored. Maybe I just do not know what you are talking about? How can the resources shown not be considered reliable?</p>
<p>There are thousands of articles accepted here with far less than what Clear Channel has provided. Is AMG a reliable source? AMG is on Wiki Is THE ORCHARD a relaible source? AMG is on Wiki Is iTunes? same Is Amazon? same Is Rhapsody? " Is Google? "</p>
<p>The links to reviews such as Muzikmanreviews.com  ???</p>
<p>Reviews on the above?</p>
<p>Orchard develops artists and artists do not pay Orchard unless they sell records.</p>
<p>Which comes first? To have the line-up that this band has is hard to ignore. Stephen hasn't even gone to the Scott Bennett connection. Scott was on the Smiles GRAMMY with Brian Wilson. Scott is on the current album.</p>
<p>I will look at this over the week-end and call on some experts on Wikipedia. This whole thing is so frustrating because I truly believe it has been initiated by some people that have the wrong motives for the deletion of an article about a guy who has played for over 40 years.</p>

<p><b>COMMENT:</b> Do not consider that CLEAR and Lee Nysted are partners here; I resent the insinuation that this is some conspiracy. On the contrary, the largest radio station system in the world is picking up Lee's music. Address me, if you like, but please do not make assumptions that are not in keeping with your rules here.

<p><b>Comment:</b> I have spent 15 minutes looking at this site, and I have spent about 20 minutes looking at the sites people have put up about me on "MySpace." No laughing here, not out loud, for cetain. I have learned a very painful lesson about what I, as a father of 3 girls, must face in a world that seems to lack morals and dignity at every turn. I am grateful to be here and by God's grace, I will watch my children grow up. I was nominated for 3 Grammy awards and made it to the 3rd tier. I was grateful, even though I do not know who nominated me for "Gospel." I am a voting member of NARAS. The only way someone gets that right? To qualify. To qualify I had to go through far more than this inquisition is requesting. The information provided herein, is accurate and more than enough to meet the Wikipedia guidelines established before this article was written. My information is reliable and it is accepted all over the world as reliable. Now, I will go back to my life and my family. God bless all of you; happy new year.</p>

<p>I see you have been here since July 2006. We are expected to "believe" people at face value here. The original article in question was here long before you got here. It is entirely possible that you are one of the myspace users that came here on a witch hunt? Please stick to the facts and do not make this article into a myspace type brawl. I find your arrogance and lack of proofs, to be astounding and insulting. You have been proven wrong in your accusations and yet you fail to admit it. Look at the companies that represent M.R. Nysted's music. AMG, is only one of nearly 10,000. THE ORCHARD is not a "fly by night" label. All of our discourse is going out on the internet. I pray a person in charge here, will intervene and help create an article that will stand as The Rambling Man stated, so politely. <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntress829_1301.html" title="User:Huntress829">Huntress829</a> 17:17, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Note</b>: Mr. Ohconfucius, I see you did not withdraw your false claim above about Lee being "self published" even though it has been disproved over and over by reliable sources, as shown in the reference. Out of courtesy to you, I will leave it for you to scratch. If you do not scratch it, I will scratch it for you, as I find it offensive and false sensationalism.</li>
</ul>
<p>(e.g., National Enquirer.) Further, this forum is for debate only; it is not a ballot and we are not to "count" votes. I believe anyone that still feels that this article is not representing a notable band or ensemble, is not reading and reviewing the additions to the article itself.<a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntress829_1301.html" title="User:Huntress829">Huntress829</a> 14:21, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: As a journalist; avid reader, and a user of Wikipedia, I am "salting" this article and the arguments for and against it. This has been an interesting experience (My first and second of many articles to come) and offers a great informative piece for researching the ways and means that Wikipedia operates.

<p><b>Comment and Reply to Mr./Ms. Martin:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Notability, as defined by Wikipedia, is anything but a "grey area." You have taken notability to a new dimension here.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Any one of the following" means/= "any one of the following."</p>
<p>Your own version of the truth, is seen by your ability to imply dishonesty, and you skirt around the central issues that have been added, and which, certainly prove notability, as well as, success with notable artists. Friends and fans are encouraged to write the type of article that was written here. Unfortunately, Wikipedia is becoming more like MySpace, with a "chosen few" having all power.</p>
<p>Lacking an article in Wikipedia does not constitute anything, in the real world, but not having one based on your reasons, takes this encyclopedia to new lows. My children cannot use Wikipedia in the schools they go to, for the above reasons. That, I believe is a shame</p>
<p>Ms./Mr. Martin, "The Musicians we cover" as you put it? We stopped in the (alphbet e's,) but suffice it to say, we had about 92% (1000 names) that did not meet the criteria for "notability" that you and Mr. Dhartung, claim to be your "arrows" in the Wikipedia quiver.</p>
<p>Any editor out there looking for articles to delete would have a "field day." Witch hunting is what brought us here. I own the copywrite for the review on my site.</p>
