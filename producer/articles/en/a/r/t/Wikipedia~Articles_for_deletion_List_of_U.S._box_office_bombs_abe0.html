I don't see any POV involved, the article <b>is</b> sourced, the basic premise is a well known one, and this is no more original research than me cribbing hockey stats from hockeydb.com to put in player articles.

<dd>Fair enough. Lets start with the first film on the list. This article says "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" had a budget of "$40,000,000":</dd>

<dd>It isn't a huge stretch to suggest that BoxOfficeMojo, <i>the explicit reference given in the article</i>, might very well be the source. So the numbers don't square? Correct it then; that's what we come to Wikipedia to do, correct typos and errors we find. Myself, given that the article is over three years old and has had many editors, I wouldn't venture to suggest when or by whom that particular figure was added, and in any event this is a discussion better suited for the article's talk page. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:18, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Keep</b>: I double-checked these numbers with www.boxofficemojo.com and they check out. As for this claim that they numbers come from IMDB, this is simply not true. Deleting this article simply because populist editors are mad that some of their favorite films are on this list is POV and flies in the face of Wiki's objectivity. The reason why some people here want to delete this page is because they think it's too negative. What's next? Are we supposed to delete the Nazi wiki page because it puts Germany in a negative light? Should we delete the penis wiki page because it might offend conservative people? Sorry... but box office bombs/flops are a known phenomena in the world of the moviegoing public. It deserves research like anything else in the world. Deleting this page is simply censorship from people who don't like to face the brutal reality that some business enterprises, like movies, are failures. It's not a moral judgment but a financial reality. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.9.103.143 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.9.103.143.html" title="User talk:24.9.103.143">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.9.103.143_432c.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.9.103.143">contribs</a>) 07:06, March 25, 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I have heard two issues that are relevant for deletion: (1) the source of the figures, and (2) the arbitrary inclusion threshold. 1: So, we should make sure the figures are correct and source them. I see no reason to believe that this cannot be achieved. 2: A box office <i>failure</i> is one that fails to recoup expenses. What makes one movie a bomb and another merely a failure may be a bit subjective, but it seems like the list could just set an arbitrary threshold, like "Gross &lt; 30% of budget, or Gross less than budget by at least $10 million" that would pretty much accurately sum up the contents. Exceptions could be included if they were described in sources as bombs. Yes, this article needs some cleanup, but it's interesting, it's relevant, it's an appropriate topic, and it's a good start. No real reason to delete here. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 20:31, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Beyond which this is getting tendentious. There comes a point in most AfDs where the debate has run its course. This is one. You've failed to even elicit a majority for your view, never mind a consensus to delete. Continuing to hammer that no list can be held valid unless it is based on a rigidly formulaic definition (a POV refuted, as I've mentioned elsewhere, by the numerous racially-based lists) has failed to spur an avalanche of "OMG, you're right, I must change my vote!" responses. In your shoes, I'd consider losing gracefully and moving on. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 17:01, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>As far as a formal definition goes I am having trouble finding one. However, all sources assume the term is already understoond as being applied to a money-losing film such as <a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/20050722.html" class="external text" title="http://ask.yahoo.com/20050722.html" rel="nofollow">"for a film to lose money" (Yahoo)</a>, which is the industry and commonly accepted definition.</li>
<li>The term is not original research, the nominator's second of two arguments. The term is used widely, for example by <a href="http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/sep/09-09-98/arts/arts2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/sep/09-09-98/arts/arts2.html" rel="nofollow">The Michigan Daily</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0701230149jan23,1,2314395.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed" class="external text" title="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0701230149jan23,1,2314395.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed" rel="nofollow">The Chicago Tribune</a>, <a href="http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/13701" class="external text" title="http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/13701" rel="nofollow">Yale Daily News</a> and <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0508/02/sbt.01.html" class="external text" title="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0508/02/sbt.01.html" rel="nofollow">CNN</a> as well as in specialized sites such as RottenTomatoes.com and BoxOfficeMojo.com.</li>
<li>A Box Office Bomb is of major importance, not only in the lives of the film stars but also in the performance of big studios and their parent companies such as <a href="http://www.satnews.com/stories2/3aug2001-1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.satnews.com/stories2/3aug2001-1.html" rel="nofollow">News Corp</a> and <a href="http://www.thunderbird.edu/wwwfiles/pdf/about_thunderbird/case_series/a15990007.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.thunderbird.edu/wwwfiles/pdf/about_thunderbird/case_series/a15990007.pdf" rel="nofollow">Disney</a>. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFateClub_8a45.html" title="User:FateClub">FateClub</a> 19:26, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>No one is saying the term is original research.</b> If I thought the term was original research I'd have nominated the "Box office bomb" article for deletion. <b>This list of films is original research.</b> We are taking the budget and revenue figures, comparing them and saying "these films are bombs". We aren't referencing other people that say these films are bombs, Wikipedia is saying that. Therefore original research. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 19:37, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>In that case we got sidetracked in the previous thread. If the industry definition of Box Office Bomb is a money-losing film and it is generally understood (as all these sources would suggest) then this is a list of films that fit the industry definition of Box Office Bomb or the generally accepted definition of Box Office Bomb (which is in fact the same, in any case). Then such list is not original research, as it would be if the list included non-money losing films. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFateClub_8a45.html" title="User:FateClub">FateClub</a> 20:03, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I expect that very few lists on Wikipedia work that way; a POV-ridden opinion poll doesn't magically cease to be one just because someone who wasn't on Wikipedia made it up. I'd much rather take a list compiled from factual, reliable sources ... like this one. That being said, Mr. McMillan's interpretation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is completely in error, if a common mistake. "Original research" as policy defines it is not "anything an editor compiles." The specific criteria valid here is "It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source." A money-losing movie is value-neutral, and the facts presented are attributed to reputable sources. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:07, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I certainly agree, most figures lack sources and <b>that</b> is the issue, and one that most of us (if not all) agree upon. Then a {[fact}} should be added instead of getting rid of the entire article. As this is valuable information (for the industry and from the financial point of view). --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFateClub_8a45.html" title="User:FateClub">FateClub</a> 20:10, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The list itself is clearly <b>original research</b> - it gives an analysis beyond mathematical calculations and logical deduction. The calculation of the percentage is logic, but stating a picture is a box office bomb because of that is not. Therefore, every entry in this list must have a source explicitly stating that the picture was a box office bomb. I suggest that some valiant editors with knowledge of the subject add references to as many entries as possible, and delete the others.

<dd>I'm sorry, I would love to answer your question but I just don't know what to say. I'm sure I've said it already a number of times. Most "List of" articles aren't based on an editor comparing two data points and drawing a conclusion from them. And any that are should either be deleted, or be re-written so that they are just presenting conclusions drawn by someone else, who we can cite. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 03:53, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Aha ... now <i>there's</i> the rub. Fair enough. Would you mind explaining to us what conclusion you fancy the creator of this article has drawn? Other than, of course, that the films listed all lost money, but that's no more "original research" than claiming that (X-2X) results in a number lower than X. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:03, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That "The Adventures of Baron Münchhausen", "The Adventures of Pluto Nash", "The Alamo", "Alexander", etc are all "US box office bombs". We are saying all these films are bombs because "revenue &lt; budget". That is our analysis. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 15:06, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is no other conclusion to take, it is not profound analysis, just revenue &lt; budget. Otherwise, most lists, for example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Americans_3ace.html" title="List of Americans">List of Americans</a> would be original research, place of birth = America. That is indeed a comparison. In fact <b>all</b> lists would be original reseach under that premise, other than the ones that are verbatim copies (such as <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forbes.html" title="Forbes">Forbes</a> list of billionaires). If that is the case, then nominate all those articles as a group, including <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Irish-Americans_092c.html" title="Lists of Irish-Americans">Lists of Irish-Americans</a>. There is no reference with the already produced list in question, wikipedians put it together by comparing country of origin = Ireland, it's all about comparisons. That is our analysis. And how about <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_computer_system_manufacturers.html" title="List of computer system manufacturers">List of computer system manufacturers</a>, analysis: Product manufactured = computer systems. And <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_prizes%2C_medals%2C_and_awards_for_women_in_science.html" title="List of prizes, medals, and awards for women in science">List of prizes, medals, and awards for women in science</a>, analysis: Gender of awardee = female. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFateClub_8a45.html" title="User:FateClub">FateClub</a> 16:31, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So if a film costs $5,000,000 to make and only takes in $4,999,999 then it is a "bomb"? How about if it only takes in $4,000,000, or $3,500,000?
