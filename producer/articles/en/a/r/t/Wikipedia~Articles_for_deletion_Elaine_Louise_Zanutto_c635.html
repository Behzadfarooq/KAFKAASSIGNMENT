<p>Elaine Zanutto was speedy deleted A7. Another user put the G4 tag on, but that doesn't apply to speedy deletes (as recreation in that case is equivalent to contesting the speedy), so taking to AfD. I'm <b>neutral</b> for now, as this is just procedural. I'd imagine the problem here is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">notability</a>, but more research needs to be done. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 23:21, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Does not assert meeting any of the tests at <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>.

I believe <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> applies to such cases, but I see no assertion of meeting any of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> tests either. (Although I don't consider the publication list to contain an assertion of notability, I also comment that the list of publications, because it includes items "accepted for publication", is clearly from a resume or equivalent, and hence not an independent reliable source that could be used to establish notability.) <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 20:17, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I happen to know something about Zanutto's research (I've read 5 or 6 of the publications listed in her article), and I think she does some nice work. My impression is that she's a bit above the average college professor, although I'm not sure how to demonstrate that. I would not class her as especially notable (unlike both her advisors, Rao and Rubin, who we don't seem to have articles for). But I'm fairly liberal on inclusion of academics, and there's enough verifiable material here for a short article, hence my vote to keep. The article should be cleaned up, though; long lists of publications and grants are not appropriate. -- <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAvenue_4731.html" title="User:Avenue">Avenue</a> 00:28, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I certainly have nothing against Dr. Zenutto (who I have absolutely no knowledge of), and as you say, the CV reads impressively. Personally I'd be cheering this person on - going to Carlton means she is likely a fellow Canadian, and I work with a bunch of government statisticians who deal with surveys and census stuff. But certainly there seems to be no notability requiring an article - nothing that would produce any linkages form other articles, etc. If Wikipedia wanted to go in the direction of ignoring <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> and including stubs on pretty much all established academics I suppose there would be nothing wrong with that, but having these sorts of articles decided haphazardly based on who happens to come across the AfD doesn't seem useful (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Roberta_Wenocur_987b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Roberta Wenocur">Roberta Wenocur</a> was deleted, for example). - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 06:19, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
