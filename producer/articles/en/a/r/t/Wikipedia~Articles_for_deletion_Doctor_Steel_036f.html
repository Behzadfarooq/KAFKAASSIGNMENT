<p>At any glance, this article is just a <b>major</b> fair use violation. With a partial read, it's impossible to tell if this is about a real individual and his band or a fictional individual used as part of an advertising campaign. Seeing as this does not <i>really</i> fall under any sort of speedy deletion, I'm listing this here as not having <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">neutral</a> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources as to the actual existence of this individual/band/copyright gallery.

<li><b>Keep</b>. All Major fair use violations as well as descriptions over whether or not "Doctor Steel" or "Phineas Waldorf Steel" are real people have been settled with those who have contributed on the discussion pages as well as addressed within the articles respectively, It's another Stephen Colbert actor / real person debate, I like Colbert&#160;;)--Fenixasin 1:20am Saturday, February 10, 2007 UTC</li>
<li>As far as the verifiable information Fenixasin has provided it to you. The issues of being verified has been addressed, as far as neutrality I assure you that no one is adding more than information. Third party individuals will also make their editing and corrections on the page. Wikipedia after is built on that very idea, the users will keep it neutral.- FleshMask 10:04 Friday, February 09, 2007 EST <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.112.60.244_ae51.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.112.60.244">69.112.60.244</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.112.60.244.html" title="User talk:69.112.60.244">talk</a>) 03:04, 10 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>keep</b>. I see no reason not to keep this article. It is part of a pop culture phenomenon, the character/persona is verifyable and there is considerable interest in the character. Additionally, there is a real person attached to the persona and that is also interesting in the same way as the Stephen Colbert persona is attached to the person Stephen Colbert. I don't disagree, however, that there is currently a commercial appearance to the article. The need to clean up the article has been identified and there are certainly editors available that appear to be willing to work on this requirement. Plus, Dr. Steel apparently has recruited an army of people who are likely to continue to resurrect it anyway. It makes sense to leave it and clean it up. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 03:18, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</b></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the subject matter is definitely valid, the article itself just needs some work. As far as the blurring of lines between person and persona, the situation is similar to that of <a href="../../../m/c/_/MC_Frontalot_f2fa.html" title="MC Frontalot">MC Frontalot</a>, Dr. Steel just takes the character aspect to further extremes. - <a href="../../../u/g/l/User%7EUglinessman_95ac.html" title="User:Uglinessman">Ugliness Man</a> 08:45, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I understand your concern over the fair use issues here, but I don't think that's grounds to delete the whole article. Doctor Steel seems to have enough third-party coverage to warrant an article. As for the fair use, especially the gallery of fair use images, they seem to be used with permission, so I would recommend putting the article up at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_review_1790.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use review">Wikipedia:Fair use review</a>. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 13:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../k/e/e/Keep.html" title="Keep">Keep</a>. There is honestly nothing wrong with the artist's page. There's a page of a couple Professional wrestlers on here I've seen, and no one's ever heard of them before, but have used wikipedia to get known. for example, the human tornado. nobody in the midwest knew who this guy was, and yes, the page that was made for him helped out his career a little. But this artist is know throughout the world by many people without this page. With all honesty, This guy doesn't even need this page, cause he's gonna get a bigger fan base without it or not. But he has been in several shows, and magazines, and is a popular artist with no mainstream radio play. to make this kind of a name for himself with out that help is a rare thing, and that's deserving to be a part of wikipedia.<small>— Yellowjacketrattlocke (<a href="../../../y/e/l/User_talk%7EYellowjacketrattlocke_5baa.html" title="User talk:Yellowjacketrattlocke">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yellowjacketrattlocke_34e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yellowjacketrattlocke">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Merge into Phineas Waldolf Steel</b> - or merge PWS into this one. Either way, the article(s) need(s) to be heavily edited to separate reality from promotion. For instance, Steel did get a brief appearance on Leno, but I'm not sure about Letterman (the pic might be photoshopped) and I think the Muppets thing is a pure bit of promotional fantasy. (Shame, cuz I think they'd be smashing together!) Anyway, I do think there should be an article about this guy, but we need more real info about the performer, which seems to be hard to get. --<a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistrion_ca94.html" title="User:Histrion">Jay (Histrion)</a> (<a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHistrion_9096.html" title="User talk:Histrion">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Histrion_7f5b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Histrion">contribs</a>) 23:54, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
