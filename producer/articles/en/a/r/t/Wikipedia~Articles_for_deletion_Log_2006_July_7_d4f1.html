<p>I did not realise the rarity of this act but understand possible concerns as to its relevance.

<li><b>Keep if permission is given</b> I'm working on obtaining permission from Guitar World, I think this is an important poll showing the most popular songs, and as many song pages list where the song ranks in popular polls, and shows the relative importance of the songs.

<li>While true, the list is a copyright violation and is only a list of songs enjoyed by readers of Guitar World magazine. Every classic rock list has <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stairway_to_Heaven_14f0.html" title="Stairway to Heaven">Stairway to Heaven</a> as the most popular song, no matter what the list is for. This list of "greatest guitar solos" is no more notable than (e.g.) Q104.3's top rock songs (which has also had Stairway to Heaven as number 1). <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 05:15, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that a poll by Guitar World is slightly more important than one from a local radio station, all I'm asking for is to have it kept until I get a response from the magazine on whether or not we have permission. Many of the top songs list many polls, I think it would help to tie it all together. If someone sees info about the poll on a page of a song, they'd be likely to click and see what else is on the list, and click some links there.

<p>The result of the discussion was <b>Merge</b> to university article. The actual discussion concerning the worth of this particular article isn't very convincing in either way, but in its current form the article doesn't say anything that makes it worthwhile in a wider context, therefore the merge. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 18:25, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are many student newspapers in the category Category:United States student newspapers. Student newspapers and their web sites are often the most reliable published source of information about a university and related cultural and sports topics on campus and in the community, and many people who work at student newspapers go on to become professional journalists. As well, a student-run newspaper can also be where people learn business and interpersonal skills that are valuable in the real world. And student newspapers bring a student perspective to the news, sports and cultural coverage that is missing from commercial newspapers. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a></li>

<li><b>Merge</b> My college has no less than two WP articles devoted to university publications (the Brandeis Justice and the Brandeis Hoot immediately come to mind).

That isn't what would be in an encylcopedia. But even if you revised these statements, it would still almost certainly be deleted because it doesn't seem notable.

<li><b>keep</b> First, stop comparingg sales on Amazon, There are many other Canadian online bookstores and I stopped using them for my publishing company years ago. When I found the misplaced article in the Canadian Poets Category, I removed the whole thing and cleaned it up and put it in its own article. I was unaware of her own website Bio and tried to make it more neutral less vanity as I could. She seems to have some notability in Canada as she is a member of the prestigious League of Canadian Poets of which I and most Canadians know is hard to join.

<li><b>Comment</b> "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia." I would argue a collection of songs containing an unremarkable word is precisely an "indiscriminate collection of items of information", in violation of "Wikipedia is first and foremost an online encyclopedia." The door is opened to other lists of songs, containing other unremarkable words, ad infinitum. If you cannot see that (or if you can see that, but could not care less) then you need to re-read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Incidentally, the primary source nature of the list (it appears no one verifiable has catalogued these songs per some or all of the list criteria, allowing WP editors to then cite them as a verifiable member of this list) also helps it fail <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Violation of any one of these policies is grounds for deletion. Multiple failures such as this make it an open-and-shut case.

<li><b>Comment</b> When <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Carlin_f409.html" title="George Carlin">George Carlin</a> or the Family Media Guide creates a list of songs containing "fuck", there may be grounds for writing an article citing them, per <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_dirty_words.html" title="Seven dirty words">Seven dirty words</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_ordered_by_uses_of_the_word__fuck__d887.html" title="List of films ordered by uses of the word &quot;fuck&quot;">List of films ordered by uses of the word "fuck"</a>. The "commercial and legal ramifications" of "fuck" are unremarkable on their own - the "ramifications" talked about are fairly minor in reality, they are crucially not restricted to use of this one word, and besides, JJay alleges that it's the use of "fuck" "in titles" that has significance - if that's so, why on earth is this article being mealy-mouthed about "prominent positions"? Maybe thirty years ago this would have been an exciting and edgy topic, but today, I personally find it rather tame and crufty - "juvenile" even, FWIW. Aside from my POV, I note no one has yet explained how this article successfully passes the WP policies that I cited above (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>A7, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>).

<li>George Carlin and the Family Media Guide may not be in the song list business, but the RIAA is and has been for some time with their parental advisory label (and fuck is a part of that). You may not believe that the "commercial and legal" ramifications of the word fuck are "remarkable", and you might have been right, except that the word "fuck" can lead to FCC and FTC investigations (ask Bono) and get your album banned at Wal-Mart. That is far from minor considering that Wal-Mart is the biggest retailer in the United States. You have claimed above that fuck is an "unremarkable" word. That is seemingly belied by our long <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a> article and associated category: Category:Fuck. If you want to argue that this fails Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information that is your business, but this article does not come close to any of the specific clauses (travel guide, memorial, genealogy, aphorisms, etc.). Basing your reasoning on the line: <i>That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia</i> is also not a particularly compelling argument: (i) it is a generic argument that can be applied indiscriminately to any article up for deletion; (ii) the three AfD discussions involving the cinema list have already proven the viability of the subject. I won't address your comment on "edgy and exciting" or "tame and crufty" since I don't believe that those sort of subjective judgements have any bearing on inclusion of reference material. Lastly, I do not see any conflict with WP:V or WP:NOR. The song titles are listed on the albums. The albums are available through commercial sites and are reviewed. Are you really suggesting that editors can not confirm that <a href="../../../a/m/e/America%2C_Fuck_Yeah_e6a5.html" title="America, Fuck Yeah">America, Fuck Yeah</a> is really called America Fuck Yeah? If that is the case, perhaps you would like to add a fact tag to the title of the America, Fuck Yeah article. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 17:33, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "Titles" - you keep mentioning "titles". And yet this article is not concerning itself with "titles" is it? How about a new article name - List of Albums Banned by Walmart? Assuming you can cite either Walmart or a reliable commentator that the albums were indeed banned, then that might be a viable topic. Or List of Albums with a Parental Advisory Sticker on the Front? As long as evidence is brought forth, even that might work. But please don't confuse albums with mere songs. This article is about songs, and does not mention or seek to address RIAA guidelines, Walmart practices, or anything else of substance whatsoever. You seem to suggest my criticisms are wholly "subjective", yet you do not acknowledge that your own arguments here are completely subjective also, and fail to engage with the WP policies cited. Don't ask me "are you suggesting...?"-type questions (you already said you dismiss subjective views, so why would you care what I'm "suggesting"?). Instead, cite the policies and explain exactly how this article complies. You seem to misunderstand (and pretty much ignore, in fact) <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> in relation to this article.

<li>Starting with my very first post much higher on this page, I indicated that the article could evolve and the title could change. That requires editing, which takes time. Certainly longer than the 26 minute window given to the author before it was tagged for speedy deletion. Therefore, considering the almost immediate deletion tagging and repeated removal of edits by the AfD nominator, I hardly think that it is fair to complain about what the article "seeks to address". Despite your refusal to answer my question, I will point out again that the article does not violate any of the specific clauses of WP:NOT. You apparently agree with me since you have not, despite repeated requests, indicated a specific clause. I commented above on WP:V and WP:NOR. I do not see how either is contravened by listing songs that have the word fuck in their titles. Other aspects of the list should be sourced, just like with any other article. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:41, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for your comments. To summarise your view, if this article had a different title and different contents, you believe it may pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. I dare say you are 100% correct. It would be a totally different article. I therefore don't see why deletion of this one is opposed, since you seem to agree that its title and contents intrinsically fail those policies. You dismissed my citation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>A7 as "subjective" above. This being the case, I really have no desire to discuss that point any further - your own dismissal of it is "subjective" to my mind, so round and round that goes without any conclusion in sight.

<li>I suggest you reread my comments. The only time I used the word "subjective" in our discussion was in the following line: <i>I won't address your comment on "edgy and exciting" or "tame and crufty" since I don't believe that those sort of subjective judgements have any bearing on inclusion of reference material.</i> I will be happy to withdraw that comment if "edgy and exciting" or "tame and crufty" are actually in the WP:NOT policy. In fact, I "dismissed" your citation of WP:NOT by stating that it was not a "particularly compelling argument". It will remain uncompelling until you cite a specific clause in the WP:NOT criteria. Those criteria are there for a reason, essentially because the policy is specific rather than elastic. Other than that, I will say that your summary of my "views" was an excellent demonstration of your "subjectivity". --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:30, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You don't seem to handle disagreement very well, do you? "Not particularly compelling" is very different from an outright dismissal...and once again, I never said you applied "subjectivity" regarding WP:V or WP:NOR. I would appreciate it if you stopped trying to put words in my mouth. I have already commented on WP:V and WP:NOR multiple times above, such as when I wrote: <i>I do not see how either is contravened by listing songs that have the word fuck in their titles. Other aspects of the list should be sourced, just like with any other article.</i> Otherwise, I fail to see why you object to a change of title and/or content regarding this article.

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem here isn't just changing the criteria to make them work.

Whether or not what Lord mortekai says is true, we cannot "easily verify" whether songs <i>not</i> on the list have the word "fuck" <i>more</i> prominently positioned than the ones arbitrarily selected by the editors of this article for inclusion. Without a reliable source or sources whom we can trust to select the songs based on prominence beforehand, we are left with inherent <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> failure (as HumbleGod notes above) through the unsourced song selections made by editors, and we are left with the (obvious) <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> failure too, because no one can cite a single source for any of these editor choices. Rather than say "you can tell it should be on the list from the title", etc., I would like to know how we can tell there aren't other songs better suited for the list than these chosen ones. The only way we could be sure of that, would be by following <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and making this article into a tertiary source, which currently it is not. Nothing - as HumbleGod says - is going to change this problem without some bona fide reliable sources for this list.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a notable Canadian writer with several books published by non-vanity publishers that I have heard of. (He also operated his own book publishing company for a while, but closed it down.) I confirmed the titles and their ISBNs at the Library and Archives of Canada catalog at <a href="http://amicus.collectionscanada.ca/aaweb/aalogine.htm" class="external free" title="http://amicus.collectionscanada.ca/aaweb/aalogine.htm" rel="nofollow">http://amicus.collectionscanada.ca/aaweb/aalogine.htm</a> and I found independent coverage on a number of sites. In general, anyone published by Mercury or Coach House should be considered a serious author. I realize that there are a lot of nn authors out there, but some time with a library catalog and Google will help to sort the notable from the non-notable. For U.S. authors, visit the Library of Congress catalog at <a href="http://catalog.loc.gov" class="external free" title="http://catalog.loc.gov" rel="nofollow">http://catalog.loc.gov</a> and for British authors, visit <a href="http://catalogue.bl.uk" class="external free" title="http://catalogue.bl.uk" rel="nofollow">http://catalogue.bl.uk</a> I have sometimes been able to find out the year of birth of an academic by searching a library catalog because of the cataloguing convention of including the author's year of birth (and sometimes death) in a cataog entry. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 05:53, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm neutral on this vote at the moment, but I would point out that ISBNs and inclusion in these major national library archives may <i><b>not</b></i> be good indicators of notability:
<ul>
<li>ISBNs can be bought by anyone, who can then use the number to list a completely fake book on Amazon. This has been used for hoaxes on Wikipedia in the past (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Brent_Henry_Waddington" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Brent_Henry_Waddington" rel="nofollow">November 2005 example</a>. Incidentally the hoax book in that afd is STILL listed on Amazon<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976467186/ref=sr_11_1/002-8187767-3636857?ie=UTF8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976467186/ref=sr_11_1/002-8187767-3636857?ie=UTF8" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. I emailed Amazon after the afd closed but apparently noone read my note or cared.). Wikipedia's guidelines on book notability should be updated to reflect this problem with ISBNs.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Library_1c04.html" title="British Library">British Library</a>, and the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_and_Archives_Canada_a8eb.html" title="Library and Archives Canada">Library and Archives Canada</a> are <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_Deposit_0b34.html#Legal_Deposit_and_Copyright" title="Legal Deposit"><i>legal deposit</i> libraries</a>. In the UK, every book published by British publishers must, <i>by law</i>, have a copy sent to the British Library for cataloging. The same applies to the Library and Archive of Canada <a href="http://www.collectionscanada.ca/6/25/s25-200-e.html" class="external text" title="http://www.collectionscanada.ca/6/25/s25-200-e.html" rel="nofollow">see this link</a> for Canadian publishers (and note that a <i>very</i> broad definition of "publisher" is used here - covering all individuals and associations as well as formal publishers). The <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_of_Congress_f2f1.html" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a>, on the other hand, does not work as a legal deposit library and is more selective in what it adds to its collections.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I recognize that it is difficult for people outside Canada to tell whether a Canadian publisher is legitimate or not. The publishers that belong to the Literary Press Group, an association of independent publishers in Canada, or to the <a href="http://www.pubcouncil.ca/" class="external free" title="http://www.pubcouncil.ca/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pubcouncil.ca/</a> are legitimate, in my opinion. See <a href="http://www.lpg.ca/publishers.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lpg.ca/publishers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lpg.ca/publishers.html</a> for a list.

<p>I would vote to keep if the information was put into context and proper sources cited. "Server emulator" is a term used only within the <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPG</a> community, and is not accepted by the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_science.html" title="Computer science">computer science</a> community at large.

<p>There are numerous examples of projects which recreate a network server, either according to a spec (NFS, FTP, HTTP) or reverse engineered (Samba amongst others). None of these re-implementations are called emulators. Despite that, the definition in a computer-science setting clearly shows this is an incorrect usage of the word emulator. --Omnivector 22:00, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> page and give <b>Chris Orcutt</b> some feedback on revising it so it isn't 'self-promotional vanity'. There isn't a single non-verifiable entry on the page. With due respect, if you cut every page with a hint of self-promotion, Wikipedia would become very small very quickly. Nowhere on the page do I make outrageous claims, and I only put up the page after receiving dozens of emails from visitors to NotWriting.com who wanted to know more about the author. To technology people my blog may be nothing, but in the writing (and procrastinating about writing) community, NotWriting is very popular. I've logged over 10 million hits in four years from visitors in 30 countries. Now that I understand Wikipedia's "no self-promotion" policy, I am open to cutting any elements in the entry that violate this policy. Now, if you still decide to delete my modest entry, I just have to ask you, what would constitute a valid entry for a writer? In other words, if you vote me off, what objective criteria do I (and my entry) have to meet in the future to get back on Wikipedia? Let me work with Wikipedia on this to create an entry that meets your standards. --Corcutt007 19:04, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I believe this article attempts to explore history of voicemail-specific speech-to-text service providers. If advertising is indeed kept to a minimum of only a chronological order of provider offering, this should continue to grow into an informative overview of this emerging application.

<p>This product is a trademarked name and does not serve as a spam/advertising document. It provides a history of the service which is available nowhere else on the Internet. It also clearly explains the detailed process of how this voicemail-to-text service functions, as well as fair and balanced links to additional resources for exploring this emerging technology.

<p>Referenced from the Wiki Offical Rules, I believe this article meets the conditions for non-deletion as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Self-promotion. You are free to write about yourself or projects you have a strong personal involvement in. However, do remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other, including the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view.</li>
<li>Advertising. Articles about companies and products are acceptable if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Rygelski 09:03, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Two issues. Firstly, as it completely lacks sources I am unable to seperate this from a hoax; Google gives 100 some results and Google News gives zero. Secondly, I don't think he's notable anyways. He's been in trouble a few times, and got in the way of a tank. Whooopeee.

<li>""Keep"" just clean it up. First off 'bizarre social theory' is a personal opinion, and if you think a personal opinion about it being bizarre is a new standard for wiki, then you might as well delete a few thousand more entries. Secondly, 'the human union movement' is outlined in an offical peer reviewed publication and academic argument. Thirdly, spelling errors are not grounds for deletion, and since this is a wiki, you can correct them. It's called a cleanup. Fourthly, OS 0 1 2's deletion is being challenged as we speak and a hearing is forthcoming. I imagine that the wiki standard would insure you address these points rationally and this hearing would not succumb to rhetoric, which apparently is all some of you supplied. <a href="../../../t/u/m/User%7ETumbleman_ba99.html" title="User:Tumbleman">User:Tumbleman</a></li>

<li>Not really, but perhaps it would be appropriate to reorient the article toward the book until the idea is more widespread.

<ul>
<li>Not really what? Is that a 'keep' with a clean up?' Look, you cant have it both ways. An academic peer reviewed publication is an academic peer reviewed publication. I agree the article should be cleaned up. Lyndon is NOT the first person to use this particular phrase either, he only created the academic argument. The phrase is self defined and the ideal has been discussed historically is some shape or form for millennia Tumbleman</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That will be a "move" if and when I strike my original comment. I don't see anything indicating that this book was screened for publication by other international relations experts, which is what "peer review" means. The book's existence is easily verified, but your assertion that its idea is widespread (when the book was published 5 months ago) is not. As for the idea being "discussed for millennia," that's a point of view unless supported very specifically (e.g. a quote from Plato that defines a term exactly the way Storey defines "human union"). And if there is such a quote, there are probably many more people who have used the earlier writer's term than Storey's. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 02:36, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Peer review does not mean 'screened for publication by other international relations experts' it means 'peer reviewed' by academia, in this case political science academia, i.e. the book was published soley by a institution that publishes for universities, Lyndon has his Ph.D in Political Science and his argument was also his thesis. Secondly, now your changing your argument to something else. I said the phrase 'human union' is self defined, but the concept of a governing body of co-operating humans HAS been discussed for millenia, so the concept is not new, the phrase is. Shall I list the wiki pages that already list this concept using other signifiers? really, I think your being unfair here.Tumbleman</li>

<li>Excuse me, rhetoric is a poor way to have a discussion regarding this issue. If you can define or argue that this is a 'half-assed' dialectic, which I hardly think your qualified or able to do with me, I suggest you strike your comment, it bears as much wieght as a Fox pundit's commentary. Again, I did not say that a P2P network has been discussed for millenia, rather the concept of co-operative human beings has. Wikipedia itself is a perfect example of this process, and in case you havent noticed, Open Source P2P concepts ARE redefining the world. I dont think your informed enought to have this discussion. Try making a rational comment, and then will see if your qualified to discuss dialectic or any other concept that is on this page.Tumbleman</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If "rhetoric" is a poor way to discuss, then insulting my intelligence sure doesn't worm you into my good books (it's "hardly think <i>you're</i> qualified", BTW - see how annoying insulting people's intelligence can be yet?). Of course, you don't do it once, you do it multiple times. Please don't condescend to pompously lecture me on P2P and dialectics, you know nothing about me. Wikipedia is the "perfect example" of nothing, as this discussion appears to prove. You will also find that this discussion is completely based on "personal opinion". Learn to accept that other people exist and they have opinions. AfD is a good place to express opinions, otherwise nothing really gets discussed. While you're praising Wikipedia's perfection, you'll also find that my opinion holds just as much "weight" as yours in this discussion. Hope that doesn't shock you too much. Getting back on-topic, this article also insults my intelligence, and - ironically - it's also full of rhetoric. Fox pundits get fired if they spout pure hokum on air. I personally respect Fox for that. Ironically, if Fox had reported on this article's subject, you'd have been in a much stronger position re the topic's notability. Since they haven't, and since I see no evidence here that anyone else of note ever has, I will wait until somesuch evidence turns up before discussing this article any further. I hope I won't be waiting millennia.

<li><b>Comment</b> Karen, if your vote for deletion is based on your comment, which I assume it is, can you further define what you mean by 'opinionated' movement? Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the standard of a peer reviewed academically accepted publication. It' not opinion, it is an academic argument, and there is quite a clear distinction. An opinion when voiced does not need to reveal the logical steps and arguments it took to arrive at the conclusion. An academic argument is quite distinct and therefore I suspect you are unfamiliar with this standard and have simply an opinion yourself. If I am mistaken, can you then break down your definition of opinion and show the rational steps you took to come to the conclusion that an academic argument is nothing but? If you cant do this, then I respectfully request that you strike your comment. Thank you <a href="../../../t/u/m/User%7ETumbleman_ba99.html" title="User:Tumbleman">User:Tumbleman</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Tumbleman, in my profession peer reviewed means documented evidence that standards of research in my field have been met by publication in a peer-reviewed professional journal. Some history (concise) of the author's thinking process leading to the current article and how his position fits into or adds to the field's academic history of the topic is expected (even if the position he is taking is new or original). All statements and evidence are referenced (and not just be a link to a vague Wikipedia page with no documentation) but to some verified neutral outside source. Using an unprofessionally-sponsored website as a publication site (a a poorly written one at that) would swiftly shunt you into the quackery bin in my academic area. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarenAnn_2b02.html" title="User:KarenAnn">KarenAnn</a> 12:14, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> A couple of points. First, my apologies if you were offended by the flippant nature of my earlier comment, but such obvious errors in spelling and punctuation do _not_ inspire confidence in your readers, and can easily be corrected by a few minutes' extra diligence. As a show of good faith, I've removed a couple of minor errors from the text myself. Secondly, the issue here is _notability_, as described in <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, and _verifiability_, as described in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The article, as it stands, does not present any verifiable evidence of the movement's existence, let alone its notability; the link to its own website, not being independent of the movement, doesn't count towards this. If such evidence exists, you'll need to include it in the article - proof that the term has been used by academic or popular authors other than the movement's founder, proof of media coverage of the movement, or something of the sort. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 20:14, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> No worries on the flippant comments, I can handle them if you can respond back rationally with your actual point, which you have. First off, thanks for trying to make the page better. For sure things like spelling and grammar are always issues, but since this is a wiki, the whole point is we all share in editing. When we see a simple mistake, we don’t delete it, we correct it, right? Secondly, the intention and subject matter of this article meets those wiki requirements you mentioned, and I am monitoring this page until the page reflects that you the wiki standard. Notability and verifiability are very relevant in this article's intention to list the actual argument Lyndon puts forth. I understand that many wiki editors are not as familiar perhaps with an academic standard, so please note that having a political academic argument for the ideal that the phrase 'Human Union' holds is pretty noteworthy. Regardless of Karen's suggestion that this is nothing original, the point is that this is THE ONLY academic and political argument that addresses a very sensitive subject matter, human rights and the human right to bear full potential. It's not some hippy dippy dream like it appears some posters here suggest, it is an actual outline. Dialectical Materialism, for example, is the political and academic argument for socialism and communism, and we don’t say that is just another 'opinionated' movement. If the argument exists on this scale, then it is very relevant, more so considering the sorry state of affairs in the world. The argument is what one would bring to the UN, for example. So please don’t discount the relevancy of what this means, and please do a little more research into political science to verify yourself what I have just stated. Secondly, the argument has been accepted by academic and peer reviewed sources, so that takes care of the verifiability right there. This is not a philosophy entry, it is an entry of political science, and this is the only argument of it's kind in the world, thus making it extraordinarily relevant in this context. Does what I say here make sense?<a href="../../../t/u/m/User%7ETumbleman_ba99.html" title="User:Tumbleman">User:Tumbleman</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> also..the article is not about some 'movement', the article is about the peer reviewed academic argument, which is the foundation for such a movement and such a movement can not exist in the political science sense without the argument. Indeed, the movement is created once the argument exists. i.e. there was no communism before dialectical materialism.....<a href="../../../t/u/m/User%7ETumbleman_ba99.html" title="User:Tumbleman">User:Tumbleman</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you for your reply - it does make your position more clear. Two further pages I'd refer you to are <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAP</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Wikipedia is neither a place to publish original research in any field, academic or otherwise, nor a platform to advance a particular political or social agenda. Dr Storey may be notable as a person (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> refer), in which case this exposition of his views would be suitable for an article about him: his book may be notable, in which case it would be appropriate in a summary of the book in an article about it. However, as it stands, the article provides no _verifiable_ (and I emphasise that again) sources that show the "argument", if that's how you'd prefer to characterize it, is _notable_ outside Dr Storey's personal beliefs and writings, and, as the article's author, it's your duty to provide such sources if the article is to remain.. If the political views encapsulated in the article ever do achieve widespread notice, then it'll be acceptable - but Wikipedia is not the right vehicle for your attempts to assist it in doing so. <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialectical_materialism.html" title="Dialectical materialism">Dialectical materialism</a> is a good example; if we were writing in 1896, before that term came to the prominence it has now, it would be an equally-strong candidate for deletion. In 110 years' time, "The Human Union" might be regarded as the most important movement of this century; but, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we can't say that it has any claim for notability _now_. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 18:54, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>Televido, I actually agree with much of what you wrote. How about this, give me some time to do the proper re-write on the actual argument itself and consider changing your vote to a clean-up. I have a full work week ahead of me as well as playing mr.mom, so I just request some time to do this, as presenting the argument in wiki format is a task. Perhaps the article should also be moved to a proper entry as well. Thanks again for trying to make the article better. I disagree with you on your point about DM, Wiki also encourages us to look at relevancy. We dont just wait for history for something to become relevant, history is just one of the guidelines.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Megapixie noted (in an edit summary) that this star was "Not notable other than being a star in a constellation - BUT- WP is not paper. No reason why we couldn't have an article for every star." However, one must note that this star isn't one of the stars which composes the constellation, but simply appears in the same portion of the sky. (This star, in fact, is significantly too dim to view with the naked eye.) Moreover, there are simply too many stars catalogued to create Wikipedia articles for each one.

We don't need an article for every 9th magnitude star but it could be useful to have articles about a few of them so people can see how little information is known about most dim stars.

<p>Surprised this one has lasted so long... Delete for several reasons: 1. The majority of the text is not in English, 2.

<li>Non english parts can be translated easily but since they are not cited its best to comment them out for now.</li>
<li>Correct and the reason behind that is also simple. <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan_Workers_Party_7454.html" title="Kurdistan Workers Party">Kurdistan Workers Party</a> was getting too large and a breakup was suggested for that reason. Merging it back would be illogical.</li>
<li>I believe it has been composed from news articles which is not original reserach. Iran-Iraq war is certanly citable. Better citation is necesarry no doubt.</li>
<li>Timelines were not rejected on the Kurdistan Workers Party article but it was recomended that a seperate page should be made for them so as to evade clutter).</li>

<dd>Her diaries are a primary source for the earliest days of Spokane for one thing. That alone makes her notable. Then, she is one of, if not the, only sources to mention the brief existence of the post office of Ellis, Washington which otherwise might have been completely forgotten. She is a witness to an encounter with Chief Joseph, the unionization of the building trade in Spokane, the formative years of the town of Clearview. She is a primary source for certain events in Seattle, Prospect, Hillsboro, Portland... The list is already long and that's only reading two of her four hundred journals. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 05:00, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Verifiability is an issue - Google isn't the be-all and end-all, but the above are difficult to verify! Books entitled <i>History of Snohomish County</i> exist but none I can find by Daniels. I can find no reference to <i>Clearview, founders and pioneers</i>. <i>Snohomish Tribune</i> exists but the online version <a href="http://www.snoho.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.snoho.com/" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> is just a Classifieds. So I don't feel any of the above meet normal wiki verifiability standards. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 03:45, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> They're difficult to verify, but not impossible. The Snohomish Tribune, for example, will be available on microfilm/microfiche; someone in Snohomish County could go to the library and verify the information. The "History of Snohomish County" book, being that it was privately printed, I would agree is suspect, but I'm going to assume that the book exists for now, especially given that the article is barely over a week old. The solution to having doubts that are reasonable but not beyond a shadow of a doubt related to a source is to ask for verification. <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_with_alternatives_to_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">This</a> is a more appropriate way to handle this article, not to run to AfD within seven or eight days. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 04:26, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't understand the comment. What exactly are you trying to verify? The statements of fact are cited to each journal page where the statement is made. Or are you saying that you're only trying to verify whether or not the journals (or portions thereof) have been previously published&#160;? An autobiography is sufficient proof for the facts of the person that they themselves wrote obviously, of their own life. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 05:06, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is verifying that the books in question exist. They aren't found referenced anywhere on Google, and I couldn't find them in the Library of Congress or in the online catalogs of the local libraries, and they aren't particularly well-known, so there's some doubt as to whether the books you mentioned exist. Personally, I doubt that you would make up books, but I think the point being made is that without an ability to check the references- any libraries where they can be checked out, etc.- it's hard to confirm the information. But, quite honestly, this isn't a discussion that we should be having on AfD about an article that is being <i>actively edited and productively contributed to, and that asserts the subject's notability.</i> <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 05:36, 9 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My question is, what is the point of asking about the books? To verify what exactly? The statement was "about verifiability". I can tell you the complete contents of the article are not in the books published. Many of the events are in the journals which are cited and can be read online to see for yourself what they say. Is the person suggesting that journals published in wikisource are not sources&#160;? <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 05:41, 9 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I <i>think</i> that's the point. From my reading of the poster's comments, the question is whether the journals are accurate, and he's not convinced that the sources quoted are sufficient to establish the reality of the journals. I could be wrong, but that seems to be the idea. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 05:45, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then this has gone from ridiculous to downright looney. A person's journals are sufficient to establish what they said. Every biography on here is subject to scrutiny to its *facts* and that is independent of what is or is not said. If there is only one source for the biography then the person is going to have to do research to determine its validity. But the simple *belief* that it *may* not be valid, is insufficient to discard the statments that are made. There are thousands of articles in wikipedia that have no sources *what*soever, perhaps those would be a better candidate for this kind of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_absurdum.html" title="Reductio ad absurdum">Reductio ad absurdum</a> (I got so high falutin that I lost my ability to spell&#160;;). <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 05:55, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Oh as to your comment about not being able to find the <i>History of Snohomish</i> book I referred to, the copy I have has no ISBN number and doesn't even have a copyright statment for that matter. Its a printed work, but is bound soft-cover, not really what you'd called a high-quality work, but I'm sure they sold a grand-total of perhaps 500 copies. It's not like Snohomish is a huge metropolis&#160;:0 <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 06:00, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And the Clearview work isn't even a 'book' per se, its more like a phamplet, probably put together by a local history society or genealogical society (although not so marked). Also no ISBN number and stapled not bound.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't personally doubt that these exist, but basic scolarship requires that an independent check confirm their existence. I'd go to my local library to look them up, but that's obviously not possible. So where can physical copies of these works be found which will allow hypothetical Wikipedia <i>representatives</i> visit and confirm, first their existence, and, secondly, the notability of their contents?

<dd>There is a library in the city of Snohomish. It's a small town of perhaps 3,000 so it may not be open very often. I've never been to it.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't mean that the author of the article has made up the diaries (although it would be hard to show either way): but why is having made diaries important? The diaries are unpublished, unverified (i.e. is what she writes correct? Important), unstudied, and unreferenced. There is no reason at all that this person merits an encyclopedic article at this moment in time. She has had no importance at all, has made no impact on anything, has made no revelations that have been the basis for serious scientific studies, has no literary merit, ... That an article is truthful, thorough, wikified, ... does not mean that it belongs here. As the article states, her only claim to fame is that she has written diaries (lots of them). So? How does that meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>You give as arguments: <i>Her diaries are a primary source for the earliest days of Spokane for one thing. That alone makes her notable. Then, she is one of, if not the, only sources to mention the brief existence of the post office of Ellis, Washington which otherwise might have been completely forgotten. She is a witness to an encounter with Chief Joseph, the unionization of the building trade in Spokane, the formative years of the town of Clearview. She is a primary source for certain events in Seattle, Prospect, Hillsboro, Portland... The list is already long and that's only reading two of her four hundred journals.</i> Why is a short lived post office important? How is she a reliable witness? Until her diaries are the source of historical works of some importance, she is just an anecdote. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:47, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're saying, if someone writes a work, say the Gospel of Judas. That work is not itself important *until* it is referenced by someone else? And you're saying if wikisource accepts a work that that itself does not make the person who wrote it an author who deserves encyclopaedic representation? I find those two positions untenable.

<i>Verifiable</i> does not mean by a peer-reviewed source. It only means that there is a source. Wikisource is a valid source for establishing verifiability. And I have already posted other sources which you admitted were veriable, albeit perhaps not *simple*. But verifiability does not stand on what is simple, only on what is possible. If you wish to go to Snohomish and visit the library you could probably verify that this person existed. The article itself also has links, to places other than the journals, which do verify certain events in the person's life. A biography of just *public records* would be fairly dry, every biography has statements writen from first-hand knowledge of actors associated with the person. Those statements outside of their primary, published venue, are not *verifiable* in the strict sense that you wish to employ here. The notes of the author are elements to verify the details of the biography and those notes, are not usually published themselves. Only the result of the research is published.</p>
<p>Again, the limitations in writing Autobiographies do not apply to Biographies, even if those biographies are writen from statements made by the subject themselves. The elements of this life are not gradiose, bizarre or suspect. They are merely notable. So the majority of your case dissolves from a lack of conflict. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 01:26, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not creating original statments of facts from my own personal experience or efforts. I am transcribing a diary in which those statements appear. That is not original research. You could just as well say that transcribing a newspaper is original research which is isn't. Just like transcribing public records, regardless of the amount of time you expend, its not original research, its a mechanical representation of facts in an alternative media. There is no artistic effort involved. Your next objection, wikipedia is not being used to publish primary sources. The primary source is where it should be, on wikisource. It has been accepted there, which is where primary sources go. Your next objection, this is not the first time that Kitty May Ellis has been writen about as I've stated above. She is obscure that is true, she is not googleable that is true. The same was true for my article on <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frantz_Hunt_Coe_6b36.html" title="Frantz Hunt Coe">Frantz Hunt Coe</a>, however he is notable as well.

<dd>It's problematic using something only published at wikisource as a source per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. If this person was reported on in newspapers and such, then your job is to summarize those sources. Instead, it looks like you are cherry picking information at your whim from the unpublished, unreliable source that you are transcribing (which is why it goes into the realm of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>). Transcribing isn't OR, but basing a wikipedia entry off that work MAY be OR. You should probably not use the diary as a source, or at least keep its use down to a bare minimum (right now it seems like it is the bulk of the article, also, you may want to use the format found int <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and cite.php in regard to intext citations.) Franz Hunt Coe appears to be deleted, so if this is the case, there is precedent on wikipedia to NOT include these sort of articles. I urge you to read your article. It is not encyclopedic. It reads as a family history, not an encyclopedia article. Take for instance the 2nd paragraph in early life. Do you seriously consider that good writings? <i>In 1870 they are in Lincoln, Nebraska. In 1876 Andrew applied for and received a Civil War Pension. By Sep 1879 they were living at Tarkio, Missouri. They left Takio about Mar 1883 and went by "team and wagon" arriving in Colville, Stevens Co, Washington on July 3rd 1883[4]. Soon they had moved to Spokane Falls, Washington or the vicinity,</i>. Can you point to a features or good article on wikipedia that has a similar format?

<dd>That's an awful lot of assumptions for one paragraph. Let me just tackle your main one first. You are assuming that the biography is gleaned simply from the journals. That is false. The citations to the journals are to show where she states the things that were *already known* from other sources. Of course the underlying original source in all cases, is... herself. So the entire premise falls to pieces. As in almost every biography, the most primitive, underlying source for most statements is the person. Other documents can be used to back up what they say about certain things that were recorded elsewhere, but not in all cases. "President Clinton says he likes potatoes." I mean who the heck cares if it's true or not. He said it, it goes into his biography. It's his quote. Whether it's true isn't going to change a thing. "President Clinton says he was born in September". May be true. You can verify it by looking at his birth certificate. But his birth certificate isn't going to say he likes potatoes. And if you ask his mother, that's just another source, equally failable.</dd>

History will thank me for digging up obscure but once famous people. And finally <i>be bold</i>, if you think my writing sucks, rewrite the paragraph to make it flow more smoothly, without loss of information of course. And my ref style is my choice. There are several styles in existence here, not everyone uses the same type, I didn't wish to clutter the article with 42 footnotes.

<dd>Frantz Hunt Coe <i>was</i> (speedy) deleted, and is since recreated. The article still does not assert why he is a "prominent physician", but I'll let it be for now. My main reason for putting this up for deletion is not that the existance and facts of the life of Ellis are hard to verify, but that her claim to fame is hard to verify (not that she has written a diary, but that any info in it is important for historians). For now, we have only your word that her writings have historical importance, and none of her writings have been checked by historians. As far as we know, they may be delusions, misremembered facts, ... or a mixture of all of these. For now, niether her life nor her diaries have any importance, no studies based on them or studies using them as a source have been published, the diaries themselves have not been published by a real publisher, ... Let me again post the first line of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: the policy: "One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they must refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by reputable publishers.

<dd>I'm sure in your view, schools get named for people of no particular renown. The fact that Frantz had a school named after him, that fact alone, is enough to make him notable. Not even counting the other things he was famous for in his life. As for the journals, as I have mentioned several times now. They have been published. And no you don't have just my word that they have historical importance, you have the contents of the journals themselves. Go read them. The vast majority of her writing is quotes from the newspapers, so I think you'd be awfully hard pressed to say those haven't been previously published or aren't reliable sources.

<dd>Umm, no. Either she is inherently notable (i.e. not because of the diaries), and the diaries provide a biography. But she isn't. Or she is notable <i>because</i> her diaries are historically interesting and provide a valuable source. But now you have said that they don't do that either. So what exactly is the reason Wikipedia should have an article about her? <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 21:19, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>She is notable because of her life experiences. And if you're conceding that diaries are historically interesting, than that along makes the author interesting as well. And I did not say the diaries don't provide a valuable source. They do, in fact, provide a valuable source, to many events. Primary in some cases, secondary in some cases.

<p>Reset indent. Three things to keep in mind. Diaries CAN have historical significance, but not every single diary is historically significant. Next, Afd is not a vote. The most votes do not always win. If the arguments are compelling enough to to closing editor, they may take whatever action they feel is most appropriate, considering wikipedia policy and general consensus (not simply tallying votes). Secondly, you keep scolding us about how "biographies are constructed", and we keep scolding you about how encyclopedias are written. Seriously, I think you are using the wrong project to publish your "biography". Listing the places someone of questionable notability lived does not belong in an encyclopedia. You should make the article consice, focusing in on the aspects that make the individual notable, not relaying boring, unecnyclopedic, trivial, biographical information. If you honestly want me to edit the article, I will, but I'd probably delete most of the trivial content. Is that acceptable to you?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 21:40, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

This article is not a manual, guide or a "how-to", thus WP:NOT does not apply. A manual contains instructions for <i>how</i> to do or use a certain thing, and this article don't. I think it's important that we all understand what a manual is, and what it's not, in order to avoid future AfDs without justification or support from the Wikipedia policies and guidelines. The second reason for me voting to keep this article is that this AfD nom. seems to be based on someones personal opinion that Wikipedia shouldn't contain info about games.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I would rather say that this AfD no longer has any justification. This is not a manual, so the WP:NOT does no longer apply. The information is verifiable (although some editors confuse verifiability with verified, it's not the same, vefifiable means that it can be verified, not that it is), meaning that it doesn't violate WP:V either. And since it's not original research, WP:NOR doesn't apply. This leaves us with some administrators and editors personal opinion that Wikipedia shouldn't contain any game info, and that's not an acceptable argument for deletion, since it violates WP:NOT - Wikipedia is not censored. Personally, I absolutely detest cruft, and would like to rid Wiki of it. But this isn't gamecruft, since gamecruft (as well as other forms of cruft found here and there on Wikipedia) is based on conclusions and assumptions made by some individuals (ie fantasies and their own little "contributions" and "improvements" to for the example overall storyline of a movie, or a fictional universe), and are non-factual/non-canonical information. According to my experience, people tend to condemn everything they personally don't like or are interested in as "cruft", although it is often based on facts and reliable sources. And when you're fighting cruft, you don't use AfD templates, you clean up the crufty articles instead. /<b>M.O</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagore_c109.html" title="User:Magore">u</a>) (<a href="../../../m/a/g/User_talk%7EMagore_308e.html" title="User talk:Magore">t</a>) 16:14, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Though some sections--Warthog in particular--are too detailed for their own good, the page is needed as a vehicle index.

<li><b>Keep but cleanup</b>. If you believe in <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/immediatism" class="extiw" title="m:immediatism">m:immediatism</a>, sure, this article is in bad shape. But I think that this is an encyclopedic topic, and we should approach it from the viewpoint that it is an incomplete article, rather than one that is unsalvageable. When <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> was being developed, many felt that it should not be made policy because that would potentially spark deletion of salvageable articles on fiction. Although I am nominally part of WikiProject Halo, I'm not a big content contributor; I go through a copyedit articles from time to time. I would say that the focus needs to shift to describing the vehicles as <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_artifact.html" title="Cultural artifact">cultural artifacts</a>. By this, I mean that the following questions should be answered (and sourced):
<ul>
<li>How did Bungie come up with the idea for creation? Did they take anything from their earlier games, or perhaps from other fiction?</li>
<li>For vehicles in both <i>Halo</i> and <i>Halo 2</i>, how did they change? Were the changes aesthetic or for reasons of game balance?</li>
<li>How did game critics and other reliable sources react to the vehicles, or any changes made between the games? Are there any reliable reviews that mention the vehicles' handling and shift to third-person perspective?</li>
<li>How have the vehicles been used in notable <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machinima.html" title="Machinima">machinima</a> pieces? For example, the Warthog was the subject of both <i>Warthog Jump</i>, a video that exploits the <i>Halo</i> physics engine, and an entire episode of <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_vs_Blue_4af2.html" title="Red vs Blue">Red vs Blue</a></i> (where the characters wonder why it's called the Warthog in the first place).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In short, I really do think that this topic can be treated encyclopedically, and, in researching along the lines that I mentioned above, editors <i>may</i> find that they have enough material to justify splitting some of the more notable vehicles into their own articles. — <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a>::<a href="../../../t/k/d/User_talk%7ETKD_73cb.html" title="User talk:TKD">Talk</a> 18:22, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. I do, however, believe it is possible to reject dictionary-like discourse in favor of encyclopaedic analysis. After all, isn't that what Wikipedia's all about? <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurai_fde2.html" title="User:Ourai">Ourai</a> 16:09, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I'm going to play devil's advocate for articles like this. You just mentioned analysis, but on such topics as these, how can the analysis not be "original"? These articles cannot possibly meet Wikipedia's formal article criteria, for what is the "source" of the material in this article other than the game itself? To the extent that an article like this <i>is allowed</i>, it needs to be judged on its balance and reasonability vis-a-vis the small world it describes. That description is always going to be "original research", in the most trivial possible sense of that term. I have to wonder about anyone who thinks that observing and synthesizing certain facts about a <i>video game</i> violates Wikipedia standards. The <i>standard</i> should be: this is too silly for an encyclopedia that wants to be taken seriously, or it isn't. I fail to see how any of the listed WP policies--original research, strategy guides, dicdef--meaningfully apply to this article. I say either develop a policy that says a video game can have only one page to describe it, without going into excessive detail, or let it rest, unless the article in question is just crap. Which this isn't. That's my opinion... <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutriggr_fee9.html" title="User:Outriggr">Outriggr</a> 00:10, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Regarding those last two points...the login page actually has more information on it if you follow the 'about' or 'join afw' links...these pages are all extensions of the index.php file so cannot be linked to directly from wikipedia.

<p>--- How could it be spam? This is non-commercial and new users have to be invited. Even if 10,000 people visit the site, none of them can get in, so I fail to see how a posting on wikipedia can be of any advertising benefit to the site. If you wanna delete the entry then fine. But the entry is more about the concept rather than an actual URL address.

<p>It's certainly not spam.</p>
<p>I am loathe to compare, but what is the difference between including asw, friendster etc and not AFW?</p>
<p>Is the tone anything but more apt in the progressive stride for a VERIFIABLE source of entertainment?</p>
<p>There are no published articles.... I fail to see why that is required? Had we wanted to publish such blatent attempts at self publication we would have done so.

<p>I have heard numerous mention of this site on asmallworld and from what I understand it is an offshoot of a number of memebers of this site. From what I understand it is mainly an experiment in absolute free speech without moderation and using relative anonymity. I hear they have well over 1000 members and that they are well beyond being a blog. From what I have read they have held a number of gatherings and parties in London, Paris, Italy and even Dubai. I think the entry of this site is as legitimate as the one for asmallworld or friendster. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sbmcnamara (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sbmcnamara_1525.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sbmcnamara">contribs</a>) 7 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>As an amateur contributor</b>, I'm ready to modify the article as needed. I just added 5 references yesterday as requested; ref 4 is one which should satisfy the validity of the term. The other references serve as dated material to establish when the term came into common use by surface scientists, chemical analysts and materials scientists. The term <b>chemical state</b> was used in a 1979 reference: ref #5, but that reference was published privately and does not have an ISBN number. The term was came into existence in the late 60's, but I've not checked my older books just yet.

<p>A page by this name has been deleted three times as CSD A7. This version of the article at least asserts a significance so speedy is inappropriate. However, whereas it can survive a speedy, there doesn't seem to be enough information to create a usable article or even confirm everything in this one. The creator of this article is User:Ejtl, so there is at least a decent chance that this is an autobiographical article. (EJTL could be Eduardo Lopes's initials.) <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 05:47, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> it bothers me that articles as blatantly hoaxy as this can't be speedied; so, even though it's filled with lies, because it does "assert" notability, it has to go through this process.

However, I'm completely unfamiliar with the subject and hunting down Google hits that aren't teenagers in net forums going "ne1 no how 2 hack in2 swapitshop plz plz plz" seems very difficult, so I can't do it myself, and I'm not at all convinced that it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, anyway.

It shouldn't even matter what sources MathWorld cites, or if they cite anything!!! We're talking about MATHWORLD here. And for those of you trying to smear MATHWORLD, let me point out that it is NOT a "self-published resource". The ONLINE version may be run by Wolfram who employs Eric Weisstein, editor in chief, and Weisstein himself writes many of the entries, but CRC PRESS, a fully <i>independent</i> entity and publisher, publishes the book form. Take that, Trovatore! Finally, we have <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/about/" class="external autonumber" title="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/about/" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>:

I've also not heard this term used in many years of mathematical experience; what this article describes is most commonly called a "<a href="../../../f/i/n/Finite_decimal.html" title="Finite decimal">finite decimal</a>" or "finite decimal expansion"; the MathWorld article also acknowledges this use as valid. <b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal_representation.html" title="Decimal representation">decimal representation</a> and <b>delete</b> the redirect from "regular number" unless other supporting references for this usage can be provided from independent sources.

Importantly, the article generalises the definition of "regular numbers" beyond base 10 (whereas Mathworld talks only about decimals). If this WP article is to be kept, it would appear to me that the right thing to do would be to generalise the WP definition the same way for any base, or redirect to the appropriate existing article that does this job, if there is one (i.e., <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal_expansion.html" title="Decimal expansion">decimal expansion</a> apparently wouldn't fit the bill here). --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 03:04, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

No point generalising to other bases, as every rational number is "regular" in any base which is a multiple of the prime factors of its denominator, and no irrational number is "regular" in any base, so the generalisation simply duplicates the distinction between rationals and irrationals. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandalf61_7a88.html" title="User:Gandalf61">Gandalf61</a> 11:19, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. We have to avoid generalizations, even if they are easy, unless they are well documented (because original research <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is not allowed). The paper on Mesopotamian math doesn't even have a reference to who uses the phrase <i>regular number</i>; it seems in that paper that the author is just using the phrase as a bit of local notation to help the exposition. You might think the author is trying to claim that <i>regular number</i> is a well known term, except that it isn't. I think nobody has exhibited a use of <i>regular number</i> as a defined term in a published monograph other than Mathworld. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> 13:55, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Here's how it looks to me:
<ul>
<li>The link in the article's history to <a href="../../../m/e/a/WP%7EMEA_d033.html" title="WP:MEA">WP:MEA</a> suggests the article was, in fact, created specifically because a corresponding article existed on MathWorld. The MathWorld article, in turn, cites two entries from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, and two books.
<ul>
<li>One OEIS entry (<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A117920" class="external text" title="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A117920" rel="nofollow">A117920</a>) lists Weisstein as the author.</li>
<li>The other (<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A003592" class="external text" title="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A003592" rel="nofollow">A003592</a>) actually uses the term "terminating decimal". Both OEIS entries refer back to MathWorld.</li>
<li>The book <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691099839" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691099839" rel="nofollow">Gamma: Exploring Euler's constant</a></i> is apparently cited to justify the term "finite decimal", and not "regular number", although it is ambiguous. But in fact, Amazon's "Search Inside This Book" feature does not find "regular number" in this book, while it does find "finite decimal" and "(non-)terminating decimal".
<ul>
<li>Checked my copy of Havil's <i>Gamma</i> and I can confirm he does <i>not</i> use the term "regular number". <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandalf61_7a88.html" title="User:Gandalf61">Gandalf61</a> 08:41, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140080295" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140080295" rel="nofollow">Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers</a> is not cited in the context of the term, but of the interesting integer sequences. (Interesting? Well, if they say so.) Again, "Search Inside This Book" finds "finite decimal" and "(non-)terminating decimal" but not "regular number".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The links above to "regular number" above on this AfD seem to be something related, but quite different. In both places, a regular number is an <i>integer</i> of the form 2<sup>a</sup>3<sup>b</sup>5<sup>c</sup>. It does not apply to arbitrary rational (or real) numbers at all, it has to do with ancient mathematical practice. They do not however appear to be local notation, as suggested above, because in fact they both cite:
<ul>
<li>Papers by A. Sachs from the <i>Journal of Cuneiform Studies</i>&#160;: "Babylonian mathematical texts I: reciprocals of regular sexagesimal numbers" (1947) and "Babylonian mathematical texts II: approximations of reciprocals of irregular numbers in an Old Babylonian text" (1952). And if this is not the source, then I surmise it is something else in this discipline. I surmise that the mention above of Conway also ultimately refers to these Babylonian techniques, which, I repeat, is a totally different context from the "regular number" of the article as it stands. 192.75.48.150 15:29, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: The last extensive comment by 192.75.48.150 has convinced me that the current article is describing a neologism created by Eric Weisstein. At best, we could try and rewrite the article to reflect the <i>perhaps</i> well-known use of "regular number" in the study of Babylonian mathematics. But I think given that this usage seems to be fairly restricted to Sachs and some people quoting him, there is doubt as to how widespread it is. I have a suspicion that "regular number" may be used just as (in)frequently in other contexts. Additionally, nobody here is really knowledgable about that subject, so I'm leery of biasing this discussion on future rewrites. I think the best thing is just to delete and if someone writing about Babylonian mathematics needs an article on "regular number", then it can be created and written appropriately. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 16:14, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Repeating point made above ... my own objection to including generalisation of "regular" to other bases is that it is both trivial and uninteresting. Every non-integer rational number is "regular" in an infinite number of bases - it is simple to determine which ones - and not "regular" in an infinite number of other bases. No irrational number is "regular" in any base. Only integers are "regular" in all bases.

TBH, I got the feeling on finding it that this 'regular number' stuff was obscure to the point of 'specialised/obsolete'. Maybe Mathworld only mention it out of some archaic tribute or other? And I am not really (again, as a non-math-head) convinced at the end of the day that this is a particularly standard term for a current and non-ancient notion of what it describes. Mathworld alone, in this case, is not enough IMO.

<li>Yes, thank you for checking. Indeed, I concur the citations in Mathworld leave much to be desired (the principle editor Eric Weisstein, I am not conviced always reads the citations in mathworld; I take them to be suggested further reading rather than references). Additionally, I never heard the term "regular number" while I was getting my BS in math. Having said that, mathworld is not given to the creation of neologisms in my experience. I am not convinced the article is comprehensive in its descriptions of useages, but further checking on MathSciNet indicates thirty articles which use the term "regular number." There are several references to TA Springer's "Theory of regular numbers." I have not had time to look up and digest these references (and they may use a different definition). However there seems to me to be evidence the term is used. --<a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeaDrinker_0ad2.html" title="User:TeaDrinker">TeaDrinker</a> 22:55, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are no "odd" opinions, only the documented fact by engineering manager Bob Kress that the F-14 was designed for maneuverability, and Flight Magazine 1969 that calls the F-14 an air superiority fighter. Unfortunately it appears that the majority of WP users sympathize with Mmx1 in being able to be persons with zero credentials dismiss all reliable sources and construct factually incorrect positions that can be placed in WP while cited sources can be removed, and innocent collateral articles can also be removed with full approval of WP editors. This is a rather shocking learning experience for me, and I will certainly transfer this information elsewhere if the WP community won't stand for it.

<dd>Tom, essays are generally allowable in Wikipedia space (as far as I understand it) provided that they are marked as such (with {{<a href="../../../e/s/s/Template%7EEssay_6343.html" title="Template:Essay">essay</a>}}) and aren't attack pages.

<dd>I'd say Wikipediaspace is not the proper place for this "essay", it somehow "institutonalizes" it, and its still somebodys angry statement over a personal feud and injured ego. I'd rather see it within userspace, without redirects from the namespace. This whole thing just caused far too much ado than it is really worth.

<p>This is a series of artilces related to Leader of the Eyre/Heller Dynasty in the United States (also see associated <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Leader_of_the_Eyre_Heller_Dynasty_in_the_United_States_139c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Leader of the Eyre/Heller Dynasty in the United States">AfD</a>). Basically, this seems to be a chunk of geneology research. Hard poking at the references yield nothing. I noted that there's a castle eyre, but then again, there's a castle Breitenstein sitting in Europe too, but there's no article on that. The thought of a hoax comes to mind, but its probably more likely, as I said, geneology research. I really can't find anything special, nor can I find substantiated evidence beyond the wikipedia articles of any sort of <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynasty.html" title="Dynasty">dynasty</a>. Its just a family line. However, if someone can actually clinch the existance of a serious power-management dynastic old-money family that existed under these names, I will happy withdraw this nomination. In point:</p>

<p>Okay, this:</p>
<p>Title: Business papers, 1795-1847 (bulk 1800-1805). Description: 720 items. Notes: Manuel Eyre, a Philadelphia merchant of Quaker ancestry, was born in 1777. His father, Manuel Eyre, Sr., [take note, as this man was the subject of one of my articles] (1736-1805) was a shipwright in Kensington and a colonel in the Contintental Army. He obtained his training in the counting house of Henry Pratt and Abraham Kintzing and in 1803 joined with Charles Massey, Jr., (b. 1778) to form the mercantile firm of Eyre &amp; Massey, a partnership that lasted until Eyre's death in 1845. The firm of Eyre &amp; Massey owned over 20 vessels, ranging in size from ships to sloops, and traded around the world, mounting voyages to Europe, the Caribbean, South America, China, India and the Pacific Islands. Manuel Eyre also served on the Philadelphia City Council and was a founding director of the Schuylkill Navigation Company (1816) and the Second Bank of the United States (1816). After 1820 he gradually retired from active trading and devoted much of his time to agriculture. He owned two farms outside the city and three in Delaware. He was the founder of Delaware City, Del., at the mouth of the Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal, buying the entire site in 1828, erecting public buildings and dividing it into lots.</p>

<p>This:</p>
<p>Mr. Rumsey says in page 2, "That in the month of September, 1781 he exhibited the model of a Boat to his Excellency General Washington at Bath in Berkeley County, calculated for stemming the current of rapid rivers only constructed on principles very different from (his) present one&#160;; satisfied of the experiment of her making way against a rapid stream by the force of the stream the General was pleased to give me a most ample certificate of her efficacy." Here it is to be observed, that no mention was made to General Washington of steam at the time of such exhibition&#160;; the principles on which the Boat was propelled, were entirely unconnected with, and distinct from steam; being simply a model propelled by water wheels, cranks, and setting poles&#160;; a mode which was many years ago tried on the river Schuylkill by a farmer near Reading, but without success. From an exhibition of this plan it was that Mr. Rumsey procured the certificate from General Washington, and on that certificate were Mr. Rumsey's laws founded. In his petitions to the several legislatures, he prayed for no exclusive right, for the use of Steam Boats; neither did be make mention of Steam, to their committees; or even suggest an idea of the kind; as proof of which, I offer the following petition to the Assembly of Pennsylvania the certificate from General Washington, accompanying it, and the certificate of Manuel Eyre, Esquire, who was one of the committee of Assembly, who reported in Mr. Rumsey's- favor.</p>

<p>The same day the Navy Board recommended to Council that as there were reasons to believe that some vessels of the English fleet would attempt to approach the city, a certain number of persons should be assigned to flood Hog Island, and that ninety or one hundred men should garrison the fort at Darby Creek. Council requested the Navy Board to see to the flooding of the Island, and ordered a company of artillery and a company of "Musqueters," under the command of Col. Jehu Eyre, to the works at Darby Creek.</p>

<p>This: When the Revolution broke out in 1775, Hewson organized a company of volunteers from his own Kensington workmen and served as their Captain. He was joined in this patriotic response by the shipwright Jehu Eyre, who captained his own ship carpenters, workmen, and apprentices in the "Kensington Artillery." The Eyre shipyards at the foot of Columbia Avenue hastily constructed thirteen gondolas and galleys for use in the defense of the city.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The family remained wealthy and powerful long after the Revolution, retaining its political sway until 1929 and its monetary strength until 1934. The Revolution was important in establishing the Eyre family, but it was not the defining event of the dynasty. The Heller family was itself enormously wealthy (which is the main reason that Anne Eyre Heller and Franklin Pierce Heller are significant in their own right). George Eyre was the first member of the family to live in what was then the American Colonies, which makes him noteworthy as the family's American founder. And, of course, Leroy Heller saw the downfall of Eyre/Heller might, which makes him highly important.</li>

<li>Eyre Empire was one of the first articles I ever debated on Wikipedia. I supported it enthusiastically then, and, while I have since had reservations about some of the material contained therein, I still stand by the essence of the piece, which stated that a family of greatly powerful patricians existed in this country that played a pivotal role in the Revolution, the Civil War, and later financial developments in American history. I hope that everyone will please actually read the sources that I provided. The reaction of some members leads me to believe that that has not been happening.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eyre Empire first sparked a deep interest in this family for me, and led me to do extensive research and then write the articles now up for deletion themselves. I worked quite hard, scoured the Internet, went to various libraries, and even spoke with several descendants of the family.</p>
<p>As an American patriot (some would so jingoistic, though I disagree with them), I think that the Eyre and Hellers ought to be hailed as individual heroes, and that, as a group, they should be recognized for the tremendous influence that they have had in forming and then helping to lead the greatest nation in the history of the world.</p>
<p>The United States is the single most wondrous power that the world has or ever will see, a beacon of freedom that has stood as a symbol of hope in the hearts of millions of immigrants for centuries, has been almost solely responsible for the salvation of democracy (through heroic struggles in World Wars I and II and in the Cold War), has defined the very idea of modern liberal government and human rights, and remains the world's brightest light in the dark.</p>
<p>America has given millions not only the reality of freedom, but has granted the people of Earth the very conception of liberty. The idea itself was a mere fantasy to the thinkers of the Enlightenment, trapped as they were in their Absolutist kingdoms. The American Revolution and the subsequent establishment of our Constitutional system showed legions of oppressed, impoverished wretches everywhere that freedom was not a myth but something that could be achieved.</p>
<p>The French Revolution of 1789 was directly inspired by its American predecessor, as have countless other liberal revolts throughout history. And without the selfless sacrifices made by Jehu Eyre and his kin, none of that would have been possible. The influenc of this family on world history is incalculable.</p>
<p>His descendants went on to continue contributing to the American Republic, finally reaching their ignominious end in 1929 under the disastrous leadership of Leroy Heller (a historical figure who, the more I learn about, the less I like). For two hundred years, from their arrival in 1727 to their ultimate collapse in 1929 (and/or 1934), they were one of America's greatest and riches families. They founded cities (Delaware City, Hellertown), established banks (Second Bank of the United States, which a Heller still sits on today), fought in wars (the Spanish-American War, the Civil War), and maintained a position as an economic powerhouse (Eyre/Heller shipping yards and trading companies in Philadelphia). All of thi points to a highly significant family deserving of the articles I have written about them.</p>

<dd>There does seem to have been an American Revolutionary artillery commander called Jehu Eyre - <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Jehu+Eyre%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Jehu+Eyre%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">see this google book search</a>. I don't know if he's sufficiently notable for Wikipedia. In any case, I agree that his article seems to have numerous dubious details, possibly introduced by a malicious hoaxer - for instance the $1.8bn claim is totally wrong (see my note on the article talk page) and the article has a childish view of the American Revolution. The external reference sources given currently are very unsatisfactory. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:38, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Even if the other articles are not hoaxes, Wikipedia is not a family genealogy site, and these articles do not assert their encyclopedic notability anyway.

<li><b>Followup</b> After doing some research, I've come to the conclusion while not all the information is hoax material - Jehu Eyre and Manuel Eyre Snr did exist (though I don't think Manuel is sufficiently notable for an encyclopedia at all), but there seems to be no evidence that the other people did. It does seem increasingly clear that History21 is for reasons of his/her own, is making very inflated and misleading grandiose claims about the Eyres/Hellers. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:52, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

This is in part because the article is little more than the sort of puff blurb that one sees in corporate brochures, full of <a href="../../../b/u/z/Buzzword.html" title="Buzzword">buzzwords</a> but devoid of information. There's pretty much zero content in the article that tells one about the concept of free mobile content, and I'm highly suspicious that the intent of this article is actually to have the phrase "free mobile content" linked to the web sites listed in the external links section, rather than to have an encyclopaedia article on some subject. The article tells the reader that there is a "new revolution in place" and a "new trend" that is "contributing at the democratization the mobile content value chain". Until this trend/revolution is actually documented in some secondary source, there can be no encyclopaedia article on the subject of free mobile content. The article, of course, cites no sources. I can find borderline sources <i>on the subject of free mobile content</i> (none of which support the notion that there's a "new revolution" or a "new trend") such as "<a href="http://www.moconews.net/?p=4654" class="external text" title="http://www.moconews.net/?p=4654" rel="nofollow">The Problem With Free Mobile Content</a>", <i>MocoNews</i>. and Richard Martin.

<p>Another article from the <i>Lost Books</i> series. For a comprehensive account of the problem see <a href="../../../e/m/-/User%7EEm-jay-es_9812.html" title="User:Em-jay-es">User:Em-jay-es</a>'s comment in a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lost_Book_of_Jasher_f496.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lost Book of Jasher">related AfD</a>. The "Lost Book of Moses" that this article is about is an account of the victory over the Amalekites mentioned in Ex 17:14.</p>
<p>The problems here are threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>The article asserts that the document (account, poem, inscription) related to the victory over the Amalekites is indeed a "book"</li>
<li>The article asserts that that document is called "Book of Moses" and a few other names and does not mention who calls it that</li>
<li>The article also asserts that several references in the Bible refer to that document (again without references)</li>

<p>Well 'funny'ness isn't it itself a deletion citeria is it, what matters is whether this is true not whether or not it's amusing (as opposed to pathetic), it occurs to me that the books are probably comedies, and the original poster structured the wikipedia entry in the same light. I can affirm Trevor K Grant is indeed a real person, he was in the year above me at Quarry Bank Comprehensive school, and was friends with Clive Barker. On the basis of acquaintance and because Trevor is notoriously IT-weak I have given him some of my flickr space to host the art from his books. While this is poor, it doesn't strike me as worse than many a self-published writers. I haven't actually seen any of the books themselves though. Simon Bucher-Jones</p>
<p><b>Strong keep</b> Although I've only joined today, I've been a Wiki fan for many years, and have joined to come along and Support Trevor. I am a *real* author too. Look me up, on Amazon go on, you know you want to&#160;:-) Trevor is an old friend, and a bit (I'm sure he won't mind me saying) Up Himself, but his books are real, I've read them - and although a little florrid in style they are in existence. Trevor has many fans. I know, I've been scared by many of the perspiring plump be-moled women who buy his books (for something more than thrills and chills I'll wager)! So Trev is real. Trev is cool. And trev is noteworthy. Please, please let him stay. Many thanks.--Paul Ebbs 12:38, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is not a copy of a HFH Store Manual. It is a detailed description of how to run a Habitat for Humanity ReStore. It also serves to provide information on the inner workings of HFH Restores operating in the United States. I am currently updating it with more information.</p>

<p>In order <b>to create some buzz before the release of the Nokia N91 music phone we created a somewhat odd character by the name of Pjotro</b>. He loves music so much that he became music.

<li><b>Weak keep or neutral</b> As far as torrent sites go, I'm pretty sure this is among the largest. I know Alexa rank doesn't show up in any notability guidelines, but that number is really good for a site that's nothing but a torrent list. My weakness of the keep comes from that I'm not really convinced that even being among the largest torrent sites really means it needs an article. There's simply not a lot to say about any website that only exists to list files. Exceptions of course would be places like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pirate_Bay_cefb.html" title="The Pirate Bay">The Pirate Bay</a>, because of huge news coverage. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 19:42, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>REALLY STRONG Keep</b>. A clear example on how a company took over a community supported website and tryed (and succeeded to some sort) to shut off the people who created it, and the people who used it. All to profit from an already very popular website with a large userbase and a large amount of content contributors who themselves didn't profited from it. <s>Johnnyg0 7 July 2006</s> <i>(the previous comment was posted by 66.36.141.82. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 23:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC))</i></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> So I've read the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a> and especially the "Problem articles that may require deletion" table in it, and the Empornium page does not match *any* of the deletion candidate criteria. In fact the thing it most matches is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_censored</a>. So the question comes down to "is it an advertisement". I don't think it is. The website is not for profit. It has a long history. It's going through political changes (for which I came here this very night to find out wtf is going on, the forums are down and probably being censored as long time moderators and admins are evicted), and it's literally had hundreds of thousands of users. If anything the page needs to be expanded by people in the know. Furthermore if you delete this page, you need to delete the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a> page and a hundred others, just because they describe websites that have large communities of users that are interested in them. Which is just silly. Someone doesn't like porn - and that's not a criteria for deletion.

</ul>
<p><b>KEEP</b> provides valuable info on the nature of the site although im not sure how much current info is genuine. Such as Targetpoint deleting accounts? I cant see it because the material on EMP which people want is provided by the users, so if they delete accounts they annoy and remove uploaders, which reduces the torrents available which reduces the need to visit the site, which reduces hits and revenew.</p>
<p>Also, the old mods keep saying different things such as Target point are deleting accounts to charge a fee, changing ratios to stop people leeching and reinstating an old database to hide the members who have deleted their account. All of those points contradict the other. Such as would deleting accounts not reduce the overall membership? Why change ratios just to restore them barely hours later? If they want membership fees then why reinstate people accounts?</p>
<p>Also, I believe that the old regime are voting low on peoples torrents. Why? Target point wouldnt do it as they would be annoying their own users. Saz and the rest will be doing it to annoy the users enough to go to their new site. Probably do the opposite, if they think doing what they are doing will get them new members they are dead wrong. Loyalty counts for nothing in this, most people just want porn.</p>
<p>Keep the facts and remove everything else designed just to bad mouth target point cause not all of it can be proven.</p>

<dd><b>useless comment</b> Well, there is a lot of misinformation out there, but the accounts were for the most part deleted by the users themselves, possibly as a protest against Targetpoint's apparent intention of making emp a paysite.

<p>–<b>Keep</b> This provides an unbiased outline of the history of this site and no matter the outcome be it good or bad.

<ul>
<li><b>DEFINITE Keep</b> Good information here about what Empornium has gone through. This is certainly not advertising and it is a notable site (just because you don't like it does not make it un-notable). It has been the biggest and best of it's kind. Besides all that, why does one wiki page draw the ire of so many people? Those looking for information about the site and what has happened will find it here and isn't that what Wiki is really all about? If you don't like the information contained in the article, add more. Deletion should only be considered in extreme circumstances. Chronocore 8 July 2006</li>

<p>Keep- How are target point hiding the truth? If that was the case why are they telling us new members are paying a fee? Stop being a fanboy and use your own eyes. Sazaraki and the rest are currently ruining EMP. Its funny how everyone moans at Targetpoint but nobody moans at Sazaraki for selling the site up the river to no doubt line his own pockets. Who is to say that wouldnt happen with his new site?</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> - Just as notable as <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate_Bay_6051.html" title="Pirate Bay">Pirate Bay</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mininova.html" title="Mininova">mininova</a>, etc, if not more so. In reply to above, they have taken the forums down claiming it be maintenance (Ive been a part of the community for over 2 years, and I dont recall the forums ever being down this long without there being some news on it.), as well as removed any torrent comments critical to Targetpoint, I have had several of my comments deleted in the past few days, they were not spam, nor flaming, but rather observations about what was going on &amp; the information control (whether real or perceived) myself &amp; many others believe to be going on. <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyraan_7e60.html" title="User:Cyraan">Cyraan</a> 20:51, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b>Keep-</b> The arguments for deletion so far are weak: <i>"I'm not really convinced that even being among the largest torrent sites really means it needs an article. There's simply not a lot to say about any website that only exists to list files. Exceptions of course would be places like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pirate_Bay_cefb.html" title="The Pirate Bay">The Pirate Bay</a>, because of huge news coverage."</i> Just because one doesn't think much of a bittorrent site doesn't mean it's unworthy of listing. It is a controversial movement, it is a site that covers a controversial aspect of a controversial movement, and its current seemingly hostile takeover is controversial. Ironically this person recommends the listing of piratebay, which is controlled by the same company which has allegedly taken over empornium, and therefore to list piratebay and not empornium would create a subjective imbalance in wikipedia. <i>"Keep the facts and remove everything else designed just to bad mouth target point cause not all of it can be proven."</i> <i>"It's currently in the process of adopting a pay account system, and so this is advertising."</i> When one considers these two arguments for editing/deletion together, they actually support the need to keep the article mostly intact. The listing discusses the controversial move by the targetpoint corporation to charge new users for the system. That is an unsavory and unappealing aspect to a bittorrent site (bitorrent's purpose being the controversial free sharing of information) and therefore not only should the negatively critical aspects of the article be held intact, it is clearly not advertising, as that aspect of the article presents the site's transformation in a negatively light.</p>
<p><b>Strong Keep-</b> I see no issues with keeping this page. It is not advertising. The recent changes at the site must be taken into consideration when weighing whether to delete or keep his site, as the motivations of these voters may be biased by their feelings about the site itself and not the Wiki entry. This is not the place to debate those changes. The site is large and notable and its entry in the Wiki should remain. --Sarty 02:43, 10 July 2006 (UTC) &lt;3&gt;</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> Well, I came to wikipedia to look up information regarding the recent torrent of controversy (pun intended) around empornium and its takeover by targetpoint. Isn't that the whole point of wikipedia? If the article didn't exist, me and probably tens or hundreds of other people would have not aquired this information. Definitely keep as long as the article is correct and unbiased.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> Same as above, would never have known why a controvery existed if this article wasn't here.</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> As a former Admin ousted by the new controling parties and even in light of their continued practice of deception and censorship of whats really going on... I still say Keep. Why? Emp was the largest and best of it's kind. Perhaps I am biased. I'm upset overwhat it's becoming, but even the King gave the colonists respect after the war was over. If Targetpoint can manage to turn a dime over this mess, then more power to them, but it won't be with my sweat or bits.--204.8.204.108 07:01, 12 July 2006 (UTC)Vic &lt;4&gt;</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. There are serious issues with this article. It is a POV fork of <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelation.html" title="Revelation">revelation</a> (or maybe <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_experience.html" title="Religious experience">religious experience</a>. The title is very poor. I would suggest changing it to Revelation (Catholicism) or Revelation (Roman Catholic Church), if it is demed appropriate to fork out the catholic POV from the main revelation article. That said, the article lacks wikification and formating. There is inappropriate use of the 2nd person. The Catholic POV is still overbearing. This article has not been converted per the <a href="../../../m/i/s/WP%7EMISSING_b880.html" title="WP:MISSING">WP:MISSING</a> guidelines. I am not sure if that is reason enough to delete an article. I personally feel that this is a very poor example of a wikipedia article and would rather it be worked up a lot before having gone live.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 22:22, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> - I gave my reasoning for this in the AfD for the individual Smack-Off articles, but I'll put it back here. This article is a supporting article for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jim_Rome_Show_f91d.html" title="The Jim Rome Show">The Jim Rome Show</a></i>, and the contest is no small, rinky-dink matter. The contest is a yearly feature of the show, ties directly into one of the principal features of the show's content (namely the "smack talk" that Rome uses), and is a source of multi-national attention given that the show broadcasts into both the USA and Canada and attracts participants from both countries. The article is in need of copyediting, but should stay. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillbyr_8684.html" title="User:Willbyr">Willbyr</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillbyr_6b53.html" title="User talk:Willbyr">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willbyr_1daf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willbyr">contribs</a>) 22:47, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>It would probably have to have a good level of media coverage (besides that from the show itself, of course) for most people here to consider it notable. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 03:23, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comments</b> - Since the show (and, thusly, the Smack-Off) has been around since the mid '90s, is carried on over 200 affiliate stations through Premiere Radio Networks, is heard in both the US, Canada, and pretty much worldwide through Podcasting, and Rome has both a show on ESPN and <i>The Jim Rome Show</i>, and hundreds of athletes from several different sports have participated in interviews on both shows, the description "mildly notable" is...well, just silly. Additionally, Fox Sports radio host <a href="../../../j/2E/t/J.T._the_Brick_7e15.html" title="J.T. the Brick">J.T. the Brick</a> got his notoriety through this contest, as he was its first winner. I'd also like to point out that the comment about "most people" is a rather arrogant assumption. While I'm sure that most of the people who are members of Wikipedia could give a toss about anything related to Rome (and I'm assuming that that's the case with the people who are suddenly up in arms about these articles), the average joe's curiosity about the radio show and the activities that are associated with it deserves to be sated. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillbyr_8684.html" title="User:Willbyr">Willbyr</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillbyr_6b53.html" title="User talk:Willbyr">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Willbyr_1daf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Willbyr">contribs</a>) 04:44, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. "It's a contest on a radio show" is not <i>per se</i> a valid reason to delete. The smack-off is an annual event, and the biggest day of the year on a very popular radio show. It deserves an article. <a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETacoDeposit_8aab.html" title="User:TacoDeposit">TacoDeposit</a> 16:37, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, I'll rephrase. Contests on radio shows are not notable and don't deserve articles. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 17:39, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Again, being a contest on a radio show doesn't <i>per se</i> make something undeserving of an article. <a href="../../../t/a/c/User%7ETacoDeposit_8aab.html" title="User:TacoDeposit">TacoDeposit</a> 18:10, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Other than the fact that it is a radio contest why is it up for deletion? The contest has been going on since 1996 - it's not some lame game you hear on your local sports radio show. It is a syndicated show. Also, if you attempted to merge this with Jime Rome or The Jim Rome Show both articles would become excessively lengthy to the point of having to be massively edited. --<a href="../../../n/k/o/User%7ENkowal_3130.html" title="User:Nkowal">NRK</a> 17:08, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is the only reason why it is up for deletion. Articles on radio show contests are not encyclopedic in any way (unless they are related to some newsworthy event; the other radio host being discovered wouldn't come close to qualifying as newsworthy) because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>.

<p>Appears to be a single-editor vanity article for a non-notable writer (11 Ghits). Much of it is unverifiable. It is unclear what is the basis for being recorded as an <i>outstanding alumnus</i> of Walsh. His book <i>A Mans life</i> is from a small publisher - I can't determine whether or not it's effectively self-published. The other books seem unverifiable from here.</p>

<p>I've read his works on the internet and purchased his latest book from Amazon.com. There is no vanity in my facts -- Mr. Martin was an outstanding alumnus of Walsh University based on the criteria listed from Walsh College, in North Canton, OH . I find little vanity in telling how his wife died, and the conditions underwhich he wrote his poem, A Night's Prayer. facts, not 'appearances'. I do find one person's view of what is 'notable' or not, unacceptable. Do not delete.</p>

<p><b>Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews</b></p>
<p>--A Man's Life was independently reviewed in newspaper articles and literary reviews in newspapers and other publications.</p>
<p>--The same book was independently submitted for The Pulitzer Prize as Distinguised Verse by an American author in 1994.</p>

<li><b>Naïve keep</b>, but only because almost every episode in the series (which lasted about 180 episodes) has its own article. Since I never watched the show, I can't claim that one episode is more notable than another, but I'd assume per DS9 precedent that this article is as good as most. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The problem with deleting an episode is that there are other series that have each episode as a separate entry. <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a> is an example of this. Every episode has it's own article. If we deleted this episode, it might spark a precedence where we might have to go back through and delete a bunch of episodes of various shows. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETargetter_27f5.html" title="User:Targetter">Targetter</a> 22:56, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the pecedent is that episodes of notable shows are notable. This is debateable but AfD is probably not the place to debate it. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 23:02, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - there's sort of an unspoken consensus that episodes of significantly notable enough shows warrant their own articles, if only because then WikiProjects Dr Who, Buffyverse, Firefly, Star Trek, and many others would have nothing better to do.

<dd><b>Keep</b> - I am familiar with this company without doing any research. If my memory serves me they produced the first bluetooth headset for cell phones, or at least one of the first successful ones. There was a brief period of time in which bluetooth headsets for cell phones were called "one of those wireless Jabra headsets" as they really caught the attention of the public for being like star trek-like communication devices.

<dd>So, describing the structure of a building assists in notability? I'm sort of confused by how this would assist in making an article instantly notable. If I made a club up and I wrote a well written article about it, it would still be deleted for not being notable. What gives this mall a free pass exactly? <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 03:06, 8 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm a bit confused about why you are talking about "notability"...or "notable" articles. If you made up a club and wrote an article about it then the article should get deleted because the club does not exist. It would fail WP:V. This large mall does exist. It has 1m floorspace, large anchors and an important economic regional presence. Which can be confirmed, unlike your imaginary club. Getting back to "notability", please let me know when you can define that "concept" in a satisfactory way to meet the sensibilities of all global users and contributors to this encyclopedia. Until such definition is established, "notability" or lack thereof is merely opinion. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:39, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just because something exists does not mean that it is notable, for instance a little league team is not notable.

I think <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is somewhat of a good measure of how to judge the notability of alot of articles.

<dd>With all due respect, you just used the word "notable" or a derivation five times in five lines. That is quite a lot of opinion for a short comment. I shouldn't have to remind you that there is no policy here on notability. There are, though, a few essays on the topic, although these lack any validity whatsoever. Regarding WP:NOT, I do not believe that it covers any ground with regards to this stub. Its examples are quite specific and they do not include malls. WP:Bio is a guideline for people. As I have indicated, I would be quite happy to see this article remain on the site and do not believe that it violates any policies or that there are grounds for deletion. Many of the mall articles become quite informative over time and I think they are a valuable resource. They fit very nicely with our extensive coverage of small towns and regions. Much of that may not be "notable" to you, but is to many, many readers here. I sincerely hope people contribute more mall articles to the point where we can boast encyclopedic coverage of the topic. I also would have no problem with articles on little league teams. Those are some of my opinions. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:01, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My apologies for the word "notable," it just because of the time (EST) and lack of a better word to describe this article. So, by what you are proposing would half of what exists on AfD should be an automatic keep since the concept of notability is ambigious and should not apply to any argument. I'll put what I see in this article as simply as I can. It's an average mall that is typical and unextraordinary, it's not deserving of an encylopedic article since it's not unique or special in anyway. It's just a mall. An encylopedic mall would be the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mall_of_America_3a18.html" title="Mall of America">Mall of America</a>. It's not an issue of policy but usefullness and overal value. All, I am asking is really simple: why should this mall remain? It's boderline promotion, nothing makes this mall stick out nor does the mall do anything to assert importance. Articles are speedied for not asserting there importance, that is the basis of CSD. This article is about some kind of a structure that is ununique and has no importance stressed. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 04:09, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I respect your opinion, but I disagree. I'm sure some of the citizens in Cary would as well. Large malls are all unique to their areas and become local and regional landmarks. As far as I'm concerned, they are de facto important, just like schools. That meets my criteria for inclusion. If we delete this based on your argument, the next step would be to delete most of the articles on small towns, since what really makes them so unique? I expect an encyclopedia to have comprehensive coverage, not just the top ten or the largest as you seem to be implying with the Mall of America. From my standpoint, that means all towns, malls and schools (and many, many other things). --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:31, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>See, I have an easy lenancy for schools and towns, since 98% if the time, there is something that makes it unique or interesting is listed within the article. When you cut down to the core features of this article you get the follow: this article is about a mall, it has stores. Not exactly shining material or anything that meets any guideline, essay, that I can think of. I also respect your opinion and admire you for having one of the finest debates I've engaged in AfD. Inculsion is a rather strange thing on Wiki, but it is and should be done on a case by case basis. If something can be presented to make it somewhat different, then, well, you have a Wikipedia worthy article. However, if you create something that is generic and not useful, well, you have potentional lly deletable content. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 04:39, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> uniqueness is not a factor for inclusion in Wikipedia of which I'm aware - there are many generic articles about things arguably the same. I think large shopping centres should be kept (certainly if high schools can be) by dint of their commercial notability and importance to surrounding areas. Added assertions of notability only help. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 02:54, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This article does nothing to stress the commerical, social, or anyother importance to any area. It just looks like a typical mall, which stands as normality. By uniqueness, I am really refering to the easiest question to establish notability, "how is the subject different from anything else that is similar to it?" This seems to be a normal, average mall.

<dd><b>Comment</b> the meat puppet reference is that it is obvious that the subject of this article has asked his family, friends, and coworkers, who have never contributed to WP before, to come and vote, with little to no understanding of the policies that WP is run under, most notably <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.

<li><b>Leave It Alone</b> - I was just watching him on C-SPAN and came to Wikipedia specifically to find out more about him.

<li>On what grounds does BlueValour propose to delete the article? I'm looking at the criteria at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>. I don't know how anyone can claim that Zeese doesn't qualify based on those criteria. Here's a brief rundown of his multiple qualifications for notability: 1)He is a "[m]ajor local political figure who receive[s] significant press coverage." 2)He is a published author who has received multiple independent reviews of his work (32 hits on Amazon.com). He also qualifies under several "alternative" criteria. To wit: the professor test, verifiability, expandability, and, as mentioned by previous posters, the Google test (205,000 hits for "Kevin Zeese" and 38 hits for "Kevin Zeese" in the "News" search). I think it's a mistake to only use the criteria at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a> for a person who is well known outside of their candidacy. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJessesamuel_8842.html" title="User:Jessesamuel">Jessesamuel</a> 15:58, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep it as its own article</b> - For the same reason as listed immediately above: from what I know of Zeese, he's significant enough for his own article, and not just for the sake of being nice SCGC</li>
<li>Keep, its not just about his running for office, he has been a leading advocate for civil rights issues and ending the war on drugs for 30 years. His run for senate is unusial as he unites parties at opposite ends of the political spectrum (G's and L's), this is the first time in History that has happened in the state of MD if not the US.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>It states that the article lacks sources, I am unclear as to what it is refering too. I have known him my whole life and I will testify that all of its background history is accurate, -Alex Zeese (his son). PS- I personally think this is a partisan Democratic attack to get rid of this page, I don't see any threats on any of the Democratic Senate Candidates, or Republicans pages to get rid of them, and most of them are less significant then my father is.</li>

<li>Keep: I have known and worked with Kevin Zeese for years and can testify to the accuracy of the article (as does his own son! SEE BELOW). I have run into people throughout the DC metro area, Maryland and across the country who know and value Kevin Zeese's long history as an adocate for human rights and an end to the so-called "Drug War" which has become a war on American communities, turning them into combat zones! The advocates of Deleting or Redirecting are obviously partisan corporate liberals who favor continuing this costly policy making drug-related free-fire zones out of our inner cities. I wonder if they also advocate Deletion or Redirection of the Corporate Democrat and Republican candidates for U.S. Senator from Maryland?</li>

<p>The claim that Kevin Zeese -- with his three-decades-plus career of public service on the national political scene, acting as an avocate of basic human rights and representing the majority position on national drug policy on network television shows like ABC Nightline and in numerous other national media -- does not deserve an article in Wikipedia is so far beyond reasonable that I would think the request would be thrown out immediately!</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. BlueValour - why didn't you mention the 217,000 hits when one does a google search on "Kevin Zeese"? This isn't just a <i>minor party senate candidate casting about for support</i> - that statement seriously mischaracterizes who Kevin Zeese is. Also, I have cleaned up the article by moving much of the campaign detail to the main article about the election, which still leaves a significant amount of text about him. I invite those who have voted against keeping this article to take a second look, and to keep in mind the google search results. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 21:59, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Kevin Zeese's biography is easily verifiable, as he has been a public figure and political activist and has been participating in electoral politics for 30 years. There are many people, myself included, who have worked with Kevin Zeese on activist and electoral political issues [my personal issue being voting system integrity] and who can vouch for the details and the relevance of his work. I can see no reason to delete the Kevin Zeese article other than that someone here in Maryland, likely a Democratic Party official, might be trying to keep Kevin Zeese's activist light under the proverbial bushel because of his third-party U.S. Senate campaign. But if one looks at the whole of Kevin Zeese's resume, and tallies the number of activitst organizations he has founded, headed, or worked for, and tallies the broad array of political issues that he has been involved with in his 30 plus-year career, one should be able to recognize that the relevance of the Kevin Zeese article goes far beyond his current U.S. Senate campaign. However Kevin Zeese fares in the 2006 U.S. Senate Campaign, the relevance of the whole of his work should be recognized, and the Wikipedia article should be retained.</li>

<p>It would be nice to know who "BlueValour" is. A basic American core-value is to know the identity of the accusser! In this case, the slander against a nationally known leader of the movements for sane drug policies, varifiable voting, and peace should be ignored when it comes from one who hides behind a fake name!</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> In five minutes of searching I found pages for two other minor party candidates who are running for office this year and one who ran for office two years ago.

<p>Indeed, more of this article is about Mr. Zeese's prior career than about the Senate race. It is not substantially different from Michael Steele and Ben Cardin's pages; the major party candidates in the same race. The candidates and elections criteria state that there should be one page for each race. If you apply that criteria to one candidate in the race, you should apply it to all. Tim Willard<br />

<dd>Tim - in response to your first paragraph - Wikipedia has over a million articles in it. It's pointless to point to articles that are WORSE than the one under discussion and ask why they have not been deleted, UNLESS they were proposed for deletion and such proposals failed (THEN they ARE precedent). The existence of other articles that should be removed, but have not yet been, does nothing to prove whether the article under discussion (Kevin Zeese) should or should not be removed. Please focus on the criteria in wikipedia policy regarding whether the subject of THIS article is newsworthy or not. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 12:55, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>John - At this point it's not clear what criteria is being used to judge this article. The first criticism "notability" has been repeatedly refuted with no counter from the critics. The second, that this is a "Minor party senate candidate casting about for support" seems to imply that it is being judged under the candidates and elections criteria. But the article is primarily about the man and not the campaign. You need to be careful about deleting this article if that is the criteria used because there are undoubtably hundreds of other articles written in the same format that could be challanged on the same grounds. You are opening a can of worms. Could you specificly state under what criteria this article should be deleted? -Tim Willard
<dl>
<dd>Tim - please check your scorecard - as you can see from above, I voted to keep the article. And may I suggest that it's about time for you to stop posting to the discussion, and to trust the process?

<dd><i>"The links do not point to Chris Messina (open source ambassador) but to Factory city."</i> With the greatest respect did you read the description for each entry in google? That's what it says. Also, FactoryCity is simply the name of Chris's pretty famous (high technorati ranking) blog. Most people don't have blogs or personal sites that match their personal names. In Chris's case it looks like a different Chris Messia owns' his .com anyway.
