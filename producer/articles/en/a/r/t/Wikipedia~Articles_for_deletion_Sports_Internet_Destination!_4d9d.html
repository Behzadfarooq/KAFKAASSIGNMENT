<p>Article by User:Sports Internet Destination (copy of his user page) about a website. The site <i>offers "Top Sites" search engines</i>, and downloads, etc. Looks like advertising. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:22, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is a FACTUAL description of a company with relationships with some of the world's largest sports retailers. "Top Sites" is put in parentheses because Sports Internet Destination! describes its search engines as indexing top sports sites, this is descriptive not advertising. If objectionable, would rather remove that term. No basis for deleting entire article (which was not embellished or drawn out, kept matter of fact). Would welcome outside contributors to the article so that it evolves in Wikipedia as it should. Thank you so much for your consideration.

<li>This is a great forum, and we appreciate the feedback. We have the world's top (or close to top) search engines on our sites in 4 separate sports categories, and a diverse offering of top sports retailers, plus about 100 professionally written features, articles, full publications, etc -- we are a resource and information site. We want to be included in the fairest manner and will abide by all rules but are seeking fairness (our site is new but highly regarded). Posters on Wikipedia seem very intelligent, and I'm sure (hopeful) quite reasonable Thank you again very much. It is appreciated. (the above comment by author - moved by <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a>)</li>
<li>Last so as not to be overkill. Sports Internet Destination! is a strong resource site. It includes HSC Publications which has been around since 1996 and has comprehensive articles and full publications at the top or near the very top of comprehensive information for the entire sports collectibles industry, which is not a small industry. The Wikipedia posts citations mentioned below, those are topics for which Sports Internet Destination! has written detailed, comprehensive articles for those very topics, and the link is I believe appropriately maintained in the External Links section. The posts provide resource value to the Wikipedia community on major companies (and CEO's etc.) and the links are to fully developed articles, appropriately referenced, on those same topics. Hope that helps a little. We'll see how turns out. <i>(Moved yet another top-posted comment by the article's author.)</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Didn't post on top this time! Deleting sports shopping is unnecessary. Not only is sports shopping a significant topic area (the sports area is huge and sports gifts are very popular) but comparison shopping sites are a big thing and mention is made of quite a few choices to serve as a reference for the Wikipedia reader. I understand that people do not want advertising. I am new to this community but the criterion I would use is whether the content serves as a value to the Wikipedia reader, whether it provides useful resource infromation, and that is how our posts are written and do contain. I am not jealous of anyone else's contributions or posts, as long as they provide value to the Wikipedia reader that is all I care about!!!!!! (thanks for letting me vent, constructively). Alex</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Advertising vanity cruft for a non-notable company that appears to not actually sell much of anything. A bunch of eBay affiliate links makes this a superstore? Check this guy's contributions out too - he's sprinkled his site link into the "external links" section of a number of sports-related categories...

<li>I got a chance to look at the website in question and User:Sports Internet Destination's contributions, and it ain't pretty. User insists on adding linkspam to various articles, some tangentially related to sports collectibles. Most of it has already been reverted. The website is simply a list of affiliates and web ads, and I can't even <i>find</i> the publications the author has referred to here. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 03:10, Apr 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi. Even if this page does get deleted (and I hope it doesn't) we're going to continue to work hard in the Wikipedia community. I believe in the concept of community and shared standards, Wikipedia gets 80 million hits per day and has so many dedicated people. HSC, which was incorporated into Sports Internet Destination! has spent 9 years providing the best information available in the sports collectibles industry. We've been dedicated and we've stood the test of time. We need to learn your rules, but please if you agree work with us so that it is valuable for contributors to grow and learn and not just about punishment and deletion. Thanks.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Steiner Sports is one of the largest sports licensing agencies in the country. Just because you are not familiar with them, does not mean they are non-notable. If you have any doubts, spend a few minutes in the industry trade publication Street &amp; Smiths Sports Industry Journal, where the company is mentioned prominently each issue in news bits. In case you are wondering, I have no connection to Steiner Sports. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_9599.html" title="User:Morton devonshire">Morton devonshire</a> 02:03, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
