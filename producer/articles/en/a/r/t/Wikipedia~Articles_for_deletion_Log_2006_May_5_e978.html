<dd>In any event, by now it's pretty obvious that RLJ is not simply an officer in the Indian army, but is a very prominent one. Don't judge me too harshly, though, as some have begun to do, because the article as it was when prodded sounded like terrible vanity, was edited by Jetley himself (!) and did not explain how very distinguished he was.

<li><b>Keep</b>. His work in the Indian Army seems to put him a long way from "nn" territory, at least in my book. The article needs a cleanup, particularly to remove the more fauning and POV language ("he contributed by making an assessment of the effect of Pakistani weapons against ours" is quite revealing), and references are obviously needed. Deletion would be a mistake though, it's still salvageable. I'm not sure how mounting a high velocity gun on a Sherman counts as an "innovation", though. The British did that with the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherman_Firefly_505c.html" title="Sherman Firefly">Sherman Firefly</a> during the war. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeithp_3c9a.html" title="User:Leithp">Leith</a><a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeithp_0f76.html" title="User talk:Leithp"><font color="darkorange">p</font></a> 23:46, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The fact that Jetley got someone to write about him or did so himself does not mean that he did not play the major role in Indian defense research and development that he had.

I have taken it upon myself to do up this article as a matter of Indian military prestige and have done an initial but inadequate rewrite.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whiffenpoofs_fb72.html" title="The Whiffenpoofs">The Whiffenpoofs</a> are certainly notable, but this is a singing group at a private high school. Unless they've been in existence for many, many years, or are otherwise notable (e.g., mainstream media coverage; cd sales) they don't appear to be greatly more notable than a high school club. I don't think a yearly album meets the standards of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and a single "tour" (which sounds more like the trip my high school French class took) is not enough. Having a member who went on to be a Whiffenpoof doesn't sway me; the Whiffenpoofs are a <i>very</i> large group of people who are otherwise mostly non-notable. I could be convinced by media coverage, evidence of cultural notability (the 'poofs were on West Wing, for example), or by other references supporting a claim to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> or more generally to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 02:49, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Roughly on the same level as a high-school student club or team as far as notability goes. I'd hate to set a very dangerous precedent by keeping this due to the very thin Whiffenpoofs connection... if Madonna played in her school marching band, does that make that band notable too? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 03:09, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Student organizations that exist at only a single school are generally non-notable. Although <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whiffenpoofs_fb72.html" title="The Whiffenpoofs">The Whiffenpoofs</a> <i>are</i> notable, citing the fact that a member of this group went on to join the Whiffenpoofs as a claim that this group is notable would be an overly literal mis-application of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The Whiffs must have had hundreds of members in their history and the Whiffs' notability does not carry over to their individual members, much less to other musical groups those members had previously been in. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 07:19, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you are wrong here. The Whiffenpoofs is not a band with a settled line-up, it is a university choral society with a history going back nearly 100 years. It's a bit like saying that every single person who ever performed with the BBC Singers or the Huddersfield Choral Society is inherently notable, and by extension every single musical enterprise in which they subsequently participate is also notable. Another analogy: the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Footlights_136e.html" title="Cambridge Footlights">Cambridge Footlights</a> is notable for certain sure, and many of its former members are notable, but being a former member of the Footlights does <i>not</i> make for notability - look at the list of past members and you get an average of around one or two a year who become famous, which is an incredibly high hit rate for a university club but still way below 100%. How many genuinely famous former Whiffenpoofs are there? The article lists one: Cole Porter. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:20, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> This is a school club. While <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> does say that connection with a notable band is a criterion for inclusion the full text reads: "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; <i>note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</i>" (emphasis added). Furthermore, the connection with a notable band criterion was intended for the former bands of famous musicians rather than high school clubs of people who join a group, which over the years has had hundreds on members. If Ethan Heard had been a member of The Beatles, then it might make sense to simply change this article into a redirect, but in the subject of this article is not even worthy enough for that. Ethan Heard is not even notable enough to have his own page, let alone a page for a club he belonged to in high school. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoIdeaNick_49e4.html" title="User:NoIdeaNick">NoIdeaNick</a> 10:50, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> From what I see, this article must be ruled per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines, and the band does not meet any of the exceptions there. Thus, the article should be deleted. However, a section of the article (or a shortened version of this article) could be included in a notable article that is not going to be deleted. Thus, even if you delete the repertoire and the alumni, the fact that the band is not notable according to Wikipedia still exists, and the article would be deleted (always if people consider, as me, that it is failing <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. What some suggest is that you merge the information from this article in another. Basically, the lead paragraph, plus mention to the notable performances would become a section of the <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidwell_Friends_School_be15.html" title="Sidwell Friends School">Sidwell Friends School</a>, probably named <i>Consensual Sound</i>. There is no need to include past or present repertoire. As for past and current members, I wouldn't include the names or may appear vanity. Note that, while there are only a couple of editors that worked in the Consensual Sound article, there have been well over a dozen in <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidwell_Friends_School_be15.html" title="Sidwell Friends School">Sidwell Friends School</a>. This is my "friendly" solution where the AFD is related to a notable one, but does not hold notability by itself. By putting this information into the notable article, the people who edits that article can decide whether the band (in this case, <i>Consensual Sound</i>) is notable enough to be part of the school article. If the people who usually edit the school believes <i>Consensual Sound</i> isn't notable enough, the information will be deleted (thus disappearing completely from Wikipedia). However, there is a chance that they may consider this information to be important, thus letting at least part of the deleted article be kept in another article. Hope that makes everything clear. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 04:05, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per above. She's not only notable and popular (by some respects), but also the article falls in line with current guidelines. Just because she was the frontman of the now-defunct Barbie's Cradle doesn't mean that her article is not notable.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Besides being a very popular Filipino female artist, she's marrying Senator Gringo Honasan's son thus a newsworthy person that deserves notability. She has been popular since the late 1990s, during the heydays of Hungry Young Poets and Barbie's Cradle. Please give me one good reason why Barbie isn't notable. -<a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJojit_fb_dc95.html" title="User:Jojit fb">Jojit fb</a> 03:12, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Explicitly keep</b>. For the reason that she was one of those who struggled to keep OPM alive during the times of foreign music domination. We must show how noteworthy our artists are. I also propose to make a project about Filipino artists. Also, Barbie Almalbis broke from her group, Barbie's Cradle, so she should have her won article, being that she already has her own carrer apart from the band. If so, it would be tantamount to deleting an article about Bamboo. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustox_dizaola_ab43.html" title="User:Justox dizaola">Justox dizaola</a> 03:36, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It depends how you view it. The subject of the original article - a non-standardised course for a program which already had an article - was unencyclopaedic. The rewritten article, about the (standardised) exam, is encyclopaedic. But to recognise that the article was salvageable by <i>refactoring it to a different, albeit related, subject</i>, did require lateral thinking, and it seems harsh to castigate the nominator for failing to make that leap. Enough people voted delete before the rewrite to indicate that it is certainly not as unambiguous as you make out. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 23:52, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well, it's happening. The expansion of Pokemon-related articles (familiar to many on AfD as a core citation for why we could keep just about anything) is moving to yet lower ground with synopses for various episodes. <b>Delete</b> as yet more Pokemon-cruft.

<li>Why shouldn’t they? If the information exists, they might as well. It’d only be 2 articles.

<li>I think it is comparable; <i>Pokémon</i> is more notable than <i>Head Cases</i> only as a matter of <i>your</i> opinion. Notability is a fairly arbitrary designation.

<ul>
<li>Um, wtf are you talking about? Notability is the <i><b>primary</b></i> criterion( “criteria” is plural) for inclusion or deletion. And <i>Pokémon</i> being more notable is not merely a matter of opinion: We’re talking about a show with hundreds of episodes( as opposed to two for <i>Head Cases</i>), ratings good enough to keep it on the air for what, 8 seasons now? And which, as part of a successful multi-billion dollar franchise, started a huge fad. Most people in numerous countries all over the world have at least heard of <i>Pokémon</i>, and more know it’s a cartoon than realize it started out as a video game. How many people do you think have even heard of <i>Head Cases</i>? I know I hadn’t until this discussion. Whether it’s notable enough to deserve an episode guide or episode articles is debatable, but it would be foolish to continue to pretend it’s not more notable than <i>Head Cases</i>. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidSmaht_d49d.html" title="User:WikidSmaht">WikidSmaht</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidSmaht_41da.html" title="User talk:WikidSmaht">talk</a>) 09:59, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am of the opinion that, for basic, non-controversial information about TV shows (cast, crew, basic plot, airdates, etc), the show itself can be considered to be a source. Even if not, as has already been mentioned there are any number of online episode guides, such as serebii.net. Even if print sources are insisted upon, there are plenty of those, too. Episode information can be found in the now-defunct Pokemon Official Magazine, as well as actual books like Pojo's Unofficial Total Pokemon (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1572436794</a>), Pojo's Unofficial Big Book of Pokemon (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1572433612</a>), and several others. There's also plenty of Pokemon anime coverage in the major anime magazines as well, such as Anime Insider, Animerica, and NewType. Say what you will about the article, but verifiability is not not not not <i>not</i> an issue here. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 02:24, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> FWIW, <i>The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction</i> verifies that basically the article's accurate. It is a pretty dreadful excuse for an article, though, and I'm not sure the credits add up to notability. The only thing that might push him over is collaborating with <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Wilhelm_3f43.html" title="Kate Wilhelm">Kate Wilhelm</a> on a couple of novels. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 02:56, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'd hate to set the bar of notability so low as to include everyone who's had a short story published (hell, I've had a few myself). However, a large number of stories in a multi-decade career suggests notability, and the novels (though written in collaboration) are icing on the cake. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 03:20, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Only the novels were ever sold as such, and overall sales figures were generally pretty low for SF in that era. All the short stories were printed in magazines.

Was originally tagged for speedy deletion, negligently deleted by the author, retagged by me--then I did a Google query and found that his music is sorta, kinda approaching the mainstream--thought it better to AfD. One of his albums, '<i>Miseries Company</i> is listed on Amazon, though the item is not in stock and does not have a sales ranking.

<p>From Aaron Proot:</p>
<p>His album is on CD-Baby, which means it is on iTunes and the other download services. He was also on a UPN reality series earlier this year, whose name escapes me at the moment. While he is not a mainstream artist, he is popular enough to be included on Wikipedia.

<dd>Agreed: it was bad form not to contact him first; however, it had been tagged for speedy deletion previously, and the original author removed the speedy tags. I took this as an indication that the deletion was contested, so I skipped the prod stage as, like you, I had sufficiently concluded for myself that the artist was not notable enough. Plus, this AfD provided a more public forum through which the author could adress my concerns (had he adressed them, I would have withdrawn the AfD). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 17:02, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am the graphic artist/photographer who designed his 2 album covers and created his website (which is down at the moment for some reason). While Wolf may not be a mainstream artist as of yet, he is notable for his popularity in the SF Bay Area, for the artists he has collaborated with, and the UPN show he was on earlier this year. I think Wikipedia sometimes misses out by keeping out up and coming artists and I hope you don't make the same mistake with A-Wolf. Also, as the copyright holder for the photograph and 2 album covers I uploaded yesterday, I approve their appearance on Wikipedia as they are promotional tools for Wolf-- AaronProot 17:41, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Strictly interpreted, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> would prevent Wikipedia from cataloguing anything that hasn't already seeped well into the popular culture. The advantage of wikipedia over a traditional encyclopedia is in the breadth of its content, and the fact that it can give information on subjects like drawball or <a href="../../../w/h/a/Whatpulse.html" title="Whatpulse">Whatpulse</a> before they get a New York Times article, not afterwards. Drawball's become a popular site and a connection between different online communities. The danger of the article is that it will become more about the communities than the site itself, but I believe the issues are ones of managing the content rather than deleting it.--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigCow_5aad.html" title="User:BigCow">BigCow</a> 19:57, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think it should be cleaned-up rather than deleted. It (the attack against Korea, which is probably the main reason it is on here, contrary to misleading promotion that shouldn't take up such a large porportion) was a major internet event that involved many major website participants who all have their own articles on Wikipedia. In addition to the well-known event, groups involved in massive creations on the site (such as ebaumsworld and worth1000) are big enough to have their own article. If not big enough in hits, it is at least a major culmination point of the Internet and significant to internet culture. If this article must be deleted, however, I strongly suggest that the major Korean flag incident remain; as a stub article or as part of another article involving internet issues and culture, etc. --<a href="../../../d/c/h/User%7EDch111_7169.html" title="User:Dch111">Dch111</a> 23:15, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Compared to the other articles nominated for deletion, this has much more valuable content, and is a great reference page for the site's history and information, which exists nowhere else on the web. I second BigCow's argument that Wikipedia provides a plethora of information not available yet through huge media sources. Drawball is becoming (if it hasn't already become) a significant point in internet culture. If it is deleted and soon after receives recognition through a notable source, what then? Is the article revived or rebuilt from scratch? We will have already lost the prior content on the drawball article. Don't delete. If anything, simply clean up and add more objective content. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChigz_bf4d.html" title="User:Chigz">Chigz</a> 10:50, 7 May 2006. (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Not at all, don't worry about it. In discussions like this one, which are more about "consensus" than taking a poll, people are occasionally accused of trying to stuff ballots or bring in outside help to vote on a topic. <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">Sock puppetry</a> is what people call it, and people sometimes list how many edits a user has to suggest a "weight" to their vote or if they just signed up to vote.

<p>This article makes some assertion of notability of finishing sixth in the regional championships, but I checked its website to look at the times the swimmers were doing, and the record holder is about 20-25% slower than the world record in all events. Given that the qualifying limit for olympics and world championships is 5%, this cannot possibly come close to being sportingly notable. Britain won 2 bronze medals at the last Olympics in swimming, and isn't particularly strong, so I don't see why a community club competing in a county league at speeds 25% lower than international standard is notable.<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">ßlηguγΣη</span></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> - <a href="../../../e/r/_/WP%7EER_5c78.html" title="WP:ER">review me</a> 06:11, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A suburban swim club. Despite the claims made in the article, I checked the "club records" section in the website and all of the club records are 10-15% slower than the world record, whereas the qualifying at the Olympics requires around a 5% margin for A-qualifying. There is no indication of them winning British Championships, or any athletes being selected for national teams, and incidentally, Britain managed only 2 bronze medals in the last Olympics and aren't exactly a swimming power.<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">ßlηguγΣη</span></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> - <a href="../../../e/r/_/WP%7EER_5c78.html" title="WP:ER">review me</a> 05:39, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I checked the homepage for this club and their club records are 15% slower than the world record. You need 5% to make to qualifying limit for the Olympics. Also, the fact that the club has 300 people is not paricularly enough for inclusion on grounds of size alone, and training 6 days a week isn't exactly notable either.<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">ßlηguγΣη</span></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> - <a href="../../../e/r/_/WP%7EER_5c78.html" title="WP:ER">review me</a> 05:54, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Definitely not a hoax. I myself haven't known about this 1997 blog comment on the work. I wish I could find the blogger and get to know his sources. He talks about homosexuality and it's effects on society, and brings up Köves and Soultan's work as an example that satirically brings a solution to repopulating the nation. He also mentions that he chose his user name honoring Soultan. I guess, he is a fan too. Yes, indeed, the original spelling is Szultán Alfréd. The griff-licence was printed under that name. As I read it in the press release a few years ago, the movie version will have the English sounding name on it already. I just received an original print of his Dawning Aurora "Derengő Hajnal" which is also in Hungarian. I requested the copy from a Hungarian theatre. I suggest all that voted for deletion check out the facts before destroying my work with the page. I have researched two living Hungarian writers so far. I am doing a third article. I am trying to include people that are overlooked and not appreciated enough.

<li><b>comment</b> It could be made more encyopedia by adding some reference to why the proof is significant and any particaly noteable arguments it has caused (Eg when was this first deabted on usernet or something).<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 15:09, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki and delete, then expand other articles</b>. Our coverage of this issue is upside-down. The "Generalizations" section contains the truly important fact (used in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument.html" title="Cantor's diagonal argument">Cantor's diagonal argument</a> among other things). We should cover the fact that some real numbers have two decimal representations, and that all real numbers have exactly one infinite decimal representation that does not end in repeating 0 digits - and that this is true for all bases, not just base 10. (we already cover this to some degree in <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal_representation.html" title="Decimal representation">Decimal representation</a>) I wouldn't be opposed to an article proving the more general statement. However, the specific example in this article, that in base 10, the number 1.000... can also be represented as 0.999..., is not encyclopedic. This is indeed a good article which should be kept on another Wikimedia project, but not here. We have an article on <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_division.html" title="Long division">Long division</a>, not on 192 divided by 4 equals 48. Same principle applies here. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowersofnight_dd24.html" title="User:Flowersofnight">flowersofnight</a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFlowersofnight_468d.html" title="User talk:Flowersofnight">(talk)</a> 15:39, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Just because someone may be unaware of its existence doesn't make it a scam. The internet is free, and can be used to verfify all informations. The author has produced and article based on public information. There is no statement of opionion in this piece of writing. Instead of pointing out what should be cleaned out, you simple mark it for deletion. Below are few links talking about the institution. <b>the International Relations Institute of Cameroon (IRIC)exists</b>.</p>

<p>You could have offered some help instead. What is wrong with the phone number being listed on a related website? Just because western institutions have websites don't make those that don't have one unserious. Besides, you might want to check and see what the HEI is. If the HEI website bothers you, if can be taken off the list. where have you seen 50 links?</p>

<p>50 links: it is a joke (i do not assume 50 links are required). All i asked for was verification (because many, many people using wikipedia for commercial advertising).

<p>Not sure how I reply to this (have tried to read but can't find info! Apologies if it's wrong.</p>
<p>This is my first wiki, so I'm a little confused as to why you think that this being the only article I currently have linked to is a big surprise. I have removed the 2nd external link, though that was there as the point of entry for the shoe golf championship, as it seems that offended you. Please, if you can find any other info on shoe golf, other than the shoegolfassociation please link to it. I am literally just trying to publish a wiki on a game I love playing with my friends, and have linked to it from golf (as it's a variation) and also from street games...as it is one! If you watch my editing highlights over the next week or so you'll see that I'm a sensible person, and that my intention isn't to spam, nor to spoil a great resource...merely to add to it.</p>
<p>On a truthful note, yes I have done work for Ochosports, but as I said, they're one of the places I can find info about shoe golf, so the link IS relevant imho.</p>

<dd>Thanks Mwanner - I've tried to include some relevant links from decent sources that I can find, and I see your point about new stuff and encyclopedias, but shoe golf isn't "new" it's just that (in the UK at least) it's just getting big. Globally it's been around ages...perhaps not in Florida though! -- User:chris_white_22 | 14:35, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>(edit conflict)<b>Comment</b> Yes, for example the book that's mentioned in the Amazon link. If it more than just mentions Shoe Golf, meaning if there is good information in the article that came from that book, then you would need to cite it and that might be good enough. There is a way to cite books by their ISBN, I don't know how to do it myself though. Citing the book itself rather than a link to it through Amazon would definitely help as long as information from that book was used in the article. On the other hand, while the myspace link could definitely go in the external links section, myspace is far from a reliable source. Hope that helps. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKoG_0143.html" title="User:TheKoG">TheKoG</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKoG_b161.html" title="User talk:TheKoG">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheKoG_e45e.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheKoG">contribs</a>) 14:37, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hang on, not much in terms of feelings in regard to shoegolf but I take exception at what some of you are trying to do. When did you personally decide on what an encyclopedia is or is not for! This is arrogance at a huge scale.</p>
<p>"Definition encyclopedia" a book or set of books containing many articles arranged in alphabetical order which deal either with the whole of human knowledge or with a particular part of it: The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language"</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>encyclopedia, compendium of knowledge, either general (attempting to cover all fields) or specialized (aiming to be comprehensive in a particular field).</p>
<p>If someone is trying to use this resource to add credibility to a specific sport this is helping everyone and making this place a centre of knowledge not just a place where people with way too much arrogance define the word encyclopedia. Points regarding commeriality are obviously valid however it you were to look at almost any sport they start out with a couple of clever companies seeing that they can attach there name to something new, kind of like hoover attached its name to the vacuum cleaner. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Skelligs (<a href="../../../s/k/e/User_talk%7ESkelligs_811b.html" title="User talk:Skelligs">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Skelligs_d547.html" title="Special:Contributions/Skelligs">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Richard - I prefer odd, rather than idotic! Normal golf is idiotic...all that time chasing after a little ball. Why not make it biger, courses could be smaller, and less time spent looking for the ball! In many ways I would argue that Shoe Golf is notable purely for it's lack of a great knowledge base, it's a lot like, many other games that have become popular without anything really being written down. Take a look at the wiki's on Extreme Croquet for example - that page lists (externally) 20 clubs in the world who alledgedly play, yet that has been deemed more notable than shoe golf? Parce que?</li>
</ul>
<p>On the show golf mention in the book the wiki links to (well, the amazon details of it), in the front matter the author describes that he was an avid shoe golfer before he cared for teh real thing, and also describes the rules to shoe golf around page 60 (and those of frisbee golf too). I will grab the ISBN number, and see if I can find out how to cite a book properly! User:Chris_white_22 07:51, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This team - and in fact the league - was produced entirely through the efforts of UK-based baseball fans who, with the nearest available softball teams established in Bristol, decided to set up their own self-funded self-promoted self-run softball league.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Instances of sport in Britain are mainly based around the core elite of popular sports - football (thats soccer to Americans), rugby, tennis, cricket, golf and snooker. Walk into any sports shop in the UK and you are hard pressed to avoid racks full of football shirts, golf clubs and cricket bats. Recognition for minority sports is scarce - even the nations broadcaster, the BBC, only features them sporadically in small segments on Sunday afternoons and during large sporting events.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Popularity of baseball and softball may be small but it is sizable as evidenced by the efforts of BaseballSoftballUK to reinstate baseball and softball into the 2012 London Olympics. Any online resource - such as Wikipedia which is well known and respected - should be able to encompass one minor article detailing the efforts made by a group - no matter how small - to publicise minority sports.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Softball is different to many sports in that it is mixed-gender. Due to the segregation imposed by many sporting bodies - including the one where male and female footballers/soccer players are segregated by age regardless of ability - it is hard to find any other sport where gender is presented as an irrelevancy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Encylcopedias are not just collections of information, they are charters of history. Previous incarnations of the CSA have failed due to lack of publicity and interest. If this one succeeds then Wikipedia will have had an article detailing it from its inception.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I hope my argument is valid. I would not want to violate any rules intentionally. I believe this article should remain. At present it is a stub, to be expanded upon when more details, profiles, results and other miscellanea are readily available.

<dd>Mm, I'd probably say a half dozen outside various OSS projects. Typically my programming friends work on sourceforge-based OSS projects. I'm afraid I tend to shy away from "big company" (IBM, Microsoft) projects on there (Yes, MS has stuff on sf) so that could be a reason I don't run into the term. My personal programming experience and number of programmers I know is, in this case, somewhat irrelevant to the primary problem of this article, in that it appears (to me) to be more a dictdef than encyclopedic content, and should be deleted and transferred to Wiktionary so they can debate its merits.

<dd>I disagree. This is, imho, <i>constructive discrimination</i> to remove a term which as far as I can tell:
<ol>
<li>Is not a widely used industry term. It is minority at best.</li>
<li>Is written as a dictionary definiton, not an encyclopedic article (thus should be transwiki'd).</li>
<li>Is understood and not disliked. I doubt it'd be difficult to contact more programmer wikipedians and get expert opinions on the article if you'd like, though it's still dicdef.</li>
<li>As far as your not mentioning censorship, I'm afraid I have to disagree on this point also. Please look up at the <i>only</i> Weak Keep vote (or only Keep vote at all for that matter) where you mention censorship in that line.</li>
<li>The article does not cite any sources which refer to it in the manner that it was written. The original citation seemed to be a misunderstanding of the term as used, and the matrix that you note above is not anywhere near the same concept.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I'm rather curious as to why you're fighting so hard to keep a dictionary definition in the encyclopedia? Akidd, you're still the only one with a keep vote on the matter and these back-and-forth comments seem to be what's holding up the process. If possible, please reply on my talk page. I'm not sure it's really appropriate to continue debating the same points in this space.&#160;:) <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 17:42, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I apologize for not knowing proper wikipedia etiquette. Yes, I became active today but that should not make my point invalid. This isn't a "who has been here longer" discussion. It is not my plan to go around checking wikipedia for inaccuracies, but I will discuss the things I know about and this is a subject that I do know. Paul had several solo albums and one of his own became gold not including records of the King's Singers. If you do a search for his name (-tekken, of course), you will find many, many pages on him including ones that discuss his fame as a child. Most sites would not phrase it "Paul Phoenix, solo album" so it would be worthless to search in such a manner. I appreciate your love of all things "notable" and would agree with you if the person in question was not a successful individual, but it seems silly to pick on such an accomplished human being. <font color="blue">KSfan</font> 5 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Note</b>: Here is a link from www.treble.info which took me about a minute to find. There are plenty of other sources for this same kind of information. "Paul Phoenix became a member of St Pauls Cathedral Choir when he was nine. He was chosen to sing the treble solo for the theme tune to the TV series 'Tinker, tailor, Soldier, Spy' which was released as a single and became a No 1 hit in 1980. This resulted in other singles such as 'My way', a full album called 'Rejoice' and a couple of EPs where he is the soloist with The St Pauls Cathedral Boys Choir. His songs are available on the CD re-release 'Jubilate! Golden Favourites From St. Paul's Cathedral' Guild GRCD 7024"</li>
<li>And here is more from a website about the progressive rock band, Janus. 'Orr started a new Janus, involving several young, very talented, musicians, including Dave Harrold an Irish bass guitarist, Doug Boyes on Cello, and Paul Phoenix a phenomenal classical vocalist, graduate of the Royal Northern College, and somebody who had <b>had a worldwide number 1 at the age of 11</b>, as the lead in the St. Pauls Cathedral Choir, with the theme to a BBC TV show, "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy".'
<ul>
<li>I understand that the song was a hit, but the hit was with the choir - I was saying that he as an individual does not merit his own article, and still believe that. The fact that his albums are clearly not longer widely available must say something about his notability... <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7ECondem_139c.html" title="User:Condem"><font color="blue">ConDem</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7ECondem_4705.html" title="User talk:Condem"><font color="red">Talk</font></a></sup> 01:18, 6 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not saying that he is the biggest superstar to ever hit the world. There are many artists and authors within the pages of Wikipedia whom I have never heard, but I am sure that within their specific fields, they are well-known. Just because you don't know of Paul or the fame he had as a boy chorister and now as a member of The King's Singers, doesn't mean that he doesn't deserve his own page. To people in his field and to fans of this type of music, he is well-known. And by the way, the hit was his solo. He sang lead on several of those albums. He wasn't just a member of the choir. <font color="blue">KSfan</font> 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Anyway, I checked the digital archive of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> (-1985) for something on his boyhood "career" and found a couple of items: Phoenix was a guest, presented as the "boy soprano who sang the Nunc Dimitis over the closing titles of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy", along with flautist <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Galway_d89d.html" title="James Galway">James Galway</a> and writer <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurie_Lee_cba8.html" title="Laurie Lee">Laurie Lee</a> on <i><a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Parkinson_dbbe.html" title="Michael Parkinson">Parkinson</a></i> on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC1_7dd0.html" title="BBC1">BBC1</a> on Nov. 24, 1979.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and on <i><a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Parkinson_dbbe.html" title="Michael Parkinson">Parkinson at Christmas</a></i> again in the same channel on Christmas Day later that year.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> A later article in <i>The Times</i>, from 1985, and on a different boy singer, Aled Jones, who received a silver disc "for the surprise hit of the year" (on the BBC recording <i>Voices from the Holy Land</i>), mentions that "There has of course been boy treble in the pop charts before -- most recently Paul Miles-Kingston and six years ago Paul Phoenix, with <i><a href="../../../n/u/n/Nunc_Dimittis_7324.html" title="Nunc Dimittis">Nunc Dimittis</a></i>."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Apparently he charted, and was notable enough as a boy soloist to be invited on a popular show a couple of times, and still recalled by a journalist six years later. Along with his later career in a popular group, I suppose that may push him over the threshold. (Can we get his chart position confirmed from some other source? <i>The Times</i> is perhaps not the best source for what happened on the British pop charts in 1979.) --<a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 03:53, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are clear inaccuracies in ConDem's entries above, and his reasoning smacks merely of some kind of personal vendetta (he probably came across Paul Phoenix whilst a pupil at Westminster Under School, a school where I know Paul Phoenix taught) which, in my view, is no reason to delete the entry for someone who is a popular figure within the vocal music world.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The inaccuracies I mentioned relate to Mr Phoenix's solo career - anyone who has heard or referred to the score of the "Tinker Tailor..." theme will know that it is for solo treble, with no choir parts anywhere to be seen. His career as a treble was solely based on his own talent and personality, which paved the way for the later fame of Aled Jones and Anthony Way as boy trebles.</dd>
<dd>Anyone who is seeking to know more about treble singing and early successful trebles, as well as the personalities within the King's Singers - the world's first "close harmony" group (they invented the term) and still the best, most highly sought-after and longest-surviving male voice ensemble ever to exist, will find entries both on the group in general AND on individuals within that group informative, interesting and revealing. Simply taking it upon yourself to attempt deletion of anyone who you deem "unworthy" despite clear evidence to the contrary is, I would say, a little disappointing. Apart from anything else, the educational benefit of these entries to the countless students in the UK and USA in particular who study King's Singers material (they publish most of their arrangements and sell tens of thousands of scores each year) and wish to find out more about the group, is extremely worthy.</dd>
<dd>Before it is mentioned, I also am a new editing member of Wikipedia, but the fact that I use it frequently and wanted informaton on the King's Singers and their members today, shows that this information is appreciated by those of us with slightly fewer chips on their shoulder. I haven't found the need to comment before, but in this instance it seems important. --82.68.78.198 18:56, 6 May 2006 (UTC)Montiolivetti

If this reasonabley objective information stays on Wikipedia we can go "Hey racists look it was all faked, you can't act like that in public." There is a value in having objective information about the Amazing Racist and the actor. This isn't just hatemongering.

<li><b>comment</b> - why even list the professor test? It is like you're just listing out policies which aren't applicable. Also I agree the article needs a POV cleanup. Its defense of the videos is totally POV. Google metrics are bogus are not worth even arguing over, but the original poster misrepresents the results of the google search. Also I don't think referring to the previous process is really fair or accurate. If you read that AfD it is just wikipedia policy quoting, there was no real discussion and it is possible people didn't even know that article existed. So the only people voting might be those who hover around the delete page. Essentially I've shown this person to be reasonably notable and shown many of the metrics used to claim his article should be deleted to be inaccurate, misreprsented or bogus. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollHistorian_f3a9.html" title="User:TrollHistorian">TrollHistorian</a> 13:58, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete! Keep!</b>. How can a team has played teams from southern California to Rhode Island and Canada not be notable? The Claremont Braineaters is a club team that might not be varsity in the sense of the word as it applies to Duke Blue Devils basketball, but the Claremont Braineaters has members from all colleges and succeeds more than any varsity program. The fact that the Claremont Braineaters is a Division III school and still placed 26th amongst so many Divison I schools is notable. To delete this article would be to say to all Wikipedians that because a few people may not understand or have even heard of ultimate Frisbee that an article cannot exist, that's wrong. What if someone from Australia or Eritrea had never heard of hockey, should that mean that the Montréal Canadiens' article should be deleted? Maybe the UPA does not have enough money to start a ridiculous professional league where people play for the money. Ultimate Frisbee is pure love of the game, and the Claremont Braineaters embody that. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">Dan37205</a> 4:10 AM EST, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is also extensive coverage of ultimate Frisbee with the <a href="http://www.UltiVillage.com" class="external free" title="http://www.UltiVillage.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.UltiVillage.com</a> crew who produce films about special club and college tournaments and posts daily clips from tournaments around the country. It's true, college basketball and Duke are especially popular, and a lot of people do watch it, but that is mostly because of basketball being around for over 100 years and it catching on. Ultimate Frisbee was not truly developed into leagues until the late 1970s and early 1980s, especially for college ultiamte Frisbee. Also, the Braineaters are notable to thousands of people. A film that was made called "I Bleed Orange" which can be seen at <a href="http://www.Ibleedorange.com" class="external free" title="http://www.Ibleedorange.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Ibleedorange.com</a> was a mockumentary of the team with the most Nationals wins, the Santa Barbara Black Tide who made a film called "I Bleed Black" the trailer for which can be seen at <a href="http://www.Ibleedblack.com" class="external free" title="http://www.Ibleedblack.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Ibleedblack.com</a>, and that "I Bleed Orange" has been seen by ultimate players in Israel to Hawaii to the States, Europe, you name it, which would suggest that Ultimate is also popular in other countries. Not surprisingly countries such as Australia, Finland (where the 2006 World Tournament was held), the UK, Germany (where a world-famous offensive formation was created), Japan, South Korea, Canada, Venezuela, Spain, Italy (home of Paganello, the largest beach ultimate tournament in the world with over 100 teams) to name a few all have large ultimate and Beach Ultimate progams and communities. Ultimate Frisbee is to me therefore notable, just not televised and consumed by the mainstream television watchers, and thank all that is good for that, who have ready access to such programming as the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Blue_Devils_d7b9.html" title="Duke Blue Devils">Duke Blue Devils</a>, which according to their article also includes their tennis team, track and field, golf, women's rowing (no men's crew? tsk tsk, not like Claremont Stags, Athenas, or Sagehens have one either), not just their very popular basketball team. For that is the basketball team not guilty by association? The Claremont Braineaters are known by many and their players and alumni are known around the the States and the world, mostly in the past for their antics, but recently also for hard play all over the frisbee world, to me says that they are notable. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">Dan37205</a> 7:45 PM PST, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This substub article isn't about the film <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> refers to, but there's at least an <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0455362/" class="external text" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt0455362/" rel="nofollow">IMDb entry</a>. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">crystal ball</a> criterion isn't exactly clear though; it says "All articles about anticipated events must be verifiable" (the IMDb verifies it) but also says "and the subject matter must be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article if the event had already occurred", which is perhaps debatable here. I say <b>weak keep</b> and expand per the IMDb entry. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 22:11, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The IMDB article says it's a 2006 film, but the entry hasn't been update since June, 2005. If production had taken place and a release was planned, wouldn't there be some update there? IMDB has a bad record on reporting projected movies that never happen. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 01:41, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Even if there is an IMDb article, the only thing given is five actors and a sentence of the plot. I don't think that would make much of an article. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasma_Twa_2_6409.html" title="User:Plasma Twa 2">Plasma Twa 2</a> 03:19, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
