<p>A short article named <b>N'Ko</b> was needlessly split into <b>N'Ko script</b> and <b>N'Ko language</b>. I disputed this, and attempted to revert to a single article. An edit war ensued, unfortunately, resulting also in the moving of <b>N'Ko script</b> to <b>N'Ko alphabet</b> by the splitter. I proposed on the <a href="../../../n/27/k/Talk%7EN%27Ko_43e0.html" title="Talk:N'Ko">Talk:N'Ko</a> page that the article should only be split if there were consensus from other editors that it be split. The splitter has ignored this, and it's been getting unpleasant. There is no reason that the single <b>N'Ko</b> article can't deal effectively with both script and language issues (at least until it gets much longer than it is) and therefore <b>I request that <i>N'Ko alphabet</i> be deleted (or made into a redirect) and what unique content it contains be merged into <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_6236.html" title="N'Ko">N'Ko</a> -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 18:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> is the splitter mentioned in the nomination. The N'Ko script can be used to transcribe other languages. I have a document in French and N'Ko in N'Ko script. This does not mean that French (or any other language) is conventionally written in N'Ko script. The N'Ko language is a literary language which is <i>only</i> written in N'Ko. There is -- honestly -- <i>no need</i> to have the language described on a page of its own.

<li><b>Comment</b> If Mr Conradi were a reasonable editor, that might be possible. It is not. There was one article, <b>N'Ko</b>, which he has split. In point of fact, he is now continuing to edit <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_alphabet_3920.html" title="N'Ko alphabet">N'Ko alphabet</a> and <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_language_0a90.html" title="N'Ko language">N'Ko language</a> while we have this dispute. This seems to me to be bad faith. All that is happening is a whole lot of confusion is being added to the Wikipedia. <i>I was advised by one Administrator to propse a VfD to <b>merge</b> the articles all back into <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_6236.html" title="N'Ko">N'Ko</a>.</i> Please be specific about how we can resolve this. All I see is Mr Conradi acting as though he can do whatever he likes. -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 15:54, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>False claims again and again. Evertype can't you stop it? Can't you add content to the language article like I do add content? I am editing the language article because the N'Ko articles is protected. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 04:05, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You split the article. I dispute that the article should be split. I have now also given the following at <a href="../../../n/27/k/Talk%7EN%27Ko_43e0.html" title="Talk:N'Ko">Talk:N'Ko</a>: It is not acceptable to me to have the two articles split. Mr Conradi endeavours to force a taxonomy for all language and script articles on the Wikipedia. But he does NOT know anything about N'Ko. The literary dialect which now has the ISO 639 script code "nqo" is <i>only ever written in N'Ko script</i>. Indeed, because of the nature of the N'Ko script and the way it informs the literary dialect, it is impossible to see how the literary dialect could be written in the Latin or Arabic scripts, because it is <i>intimately tied</i> to the writing conventions of the N'Ko script. I have tried to explain this elsewhere, but instead of <i>discussing</i> with other editors and <i>agreeing in consensus</i>, Mr Conradi has ploughed on ahead, splitting and adding more material to the split articles, oblivious to the fact that he is doing is counter to the <i>facts</i> of the sociolinguistic situation for N'Ko. It makes <i>no sense at all</i> to have <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_alphabet_3920.html" title="N'Ko alphabet">N'Ko alphabet</a> separate from <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_language_0a90.html" title="N'Ko language">N'Ko language</a>, and that split in fact makes it more difficult to write an article which <i>correctly and usefully</i> addresses the facts. A single article, <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_6236.html" title="N'Ko">N'Ko</a>, is all that is needed here. I (who have worked with the N'Ko user community for several years) cannot edit Mr Conradi's split articles. I cannot improve them. They make no sense while split. The split is <i>only</i> wanted by Mr Conradi. Not by anyone else. He split the articles without consultation or consensus. There is sustained opposition to the split; he has not convinced me with his "justification" that "all language and script articles should be split". It makes sense for many of them to be split. It makes no sense for N'Ko to be split. N'Ko is a special case. We (the Wikipedia community interested in Writing Systems) should not <i>want</i> Mr Conradi to "get the numbers to 100%". He wishes to do this for its own sake, not because it makes sense to treat N'Ko this way. <b>I ask you, Mr Conradi, can you <i>possibly</i> agree that in this case your desire for tidiness is incorrect and unhelpful, and that you should <i>listen</i> to someone with expertise in the script in question, and agree to allow us to revert to a single article <a href="../../../n/27/k/N%27Ko_6236.html" title="N'Ko">N'Ko</a> which can then be improved and expanded usefully?</b> I ask this courteously, despite the fact that your willfulness and your apparent pleasure in doing whatever you please with the Wikipedia is extremely exasperating. Ikiroid, that is the best I can do. -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 09:36, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
