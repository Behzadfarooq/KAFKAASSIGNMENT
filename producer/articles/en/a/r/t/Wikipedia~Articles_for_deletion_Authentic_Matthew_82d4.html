<p>The previous VFD on this article was effectively sabotaged multiple (in some cases self-admitted) sockpuppetry, and was closed as "inconclusive" - i.e. it was not possible for the closing admin to determine what the votes actually were (as opposed to "no consensus").</p>

<p>This article is basically original research.</p>
<ul>
<li>It relies on assuming that <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome.html" title="Jerome">Jerome</a>'s statement about a "Gospel of the Hebrews" was accurate</li>
<li>It is an almost universal opinion amongst academics and non-academics that Jerome's statement was an (innocent) error caused by lack of information, and that the "Gospel of the Hebrews" that he refers to were in fact 3 seperate texts -
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Hebrews_2456.html" title="Gospel of the Hebrews">Gospel of the Hebrews</a></li>
<li>The <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Nazarenes_878c.html" title="Gospel of the Nazarenes">Gospel of the Nazarenes</a></li>
<li>The <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Ebionites_858f.html" title="Gospel of the Ebionites">Gospel of the Ebionites</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It contains an <b>opinion</b> of why people might have wanted the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> to exist</li>
<li>It presents an extremely POV view of the origin of the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a>, which is totally inconsistent with either the conservative religious view of their origin, or the critical academic view involving
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/r/Markan_priority.html" title="Markan priority">Markan priority</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../q/_/d/Q_document.html" title="Q document">Q document</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_source_hypothesis.html" title="Two source hypothesis">Two source hypothesis</a></li>
<li>The relevant section on the origin of matthew at <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It bases all of this on a totally non-sequitur argument that as Eusebius said that "matthew wrote in hebrew letters", there is an entirely different gospel for the hebrews which is not dependant on Mark, and forms the basis of Matthew, and that this must therefore mean that the above 3 gospels (Hebrews/Nazarenes/Ebionites) are in fact 1 gospel not 3 despite the near unanimous opinion amongst academics and non academics to the contrary.</li>
<li>The origin of the Gospel of Matthew should be, and is already, discussed at <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a></li>
<li>None of the references actually support the argument of the text but instead either adhere to the standard critical academic view, or propose an entirely different argument altogether.</li>
<li>The article is even written as an essay/thesis, with introduction and conclusion.</li>
<li>The author of the article added detail to all articles relating to this area of the bible supporting the POV of the article. The only people setting up links to the article or even mentions of its thesis are <a href="../../../2/0/2/User%7E202.176.97.230.html" title="User:202.176.97.230">202.176.97.230</a> and the article's author themselves, and they may very well be one and the same.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The earlier version of the article had extensive duplication of source texts which are already on Wikisource - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;oldid=18807366" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;oldid=18807366" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> - when this was removed, it was restored by editors with very few edits indeed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The author of the article has gone to extensive lengths, including RFAR (failed), to preserve it, and there have been many sockpuppets (many of which were admitted to be so - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FAuthentic_Matthew&amp;diff=19342484&amp;oldid=19340805" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FAuthentic_Matthew&amp;diff=19342484&amp;oldid=19340805" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The article has been reviewed by an editor (not me) who has a doctorate (PhD) in the study of the New Testament, and been said to be unsalvagable original research by that editor.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Even the article's title is POV</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. No case has been made for the "original research" claim; this VfD seems to me to have more to do with -Ril-'s feud with the writers of the article than anything else.

<li>Delete: The amount of tinfoil hattery around the early Gospels is extreme. This article ignores everything from Higher Criticism on to weave together a wishlist view, arguably to support a further POV (not in the article but which the article will be used to support) for one heretical view or another. Honestly, these schemes and arguments are thick as flies in history. There can be no merge, as that requires equally merging in <i>all other</i> variant readings of the origins of the Gospel and non-Q sources, and we would indeed run out of not-paper doing so. There is no keep, because there is no support for this view that makes it representative enough to need explication, and it obviously isn't just "true" or "accepted as true" by the wider community. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:52, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, for reasons given.

<li><b>Extremely strong delete</b> – I have researched and taught New Testament, and I’ve never even heard of ‘Authentic Matthew’. This article takes all sorts of (disputed) asides from the Church Fathers, adds them to several unrelated scholarly theories about synoptic origins – to produce what is a piece of (bad) original research. It is about as factual as the Da Vinci Code! Any (notable} proto-Matthean theories should be discussed under <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> or <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_problem.html" title="Synoptic problem">Synoptic problem</a>.

<li><b>DELETE</b>. The argument that it is cited does not justify its validity, as even original research must be cited for publication.

<p>If I were allowed to vote, I would vote <b>keep</b> because, if the Gospel is true, then who wrote it is a separate issue from its existence, and if it is not true, then no amount of writing about it will ever make it true.

<li>Simon, the argument here is not whether this theory is correct, or even possible. It is whether this is a position being argued by any notable scholar, in a way that WP can record. It is not (although individual bits of it may be) - and thus it is original research. Even if the thesis was factually correct - it still would have no place here. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 21:54, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
