So if his goal was to improve his contribs list... he didn't do a very good job of it. Seems more likely he got his plug in then wanted nothing more to do with our project. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 02:38, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I take an unpopular view on these things - a CD sold only on tour dates has equivalent status to a t-shirt or tour programme rather than the status of an ordinary CD release.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Like a t-shirt, yes, but the arguments for keep have been begging the question.

<li>Well, although there is dispute, the position at present is that if an artist is notable, their albums are notable but, even if this was a full length disc, it is still effectively tour merchandise because of the way in which it has been sold regardless of the numbers involved. A live album released commercially as a document of a tour is a different barrel of onions. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 13:59, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>i still don't see why limited edition stuff shouldn't be included. what if it was from a small cd-r label? this isn't really a live release by the way. <a href="../../../n/y/a/Nyago.html" title="Nyago">nyago</a>
<ul>
<li>I'm aware that it isn't a live release but it appears only to have been sold at live shows. If a small CDR label was to issue something by a notable artist (an increasingly common event), and it was sold commercially throught the usual channels, I would be inclined in principle to support it, although the low numbers associated with CDR labels would put me off. But this is really just a tour souvenier rather than a proper release. Obviously it could be added to a discography or some such but I can't support an entry of its own. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 17:21, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>i wouldn't really consider this to be "just some souvenier", though. i think it's more than that. would it make any difference if it had a more interesting title? i think that if an artist is notable enough, it should be included. it shouldn't matter what their albums are called or how many copies it may or may not have, as long it's somewhat useful for someone. <a href="../../../n/y/a/User%7ENyago_7b03.html" title="User:Nyago">Nyago</a> 14:39, 01 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A photographer and creator of digital art whose only specified claim to notability is having taken and been credited for "all the pictures for a Japanese-language gardening book of plants cultivated in Japan, published by Shobunsha, Tokyo, 1975". If this is 晶文社, it's a prestigious publisher; but a search in the online catalogues of the Japanese national library and the Tokyo central library for books by "Brago" (or either of its likeliest <i>katakana</i> forms, ブラゴ or ブラーゴ), which I infer was her surname at the time, shows nothing. Googling for this person brings up a lot of stuff, but all of it seems to be either (a) Wikipedia or its commercial scrapes or (b) written by her or promotional or both. Thus what is written here is <b>not verifiable</b>. In addition, I see no evidence that she comes anywhere near satisfying the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">"notability" requirements for a photographer</a>, viz <i>Published ... photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work</i>; this of course is not damning in itself but I also see no alternative factor here for notability.

<p>This nomination also includes the related article <b>NPA personality theory</b>.</p>
<p>I am a scientist by profession, and while psychology is not my field of study, I do have experience in identifying pseudoscience and self-promotion. I am suspicious that the articles on Anthony M. Benis and NPA personality theory (a personality theory invented by Anthony M. Benis) do not meet Wikipedia's notability requirements, and may also be vanity articles to some degree. I believe these articles have been cleverly crafted to make their subjects appear notable when in reality they are not. My reasons are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Both articles have been extensively edited by <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EABenis_c150.html" title="User:ABenis">ABenis</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../a/b/e/User_talk%7EABenis_d3dc.html" title="User talk:ABenis">talk</a><span style="white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold;">&#160;·</span>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ABenis_bd6f.html" title="Special:Contributions/ABenis">contribs</a>), whom I presume to be Anthony M. Benis himself. In the case of NPA personality theory, <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EABenis_c150.html" title="User:ABenis">User:ABenis</a> made the vast majority of edits.</li>
<li>The Anthony M. Benis article is extremely long, yet nothing in it shows why he is any more notable than other researchers in his field except the single paragraph mentoning his work with NPA personality theory. The awards he is listed as receiving are not major awards in terms of Wikipedia notability; for example, there is not and probably never will be an article for the AICE Regional Award or a Category:AICE Regional Award recipients. Contrary to what the article claims, there is also nothing particularly notable about his being a member of <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigma_Xi_0c05.html" title="Sigma Xi">Sigma Xi</a>, which has 62 000 members and is open (by invitation) to anyone who demonstrates mere "aptitude" for research. At any rate, none of these awards appear to be for his development of NPA personality theory.</li>
<li>NPA personality theory is not widely known in psychology. As far as I can tell, there is only a single unique publication about NPA theory: <i>Toward Self and Sanity</i> by Anthony M. Benis, a book published in 1985 and now long out-of-print. The text was republished in a little-known speculative science journal in 1990. That journal is not a psychology journal, and tends to publish speculative articles on fringe science topics such as <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warp_drive.html" title="Warp drive">warp drive</a>.</li>
<li>NPA personality theory is not widely known in general. I performed a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%22npa+personality%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%22npa+personality%22" rel="nofollow">Google search for "NPA personality"</a> and the first hundred or so results are almost all Wikipedia mirrors, link directories, or sites operated by Benis himself. Searches on online bookseller sites yield no books on the NPA personality theory. (Compare this with over 30 results for "Rorschach" and thousands for "Myers-Briggs".)</li>
<li>Benis himself heavily promotes the NPA Wikipedia article on his websites, as if it lends credibility to the theory. If his theory were credible or notable, he would have also or instead listed references to scientific journals, popular science articles, and established print encyclopedias. I believe he promotes the Wikipedia article because it's (a) practically the only in-depth discussion of NPA to be found on the Internet but not on one of his own websites, and (b) largely authored, or at least partially controllable, by him.</li>
<li>To my understanding, the NPA personality theory is pseudoscience and quackery. While that alone doesn't necessarily disqualify it from being on Wikipedia (after all, we have articles on <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phrenology.html" title="Phrenology">phrenology</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">intelligent design</a>), it should be a factor we consider when deciding Benis and the other authors' motivation for including these articles on Wikipedia.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm willing to admit that I'm wrong about these points; the best evidence to establish notability would be if someone could find a citation index which proves that Benis's work is widely cited in the scientific literature. However, given that his only book on the topic is long out-of-print, and that there doesn't appear to be any other research psychologists writing about NPA, I suspect that no such evidence will be forthcoming. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 03:27, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This looks to me like a surprisingly successful spam/astroturfing campaign. I doubt you'll get NPA personality theory deleted, as it is - amazingly - currently listed as a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_Article_5315.html" title="Wikipedia:Good Article">Good Article</a>. However, it clearly should be delisted, as it is a pile of pseudoscientific nonsense and the article provides no indication of its lack of scientific acceptance, or any critical commentary whatsoever. Overall, I'd say <b>delete</b> Benis, <b>keep</b> NPA but give it a good trim and add some external criticism. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 05:19, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> the sole publication supporting the theory seems to be Benis, Anthony M. and Jacob H. Rand (1986). "A model of human personality [<i>or "human personality traits" according to <a href="http://primate_behaviour.homestead.com/" class="external text" title="http://primate_behaviour.homestead.com/" rel="nofollow">this</a></i>] based on Mendelian genetics" (abstract). Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Publication 86-5, 124. A search in Google for <span style="color:#000; background-color:#dfd; padding 0 10px">benis rand "human personality based" "mendelian genetics"</span> gets just two hits, for en:WP and fr:WP; one for <span style="color:#000; background-color:#dfd; padding 0 10px">benis rand "human personality traits based" "mendelian genetics"</span> gets none. I therefore infer that this model of personality sank without trace, other than in the eyes of its proponents. Incidentally, <a href="http://primate_behaviour.homestead.com/" class="external text" title="http://primate_behaviour.homestead.com/" rel="nofollow">a site about this</a> captions a photo of a gorilla baring its teeth as "smiling", a claim that is debatable, and offers a list of "NPA Sites" among which is the en:WP article. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:32, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Additional Comment</b> Also, it's no wonder NPA is a featured article; of course the person who invented the theory can make a good, highly detailed article like the NPA one.

<li><b>Additional comment on NPA</b> Take a look in the discussion page of the NPA article. It's extraordinary. Here's just one comment, slightly abridged and with emphases added: <i><b>The article NPA personality theory adds honor to the Wikipedia.</b> .... / The nature of this subject is speculative, almost akin to subatomic particles, we can only approximate and see to it that all the observed facts of the subject are consistent with the theory. As such, <b>the NPA theory is analogous to Darwin's Theory of Evolution</b> in that it frames the complete context of knowledge of biologic beings in a new and startling and even dazzling light. / .... The importance of this article is of the top designation. There is no subject in the Wikipedia that could be of more importance to address than the human personality. / <b>We are devoting every energy to furthering knowledge of this theory</b>.</i> Right. One such energy seems to be the unscrupulous and unintentionally risible use of Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:47, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> NPA personality theory already has paragraphs in the highly relevant <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personality_Test_0e71.html" title="Personality Test">Personality Test</a> article and in the <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Horney_f8f2.html" title="Karen Horney">Karen Horney</a> article. If NPA goes, those paragraphs should go too. On the other hand, NPA may be interesting as an example of Horney's influence. I suggest <b>delete</b> Benis. NPA might do with a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> warning.

<dd><b>Comment</b> You're right it's in the relevant Personality Test article... and guess who put it there? Benis, and the other person Dkatana (possibly a sockpuppet?) who were the two responsible for the NPA article added all the NPA info to the personality test article as well, I'm guessing the same is true for the Karen Horney article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I would strongly recommend taking a look at the talk page of NPA personality theory when making decisions about it. There was a rather lengthy discussion about how to assess its importance on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Psychology_1dc5.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Psychology">WikiProject Psychology</a> assessment scale, and this discussion included some points about the merits of the author and the theory. I think that I said most of what I can say there, although I will point out that there is a rather clear <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a> with the article. One editor in particular expressed rather directly that his or her intention was to use Wikipedia to promote the theory, as evidenced by this statement: "And, in turn, Wikipedia has the honor of the recognition for championing the theory before any other group of scholars took it on for further development and propagation." This is a definite misuse of Wikipedia, although it's not necessarily a reason to delete the article if it has other legs to stand on. In its favor, the theory is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> since there are a couple of publications about it, and while they may be of questionable reliability, they do seem to qualify as <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>. However, I don't think that there is much to establish its <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a>. Benis's publication is over twenty years old, and yet, this theory is virtually unknown in the psychology community. In fact, I suspect that few personality psychologists would have heard of this theory. While I think that the article does satisfy the basic requirements of Wikipedia, it is on the fringes of psychology, and Wikipedia is not the appropriate place to try to establish any credibility for it. —<a href="../../../c/s/w/User%7ECswrye_d0de.html" title="User:Cswrye">Cswrye</a> 06:54, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Having looked over the talk page, it appears the only people arguing strongly in favor of the article and giving the article a high rating are Benis himself and one or two individuals that seem very closely linked to Benis as they all seem to edit the very same articles, students perhaps? Especially <a href="../../../d/-/k/User%7ED-Katana_ca0b.html" title="User:D-Katana">User:D-Katana</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: as NPA is claimed to be a method-cum-theory of personality assessment and the two-volume <i>Encyclopedia of Psychological Assessment</i>, ed. R Fernández-Ballesteros (Sage, 2003) is bristling with articles on these, we can expect to see it there -- if it's regarded as amounting to anything. It's not there. And neither NPA nor Benis appears within the capacious indexes of either of the large works titled <i>Encyclopedia of Psychology</i> -- four volumes ed. R J Corsini (2nd ed, Wiley, 1994) or eight volumes ed. A E Kazdin (APA/OUP, 2000). NPA seems to be of negligible significance to psychometrics or psychology. Incidentally, I wonder how many academic libraries that aren't also copyright libraries have a non-donated copy of Benis's book: the Library of Congress does have a copy but Copac doesn't show a single copy (paid for by anyone), suggesting that no British university library has one. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:25, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a formally published theory by an impeccably qualified academic and MD, who, if you look at the bio, seems to have lived something of a "life less ordinary" which, combined with a formally published theory, I would regard as notability enough in it's own right.

<li>There certainly is. A putative issue in psychology should certainly not get the thumbs down because of a low number, even a very low number, of Google hits. However, Google does provide hits for the abstracts of articles in recent issues of most substantial scholarly journals in the cognitive and social sciences. Can you find any article that deals with this theory? As I've said, I think that this model/scale should be in <i>Encyclopedia of Psychological Assessment</i> (Sage, 2003) if it's taken seriously -- the two-volume encyclopedia does not devote a chapter to each of a few dozen such models but instead a paragraph to each of thousands of them. There's nothing there. Can you name a likely alternative to this encyclopedia? We can look it up in our respective libraries. As for formal publication, it seems not to be published in the <i>Proceedings of the AAAS,</i> as claimed, because this doesn't seem to exist. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 13:19, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>By "formally published" I mean commercially published by a recognised publishing house, as his book "Toward Self and Sanity: On the genetic origins of the human character" was in 1985 by <a href="http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLJ%2CGGLJ%3A2006-38%2CGGLJ%3Aen&amp;q=%22Psychological+Dimensions+inc%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=|Psychological" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLJ%2CGGLJ%3A2006-38%2CGGLJ%3Aen&amp;q=%22Psychological+Dimensions+inc%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=|Psychological" rel="nofollow">Dimensions inc</a> was in 1985. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 13:55, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

With respect to a "formally published theory", any kook can achieve that, and many of them indeed have (see, for example, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Dembski_b97f.html" title="William Dembski">William Dembski</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Chick_19ea.html" title="Jack Chick">Jack Chick</a>) — books aren't peer reviewed. Also, keep in mind that Psychological Dimensions Inc.

Now, while all this doesn't necessarily disprove NPA's notability, Google <i>does</i> provide pretty strong evidence when it fails to turn up a single independent scholarly reference to this 26-year-old theory among the millions of academic articles, web pages, and bibliographies it indexes. One would think that a notable psychological theory would have been mentioned at least a few times in the last twenty years, if only to criticize it! —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 16:22, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>His MD would entail a substantial element of psychiatry and psychology, while his impressive academic career would serve to instil the proper disciplines of scientific research and hypotheses an provide a professional reputation that would depend upon adherence to a reasonable standard of same, as his book and presentation clearly demonstrates.

<li>You're completely missing the point (and the conclusion of my last comment), to wit: no matter how "emminently qualified" (or not) Benis is to develop and publish a psychological/genetic theory of personality, the ultimate issue under consideration here is whether said theory is <i>notable</i>. Notability, both in science and in Wikipedia, is not determined by whether the theory is correct, or well-written, or published, or espoused by someone of certain qualifications or reputation (all of which you have argued). Rather, notability of a theory is established when the general public, or at least its proponent's scientific peers, <i>note</i> the theory. Notice the linguistic connection between the terms <i>to note</i> and <i>notability</i>? The latter requires that the former has occurred. Until you or anyone else can present any evidence that a significant proportion of the general public, or a significant number of psychological and genetic researchers, have noted Benis's theory, then we must assume (for the time being) that Benis's theory is not notable. The best evidence that people had noted the theory would be references to it in popular and scientific literature, in the form of books and articles (or even sections thereof) dedicated to the study of the theory, or citations of Benis's published works on the theory made in support of some other theory. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 17:45, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Since when is the plain-English interpretation of the word "notability" a personal opinion? And the subject of this AfD is not Benis's book, so <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> does not apply.

<li><b>Comment</b> Benis' theory has never been mentioned, however briefly, in any peer-reviewed publication in any disclipline. While Benis is a scientist and surgeon, he is no psychologist, no geneticist, no primatologist. In the past 20 years, he has not done any scholarly study of relevant literature or research. He has continued to solely rely on a minor personality theory of the early 20th Century. In the meantime, there has been decades of published primate behavioral studies and behavioral genetics research. True, Benis' theory may be valid, but the issue is not whether it is valid, but its noteworthiness. Apparently, it is not Wikipedia's job to provide platforms for obscure theories in the hope they will be discovered. Benis is quite devoted to his theory and book, but his interest has unfortunately not been enough to drive him forward in developing it.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> NPA personality theory, <s><b>keep (but rewrite) Anthony M. Benis</b></s>. This is the both the most clearcut and the most worrying AFD nomination I have yet seen. Clearcut in that both articles are about essentially non-noteworthy subjects, and both have wormed their way deep into the mesh of wikipedia at the clear behest of the subject himself. As discussed above, the grounds for deletion of both articles are very clear, and if we let them stand, we might as well give up on AFD.

<s><b>However</b>, the breach of wikpedia guidelines about verifiability and self-promotion is so serious that I would strongly urge that an article on Anthony M.

<dd>Hoary, I strongly support your POV on this dirty notion of vilifying Benis. I have known this man for MANY years, have witnessed his interactions with others, and he is NOT capable of acting with the intent some here ascribe to him and I find those unfounded and unproven assertions to be highly hurtful and damaging to a man who I have never known to be presumptious, egotistical or self-promothing. He is gentle and humble man and the ONLY reason he has ended up on the topic page today was his reliance on dear friends who strongly encouraged him to come here, never guessing at what could happen. You simply can't look at an end product and extrapolate backwards to discerning a person's inner state of mind, never mind intent - in a case like this where there is zero evidence of intent to use wiki to enrich or glorify himself. -<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">A green Kiwi in learning mode</a> 01:23, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

If you sincerely believe that these two articles belong on Wikipedia, I implore you to give us some third-party reviews, citations, case studies, sales figures for your book—in short, anything at all which would support the assertion that you and NPA personality theory are widely recognized as important in the fields of psychology and genetics. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 04:58, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete both</b> - I was reluctant to vote at first, but after reading the additional comments, I am more convinced that neither of these articles are appropriate for Wikipedia. A single book about a theory does not establish notability for a scientific theory when there has been little mention of it since its original publication and it has not been recognized by other experts. Likewise, I don't think that Dr. Benis has done anything yet to set him apart from similar academics and scientists. However, I will also say that I am somewhat embarassed by the way that he has been treated on this AFD. I had some pretty strong disagreements with Dr. Benis's supporters, but they were never anything less than civil during my discussions with them. Dr. Benis was simply asked to write an article on Wikipedia. It seems that he did not familiarize himself with Wikipedia's policies when he first came here, but let's be honest, most people don't learn them until they've been here for months. Writing an article that gets deleted is not vandalism, and I don't see any evidence that he was not behaving in good faith. There's no reason to attack him here; we only need to explain why the articles should be deleted. —<a href="../../../c/s/w/User%7ECswrye_d0de.html" title="User:Cswrye">Cswrye</a> 15:23, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Mediation of an AfD strikes me as an odd idea, but this oddity aside, the template looked mistaken. I therefore commented it out. Anyone who find that there has indeed been a RfM should tinker with the template to make it useful and then "uncomment" it. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:56, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Mediation? Of what? If we had thought for a minute that our contribution of “NPA personality theory” was improper or, indeed, not enthusiastically accepted, we would never have submitted it. We were told that it would make a splendid addition to the [Category:Psychological theories] section of Wikipedia. We agreed, and we produced the best article that we could, that eventually went through peer review where the major request for change was to add citations. We never claimed that NPA theory was the conventional wisdom of experts in the field, and indeed it is not, although it is the only quantitative personality trait theory put forward so far. But the fact remains that it is you, Wikipedia, who asked for the article. For those who were quick to rush to judgment, we ask you to look through the other Wikipedia entries under [Category:Psychological theories] and tell us, honestly, where you think NPA personality theory should be ranked.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>We are mystified at the irrational reaction that led to this implosion. It began with disparaging statements, full of inaccuracies, on the Discussion Page of the article, and quickly culminated in an apparently orchestrated campaign to expunge the NPA theory article and the associated biographical article. If there is one error that we did make, it was to allow the biographical article to take its present form, which does, indeed, give the appearance of a vanity entry. The biographical article was not our idea, and the original information that we submitted was a short paragraph from the dust jacket of our book.</dd>

<dd>Finally, if Psychonaut believes that he is friendly, open-minded and a “scientist”, then he should know better than to label a falsifiable mathematical model that is outside of his field as “pseudoscience and quackery”. But he is young and should have the capacity to learn from his mistakes. We hope that he does.</dd>

<li>Mediation is needed. This article may be better placed under a psychiatry or neurology section of Wikipedia. The theory's underpinnings are all solid medical science. Here's a quote from Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, Ninth Edition, p. 152. The neurologist assigns to it (emotion) a more precise definition-a complex state of the organism comprised of a mental component of fear, anger, love, or hate in association with certain visceral changes that are mainly under the control of the autonomic nervous system and lead to a certain pattern of motor expression." And a paragraph later: "Cannon and Bard and their associates studied the ways in which the two parts of the autonomic nervous system participate in the emotional state-the parasympathetic mediating trophotropic, restorative and reproductive functions, viz., the general homeostatic functions; and the sympathetic (including the adrenal glands) mediating self-protective or ergotropic functions. Hess and Bard localized the central control mechanisms in the hypothalamus which are ideally situated to send impulses via descending tracts to the parasympathetic and sympathetic segmental apparatus and via releasing factors to the pituitary-adrenal-thyroid system."

This is a bit odd, but very understandable in view of the way it has been referred to above as pseudoscientific (or at least redolent of pseudoscience). Still, your task as somebody who thinks the article is worthwhile is not to persuade people here that the theory (its subject matter) is worthwhile but instead to persuade them/us that the theory has made some sort of mark in the psychiatric, neurological or other community.

If not -- then I regret that this suggestion may irritate you, but still -- can it be shown to have been a significant part of what later turned out to have been a noteworthy blind alley? Can you name a reference book in which it's mentioned? (It wouldn't need its own article; an entry in the index would be a start.)

<li>Hello, Dr Hobgood. I agree with you that psychology was a bad placement, but I don't think that psychitry or neurology are any better. Temperment inheritence under genetics would be the best. For centuries, for thousands of years, mankind has selectively bred animals on the basis of personality characteristics. Cattle, horses and dogs are probably the best represented.</li>
<li>And cattle, horses and dogs all have different characteristics that are present and can be manipulated by selective breeding. For dogs, it is territoriality, dominance and affiliation. For man, it might very well be these other three. But it IS in animal science that this type of genetics is best recognized, understood and accepted. Also, considering the huge explosion in primate studies over the past 20 years, it might have TREMENDOUS acceptance with primatologist and primatology.</li>
<li>Personally, I think the research has tremendous validity. It is just that, as personality theories go, it's currently dead in the water (even if it proves eventually to have been revolutionary and ground-breaking).. But there are other venues where it could easily go. And if he were to look up the contact info for various primate behaviorists and primate study centers, he might find a lot of researchers eager to examine what he has to say. He could upload his entire book to WikiBooks...</li>
<li>The world is still a far way from admitting that we are a whole lot more like dogs and apes than we are like gods. We like to think that how we act and how we think and how we react comes from something a little more fancy that "breeding." But how at home we were not all that far back when people placed such a high value on "breeding", using it to explain all sorts of human success and failure. After Freud, however, and all who came after, and the ridiculous theory of the infant born as a blank slate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So yes, I more than think his theory has a place - just not in psychiatry or psychology. Maybe in a few more years. --<a href="../../../a/_/k/User%7EA_Kiwi_b88f.html" title="User:A Kiwi">A green Kiwi in learning mode</a> 09:36, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Excuse the repetition, but I don't think that a debate on the merits of NPA is appropriate here. Yes, I'd agree with you that the "blank slate" idea is ridiculous, but (aside from the fact that it wasn't always ridiculous) it has been sufficiently influential to prompt the recent publication of an entire book (by Pinker). And Freudianism (which I happen find equally ridiculous) constitutes a (putatively) academic and psychotherapeutic industry. I'm waiting for news of the effect NPA has had, on anyone or anything, in any category. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 10:40, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

The idea that human personality is determined by a single Mendelian locus with three alleles is totally at odds with all modern behavioural genetics research into the topic, see introductory textbook such as Plomin et al's <i>Behavioral Genetics</i> (W H Freeman &amp; Co.). This NPA article makes no real attempt to reconcile it's content with current science what-so-ever. Further oddities, such as why some phenotypes are spontaneously aborted are never explained, and make no sense. Why humans have this three locus polymorphism, but all the non-human animals in the article have one single personality type is not justified or defended, and at marked odds with current biological views. How putative monomorphic ancestors give rise to polymorphic humansunder some hand-wave "evolution" section is plain kooky. None of the material in the "Criticism and controversy" section deals with the NPA theory, the putative subject of this article. This is no doubt due to the fact that this non-notable theory is totally unknown to science and therefore uncriticised. From the material presented here, it's fairly easy to guess why, it's not really connected to the present state of knowledge in the field at all. The Anthony M. Benis article fails standards of notability, since it rests on this article as the notable achievement. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 04:23, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> We had said that we were leaving, but somehow keep getting prompted to return here.</li>
</ul>
<p>We should like to emphasise that we have never contested the non-notability of the theory. We do not understand why “mediation” should be applicable here, for Wikipedia should have the sole say of what goes into its pages, and there is really nothing to mediate. If Wikipedia decides that the article is not appropriate, we have absolutely no quarrel with that.</p>
<p>We have noted Dr Hurd’s entry, and although this page should not be encumbered with a discussion of the merits of the theory, we hope that you will permit us a short reply.</p>
<p>The original article that we submitted at Wikipedia’s request was short, a bare-bones summary of the theory, without illustrations. The article did grow, at the request of an editor, with further requests to comment on the possible implications of the theory. That is how the section on evolutionary implications found its way into the article.</p>
<p>The biographical article was also not our idea, and we agree that it should not have been there at all.</p>
<p>We suspect that Dr Hurd must have read the article hurriedly, for the theory is not so “kooky” as it may appear at first glance. The non-notability of the theory aside, Dr Hurd’s comments contain several misstatements, and we believe they give the reader an inaccurate picture of the seriousness of our model.</p>
<p>First of all, we do not say that that “human personality is determined by a single Mendelian locus with three alleles”. The model comprises three separate loci for the three traits, and furthermore we did state that there were at least “four tiers” to the human personality, with the possibility of many genes entering into the picture. We also did explain the basis of why certain phenotypes are spontaneously aborted: “Certain combinations of parental genotypes may lead to zygotes having only the P trait (P phenotype) or lacking all three traits (null phenotype, denoted by 0).” The reason why such zygotes are non-viable is that they develop no functioning autonomic nervous system. Although Dr Hurd considers this to be an oddity, it is a predictive aspect of this deterministic model.</p>
<p>Next, we did not say that “all the non-human animals in the article have one single personality type”. We clearly stated that “Akin to humans, the omnivorous, promiscuous chimpanzee, also capable of the gingival smile, would likely have a heterogeneous distribution of types, with NA and NPA types predominating”. Finally, nowhere do we imply that “monomorphic ancestors give rise to polymorphic humans under some hand-wave ‘evolution’”. Surely, Dr Hurd does not mean to imply that baboons, orangutans and chimpanzees are our ancestors.</p>
<p>The NPA theory, being based on genetics, is one of the very few falsifiable theories in psychology. Perhaps, it will turn out to be “false”. But if notabilty is the criterion, then we agree that in the present circumstances it does not belong in Wikipedia. Once more, we wish you all the best, and bid you ...adieu.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I do feel that when one academic criticises the work of another in a related field he owes it to all of us to explain that criticism in recogniseable academic terms that we can assimilate and learn from.

<p><b>Nomination for Deletion</b> An encyclopedically non-notable magazine. This is an article about a spammy free promotional magazine put out by an early British computer games company. Publication of the magazine is said by article itself to have been "occasional" and for a "brief period". Most or all UK computer game magazines from this period had BASIC or other language programs written as text in them (I used to read some of them) - doesn't seem to be anything special about the text adventures mentioned. Also, no sources,. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:38, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Question</b> In less than twenty years, computer games have evolved from being text code keyed in to 16K of RAM, to hundreds of MB on CD or for lengthy download. It seems to me that there is now a historical revelvance to these magazines, which must appear utterly paleloithic to today's kids. It doesn't sound like this mag was one of the big players a the time, but does it have any significance as a niche example? I'm edging towards a delete, but want to be sure that I understand the context. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 19:46, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b><s>Comment</s>Delete</b> -- anything to do with the Dragon home computer could be described as "niche". I knew one person who had one (and he regretted telling us very quickly!), the rest of us had Spectrums and Commodore 64s. I was heavily into the C64 and home computing scene in the years in question and I certainly don't remember this publication - but as above, I'm not aware of the context. <s>Put me down as neutral at the moment, I suppose.</s> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hot</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubba_hotep_258d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubba hotep">ep</a> 20:07, 28 October 2006 (UTC) Now you've convinced me, Brown Haired Girl!

<li><b>Keep</b> This isn't a "game strategy guide." It's a discussion of one of the three main deck archtypes of the original TCG. If every single Pokemon (of which there are over 300) gets an article, why can't the deck types, of which there are only three and none of them are stubs, get articles? <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilver2195_22fc.html" title="User:Silver2195">Silver2195</a> 13:45, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because as well-established as the game's deck-format trinity of aggro, combo, and control are, they are not defined by Magic's rules, but rather have evolved as a result of players over the years tuning their decks to find an optimal strategy. As for the Pokémon, their articles do not (or in any cases where they do, should not) cover game strategy, but they do cover the established story of the characters as they appear in the comics and cartoons. Plus, there's the Yu-Gi-Oh precedent to consider. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 15:04, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I don't understand the need to delete an article that's so neatly tucked away that it will be read only by those that want to read it. Chess openings are in Wikipedia and they are pure strategic choices in a game, on a specific level. I can source the material in these AfD but you're just going to delete them on some other grounds. I have spent hours on them and now they're going up in a puff of smoke. The game of Magic is actually in need of encyclopedic material like this, the official website has just gotten around to hiring writers to lay 'official' groundwork like these AfD's cover; it's fan sites that cover this material but in extreme detail on a daily basis. Are you the janitors that must keep Wikipedia clean?

<dd><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is a general-purpose encyclopedia, so articles that are only accessible to a niche crowd are not good for the encyclopedia (articles that are too "in-universe" are similarly treated). But in this case, the deck articles are always going to focus on how to play them (just like a Pokemon article that was deleted, Blisskarm, and people say we don't delete Pokemon articles!), and I don't think you'd accept the compromise on taking out all of the "how to play" material, so a better option would be to <b>transwiki</b> them to a specialist wiki, like <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering" rel="nofollow">Wikibooks</a>. That way you can keep your articles. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 15:25, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Sounds like a copy-paste from the Postmodernism Generator. Phrase gets 11 google hits, 10 from Wikipedia or Answers.com, and the only one that looks remotely relevant is a dead link. The paper supposedly putting forth this theory was published in 2006, making this a very neo neologism. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 04:46, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The article cites a paper, but I am unable to locate any such paper. A single such paper is far too specific a topic for an encyclopaedia article, anyway.

Nothing has ever been written about this site in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reputable source</a>..." You claim CFC is "nowhere near as notable as a site such as Serebii.net". If notability has nothing to do with being a certain size or level or activity, as seems to be the standard used to dismiss many of the claims of CFC notability, and notability is solely based on external factors such as being written about and having external hosting of the site's content, then why would you make your ridiculous claim that Serebii.net is more notable than CFC? Based on what factors or criteria? Based on what evidence? If you make a claim you should be able to either back in up (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> seems important to Wikipedia), or else withdraw your incorrect and misleading statement. --- <a href="../../../s/a/h/User%7ESahkuhnder_c9e4.html" title="User:Sahkuhnder">Sahkuhnder</a> 21:25, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> No encyclopedic notability. Articles on fan sites are getting out of control. The way we're going, at some point for every article on a popular TV show, video game, pop star, cartoon series, we'll have a separate article on Wikipedia about the main fan website which reads "this fansite was founded in 200x and it pays tribute to X pop culture thingy and is linked to from X's main website by X's marketing guys", "it has 3 forums and 8 subforums. here is the list", "here are some fun stuff that the forum posters get up to and some running jokes we like - it's a subculture!". Wikipedia is not a web directory. Leave aside how many visitors the site is claiming to get - Does the website do anything encyclopedically notable? Does it have any impact on the wider culture?

<li><b>Delete</b> I am longtime member of the CFC Forums. I appreciate its value to those who use it, but it is of no major consequence to the mainstream world. The article reads like an advertisement and frankly, none is needed. CFC stands on its own. I do not feel that a wikipedia article adds anything of value to Wikipedia itself nor detracts from CFC if the article were withdrawn. All that it is doing is taking up space, needlessly. My main point of contention is that if you know enough about CFC to look it up on Wikipedia, you know enough about it to not need to look it up, at all. --JohnHSOG 04:15, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I am longtime member of the CFC Forums. Respectfully, I see only a negative relationship with a site like Wikipedia. I trust the posts on CFC because they have undergone true peer review, in other words comments are not deleted but are discussed by other fellow members with their own visible reputations, and then each member is free to judge for themselves. CFC is not a tyranny of whoever has the (temporary) last word or of a particular editor's politically correct agenda or personal opinion. Please see RockMFR's "fanatics" comment above for an example of an attitude that wouldn't be welcome at CFC. As JohnHSOG put it "CFC stands on its own.", and it stands taller without any association to a site of highly questionable accuracy and trustworthiness. --mossmonster 11:09, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

No real evidence of independent reviews or the distribution of the content by other sites. In other words, it doesn't meet the WP:WEB standards. I have it on my bookmarks, but that isn't a WP:WEB standard. WP:WEB also doesn't authorize the top N sites of a type for any N or any type.

<li>Have you ever looked at the official Civ4 and GalCiv2 sites, as they are full of mods from CFC. Not only that but the bug hunting and game improvements/new game features that come from the CFC forums, as discussed by game developers that are members of CFC, get added directly into new game patches and game upgrades. There is lots of distribution of CFC content if you just look for it, and as CFC content improves and becomes part of the games themselves, every time the games themselves are independently reviewed a small piece of CFC content is reviewed as well. --- <a href="../../../s/a/h/User%7ESahkuhnder_c9e4.html" title="User:Sahkuhnder">Sahkuhnder</a> 03:06, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I haven't looked at them in the context of this AFD discussion. I have one bookmarked, the other I've looked at but not bookmarked. Mods aren't really that convincing, as they seem to me primarily the creation of the individual creator, not any particular fansite. The GOTMs being included or reviewed elsewhere would definitely be CFC specific content distributed/reviewed elsewhere. Of course, best practice if you are aware of such is to introduce citations or other references to the article, but we generally will evaluate evidence introduced here despite the WP:WEB requirement that the evidence be in the article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 17:44, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Of course the content is the creation of the individual creator, no fansite creates anything on its own, but is just a repository of the work of many actual people. Mods may not be convincing to you, but to those of us who play the game they are huge, often to the point of creating what is very near to a whole new gaming experience. Do you know the amount of skill and time it takes to create a modpack? Does some content qualify as 'acceptable' while other content like mods just gets disregarded? Look at the massive number of people who download game mods(including scenarios/new units/custom maps/rule changes/etc.) before you say "mods aren't really that convincing". I read the rules and didn't see the part anywhere where some content counts and some content doesn't. It just seems very wrong that many people simply added their opinion without knowing how large and active CFC is, that it's linked by the offical games homepages, that the game designers are active members, that CFC helps debug the games, that new units, rules and features are discussed and added due to CFC, and that a great deal of CFC content is posted elsewhere for download by those of us who play the games. I guess all that acutal research would be too much work. Easier to just wallow in ignorance and smugly type "Delete - Non-notable/No external content/It's just a forum fansite/etc." without knowing the slightest bit about CFC or the influence it has on both the games and the players. --- <a href="../../../s/a/h/User%7ESahkuhnder_c9e4.html" title="User:Sahkuhnder">Sahkuhnder</a> 18:56, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are some mods for other games (for Civ? I dunno) that have articles here at Wikipedia, so a mod can be notable for an article all by itself. To me, mods aren't that convincing for a particular fansite because they aren't strongly enough tied to any that site. The same mod could have been posted to multiple sites, so which one should Wikipedia credit for its redistribution at another site? That is why I was looking for CFC specific content that was redistributed, because that would be solid evidence for keeping the CFC article, as opposed to an article on the mod or on some other site. As a side note, I think even if the article gets kept much of the current text fails to adhere to our policy requiring <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

A few of its members were invited to Beta test Civ4, and one of the mods created there has even been included in one of the patches. Even without all that, it has a place in general internet history; being the inventor of the 'Democracy Game' and suspect as featuring the first 'Game of the Month', something which has been included in many other gaming forums. The off-topic forum on its own is worthy of being mentioned here, with deep philosophical and political discussions, as well as things like the 'Giant Radioactive Monkey'.

Actually, of course you didn't or you would have seen that they are far more than just HYPERLINKS back to CFC and that they host CFC content themselves in the form of mods, etc., as well as actual changes to the standard game in the form of CFC upgrades, improvements and de-bugging efforts. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criterion 3 for Notability clearly states "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators".

<li><b>Keep</b>: RockMFR, consider this. I worked on Civ4 (the primary game both CFC and Apolyton focus on) as a scenario designer. I worked on the sequel as well (both sites also focus on this). You want CFC/Apolyton content that is redistributed? Fine. My "Ages of Discovery" scenario was uploaded to both CFC and Apolyton as content of those sites. Now, the scenario 6 months later is spread across the web being redistributed. Also, this CFC and Apolyton content has been published in magazines (most notable July 2006 Strategy Gamer &amp; November 2006 Computer Games Weekly) with other CFC &amp; Apolyton exclusive content. Jon Shafer, Firaxis scenario designer, has released exclusive official content on both CFC &amp; Apolyton (WW1 &amp; South-East Asia scenarios) which are also now spread across the web. If you didn't jump to such a fast conclusion "Oh it's a fan-site delete it!" BEFORE looking up the facts first, you wouldn't look like such a fool now.

<li><b>Comment</b> RockMFR - Nonsense you claim? There are a billion people on the Internet, and only one of them would want to add evidence of this page having a "flood of obvious meatpuppets". And what an <i>astronomically</i> amazing coincidence, this planted comment is very stereotypically "meatpuppet", comes from your school, and was made 6 minutes prior to your logging on and making a comment under your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RockMFR" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RockMFR" rel="nofollow">RockMFR</a> name.

<li><b>Comment</b> Note that this user has made quite a number of contributions on various issues since before this AfD was made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=164.107.92.120" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=164.107.92.120" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. Firstly this means it seems unlikely it was RockMFR unless he's been editing anonymously too for a period of time. Secondly, it means this account isn't a Single Purpose Account, and unlikely to be a "meatpuppet", so even if it was RockMFR, it's a rather ineffective fake. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 23:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This account seems to have been blocked before for violating the rules. Doesn't that also fit perfectly for a puppet account that a coward is using to hide behind and do mischief as? Is it in any way hard to believe that this guy had been editing anonymously for a period of time? As long as he continued to get away with it why would he stop? It would be interesting to check the posting time/date stamps with this account and see how well they mesh with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:RockMFR" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:RockMFR" rel="nofollow">four accounts</a> RockMFR admits are him. I only glanced at them and already caught both accounts doing the exact the same, meatpuppet=Keep, RockMFR=Delete to the same obscure page, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Black_Bitch" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Black_Bitch" rel="nofollow">Black Bitch</a>. Yeah, I'm sure this is just another coincidence too. I guess he didn't think any lowly "meatpuppet" like me would ever catch his deception. --- <a href="../../../s/a/h/User%7ESahkuhnder_c9e4.html" title="User:Sahkuhnder">Sahkuhnder</a> 23:44, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Why on earth would he use this anonymous IP to make votes <i>opposite</i> to his vote? I mean, I can understand the claim for this AfD, to support the accusation of meatpuppets (though we both know it's true that this AfD has been linked from the forum in question anyway), but no one has made any such accusations on the Black Bitch article.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Gosh, thanks for all those well-thought-out, carefully checked commets. In the future, to improve the level of your contributions to Wikipedia, might I suggest you improve your practices in two areas. First, you should actually read the article you are commenting on, and take note of its contents. Second, you should consider the claims made in the article against the relevant notability criteria, even, as necessary, checking the references and external links provided for the article..<br />
<br />
<a href="../../../o/p/h/Ophelia_Benson_e901.html" title="Ophelia Benson">Ophelia Benson</a> is a well-known published author, not merely a blogger (although she is probably notable as a blogger, too). Her two books are listed by title in the article,even though none of you astute readers noticed that. (Apparently the identification of Benson as an "author" and the listing of the book titles in distinctive type was insufficient to tip off careful and well-informed Wikipedia editors like yourselves; perhaps one or two of you may have suggestions on how to improve such descriptions.) Her books meet the notability criteria, having been reviewed and discussed in major media. In fact, Benson is a native of the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a>, and both her books have been reviewed/discussed in the <a href="../../../t/l/s/TLS_099d.html" title="TLS">TLS</a>, which even <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> acknowledges as "one of the world's preeminent critical publications." (The second review appears in the October 20, 2006 issue, and is not yet directly cited online.)<br />
<br />
Benson's two books may be only available through such obscure retailers as Amazon.com <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Truth-Matters-Ophelia-Benson/dp/0826476082/sr=1-1/qid=1162146949/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3446636-3738429?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Truth-Matters-Ophelia-Benson/dp/0826476082/sr=1-1/qid=1162146949/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3446636-3738429?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Fashionable-Nonsense-Guide-People/dp/0285637142/sr=1-2/qid=1162146949/ref=sr_1_2/002-3446636-3738429?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Fashionable-Nonsense-Guide-People/dp/0285637142/sr=1-2/qid=1162146949/ref=sr_1_2/002-3446636-3738429?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> and Barnes &amp; Noble <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780826476081&amp;itm=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780826476081&amp;itm=1" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780285637146&amp;itm=2" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780285637146&amp;itm=2" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, and the relevant pages give samples of reviews and indicate the caliber of Benson's audience.<br />

Now I recognize that article deletion is a holy and privileged activity, and that deletion of articles about women whose claims to notability don't involve performances emphasizing, flaunting, or exposing their mammaries is a virtual sacrament which shouldn't be disrupted or contested, however ridiculous or inaccurate the basis, unless the circumstances are really really unusual. But while one of England's "leading cultural critics" is apparently not, by Wikipedia editor consensus, as notable as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chessie_Moore_3df5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chessie Moore">a moderately obese middle-aged woman who films herself having sex with dogs</a>, and the <a href="../../../t/l/s/TLS_099d.html" title="TLS">TLS</a> is apparently by the same consensus not a "major" publication with the stature and reputation of <i>Color Climax Anal Sex</i> or <i>Big Fuckin' Tits</i>, or even <i>Juggs</i>, I think she deserves to be included in Wikipedia.<br />
<br />
I now realize that the excessive literacy and cultural awareness I displayed in recognizing the name of a well-known figure in the British academic-philosophical-literary world is inconsitent with the qualities required of a good Wikipedian, and fully justifies the assumptions of bad faith you have all made. I now know that in-depth knowledge of any subjects outside of pornography, Pokemon, and professional sports can only damage the Wikipedian enterprise, and I will do my best in the future to follow your lead and to contribute only with regard to subjects about which I know nothing, or next to nothing.<br />
<br />
Now (dropping the ironic stance) I deserve a public apology from each of the posters whose sloth, carelessness, malice, or incompetence led them to make unfounded, uncivil, derogatory comments about me (and about the entirely blamess Ms Benson). And I deserve a display of abject, public, unqualified self-execration from the ArbCom member who charged to the head of the attack. I expect, of course, nothing but renewed incivility, personal attacks, and evasion of responsibility.--<a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivianDarkbloom_43b2.html" title="User:VivianDarkbloom">VivianDarkbloom</a> 20:32, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You know, I'm just going to weigh in once more here, after having been called to this VfD by a gigantic bolus of angry ranting on my talk page. Scenario: Person A tries to get their way by throwing a nasty screaming tantrum. Person B responds like, "What the...? Jeez, cut that out!" Now, this is life, and having been involved in life for awhile, I've noticed something: Whenever the above scenario plays out, there's always a Person C who comes around a liitle while later, all like, "Dudes! <i>Everyone</i> needs to chill out here."

For the scene, the article merely asserts that he's "<b>a</b> prominent representative." As for "notable style", noise is a notable style, but he's absolutely <i>not</i> the most prominent representative, and I don't see any evidence that the sub-sub-genre "avant-garde noise" is notable (or, in fact, anything more than a neologism), let alone any proof that he's its most prominent representative.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- I am entirely confused by this article. For a start shouldn't the opening sentence be the other way round? "Soho Repetory Theatre...aka Soho Rep"? And the article titled to reflect this. Other than that, it <i>sounds</i> notable, but I haven't got the time nor the inclination to check it externally. The onus is on the author to provide external, independent sources to save us having to look all the time. I would delete it on that basis because otherwise it looks like an overblown advert. However, having awoken with a sense of good faith this morning, I am willing to wait to pass judgement. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hot</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubba_hotep_258d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubba hotep">ep</a> 12:09, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While this is an article that needs a lot of references and editing for sense, Soho Rep is a notable theater in New York City. The OBIE awards are notable. Soho Rep is regularly the source of articles in the <i>New York Times</i> and other reputable newspapers--I found a 10 October 2006 <i>NYT</i> piece discussing their new production and new artistic director. I have no present connection to the theater (I worked on one production in 1999) <a href="../../../o/v/e/User%7EOvercamp_2855.html" title="User:Overcamp">Overcamp</a> 21:51, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, the assertions of notability are poorly presented, but seem adequate. And the article needs work, but seems salvageable. While I'm here, though, I have to ask, is that really the official name? It sounds more like a common nickname, in which case, the article should be moved to the offical name, with the redirect left in place. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 23:32, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not sure whether this university professor is notable or not, so I nominate this article without a vote.

<p>This is unencyclopedic and unmaintainable. First of all, the show has been running 4-5 days a week for the last several years, so thousands of number-one videos in the show's history have already been lost in time. Second, well, it's a music video countdown show voted in every day by whoever happens to visit the website, so you can't really say what useful information it's providing the reader, if any. Third, utterly unverifiable in any case since the site only keeps the previous day's vote results, and if the editor who started this should miss a day, then that's one more day lost.</p>
<p>And for the record, I do watch the show; there are better indicators for <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Forty_95a6.html" title="Top Forty">Top Forty</a> format popularity in Canada.

<li>Yes, the section Marasmusine referred to is why I (and presumably the other two prodders) marked this. It's inherent in the title of the article that it's a how-to guide, so there's nothing really that can be done to make it encyclopedic. Are you saying you agree with the deletion?

<li><b>Comment</b> No vote quite yet from me, but some early thoughts... I decided to take a hard look at the videos which Chessie's been in. IAFD says she's been in 215 movies which is substantial and well above the "100 films" test in <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> (and yes I realize the test is dubious). Pulling out all the films which were tagged by IAFD as compliations, as well as all the films where the distributor is tagged as "CMoore" (to remove VivianDarkbloom's "custom" movies) left me with 125 films ranging from 1989 to 1996. That's still a substantial number of films. <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 14:56, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

That really is <i>quite</i> rare, usually considered demeaning, often considered outright illegal, and would have been stricken from the article except she references it on her own web site (and Luke Ford writes about it in his article, but that wouldn't have been sufficient for us to write about it without confirmation on her own site).

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd like to know that too. I'm under the impression that it's ultimately a matter of sourcing, like so many other things. Unfortunately, with a lot of genuine subcultural groups (including, apparently, Satan-worshipping National Socialists), not much tends to come up in the mainstream press, and it can take a lot of work for an outsider to figure out what's relevant and notable and what isn't. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto "Protocols of the Elders of" Movil</a> 23:11, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I only ask because there are a lot of churches which come up which I refrain from nominating because (a) it isn't easily discernible whether it fits into CORP or whatever, and (b) fear of being struck down by an almighty... no that isn't true actually.

<li><b>Delete</b> -- and delete again. Just what is notable about fan sites anyway? But besides that personal thought, in this article there are "claims" to notability - made by themselves, referenced and sourced by themselves. Oh, and look, you can join the forum and there's a handy FAQ too. How handy. If it was to be restyled into a proper article it would say "... is an Avril Levigne fan site." - and that's it. It would then be speedied under "nocontext" or "nonsense". Of course it gets good Alexa results because A.L. is a notable figure herself and any site which features her is bound to have big hits.

<dd>I would say that all of the information in this article is easily derivable from Wikipedia's own information content services, as well as Bi-lingual Wikipedians who contribute to both Wikipedias. (and we'll assume that there are sources for the language of the Maldives, if not, then you'd best object to that elsewhere). And the reason why the article on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is not appropriate for this information is simply a matter of convenience. That article is large enough without trying to describe every language. Yes, this is a shorter one, but some of the others are not, and those have enough details that they should clearly be kept. Given that, I'd rather keep articles on all of the languages than none. And I don't have to prove how it meets any of those standards, since I don't believe any of those standards are appropriate in deciding whether or not to keep this entry, or any of the others. It's clear to me that Wikipedia should document itself, and part of that documentation is information on the foreign language version. To do otherwise just seems strange to me. But then, I said as much in the Czech language discussion. You aren't offering anything new, in fact, you're repeating the same arguments given there. They aren't convincing. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:20, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I have a strong argument in that this article violates policies and fails notability guidelines. The "repetitiveness" of my arguments have nothing to do with their strength, and "they aren't convincing" is merely your opinion (which I respect). You said "And I don't have to prove how it meets any of those standards, since I don't believe any of those standards are appropriate in deciding whether or not to keep this entry, or any of the others." What makes this article an exception? We can all of a sudden disregard policy and notability guidelines?

<dd>Yes, we can disregard guidelines like that, when they're not appropriate. It's called common sense, and it's a valuable asset in making all decisions. Wikipedia should describe itself(Wikipedia is notable, for many reasons, but even if it wasn't, I'd say it would be important for the site to be able to describe itself). Wikipedia has foreign-language components(if you don't believe this is the case, I suggest you visit wikipedia.org). Since they clearly exist, they should also be described. Given the potential length of those articles, having seperate articles is probably the best way to do that. Can you come up with a good reason why having this article is a real and substantial problem? I can't. Can you come up with a better way to do things? I doubt it, but you're welcome to make suggestions as to other options. However, deletion is not one of them. It's not effective. If you've gotten any objections to the content, you can check it seperately, but please don't try AfD's for cleanup. Anyway, you can cite policies all you want, but if you'll check things like WEB, SELF, others, they have exceptions and clarifications that clearly show they aren't to be adhereded to like a bunch of mindless machines. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:52, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

This is a necessary result of Wikipedia being a neutral, verifiable encyclopedia. The terms 'importance' and 'significance' are also in use, and for practical purposes on Wikipedia they are similar." That is why this article is problematic. Also, if I could have come up with a better way to do things, then I would just do it. But, since I don't believe this article deserves to be on Wikipedia, and I want to get a consensus on whether it should be kept or not, I brought it here.

<dd>Actually, the very first part of Notability is: <i>This page is considered a guideline on Wikipedia.

<dd><i>Clearly</i> one of those? Well <i>I</i> don't think so. Take a look at the article again (Divehi Wikipedia).

I don't even think this article has the <i>potential</i> to grow. An article about the smallest nook/cranny about Wikipedia shouldn't exist.

<dd>So, it's a slow growing encyclopedia, which is no surprise given the number of speakers. So what? It's a simple article, with nothing that needs extensive verification outside the wikipedia software.

Other than that, the only other information refers to the language itself, which I assume you're not questioning. All in all, no big deal. Does this article need to grow? I suppose, but that would depend on Wikipedians who speak both languages being interested in informing us. I doubt it'll happen quickly, if at all, but so what? That's just a result of the idiosyncratic growth of Wikipedia, not an argument as to merit.

<li>The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field. <b>Greg is doubly significant in the history of IRC, as the instigator of EFnet and the writer of the first bot.</b></li>
<li>Google Test -- Does a search for the subject produce a large number of distinguishable hits on Google or other well-known Internet search engine? <b>Quite a significant number of articles show up on Google if Greg is searched for. Results 1 - 100 of about 139,000 English pages for "Greg lindahl".</b> That's an incredible number of articles! The overwhelming majority seem to be about the history of IRC.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - He was a major (if not the most important) influence behind the modern form of British bureaucracy. He also influenced British policy on currency, including the setting up of new currencies in Empire dominions, and had far more influence than a mere "private secretary", even in the 19th century British government meaning of that word. His field isn't one that you find a lot of online references about; somebody's going to have to get out some old books and perhaps visit the British Museum to add in any reliable information from secondary sources. He may not be well-known <i>to the 21st century</i>, but he was notable. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 01:12, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

This does not appear to be a landmark work, nor does it indicate encyclopedic notability for this fellow. You say he was influential but historians from the 19th century til now appear to have overlooked him. It may be that he had significant influence within government departments he worked in - but this does not necessarily make him encyclopedically notable. The same goes for faceless policy wonks within the No.10 Policy Unit in the 21st century who may have significant influence but no high office or exceptional influence. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:34, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, if he appears in the modern DNB, it looks like he's a carry-over from the 19th century edition. Here's the summary article from that version:<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2000.01.0013%3Aid%3Dart.677" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2000.01.0013%3Aid%3Dart.677" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>. Unless his being "an authority of currency questions" can be substantively fleshed out with references to show some significance in economics, I don't see the encyclopedic notability. Article also doesn't mention him ever being a secretary to a Prime Minister. I sympathize with the overpopulation of current day nobodies in Wikipedia, but that's reason for culling, not expanding. Also, from browsing around the summary version, I'm not quite convinced of 19th century DNB's ironclad status as a reference work for notability. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 05:07, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>As you say, that's the <i>summary</i>. The actual entry is six paragraphs, a relatively substantial article on a "non-notable" person (and much longer than many DNB articles)! -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 14:33, 29 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Question:Does the DNB remove people once their notability has waned, or do they just leave them in? If it's the latter, his entry merely proves that he had notability in the past, not that that notability continues to this day. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 21:51, 29 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The DNB does not delete articles. But why should a person's notability fade? If they are notable in history then they are notable in history. Nobody appears in the DNB unless they are dead - <i><a href="../../../w/h/o/Who%27s_Who_098a.html" title="Who's Who">Who's Who</a></i> is the reference work on the living, and that includes far, far more people than the DNB. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 23:08, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Surely you know that that is nonsense. Brittany Spears is notable now, will she be in 100 years? Highly unlikely. Jane Fernandes is notable right this minute, will she be in 50 years? No. The 15 minutes of fame concept covers far more people than does longevity of notability. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 23:54, 29 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not nonsense at all, since the DNB does not include articles on living people (didn't I just say that?). Neither of those people would therefore merit an article in the DNB in the first place. They would (if they were British) be judged worthy or unworthy of an article <i>after their deaths</i>, not before. Since their shelf life is indeed likely to be short they are highly unlikely to merit such an article (unless they go on to have lifetime noteworthy careers). Please read what I actually wrote before you comment. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 01:12, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>I read what you wrote, and I find this "The DNB does not delete articles. But why should a person's notability fade? If they are notable in history then they are notable in history" to be nonsense. BTW, are you a member of the DNB's editorial board? Are you privy to their methods or to their decisions? How can a person's notability fade? Surely that question was not serious. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 22:32, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I fail to see your reasoning. People's notability fades after they retire from public life, but if they were deemed notable for the DNB in the first place (after they were dead) then how can they be less notable now than they were then? Arbuthnot was included twenty years after his death. He was still considered notable then. Why is he any less notable now? He may be less well-known to the general public now (if he was ever at all well-known to the general public, which is doubtful), but that doesn't make him any less notable to an historian. Wikipedia is not meant to only include people who are well-known today, but people who were significant in their time. It seems to me that you are having trouble with the difference. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 01:44, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of course Britney Spears will be notable in a hundred years. She's a major pop star, and hence will be notable as a major figure in the music scene of the late 20th and early 21st century.

<li><b>Comment</b> The first canonical mention of Saber's Beads made was by a Richard Kone from British Columbia ('Targets Not To Miss', Astronomy Sept 06). The national/global magazines Astronomy, Amateur Astronomy, and the Reflector (as well as moonsighting.com) all find the rarely observed phenomenon worthy of mention. Stephen Saber, an accredited observational astronomer and author <a href="http://www.geocities.com/saberscorpx/home.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/saberscorpx/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/saberscorpx/home.html</a> <a href="http://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/master/mastrwn.html" class="external free" title="http://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/master/mastrwn.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/master/mastrwn.html</a>, was the first to note the exceedingly thin limb's staggered brightness peaks' similarity to those seen during a total solar eclipse. This is not a promotional attempt, except to appreciably boost the search for very young/old crescents and encourage Lunar observing in general. It was others from the astro community that nominated the term in the first place. It is now becoming mainstream. WK should appreciate the entry at its inception. Thanks anyway. -User:Saberscorpx</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for now. I would normally be very dubious of anything self-promoted and self-named, but it appears that it indeed was published in Astronomy magazine, and that the name was given to it by someone else, recognizing that apparently Saber was the first to notice it.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: As far as I understand it (I'm no astronomer) it is quite hard to observe the Moon so close to it's New Moon phase, due to it being close to the Sun (visually). This would explain why it hasn't been noticed earlier (the phenomenon obviously has existed virtually forever, but no one noticed it before). And the Moon get's looked at at a lot, but normally <i>not</i> so close to New Moon, since that is the least interesting period to watch it (why look at a dark surface when you can see it much better one or two weeks later?). Having said all that, I don't really oppose a delete, but not for OR and geocities reasons, but due to lakc of more sources. It can well be argued that one source (Astronomy magazine), even though that is obviously an important one, is not enough to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:23, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_moon.html" title="New moon">New moon</a>, or else <i>very weak delete</i> until/unless more sources are found. The phenomenon is certainly real, and we should mention it <i>somewhere</i>. As for the name, Fram's links convince me that it's a legitimate neologism used by people other than its namesake, but I still feel we need more evidence that it's really catching on, and that it isn't just an indepently coined name for something with another, more established name. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 18:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The article was not submitted without diligent research. A Virtual Moon Atlas software preview can be simulated between .75 and .95 / 29.25 and 29.45 (days) lunation with maximum penumbra. While the solar eclipse counterpart is initiated by direct sunlight through our moon's valleys, Saber's Beads are first detected by the earliest angular illumination of the mountains. How had this obvious and beautiful phase gone unmentioned for so long? There are at least three possibilities; timing, desire, and recognition. Virtual Moon Atlas software simulations show the best aesthetic window to be 18-22 hours on either side of New Moon. How many clear shots at this exact window does one get over, say, 5 years? Not many. Also, veterans in search of record/near-record thin crescents are often waiting for the challenge of something in the 10-16 hour range to test their skills. In addition, except for the celestial players involved, witnessing an eclipse and hunting a Lunar sliver are very different endeavors. The mindset during the separate events may simply preclude immediate recognition of this more subtle but unmistakably similar phenomenon. Our moon's rugged topography and constant libration will also vary the Beads' appearance, which is further enhanced by associated low-altitude scintillation.<a href="http://www.geocities.com/saberscorpx/beads.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/saberscorpx/beads.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> In any case, it gives Lunar observers and imagers something new, challenging, and interesting to watch for. If anything, it should be linked to Lunar Phase, Moon, and Observational Astronomy.If the article remains, Mr. Saber will furnish more sources and images as they become available. Thank you.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I agree that this article could border on being only dictionary entry, yet based on the use of this term in articles, books, and in internet I will argue that this term can stand on its own as a psychology article; I will even suggest to move it there, i.e. cold feet (psychology) if this helps, e.g. article on <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=10432530&amp;dopt=Abstract" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=10432530&amp;dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow">cold feet</a> in psychology. Moreover, here’s an article from a group that runs a <a href="http://www.emotionallyengaged.com/newsletter_brides_feel.php" class="external text" title="http://www.emotionallyengaged.com/newsletter_brides_feel.php" rel="nofollow">Cold Feet workshop</a> for ambivalent brides and grooms.

<dd>It may be more than a simple dicdef, but that doesn't make it encyclopedic. The extra content beyond the dicdef at the moment is both unencyclopedic and in a bad state.

<dd>It's a slang term for a very broad category of anxiety. At best it could be a redirect to anxiety.
