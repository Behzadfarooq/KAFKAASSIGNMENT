<li><b>Keep</b>. If there is going to be an edit war over these ridiculous allegations, it's better that it be on this page then mucking up Harry Magdoff's web page. I should note that a Google search for "Magdoff", "Venona" and "Kant" (Magdoff's supposed Venona secret spy name) yields four results currently. One is Wikipedia. One is a white supremacist site. One is John Earl Haynes web site - Haynes is a far right author who makes accusations of Soviet espionage by name of hundreds of US Democrats and liberals, never mind people to the left of them. As I said - a Google search turns this up as the fringiest of fringe things, yet they want to fill up three quarters of Magdoff's article with these fringe accusations that he is a Soviet spy. I should note <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">User:Nobs01</a> is editing the Wikipedia articles for half of the liberals and Democrats in the early/mid twentieth century and accusing them of being spies. Keep this article, Nobs01's fringe conspiracy theories do not deserve to take up 1/2 to 3/4 of Harry Magdoff's article. <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> 02:12, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>The problem is that there's no agreement on what's "verifiable", other than the original source documents. Ruy refuses, for example, to even concede that the "Magdoff" mentioned in the VENONA decrypts is this Magdoff, so you can't say "he was mentioned in VENONA", you basically have to give the decrypt as released by the NSA. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 19:58, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep until discussion is settled</b> Note that instead of waiting for the outcome of this vote that TJive initiated, the material being debated was unilaterally merged back into the main article, where it now forms the largest block of text on a biography page. --<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 12:28, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Cberlet, you are the one who <i>unilaterally</i> moved all of the text from the main article to a POV fork without consensus and without even asking anyone's thoughts; I was simply correcting this move. It was <i>already</i> the largest section (by text) on the page when you got there. The reason being the section was challenged factually so we backed it up in the most concise manner possible. Also, this page is not for the purpose of debating the merits of the claims but whether this page as it is should exist. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 18:57, July 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep, but rename</b></s><b>Dithering</b>. This material is way too lengthy to put in the Magdoff article; if he was a source, it was a relatively minor episode in his overall career, and putting all this stuff in his article is poor stylistically - it needs to be in a separate article. (I would suggest something like Harry Magdoff spying controversy.) It has to be covered at length, alas, because this whole issue of whether or not Magdoff was a source for the Golos network is apparently a <i>bete noire</i> for those on the left, which has resulted in this becoming a big go-round. It seems that to simply say "he was a source" is deemed unacceptable (although all reputable historians of the period of whom I am aware now agree he was one), but the inclusion of material from offical archives, excerpts from sworn legal depositions, etc is harder to question, so that has become the default path. As such, it's necessary to extensively cite all the relevant documents (VENONA decrypts, Comintern archives, etc), and as I explained, that sort of lengthy material is not appropriate for his main article. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 19:58, 27 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now that I think about it, whether <i>this</i> page is encyclopaedic, well, I'm somewhat dubious - it's really a bit too detailed; this is really devolving into a level of detail where it's more like a journal article on the issue at this point, giving all the original sources - not really encyclopaedic. On the other hand, given lack of a consensus to say in the main article what contemporary secondary sources say flatly (that he was a "source"), I don't know what to do. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 16:28, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For the record, I totally agree that the main article should indicate that several published sources stat flatly that Magdoff was used as a source of information by the KGB, as long as there is also text that explores the dispute over what that actually means. For too long the large amount of text and illusrations were designed to imply that Magdoff was a Soviet spy. That was just unfair.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 16:47, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep until dispute settled</b> Well researched article and should not even be called 'conspiracy allegations', but 'espionage allegations'. A good title would be 'Harry Magdoff - Espionage Allegations'. I wouldn't call it a controversy until we have another side to the issue. It simply documents the allegations based on solid secondary research. In any case, the article is convoluted and off-topic as I see it with the main article and so it probably should not be <b>merged</b> with the main article unless consensus says otherwise. <a href="../../../c/y/f/User%7ECyferx_cbb6.html" title="User:Cyferx">Cyferx</a> 21:27, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Somehow I doubt this is going to be settled anytime before the next coming. Some people consider any mention of this McCarthyism of the worst sort, others think it's basically proven that he was a source (note, not a "spy" - "source" is a quite different thing). Hard to see any way for those two point of views to co-exist. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 15:56, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Magdoff has no claim whatsover to being a "victim of McCarthyism"; there should be no reference <i>whatsover</i> to Joseph McCarthy or McCarthysim on either page.
