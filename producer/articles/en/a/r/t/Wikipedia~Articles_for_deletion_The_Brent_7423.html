<li>Obviously I was being a bit facetious with my phrasing, but I think it <i>is</i> legitimate to take into account, when notability is one of the criteria that brings an article to AfD, whether there's evidence that points to an attempt to manufacture an appearance of notability.

I'm new to this so didn't know the protocol. I was only weighing in cos I had genuinely seen a lot of people doing this (to MLA - I was not claiming to have made it up on my gap year - I saw it happening on several occasions during a (3 month) holiday.

<li><b>Comment</b> Copyright in the screenshot is probably owned by the BBC (this was an in-house BBC production). I'm a UK-qualified IP lawyer and I'd say the inclusion was probably justified under UK "fair dealing" principles. I believe Wikipedia runs on the US "fair use" doctrine which is significantly more relaxed and so the inclusion is more likely to be OK. In any event, copyright infringement should only realy be a reason for deletion if the page infringes copyright as a whole, not (for example) just because a single element may be problematic. The picture can be removed easily. --TMMABPTY 15:19, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>. I have seen this done at office christmas parties and now have done it myself. As for notability not being established, perhaps the inclusion of this has to wait until it gets in the press before being published on Wiki? I note there is also a page on the Macarena. Should that be deleted as being trivial? As far as neologisms are concerned, surely a neologism is only such until it becomes an accepted or widely spread part of the common language? (Manager-Speak, Buzzwords, helicopter-view, etc.) I also thought the comments on an AfD discussion were supposed to be non-inflammatory. "Delete this nonsense" from Blngyen?

<li><b>Keep</b> Bizarre. I didn't realise it was actually this widespread.

<li><b>Keep</b> A little Anglocentric perhaps but notable in my book and clearly cannot be described as a "hoax". My little brother came back from university last Christmas quite obsessed with "Brenting", as he calls it.

<ul>
<li>Sorry you perceive it as "thinly-veiled newbie bullying" going on, but Wikipedia perceives this well-established practice of noting "votes" from very new users as its protection against "<a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppets</a>", "meatpuppets", and other attempts to make the AfD reflect the views and perhaps the ulterior motives of a small group of newcomers, rather than the experience and judgement of established Wikipedians. You may think this is "unfair", but I suggest to you that that is an illusion caused by the fact that Wikipedia offers you uncommon latitude in editing its pages. Would you expect that any other non-wiki website would give you a major voice in determining its affairs simply for showing up and making seven, eight, nine, contributions before saying "My voice must be counted!"? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:13, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
