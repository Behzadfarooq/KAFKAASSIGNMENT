<li>Rubbish. "Locksport" in this context is the name promoted by a single small organization via a single web site. There is zero evidence that "Locksport" as a name for lock picking as a sport has become accepted by the world at large outside of its promoters and coiners. In any case, anything to do with lock picking as a sport belongs in <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lock_picking.html" title="Lock picking">lock picking</a>. Indeed, there is <i>already</i> discussion in that article about lock picking championships.
<p>The only things that <i>are</i> in fact widely known as "Locksport" are an 1837 boomtown in Ohio <a href="http://www.ohiodnr.com/water/canals/M&amp;E_TourGuide.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ohiodnr.com/water/canals/M&amp;E_TourGuide.htm" rel="nofollow">source</a><a href="http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/water/canals/MEcanalbooklet.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/water/canals/MEcanalbooklet.pdf" rel="nofollow">source</a> that is now known as <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockington%2C_Ohio_76ed.html" title="Lockington, Ohio">Lockington</a>, a place in Louisiana where there is a shipyard <a href="http://www.ss.northropgrumman.com/shipbuilder/pdf/july2002.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ss.northropgrumman.com/shipbuilder/pdf/july2002.pdf" rel="nofollow">source</a>, and a place in New York <a href="http://www.csjwichita.org/Pages/History.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.csjwichita.org/Pages/History.asp" rel="nofollow">source</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:48, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Locksport is legitimate. I, and many other people, will be attending the annual Dutch Open in holland this November, as covered by wired magazine in 2004. There IS a distinction between locksport and lockpicking. Honestly? It's weird, that's true, but it's a legitimate sport, and not one endorsed by a single website. Please reference SSDEV, the german locksport group, TOOOL, the group in the netherlands, TOOOL US, (in america, of course) and LSI, (Locksport International) developed in Canada and operating throught North America. 20:55, 26 October 2006 <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuylerTowne_99c7.html" title="User:SchuylerTowne">User:SchuylerTowne</a> <small>— <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuylerTowne_99c7.html" title="User:SchuylerTowne">SchuylerTowne</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SchuylerTowne_6bf3.html" title="Special:Contributions/SchuylerTowne">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> - There is a distinction between lock picking and locksport in the same way that there is a distinction between driving and racing.

<li>Locksport is a term much older than the aforementioned Locksport International. See as reference the Yahoo Group Locksports which started in 2002. It is also noteworthy that the single largest online community of enthusiasts, Lockpicking101.com, have widely adopted the term to represent the hobby. As well, consider that locksport encompasses much more than simple lock picking. - Josh Nekrep, 12:16 PM (CST), October 27, 2006</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.The arguments for deletion are baseless. The users making these comments, although very knowledgeable of wiki, lack any knowledge of Locksport, hobby lock picking or any notion of the sport there of. The term, although still in its infancy, is becoming a wide spread one. McClain’s Magazine have done an article, DefCon has a Locksport portion to its convention, as is the Dutch Open. The ability to define the difference between the act of lock picking and the sport seems to be incomprehensible by some.UWSDWF 17:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was just reading up on all of the AfD stuff, and reading up on Wikipedia in general. I apologize for not doing this before, but I will happily make it clear that I am on the board of directors of The Open Organisation Of Lockpickers, US branch. I'm also a proud member of the locksport community as a whole. Again, I'm sorry I didn't disclose that before, but I was just reading up on the process now, and I hope this can be seen as an act of good faith on the part of a member with few other posts. (I'm concerned that making some sort of winking, smiling face may, in fact, create some bit of executed code, so just know that I said that with a grin) I'm off to find other parts of the wikiverse that I've some expertise in. Hopefully we'll see a resolution to this issue soon, and hopefully I won't see myself and my peers alienated from this very interesting community. As someone else mentioned (an older wiki user than I) we're not trying to sell anything, we just thought we'd say "hello" with an article about our own community, I think this march to deletion surprised a lot of us. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuylerTowne_99c7.html" title="User:SchuylerTowne">SchuylerTowne</a> 15:44, 4 November 2006 (UTC) (I'm trying the tilde thing, let's see if it works)</li>

<li>I believe it is also worth considering that there is currently no wiki entry which describes the recreational side of locks, lock picking, bumping, or any such topic. The Lock PIcking page represents a technical representation of the physical act of picking a lock, but offers little information that there even exists a wide base of hobbyists. I can see no reason why a legitimate hobby, with a name for that hobby coined by and adopted by those who participate, should not be allowed to be described on a wiki page. Before removing this entry, serious though should be given to how wiki should describe the hobby/sport. - Josh Nekrep 17:45, October 28 2006</li>
