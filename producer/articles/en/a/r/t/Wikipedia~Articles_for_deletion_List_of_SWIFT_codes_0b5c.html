<li><b>Comment</b> IMHO, Bank branches don't have a NEED to look them up, their SWIFT department should be doing it for them when there is a need to transfer funds (and people in that department already know the codes for their correspondent banks). it is my view that this list can never be 100% complete and accurate, and there are better sources for this information.

<li><b>Comment</b> The fact that something is useful does not mean it should be included in Wikipedia. Phone books, dictionaries, and thesauruses are all extremely useful, and all outside th realm of Wikipedia.

<li>This list is functionally equivalent to a telephone directory. The existence and use of SWIFT codes is encyclopaedic, a mirror of a subset of the list (the full list runs to 16 pages of small print) on an arbitrary and unstated date is not. Nobody is going to rely on a non-authoritative source for a code lookup, and finding a specific code is trivially easy with reference to <a href="http://www.swift.com/biconline/" class="external text" title="http://www.swift.com/biconline/" rel="nofollow">the linked source</a>.

<li>Nope, not convinced, sorry. To my mind this meets Wikipedia's inclusion criteria; don't forget that our definition of encyclopaedic here includes almanac-style material such as this. As regards the potential for this list to get out of date, most lists of information have the potential to change over time; I don't understand what marks this list out as special. Your objection re: unstated date can be dealt with by the citing of the source as per Wikipedia policy; I find the argument that the arbitrariness of the date of sourcing invalidates this information curious; most information in Wikipedia first appeared on an arbitrary date, to some extent, and if it goes out of date, we update it.

What about <a href="../../../r/o/u/Routing_transit_number.html" title="Routing transit number">ABA</a> numbers? Again, most would agree not.

<li>I think you are confusing two issues - whether the information itself is encyclopaedic, and whether presenting it in list form is the best way to include it in Wikipedia. DUNS numbers sound like pretty encyclopaedic things to me, but a page of 2.7 milion of them just wouldn't be practical. The telephone number comparison is just muddying the waters; most telephone numbers belong to non-notable private individuals, so why would we want to list them here? There is most definitely argument by assertion going on in the top part of this page. There is also some more detailed reasoning, true; however, we should be able to audit our deletions back to policy, and just giving reasons which are, or appear to be, plucked from thin air, is just as bad, IMO. <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 10:11, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is no confusion in my mind at all. The existence and usage of SWIFT numbers in unquestionably encyclopaedic, a list of them is not. The difference is the same as that between <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_Pages_f2fd.html" title="Yellow Pages">Yellow Pages</a> and the contents of the Yellow Pages. Bear in mind, too, that the December 3 <i>update</i> (changes and additions only) runs to <b>16 pages</b>, and the full list is available only by subscription (read: original research). What we have here is a small and random sample of SWIFT numbers allegedly correct as of an unstated date. Verification requires visiting each bank separately or querying the BIC database separately for each entry. We are <i>not</i> a mirror for the SWIFT BIC database, the database is linked from the article on SWIFT codes, and this list is functionally indistinguishable from a telephone directory. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 13:13, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yellow Pages is a good analogy, thanks for bringing it up. I think that not only is the existence of the Yellow Pages encyclopaedic, so is much of its content. How we include that content in Wikipedia is the issue i.e. presentation. I don't see anything in the original research policy which says that material which is best obtained through subscription doesn't count as a valid source. Almost all scientific journals operate on a subscription basis, for instance. Where would we be if we deemed articles based on material in scientific journals to be original research?! <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 16:15, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think then you may want to consider working to get <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> changed (NOT is where it says WP is not a collector of telephone numbers, which I think clearly rules out Yellow Page derived information), rather than arguing for retention of this article. I suspect that this is fairly clear cut to most. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 16:25, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're misrepresenting my comment about the content of the Yellow Pages. What I said was that much of the information in it is encyclopaedic. I don't believe you doubt that, surely? Yellow Pages is not just a list of telephone numbers; if it was, I'd agree with you. I'm happy with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and have no interest in getting it changed, and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is a proposal not yet adopted. Suggesting to people that they don't have a right to respond to a deletion proposal borders on uncivility, so please don't do it. <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 17:17, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is no confusion in my mind either. Individual bank branches are not considered encyclopedic by most (see <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>), so their phone numbers are not either. Nor are lists of their phone numbers. Small banking companies are also not typically considered encylopedic (see <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> again), so their DUNS numbers are not either, despite your assertion, even though DUNS numbers as a topic, are. I feel this proposed deletion (should it happen) is "auditable back to policy" or at least back to guidelines, CORP is just that, a guideline. You may not agree which is fine but hopefully this discussion will help other editors formulate their thinking and comments. NB, I am pretty inclusionist and I STILL think this ought not to be included. Also, were I to stipulate your assertion that SWIFT numbers were encyclopedic I would still argue that your second issue/question: "presenting it in list form is the best way to include it in Wikipedia" is answered "no". This list is large and changes rapidly, and the fragment here is out of date and not amenable to keeping up to date.++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 16:19, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are misrepresenting CORP: It is a proposal, not a policy or guideline. To clarify re: DUNS numbers, I do not have an opinion myself on whether every DUNS number is worthy of inclusion (apologies if I appeared to suggest that I did) - my position is that I trust Wikipedia editors to make sensible decisions about which ones should be included. I am sympathetic to your suggestion that the SWIFT list might be presented in a better way, BTW. <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 17:17, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>They can also be found at <a href="http://www.swift.com/biconline/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.swift.com/biconline/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. More importantly, the list there is (a) accurate and (b) complete. This is an incomplete and non-authoritative mirror of the codes, and nobody in thier right mind is going to use Wikipedia as a source. The SWIFT database is already linked from the article on SWIFT codes. I don't do <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> as a rule, but would you vote keep on a single page of the telephone directory?
